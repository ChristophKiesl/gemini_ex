Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on delivering novel, transformational medicines with optimized pharmacology and pharmacokinetics to patients globally. Our internally-developed pipeline includes multiple potentially first- or best-in-class assets with broad clinical utility.
 Our most advanced investigational clinical programs include: etrasimod (APD334), being evaluated in a Phase 3 program for ulcerative colitis, or UC, a Phase 2b/3 program for Crohn’s disease, or CD, and a Phase 2b program in atopic dermatitis, or AD. We also plan to evaluate etrasimod in a Phase 2b program for eosinophilic esophagitis, or EOE, and a Phase 2 program in alopecia areata, or AA. Olorinab (APD371) is being evaluated for a broad range of visceral pain conditions associated with gastrointestinal diseases and is currently in a Phase 2b trial for treatment of abdominal pain associated with irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS. APD418 is being evaluated in a Phase 1 trial for acute heart failure, or AHF.
 We continue to leverage our two decades of world-class G-protein-coupled receptor, or GPCR, target discovery research to develop breakthrough drugs and ultimately deliver these to patients with large unmet needs. Our long-term pipeline prospects include an enhanced collaboration with Beacon Discovery across a broad range of immune-mediated inflammatory targets and compounds (which we refer to as Project Cabrillo) and the buildout of Arena Neuroscience to focus on treating neurological conditions with microglial neuroinflammation.
 We have license agreements or collaborations with various companies, including United Therapeutics (ralinepag in a Phase 3 program for pulmonary arterial hypertension), Everest Medicines Limited (etrasimod in development in Greater China and select countries in Asia), Beacon Discovery (early research platform for GPCR targets), Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH (undisclosed orphan GPCR program for central nervous system – preclinical), and Eisai Co., Ltd. and Eisai Inc., collectively, Eisai (BELVIQ®/BELVIQ XR®).

Pipeline of Development Programs and Commercial Products
 Below is a summary of our internally developed, proprietary portfolio: 


We also own and have rights to other clinical and preclinical stage compounds that were internally discovered by us and have additional licensed or partnered programs that are not included in the above pipeline summary.
Etrasimod Program
 Etrasimod is a next-generation, oral, highly selective sphingosine 1-phosphate, or S1P, receptor modulator, discovered by Arena, designed to provide systemic and local cell modulation by selectively targeting S1P receptor subtypes 1, 4 and 5. S1P receptors have been demonstrated to be involved in the modulation of several biological responses, including lymphocyte trafficking from lymph nodes to the peripheral blood. By isolating subpopulations of lymphocytes in lymph nodes, fewer immune cells are available in the circulating blood to effect tissue damage. Etrasimod has therapeutic potential in immune-mediated inflammatory disease areas including gastroenterology and dermatology. We are currently evaluating etrasimod in ulcerative colitis, Crohn’s disease, eosinophilic esophagitis, atopic dermatitis, and alopecia areata. 
Gastrointestinal Diseases
 Inflammatory bowel diseases
 Inflammatory bowel diseases, or IBD, like UC and CD are chronic life-long immune-mediated inflammatory conditions of the gastrointestinal tract that affect approximately 1.8 million patients in the United States, or US, alone. The prevalence of UC and CD in the US are currently estimated at approximately 0.9 million and 0.8 million patients, respectively. The prevalence of IBD in United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy and Spain collectively, or EU5, is estimated at 1.3 million with approximately 0.7 million patients with UC and 0.6 million patients with CD. Both conditions represent a significant burden to patients, including hospitalization, surgery, and a longer-term risk of colon cancer, as well as impaired quality of life, economic productivity and social functioning. Additionally, Japan has an estimated prevalence of approximately 0.2 million IBD patients. In aggregate, there are approximately 3.3 million patients across the US, EU5 and Japan that are currently living with IBD.
 UC is characterized by contiguous mucosal inflammation limited to the colon which involves the rectum in approximately 95% of cases and may extend to involve parts or all of the large intestine. In contrast, CD is characterized by full thickness inflammation that can occur anywhere in the gastrointestinal, or GI, tract but most typically involves the terminal ileum and colon; and causes fistulation and scarring. Symptoms for UC and CD can vary, depending on the location and severity of inflammation, but some of the most common are diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and rectal bleeding. 
 Important goals of therapy for IBD are durable remission while improving the patient’s quality of life. Although a number of therapies are approved for the treatment of IBD, they are often associated with an inability to induce or maintain remission, serious side effects, and complicated administration regimens. There is therefore an unmet medical need for novel oral agents with an enhanced risk-benefit profile and more convenient administration for the treatment of moderately to severely active IBD.

Eosinophilic Esophagitis
Eosinophilic Esophagitis, or EOE, is a chronic, relapsing and remitting, immune mediated disease of the esophagus driven by an allergic Th2 T cell inflammatory profile. Histologically, EOE is characterized by the accumulation of eosinophils in the lining of the esophagus, a tissue that under normal conditions lacks these cells. In addition to eosinophils, CD4 and CD8 T cells, dendritic cells and mast cells increase in the tissue. The presence of these unwelcome inflammatory cells has been shown to have a direct effect on immune function and tissue damage. Both pediatric and adult populations can develop EOE, however, the disorder is most common in individuals between the ages of 20 and 40 years old. EOE also exhibits a strong hereditability pattern and predominance for males and for Caucasians, and principally in socioeconomically developed countries. There are no approved therapies in the US for the treatment of EOE. We believe that etrasimod may represent a significant opportunity to provide an effective treatment to EOE due to its potential to modulate the trafficking of multiple immune subsets.
Dermatologic Conditions
 Atopic Dermatitis
 Atopic Dermatitis, or AD, is a chronic, inflammatory skin disorder characterized by dry skin, pruritus, and relapsing lesions. AD has a severe impact on quality of life, including potential occupational, social, and psychological impairments. The adult diagnosed prevalence is approximately 8.5 million patients in the US, and 6.5 million patients in the EU5. According to a recent survey with dermatologists in the US, 62% of dermatologists reported a high unmet need in Atopic Dermatitis.
 Long-term efficacy of these therapies also remains relatively unknown. Therefore, we believe a significant unmet need remains for differentiated, safe, oral agents that are effective and have a favorable side effect profile. AD pathology is driven by a combination of impaired skin epithelial barriers, altered microbiota, and aberrant inflammation driven by activated immune cells, including skin-infiltrating T cells and dendritic cells, or DCs. Etrasimod may have the potential to reduce DC migration/activation (S1P receptor subtypes 1 and 4 mediated) and T cell infiltration (S1P receptor subtype 1 mediated) in the skin. These effects could reduce the T cell-mediated inflammation in the skin that underlies atopic dermatitis pathogenesis. 
 Alopecia Areata
 Alopecia areata, or AA, is a T-cell-mediated autoimmune skin disorder with unmet medical need that causes non-scarring patchy hair loss, most often on the scalp. The prevalence is approximately 2.9 million patients in the US and 2.2 million in the EU.
 The disease may be limited to 1 or more discrete, round or oval patches of hair loss the size of a coin on the scalp, or it may progress to full hair loss of the scalp (alopecia totalis) or the entire body (alopecia universalis). The course of disease is unpredictable, with spontaneous regrowth of hair occurring in 80% of patients within the first year, and sudden relapse at any given time. Patients with extensive disease (at least 50% total scalp hair loss) rarely have spontaneous hair regrowth. Patients with persistent moderate-to-severe AA also often suffer tremendous emotional and psychosocial distress and reduced quality of life as a result of their hair loss. Thus, psychosocial support and therapy is an important part of disease management, as this often-disfiguring disease can be psychosocially burdensome. The estimated lifetime risk of AA is 1.7% among the general population and represents the second most common form of human hair loss, second only to androgenetic alopecia. The current standard of care is injected corticosteroids which have limitations in terms of efficacy. Etrasimod may have the potential to reduce circulating CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes available to infiltrate the hair follicle which may decrease inflammation and restore hair growth.
 Etrasimod Development
 Inflammatory Bowel Disease
 We are currently in a Phase 3 program in UC and a Phase 2b/3 program in CD. 
 In 2019, we announced positive results from a 34-week open-label extension, or OLE, of the Phase 2 OASIS trial of etrasimod for the treatment of ulcerative colitis. The trial enrolled 118 patients (84% of OASIS study completers), of which 22 completers also received 2 mg in OASIS, for a total of 46 weeks of treatment with etrasimod. Overall, etrasimod demonstrated durable, long-term clinical remission and was generally well tolerated in this trial. Adverse events in the OLE study were generally mild to moderate in severity and no new safety findings were noted. Impact on heart rate and atrioventricular, or AV, conduction was minimal throughout the study with no discontinuations from study related to bradycardia or AV block.
 In 2018, we announced topline results from OASIS, a dose finding 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multinational Phase 2 clinical trial of etrasimod in moderate to severe UC. The aim of the trial was to investigate dose response and compare the active arm(s) to placebo. The trial evaluated the effects of etrasimod at 1mg and 2mg versus placebo on multiple efficacy 
 4


measures including a three-component partial Mayo Clinic Score, clinical remission, clinical response, and endoscopic improvement in 156 patients. Etrasimod demonstrated a clear dose response and statistically significant improvements versus placebo in the primary, all secondary, and clinical remission endpoints at the 2 mg dose. There were fewer patients with serious adverse events, or SAEs, compared to placebo (0% in 2 mg, 5.8% in 1 mg and 11.1% in placebo). Impact on heart rate and atrioventricular, or AV, conduction was low throughout the study with no discontinuations from study related to bradycardia or AV block. There were no increases in liver function tests compared to placebo and no reports of macular edema or pulmonary function test abnormalities. In this trial, etrasimod was well tolerated.
 

Δ=% difference from placebo estimated using Mantel-Haenszel method adjusted with current oral corticosteroid use and prior exposure to TNFα antagonists.
        2 Δ = LS mean change from baseline. The 6-point MCS is based on stool frequency and rectal bleeding. Least-squares mean and standard error were estimated using a mixed-effects model with current oral corticosteroid use, prior exposure to anti-TNFα, treatment, week, and treatment-by-week interaction as factors and baseline value as covariate. 
 Eosinophilic Esophagitis
 We are preparing for a Phase 2b program in Eosinophilic Esophagitis.
 Atopic Dermatitis
 We are currently in a Phase 2b program in atopic dermatitis. 
 Alopecia Areata
 We are preparing for a Phase 2 program in Alopecia Areata.
 Prior Development
 In January 2015, we announced top-line results from a Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose clinical trial for etrasimod. In this trial, etrasimod demonstrated a dose-dependent effect on lymphocyte count lowering in blood, with mean decreases from baseline of up to 69%. Lymphocyte counts, on average, recovered to baseline within one week of conclusion of dosing. There was a modest impact on heart rate, but none of the changes were classified by the investigator as clinically significant. There were also no findings with respect to pulmonary function or liver enzyme tests that were classified by the investigator as clinically significant. The most common treatment-emergent adverse events were mild or moderate contact dermatitis, headache, constipation and diarrhea, with none being clearly drug related. There were no discontinuations for adverse events, and no serious adverse events were observed. 
 5


The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b clinical trial evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of multiple-ascending doses of etrasimod. In five different dosing cohorts, 50 healthy volunteers received etrasimod and 10 healthy volunteers received placebo for 21 days.
 Prior to commencing the Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose clinical trial for etrasimod, we completed a Phase 1 single-ascending dose clinical trial of the compound. This randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial evaluated the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending doses of etrasimod in 40 healthy adult volunteers. In the trial, etrasimod demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects, a dose-responsive reduction in blood lymphocyte count and a slowing of heart rate that appears comparable to other S1P receptor modulators. The terminal half-life was approximately 35 hours.
 Etrasimod Intellectual Property 
 As of February 14, 2020, we owned issued patents that cover compositions of matter for etrasimod and related compounds, methods of treatment utilizing etrasimod and related compounds, and various salts of etrasimod and crystalline forms thereof in 61 jurisdictions, including the United States, China, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Spain, Canada, India, Russia, South Korea and Australia, and had an application pending in one other jurisdiction (Brazil). The earliest priority date for the patents on etrasimod is 2008. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 2029 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of the later filed patent applications.
Olorinab Program
 Olorinab, a potentially first-in-class, orally available, potent, peripherally restricted, highly selective, full agonist of the CB2 receptor, is an internally discovered investigational drug candidate we are exploring for the treatment of visceral pain, specifically pain associated with the gastrointestinal system, such as IBD and irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS.
 Visceral pain is defined as pain that originates within muscle, pleura, connective tissue, nervous system or solid organs within the abdomen or peritoneum. It is distinct from somatic or neuropathic pain, and is perceived as stretching, pulling and distention, rather than by cutting, crushing, or burning more commonly associated with neuropathic pain. Visceral pain is one of the most common types of pain. For example, abdominal pain affects approximately 20% of the general population. Visceral pain may be caused by a diverse set of organic causes, such as inflammation (e.g., IBD, including CD and UC, pancreatitis, prostatitis, and vaginitis), obstruction (e.g., bowel obstruction, and nephrolithiasis), ischemia, and malignancy, among others. Visceral pain may also be caused by functional disorders such as interstitial cystitis, dyspepsia, IBS, and vulvodynia.
  There are approximately 1.8 million patients in the US diagnosed with IBD, with most patients experiencing abdominal pain or cramps. There are approximately 27 million patients in the US with IBS, with 78% reporting frequently recurring or continuous abdominal pain. Common treatments for visceral pain range from non-invasive, conservative approaches (e.g., physical therapy or acupuncture), to pharmacologic (e.g., tricyclic antidepressants acting as neurotransmitter reuptake inhibitors), and invasive interventions (e.g., bowel resection). Potent analgesics, such as opioids, can adversely affect GI function. Other commonly prescribed analgesics are often not potent enough and may lead to other GI side effects such as bleeding. Except for linaclotide and lubiprostone, prescribed for IBS, no visceral-specific analgesics are currently available. Approximately one in eight CD patients is chronically treated with opioids. 
 The CB2 receptor is expressed in the GI nervous system, and in many tissues and organs of the abdomen. CB2 receptors are found peripherally on immune cells but also on microglia, terminal neurons, dorsal root ganglia, and on visceral sensory neurons. We believe selectively targeting the CB2 receptor may provide therapeutic benefit for visceral pain without the potential for dependence, abuse, and GI and cardiovascular side effects associated with opiates or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs, which are among the most common pain relievers. In addition to analgesic effects, olorinab may have anti-inflammatory properties. 
 Olorinab is designed to be a peripherally restricted and selective CB2 receptor agonist and is intended to provide pain relief without the unwanted side effects associated with CB1 receptor activation.
 Olorinab Development
 In 2018, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 2a trial of olorinab in development for the treatment of pain associated with CD. This exploratory study was an open‑label investigation to evaluate safety and tolerability of olorinab in this patient population and to gain initial insights into its efficacy via a pain visual analog scale, or VAS. Fourteen patients were enrolled into two cohorts at 25 mg and 100 mg administered three times daily for up to eight weeks. Reductions in pain were seen within the first week of treatment and statistically significant improvement from baseline in Average Abdominal Pain Score, or AAPS, at weeks 
 6


four and eight. In this trial, olorinab appeared generally well tolerated with no clinically significant changes in heart rate or blood pressure, no psychotropic effects, and no discontinuations due to adverse events. 
 
In April 2016, we announced favorable results from a Phase 1b multiple-ascending dose clinical trial of olorinab. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b clinical trial enrolled 36 healthy adults to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of multiple-ascending doses of olorinab. Cohorts of 12 subjects (nine active, three placebo) were administered doses of 50 mg, 100 mg, or 200 mg of olorinab or placebo three times daily for 10 days and, in connection with the pharmacokinetic evaluation, one time on the 11th day. The most common adverse events were headache and nausea. All adverse events were classified as mild, and there were no serious adverse events reported. There was one discontinuation in the high-dose group due to an adverse event of mild thirst and somnolence. Reductions in blood pressure and heart rate were observed, but none were symptomatic or resulted in an adverse event. Drug levels at all doses tested in the trial, including the lowest dose, were well above those believed to be needed to stimulate the CB2 receptor.
 In April 2015, we announced favorable top-line results from a Phase 1 single-ascending dose clinical trial of olorinab. The randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trial enrolled 56 healthy adults to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single-ascending doses of olorinab. Dose-responsive exposure was observed over the explored dose range of 10-400 mg with good tolerability at all doses administered.
 Olorinab Intellectual Property 
 As of February 14, 2020, we owned issued patents covering compositions of matter for olorinab and related compounds, and methods of treatment utilizing olorinab and related compounds, in 21 jurisdictions, including the United States, China, Japan, Canada, Russia, South Korea and Australia, and we had applications pending in 11 other jurisdictions, of which the ones with the largest pharmaceutical markets were Europe, Venezuela, Brazil and India. The earliest priority date for the patents on olorinab is 2009. The terms of these patents are capable of continuing into 2030 in most jurisdictions without taking into account any patent term adjustment or extension regimes of any country or any additional term of exclusivity we might obtain by virtue of the later filed patent applications.
APD418 Program
 APD418 is a first-in-class β3-adrenergic receptor (AdrR) antagonist and cardiac myotrope designed to regulate myofilament calcium sensitivity in order to improve contractility without inducing the serious adverse events associated with currently available inotropes. APD418 is in early-stage clinical development for patients with acute heart failure, or AHF.
 In January 2020, we announced acceptance of our investigational new drug, or IND, and were granted Fast Track designation for APD418. We have initiated a Phase 1 trial. 
 
AHF is broadly defined as a rapid onset of new or worsening signs and symptoms of HF. It is a potentially life-threatening condition, requiring hospitalization, and emergency treatment is aimed predominantly at managing fluid overload and achieving hemodynamic stability. In most cases, hospitalization for AHF results when the neurohormonal compensatory mechanism, which acts to maintain hemodynamic stability in chronic heart failure, are inadequate.
 
7


Management of AHF is focused on treating clinical conditions and precipitating factors, immediate stabilization, and symptom relief. Most patients presenting to the emergency department with AHF are congested and have normal to high blood pressures. Diuretics are first line therapy to treat volume overload including congestion; vasodilators are also used as first line therapy for symptom relief in normotensive and hypertensive patients who fail to respond adequately to diuretics. Unfortunately, neither diuretics nor vasodilators have been associated with improved survival.
 
For patients presenting as hypotensive, who are at the highest risk of mortality, and patients who fail to adequately respond to initial therapy, treatment options are particularly limited and may require the use of inotropic agents. These agents aim increase cardiac contractility and restore hemodynamic status via stimulation of the myocardial β1-AdrR, but they are associated with significant risk of unwanted hemodynamic effects, arrhythmias, and pathway dependent cardiotoxicity, leading to adverse outcomes and increased mortality.
 
 Arena is developing APD418, an internally discovered and developed this investigational drug candidate, to address the significant unmet need in AHF.
 APD418 Intellectual Property 
 As of February 14, 2020, we owned an issued patent covering compositions of matter for APD418 and related compounds, and methods of treatment utilizing APD418 and related compounds, in the United States, and we had applications pending in 42 other jurisdictions, of which the ones with the largest pharmaceutical markets were Europe, China, and Japan. The earliest priority date for the patent on APD418 is 2016. The term of this patent is capable of continuing into 2037 without taking into account any patent term extension.
Additional Internal Preclinical and Clinical Programs 
 We have initiated Project Cabrillo for the development of multiple novel, early stage, oral autoimmune programs. The multiple G-protein-coupled receptors, or GPCRs, targets in this collaboration with Beacon Discovery and their associated chemistry, represent the next generation of oral compounds which, if successfully developed and approved, may transform the way autoimmune diseases are approached and treated. Project Cabrillo includes both novel and validated targets and compounds. 
 We are progressing early-stage neuroscience assets in an underlying platform focused on microglial neuroinflammation. These programs have applications in multiple diseases and will be placed into a new subsidiary, Arena Neuroscience.
 We have additional assets, including temanogrel and other 5-HT2A modulators, which are either in or being evaluated for future clinical and preclinical development. We are also evaluating additional delivery forms of the products in our pipeline to extend clinical utility or improve the product profile.
 Collaborations and License Agreements 
 In addition to our primary focus on developing our proprietary, unencumbered clinical pipeline, we have strategic collaborations and licenses with pharmaceutical companies, including United Therapeutics, Everest Medicines Limited, or Everest, Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH, or Boehringer Ingelheim, Beacon Discovery, Inc., or Beacon, and Eisai. 
United Therapeutics License Agreement
 In November 2018, we entered into a collaboration and license agreement with United Therapeutics. Under the United Therapeutics Agreement, we granted United Therapeutics an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize ralinepag. This transaction was completed in January 2019. At the closing of the transaction, we transferred to United Therapeutics certain other assets relating to ralinepag, including, among others, related domain names and trademarks, permits, certain contracts, inventory, regulatory documentation, IND, and non-clinical, pre-clinical and clinical trial data. United Therapeutics has agreed to assume certain limited liabilities, including, among others, all post-closing obligations under assumed contracts and the IND. United Therapeutics is responsible for all development, manufacture and commercialization of the licensed products globally. 
 Upon the closing of this transaction, in January 2019, we received an upfront payment of $800.0 million. We are eligible to receive a payment of $150.0 million upon first marketing approval of ralinepag in a major non-US market, and a payment of $250.0 million upon US marketing approval of an inhaled formulation of ralinepag. In addition, we are entitled to receive low double-digit, tiered royalties on net sales of ralinepag products, subject to certain adjustments for third party license payments. 
 The United Therapeutics Agreement contains various representations and warranties of Arena and United Therapeutics, and various covenants of the parties, including covenants to cooperate in seeking regulatory approvals, as well as our agreement not to 
 8


compete, during the period in which royalties are payable (or during the five-year period following the closing if we are subject to a change of control transaction) in the development of a prostacyclin to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, or PAH. 
 Ralinepag Program
 Ralinepag is in a Phase 3 program for PAH. Ralinepag is a next-generation potent, highly selective oral IP receptor agonist intended for the treatment of PAH. Ralinepag was designed by us to deliver intravenous prostacyclin-like potency and pharmacokinetics in an oral tablet. In non-clinical experiments, ralinepag demonstrated potentially best-in-class activation of the IP receptor resulting in vasodilation, inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and inhibition of platelet aggregation. Additionally, early stage studies of ralinepag pharmacokinetics in humans revealed an approximately 24-hour half-life and a low peak-to-trough ratio supporting therapeutic blood levels with once daily dosing.
 Ralinepag was granted orphan drug status for the treatment of PAH by the US Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in September 2014, and by the European Medicines Agency in January 2019. 
 PAH is a progressive, life-threatening disorder characterized by increased pressure in the pulmonary arteries that carry blood from the heart to the lungs. PAH occurs when the pulmonary arteries thicken or grow rigid. This makes blood flow more difficult. The heart must work harder to push blood through the arteries, and the arteries are unable to carry adequate blood to the lungs. The increased pressure strains the heart, which can limit physical activity, result in heart failure and reduce life expectancy. PAH will continue to worsen over time, even with proper treatment. Based on data from the Registry to EValuate Early And Long-term PAH disease management, or REVEAL, of patients in the US, there is an estimated five-year survival rate of 57% from diagnosis.
PAH involves several interrelated mechanisms, with prostacyclin and thromboxane A2 playing a major role in maintaining pulmonary vascular tone through their balanced activity. Prostacyclin, released by endothelial cells, promotes vasodilation and inhibits platelet aggregation. Prostacyclin also has antiproliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle. Despite treatment guidelines, targeting the prostacyclin pathway has been primarily reserved for patients with advanced disease due to limitations of currently available options including parenteral prostacyclins which are the only PAH treatment that have demonstrated a mortality benefit.
 Everest Collaboration
 In December 2017, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement, or the Everest Agreement, with Everest regarding the development and commercialization of ralinepag and etrasimod in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, Macau and South Korea, or the Everest Territories. In January 2019, we and Everest amended the Everest Agreement by entering into two separate agreements, one for each of ralinepag and etrasimod, with the terms for each program that are substantially the same as in the original Everest Agreement. Under the United Therapeutics Agreement, we assigned the separate Everest Agreement related to ralinepag to United Therapeutics.
 Under the separate Everest Agreement related to etrasimod, we granted Everest an exclusive, royalty-bearing license to develop, manufacture and commercialize etrasimod (in oral formulations only), in the Everest Territories.
 Everest is responsible for all development, manufacture and commercialization of the licensed products in the Everest Territories, and may participate in the portion of our global clinical trials that is conducted in the Everest Territories. 
 We are eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments from Everest, as well as tiered royalties on net sales ranging from the high single digits to low double digits. Following an initial royalty term, we are eligible to receive a lower trademark royalty if Everest continues to use our licensed product-related trademarks.
 In the fourth quarter of 2018, the National Medical Products Administration of China, formerly known as the China Food and Drug Administration, or CFDA, accepted the initial clinical trial applications for an oral formulation of ralinepag and for etrasimod. Subsequently, in the fourth quarter of 2019, Everest announced that the first subject has been dosed in a Phase 3 trial evaluating etrasimod in development for the treatment of UC in Greater China and South Korea.
 Boehringer Ingelheim Collaboration
In 2015, we entered into an exclusive agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim, to conduct joint research to identify drug candidates targeting a GPCR that belongs to a group of orphan central nervous system, or CNS, receptors. An “orphan receptor” is structurally related to a family of proteins that are known to act as functional cell-surface receptors but whose ligand has not yet been identified. In December 2018, Boehringer Ingelheim opted to start the preclinical development of the subject compound.
 9


In the past, we contracted with Beacon to perform our research obligations under the Boehringer Ingelheim collaboration. In exchange, we agreed to share limited near-term milestones with Beacon as well as the full-time equivalent funding paid to us by Boehringer Ingelheim. We have retained the longer-term success milestones and all royalties. 
 Beacon Discovery Agreements 
 In January 2020, we entered into a new multi-year strategic Collaboration and License Agreement with Beacon, aimed at building novel medicines across a range of GPCR targets believed to play a role in immune and inflammatory diseases. Under the terms of this agreement, referred to as Project Cabrillo, Beacon is responsible for early drug discovery activities and Arena will be responsible for any potential future development and, ultimately, commercialization activities. We are required to pay to Beacon research initiation fees, make quarterly research funding payments for the duration of Beacon’s research activities as well as research, development and regulatory milestone payments. We are also obligated to pay Beacon tiered royalties on net sales of low single digits levels. 
 Prior to Project Cabrillo, beginning in September 2016, we entered into a series of agreements with Beacon. 
 In 2016, we entered into a License and Collaboration Agreement with Beacon, pursuant to which we granted Beacon a non-exclusive, non-assignable and non-sublicensable license to certain database information relating to compounds, receptors and pharmacology, and transferred certain equipment to Beacon. Beacon will seek to engage global partners to facilitate discovery and development. Beacon has agreed to assign to us any intellectual property relating to our existing research and development programs developed in the course of performing research for us, and grant us a non-exclusive license to any intellectual property developed outside the course of performing work for us that is reasonably necessary or useful for developing or commercializing the products under our research and development programs. We are also entitled to rights of negotiation and rights of first refusal to potentially obtain licenses to certain compounds discovered and developed by Beacon. In addition, we are entitled to receive (i) a percentage of any revenue received by Beacon on or after the second anniversary of the effective date of the agreement from any third party pursuant to a third-party license, including upfront payments, milestone payments and royalties; (ii) single-digit royalties on the aggregate net sales of any related products sold by Beacon and its affiliates; and (iii) in the event that Beacon is sold, a percentage of the consideration for such sale transaction.
 In 2016, we also entered a Master Services Agreement with Beacon, pursuant to which Beacon performs certain other research services for us relating to our proprietary pipeline.
 Beacon was founded and is owned by several of our former employees.
 BELVIQ and BELVIQ XR (lorcaserin) Agreement
 In December 2016, we entered into a Transaction Agreement with Eisai regarding lorcaserin. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, we granted Eisai an exclusive, royalty-bearing license, or transferred intellectual property, to develop, manufacture and commercialize lorcaserin in all countries and territories of the world. Under the Transaction Agreement we are entitled to receive tiered royalty payments starting at 9.5% on net sales of lorcaserin. 
 Eisai is solely responsible for all costs and expenses in connection with the development of lorcaserin. Eisai has the exclusive right and responsibility to plan and implement all research and development of lorcaserin at its own cost and expense, including conducting all regulatory activities and all clinical and development activities. 
 Under the Transaction Agreement, Eisai is solely responsible for development, manufacturing, and commercialization of lorcaserin including all regulatory activities. 
 Eisai is solely responsible for any expenses and losses associated with product liability claims, except we and Eisai share 50% of losses for any alleged defective manufacturing of lorcaserin that was manufactured by us prior to entering into the Transaction Agreement.  
 Lorcaserin was approved for marketing in the U.S., and in certain other territories, for the indication of weight management. On February 13, 2020, the FDA issued a drug safety communication announcing that it requested Eisai voluntarily withdraw lorcaserin from the U.S. market based on the FDA’s analysis of data from the Cardiovascular and Metabolic Effects of Lorcaserin in Overweight and Obese Patients – Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction 61 (CAMELLIA-TIMI 61) study, and that Eisai has submitted a request to voluntarily withdraw lorcaserin from the U.S. market. 
 Intellectual Property
 Our success depends in large part on our ability to protect our compounds and information, and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. We rely on a combination of patent, trade secret, copyright, and trademark laws, as well as 
 10


confidentiality, licensing and other agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. We seek patent protection for our key inventions, including drug candidates we identify, routes for chemical synthesis, pharmaceutical formulations and methods of treatment.
 There is no assurance that any of our patent applications will issue, or that any of the patents will be enforceable or will cover a drug or other commercially significant product or method. In addition, we regularly review our patent portfolio to identify patents and patent applications for potential abandonment that we deem to have relatively low value to our ongoing business operations. There is also no assurance that we will correctly identify which of our patents and patent applications should be maintained and which should be abandoned. The term of most of our current patents commenced, and most of our future patents, if any, will commence, on the date of issuance and terminate 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application. Because any marketing and regulatory approval for a drug often occurs several years after the related patent application is filed, the resulting exclusivity afforded by any patent on our drug candidates will likely be substantially less than 20 years.
 In the United States, patent term adjustment is available for certain delays in patent office proceedings. In addition, under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Act, the term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for patent term extension, or PTE. PTE permits patent term restoration of a US patent as compensation for the patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a PTE of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. This period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an Investigational New Drug, or IND (falling after issuance of the patent), and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application, provided the sponsor acted with diligence. A PTE cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. The application for PTE is subject to approval by the US Patent and Trademark Office in conjunction with the FDA.
 Outside of the United States, similar provisions may be available in the European Union, Japan, South Korea and some other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. The length of any such extension would vary by country. Our European patents may be eligible for supplemental protection certificates of up to five years in one or more countries.
 Due to the specific requirements for obtaining these extensions, there is no assurance that our patents will be afforded extensions even if we encounter significant delays in patent office proceedings or marketing and regulatory approval.
 In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secrets, proprietary know-how and continuing technological advances to develop and maintain our competitive position. To maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets and proprietary information, all of our employees are required to enter into and adhere to an employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreement, and invention disclosure procedures as a condition of employment. Additionally, our employee confidentiality and invention assignment agreements require that our employees not bring to us, or use without proper authorization, any third-party proprietary technology. We also generally require our consultants and collaborators that have access to proprietary property and information to execute confidentiality and invention rights agreements in our favor. While such arrangements are intended to enable us to better control the use and disclosure of our proprietary property and provide for our ownership of proprietary technology developed on our behalf, they may not provide us with meaningful protection for such property and technology in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and are subject to rapid and significant change. We face significant competition from many organizations with drugs or drug candidates that do or may compete drug candidates we are developing. We may not be able to compete successfully against these organizations, which include many large, well-financed and experienced pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as academic and research institutions and government agencies. Developments by others may render our drug candidates obsolete or noncompetitive, and we or our collaborators may not be successful in developing either first or best in class drugs.
 Many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater drug development capabilities and financial, scientific and marketing resources than we do. Additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry may result in even more resources being concentrated with our competitors. As a result, our competitors may be able to devote greater resources than we can to the research, development, marketing and promotion of therapeutic products or drug discovery techniques, or to adapt more readily to technological advances than we can. Accordingly, our competitors may succeed in obtaining patent protection, receiving regulatory approval or commercializing drugs before we do.
 We expect to encounter significant competition in the therapeutic areas targeted by our principal drug candidates. Companies that complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and commence commercial sales of their drug candidates before us may achieve a significant competitive advantage. Furthermore, we may be competing against companies with substantially greater 
 11


manufacturing, marketing, distribution and selling capabilities, and any drug candidate that we successfully develop may compete with existing therapies that have longer histories of safe and effective use.
 We may rely on collaborators for support of development programs and for the manufacturing and marketing of drug candidates. Such collaborators may be conducting multiple drug development efforts within the same disease areas that are the subject of their agreements with us, which may negatively impact the development of drugs that are subject to our agreements. In addition, we face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for such collaboration arrangements, and technological and other developments by others may make it more difficult for us to establish such relationships.
 Government Regulation
 We and our collaborators are subject to significant governmental regulation. The FDA and comparable regulatory agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the preclinical and clinical development, pre-market approval, manufacture, import, export, marketing and distribution of pharmaceutical products. These agencies and other regulatory agencies regulate research and development activities and the testing, approval, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, tracking, recordkeeping, advertising, pricing and promotion of drug candidates and commercialized drugs. Failure to comply with applicable FDA or other regulatory requirements may result in inspectional notices of violation, warning letters, civil or criminal penalties, suspension or delays in clinical development, recall or seizure of products, partial or total suspension of production, withdrawal of a product from the market or other negative consequences.
 In the United States
In the United States, the FDA regulates drug products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and its implementing regulations. The process required by the FDA before drug candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, many of which are required to be performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and be updated annually;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials, performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA, after completion of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials, generally accompanied by payment of a substantial user fee to the FDA;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of the NDA to file the NDA for review;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Prior to commercialization, centrally acting drugs may be subject to review and potential scheduling by the DEA.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The development and approval process requires substantial expertise, time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our drug candidates will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.
 The results of preclinical tests (which include laboratory evaluation as well as GLP studies to evaluate toxicity in animals) for a particular drug candidate, together with related manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted as part of an IND to the FDA. The initial IND becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, following its initial safety review. During the 30-day time period the FDA may require additional information. The FDA may institute a clinical hold at the 30-day time period if any questions are not fully addressed or because of other concerns about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may place an IND on partial or full clinical hold at any time during a product candidate’s development. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Further, an independent institutional review board, or IRB, for each medical center proposing to conduct the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that center and it must monitor the study until completed. The FDA, the IRB or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a 
 12


finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Clinical testing also must satisfy extensive Good Clinical Practice, or GCP, regulations and regulations for informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information.
 Clinical trials. For purposes of NDA submission and approval, clinical trials are typically conducted in the following sequential phases, which may overlap:
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials. Studies are initially conducted in a limited population to test the drug candidate for safety, dose tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion, typically in healthy volunteers, but in some cases in patients.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials. Studies are generally conducted in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, explore the initial efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to determine dose range or pharmacodynamics. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted by the sponsor to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials. These are commonly referred to as pivotal studies or adequate and well-controlled studies. When Phase 2 evaluations demonstrate that a dose range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile, Phase 3 clinical trials are undertaken in large patient populations to further evaluate dosage, provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and further test for safety in an expanded and diverse patient population at multiple, geographically dispersed clinical trial centers.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 4 clinical trials. The FDA may approve an NDA for a drug candidate but require that the sponsor conduct additional clinical trials to further assess the drug after NDA approval under a post-approval commitment. In addition, a sponsor may decide to conduct additional clinical trials after the FDA has approved an NDA. Post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 New drug applications. The results of drug development, preclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA. NDAs also must contain extensive chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, information. An NDA is usually accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing, which occurs, if at all, 60 days after submission by the NDA sponsor. Once the submission has been accepted for filing, the FDA’s goal is to review applications within 10 months from its acceptance of the filing or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication, six months from its acceptance of the filing. The review process can be significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may refer the application to an advisory committee for review, evaluation and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. The FDA may deny approval of an NDA by issuing a Complete Response Letter, or CRL, if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied. A CRL may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Data are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than we or our collaborators interpret data. Approval may occur with Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, that may limit the labeling, distribution or promotion of a drug product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if ongoing regulatory requirements are not met or if safety problems occur after the product reaches the market. In addition, the FDA may require testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance programs to monitor the safety effects of approved products which have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these postmarketing programs or other information.
 Expedited Development and Review Programs. The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drug products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new investigational drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and nonclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The FDA may consider for review sections of the NDA for a Fast Track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
 Any product submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product with a Fast Track designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious condition, and if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. The FDA endeavors to NDAs for new molecular entities with priority review designations within six months of the filing date as compared to ten months under its standard review goals.
 13


In addition, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug products intended to treat serious or life threatening diseases or conditions may be eligible for accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post marketing clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit. Products receiving accelerated approval may be subject to expedited withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-market studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 The Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act established a category of drugs and biologics referred to as “breakthrough therapies” that may be eligible to receive Breakthrough Therapy Designation. A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The Breakthrough Therapy Designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will expedite the development and review of such drug. All requests for breakthrough therapy designation will be reviewed within 60 days of receipt, and the FDA will either grant or deny the request.
 Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation and priority review do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process.
 Other US regulatory requirements. Products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including recordkeeping, annual product quality review and reporting requirements. Adverse event experience with the product must be reported to the FDA in a timely fashion and pharmacovigilance programs to proactively look for these adverse events are mandated by the FDA. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic inspections (which may be unannounced) by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with ongoing regulatory requirements, including cGMP regulations, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers. Following such inspections, the FDA may issue notices on Form FDA 483 and warning letters that could cause us to modify certain activities. A Form FDA 483 notice, if issued at the conclusion of an FDA inspection or after the appropriate FDA office review of the Establishment Inspection Report prepared by the investigator, can list conditions the FDA believes may have violated cGMP or other FDA regulations. FDA guidelines specify that a warning letter be issued for violations of “regulatory significance,” also known as Official Action Indicated, or OAI. Failure to adequately and promptly correct the observation(s) can result in regulatory action. In addition to Form FDA 483 notices and warning letters, failure to comply with the statutory and regulatory requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing, recall of product, seizure of product, injunctive action or possible civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for healthcare professional marketing activities and materials, direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of off-label information, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and promotional activities involving the Internet. Drugs may be marketed only for their approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the confines of the pivotal studies and the approved label. Further, we may be required to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials, and we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new or supplemental NDA for changes to, among other things, the indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities of a drug. Failure to comply with these requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, corrective advertising, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action or potential civil and criminal penalties.
 Physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA, if in their professional medical judgment, the physicians deem such use to be appropriate. Such off-label uses are common across certain medical specialties. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, impose stringent restrictions on manufacturers’ communications regarding off-label use.
 To distribute products commercially, we or our collaborators, as applicable, must comply with state laws that require the registration of manufacturers and wholesale distributors of pharmaceutical products in a state, including, in certain states, manufacturers and distributors who ship products into the state even if such manufacturers or distributors have no place of business 
 14


within the state. Some states also impose requirements on manufacturers and distributors to establish the pedigree of product in the chain of distribution.
 Drug Enforcement Administration regulation. The DEA regulates drugs that are controlled substances. Controlled substances are those drugs that appear on one of the five schedules promulgated and administered by the DEA under the Controlled Substances Act, or CSA. The CSA governs, among other things, the inventory, distribution, recordkeeping, handling, security and disposal of controlled substances. Any drug that acts on the central nervous system has the potential to become a controlled substance based on an evaluation of its abuse potential, and scheduling by the DEA is a separate process that may delay the commercial launch of a drug even after FDA approval of the NDA. Companies with a scheduled drug are subject to periodic and ongoing inspections by the DEA and similar state drug enforcement authorities to assess ongoing compliance with the DEA’s regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could lead to a variety of sanctions, including the revocation or a denial of renewal of any DEA registration, injunctions, or civil or criminal penalties.
 Hatch-Waxman Exclusivity. Market exclusivity provisions of the Hatch-Waxman Act can delay the submission or approval of applications seeking to rely upon the FDA’s findings of safety and effectiveness for a previously approved NDA. A new chemical entity, or NCE, subject to an NDA is entitled to a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States. A drug is an NCE if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, such an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement of patents listed with the FDA by the NDA holder. The Hatch-Waxman Act also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, or supplement to an existing NDA, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active ingredient. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
 Orphan drug designation and exclusivity. Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug product as an “orphan drug” if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition (generally meaning that it affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more in cases in which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug product available in the United States for treatment of the disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product). A company must request orphan product designation before submitting an NDA. If the request is granted, the FDA will disclose the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential use. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 If a product with orphan status receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation or for a select indication or use within the rare disease or condition for which it was designated, the product generally will receive orphan product exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity means that the FDA may not approve any other applications for the same product for the same indication for seven years, except in certain limited circumstances. Competitors may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity and may obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication or the same product for the same indication if demonstrated to be clinically superior. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to exclusivity.
 15


Pediatric exclusivity. Under Section 505(A) of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act (FDAMA), the FDA may issue Written Requests for pediatric studies prior to approval of a new drug application, if the FDA has determined that information related to the use of the drug in the pediatric population may produce health benefits. As an incentive to industry to conduct such studies requested by the FDA, Section 505(A) provides for a 6-month period as an add-on to existing marketing exclusivity periods and patent terms (“pediatric exclusivity”).
 Outside of the United States 
 Outside of the United States, the ability to market a product is contingent upon obtaining marketing authorization from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The requirements governing marketing authorization, pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing and sale of the product in those countries. Approval in the United States does not guarantee approval in other countries and vice-versa.
 Prescription drug reimbursement. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of prescription drug products depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government health administrative authorities, managed care organizations, private health insurers and other organizations. The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a drug product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the drug product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved drug products for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of our products. A payer’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with their prescription drugs. Patients are less likely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement are important to new product acceptance.
 If a drug is reimbursed by Medicare or Medicaid, pricing and rebate programs must comply with, as applicable, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 as well as the Medicaid rebate requirements of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, or VHCA, each as amended. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Under the VHCA, drug companies are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies including US Department of Veterans Affairs and US Department of Defense, the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities in order to participate in other federal funding programs including Medicare and Medicaid. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.
 The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort, which has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the ACA, was enacted in the United States in March 2010 and contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. For example, since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. Concurrently, Congress has considered legislation that would repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or TCJA, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other 
 16


things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole”. In December 2018, the United States Department of Health and Human Services’ Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, published a new final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the TCJA. On December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. It is unclear how this decision, future decisions, subsequent appeals, and other efforts to repeal and replace the ACA will impact the ACA and our business. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for our products, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
 Further, the Trump administration’s budget proposal for fiscal year 2021 includes a $135 billion allowance to support legislative proposals seeking to reduce drug prices, increase competition, lower out-of-pocket drug costs for patients, and increase patient access to lower-cost generic and biosimilar drugs. The Trump administration previously released a “Blueprint” to lower drug prices and reduce out of pocket costs of drugs that contains additional proposals to increase drug manufacturer competition, increase the negotiating power of certain federal healthcare programs, incentivize manufacturers to lower the list price of their products, and reduce the out of pocket costs of drug products paid by consumers. The Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has solicited feedback on some of these measures and has implemented others under its existing authority. While some measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
 In countries outside the United States, pricing of pharmaceutical products may be subject to governmental control. Evaluation criteria used by many government agencies for the purposes of pricing and reimbursement typically focus on a product’s degree of innovation and its ability to meet a clinical need unfulfilled by currently available therapies. Some countries operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular drug candidate to currently available therapies. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines but monitor and control company profits. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
 Healthcare fraud and abuse. Pharmaceutical companies are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including, but not limited to, anti-kickback and false claims laws.
 The Federal Anti-Kickback Statute makes it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer, or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, offer, receive or provide any remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for, or to induce, the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, service or item, including the prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Some of the state prohibitions are broader in scope and apply to referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.
 In the course of practicing medicine, physicians may legally prescribe FDA-approved drugs for an indication that has not been approved by the FDA and which, therefore, is not described in the product’s approved labeling, so-called “off-label use” or “the practice of medicine,” if deemed appropriate in the physicians’ professional medical judgment. The FDA does not ordinarily regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA and other government agencies do, however, restrict communications on the subject of off-label use by a manufacturer or those acting on behalf of a manufacturer. Companies may not promote FDA-approved drugs for off-label uses. The FDA and other governmental agencies do permit a manufacturer (and those acting on its behalf) to engage in some limited, non-misleading, non-promotional exchanges of scientific information regarding unapproved indications.
 There are numerous federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws that forbid, among other things, anyone from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services.

In addition, the federal transparency requirements under the Physician Payments Sunshine Act require applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to track and annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians, as defined by such law, and teaching hospitals, and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians or their immediate family members.
 We may also be subject to state equivalents of these fraud and abuse laws.
 Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal, civil and/or administrative sanctions, including individual imprisonment, disgorgement, criminal fines and civil monetary penalties, possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), and integrity oversight and reporting obligations to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws. In addition, under certain healthcare fraud and abuse laws, there is an ability for private individuals to bring similar actions. Additionally, many states have analogous fraud and abuse laws, some of which may be broader in scope. Further, there are an increasing number of state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to establish marketing compliance programs, file periodic reports with the state, make periodic public disclosures on sales, marketing, pricing, clinical trials and other activities, or register their sales representatives, as well as prohibiting certain other sales and marketing practices. The federal transparency requirements under the ACA require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests. Additionally, recent federal legislation imposes additional obligations on certain pharmaceutical manufacturers, among others, regarding drug product tracking and tracing.
 Our activities are also potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. We are also subject to the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits companies and individuals from engaging in specified activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. Under the FCPA, it is illegal to pay, offer to pay, or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, governmental staff members, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.
 Healthcare and other privacy and security laws. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations regarding the privacy, protection, and security of health information and other personal information. These laws and regulations impose obligations and restrictions on us with respect to the collection, storage, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal information.
 The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, imposes obligations with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. We may be subject to, or our collaborators’ marketing activities may be limited by, HIPAA and its implementing regulations. In addition, many state laws apply to the use and disclosure of health and other personal information.
 For example, as of January 1, 2020, we are subject to the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA. The CCPA has created new individual privacy rights for California residents and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling the personal information of such residents. Among other obligations, the CCPA requires covered businesses to provide new disclosures to California residents and to respond to requests to access and/or delete personal information. The CCPA also allows for a private right of action for data breaches. 
 The European General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, imposes many requirements and restrictions that impact our collection, transfer, use and retention of personal data of clinical trial subjects and other individuals in the European Union.  For example, the GDPR dictates mandatory contractual terms for service providers that process personal data for us and restricts our ability to transfer data from the European Economic Area to our offices and service providers in the United States and other countries.  Penalties for non-compliance with the GDPR are steep, with potential fines of up to 4% of our global revenue.
 Because we have operations in Switzerland, we also are required to comply with the data privacy and security laws and regulations of that country. As we conduct clinical trials and other activities that involve the collection of personal data from individuals in other countries and regions, we may be subject to additional data privacy and security laws and regulations.
 Across the United States and globally, laws and regulations governing data privacy and security continue to develop and evolve. The data privacy and security laws and regulations to which we are subject will likely impact (possibly significantly) our business activities. Many of the laws and regulations that apply to us contain ambiguous provisions or impose requirements that differ from country to country, creating uncertainty. Compliance with the enhanced obligations imposed by such laws and regulations may require us to revise our business practices, allocate more resources to privacy and security, and implement new technologies. Such efforts may result in significant costs to our business.

Failure to comply with data privacy and security laws and regulations could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability, and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.
 Manufacturing, Revenues from External Customers, and Sources and Availability of Materials

We do not currently engage in manufacturing activities and we are not dependent on availability of materials for our core business operations. 
Compliance with Environmental Regulations
 Our business involves the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals, biological materials and various radioactive compounds. In the United States, we are subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Environmental Protection Act, the US Environmental Protection Agency, the California Environmental Protection Agency, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the CSA and other federal, state or local regulations.
 We may be subject to further such regulations in the future. Although we believe that our operations comply in all material respects with the applicable environmental laws and regulations, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials cannot be eliminated. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result, and the extent of that liability could exceed our resources. Our compliance with these laws and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
