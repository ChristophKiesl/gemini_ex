The environments in which these products are used include outpatient private practice facilities and inpatient hospital environments. Our products can be used throughout the continuum of care through diagnostic procedures and monitoring of patients during admissions, surgery, in post-operative care, and in intensive care units. Our Neuro products and services include:
Neurodiagnostic
•Electroencephalography — Equipment, supplies and services used to monitor and visually display the electrical activity generated by the brain and other key physiological signals for both diagnosis and monitoring of neurological disorders in the hospital, research laboratory, clinician office and patient’s home.
•Electromyography — Equipment and supplies used to measure electrical activity in nerves, muscles, and critical pathways includes EMG, nerve conduction and evoked potential functionality.
•Polysomnography — Equipment and supplies used to measure a variety of respiratory and physiologic functions to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of sleep disorders, such as insomnia and obstructive sleep apnea.
•Intraoperative monitoring — Equipment and supplies used to monitor the functional integrity of certain neural structures (i.e. nerves, spinal cord and parts of the brain) during surgery. The goal of IOM is to provide real time guidance to the surgeon and anesthesiologist, which will reduce the risk to the patient during surgery.
Neurocritical Care
•Intracranial pressure monitoring and external ventricular drainage — Equipment and catheters used to monitor pressure in the cranium/brain and catheters to drain cerebrospinal fluid from the brain to aid in traumatic brain injury cases and hydrocephalus.
•Cranial access kits — Convenient, pre-packaged sterile sets containing all necessary components for entry into the cranium, to monitor intracranial pressure and provide temporary drainage of CSF.
Neurosurgery

Diagnostic EEG and Long-term Monitoring
We design, manufacture, and market a full line of instruments and supplies used to help diagnose the presence of seizure disorders and epilepsy, look for causes of confusion, evaluate head injuries, tumors, infections, degenerative diseases, and metabolic disturbances that affect the brain; and assist in surgical planning. This type of testing is also done to diagnose brain death in comatose patients. These systems and instruments work by detecting, amplifying, and recording the brain’s electrical impulses, as well as other physiological signals needed to support clinical findings. Routine clinical EEG recording is done by placing electrodes on a patient’s scalp over various areas of the brain to record and detect patterns of activity and specific types of electrical events. EEG technologists perform the tests, and neurologists, neurophysiologists and epileptologists review and interpret the results.
Routine outpatient clinical EEG testing is performed in hospital neurology laboratories, private physician offices, and in ambulatory settings such as the patient’s home, providing physicians with a clinical assessment of a patient’s condition. Long-term inpatient monitoring of EEG and video to monitor behavior (LTM) is used to determine complex treatment plans, and for patients with seizures that do not respond to conventional therapeutic approaches, surgical solutions may be appropriate. Patients suffering from severe head trauma and other acute conditions that may affect the brain are monitored in ICUs. In addition, research facilities use EEG equipment to conduct research on humans and laboratory animals.
Diagnostic Electroencephalograph Monitoring Product Lines
Our EEG diagnostic monitoring product lines for neurology consist of signal amplifiers, workstations to capture and store synchronized video and EEG data, and proprietary software. These products are typically used as part of an EEG “system” by the neurology/neurophysiology department of a hospital or clinic to assist in the diagnosis and monitoring of neurological conditions.
•NeuroWorks®; Nicolet®One.    Our EEG Systems include a broad range of products, from software licenses and ambulatory monitoring systems to advanced laboratory systems with multiple capabilities for EEG, ICU monitoring, 
long-term monitoring of up to 256 channels, as well as nursing stations to monitor patients and physician review stations with quantitative EEG analysis capabilities.

•Supplies.    We also manufacture and market a full line of proprietary EEG electrodes and other supplies used in the electroencephalography field.
Electrodiagnostic Monitoring
Our electrodiagnostic systems include electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction (“NCS”), and evoked potential (“EP”) functionality. EMG and NCS involve the measurement of electrical activity of muscles and nerves both at rest and during contraction. Measuring the electrical activity in muscles and nerves can help diagnose diseases of the peripheral, central nervous system or musculature system. An electromyogram is performed to determine if there is any disease present that affects muscle tissue, nerves, or the junctions between nerve and muscle (neuromuscular junctions). An electromyogram can also be used to diagnose the cause of weakness, paralysis, and muscle twitching, and is also used as a primary diagnosis for carpal tunnel syndrome, which is the most frequently encountered peripheral compressive neuropathy. EMG is also used for clinical applications of Botox to relieve muscle spasm and pain. We market both the clinical system and the needles used for these procedures.
Evoked brain potentials are elicited in response to a stimulus. These evoked potentials can come from the sensory pathways (such as hearing and visual) or from the motor pathways. An examination tests the integrity of these pathways including the associated area of the brain. Sophisticated amplifiers are required to recognize and average evoked potential EMG and NCS signals.
Electrodiagnostic Product Lines
•Dantec Keypoint®.    The Dantec Keypoint G-4 and Focus EMG and EP family of products features amplifiers, stimulators, and strong signal quality. The Keypoint G4 is used for advanced neurodiagnostic applications such as single fiber EMG, visual and auditory evoked potentials, and in routine nerve conduction studies.

Diagnostic Polysomnography Monitoring
Polysomnography (“PSG”), which involves the analysis of respiratory patterns, brain electrical activity and other physiological data, has proven critical for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep-related diseases such as apnea, insomnia, and narcolepsy. A full polysomnographic sleep study entails a whole-night recording of brain electrical activity, muscle movement, airflow, respiratory effort, oxygen levels, electrical activity of the heart, and other parameters. In some studies, patients are 
fitted with treatment devices using Positive Airway Pressure technology (“PAP”) during the sleep study and the proper settings for the treatment devices are determined. In many cases, the sleep study is performed in the patient’s home.
Diagnostic PSG Monitoring Product Lines
We market dedicated diagnostic PSG monitoring products that can be used individually or as part of a networked system for overnight sleep studies to assist in the diagnosis of sleep disorders. Additionally, we offer products that are specifically designed to be used in the patient’s home. Some of our EEG systems described above can also be configured to perform diagnostic PSG monitoring. These products include software licenses, ambulatory monitoring systems, and laboratory systems that combine multiple capabilities, including EEG monitoring, physician review stations, and quantitative PSG analysis capabilities.
•Embla REMlogic, Sandman®; and Xltek SleepWorks®.    Our diagnostic PSG systems capture and store all data digitally. The systems enable users to specify rules and personal preferences to be used during analysis, summarizing the results graphically and incorporating them in detailed reports.
•Proprietary Amplifiers.    Our data acquisition systems incorporate recent developments in superior amplifiers for sleep analysis. Our amplifiers are used in both hospitals and stand-alone clinics. In addition to exceptional signal quality, headboxes include various tools such as built-in oximeters and controls to allow the user to start and stop a study or perform electrode impedance testing either at the patient’s bedside or from the monitoring room.
•Supplies.    We also market a broad line of supplies, disposable products and accessories for the PSG laboratory including the XactTrace® respiratory monitoring belts.
Intraoperative Monitoring
Intraoperative monitoring (“IOM”) is the use of electrophysiological methods such as EEG, EMG, and evoked potentials to monitor the functional integrity of certain neural structures (i.e. nerves, spinal cord and parts of the brain) during surgery. The purpose of IOM is to reduce the risk to the patient’s nervous system, and/or to provide functional guidance to the surgeon and anesthesiologist during surgery.
Diagnostic IOM Product Lines
The Nicolet EDX combo systems are used in IOM applications where a smaller number of channels is sufficient. This approach is primarily followed in international markets that utilize the integrated system approach that allows for the use of the system in EMG clinical applications as well as in IOM applications.
Neurocritical Care Products
Intracranial pressure and temperature provide insight into the health of the brain, especially in patients experiencing a traumatic brain injury, other traumatic, ischemic or hemorrhagic incidents, or a major neurosurgical procedure. A small hole is drilled into the cranium to allow insertion of a catheter that contains a pressure/temperature or pressure only transducer that allows continuous monitoring of brain temperature and/or pressure.
•Camino® ICP Monitor. The Camino ICP Monitor is a compact, portable device that provides tools for continuously determining and monitoring intracranial pressure and intracranial temperature. It has a touch screen interface, physiological alarms, and can output data to either a patient bedside monitor or to remote media types via a USB drive. These systems are used in the intensive care unit (ICU) environment.
•Camino Catheters. Camino catheters use either fiber optic or strain gauge technology to measure either pressure and temperature or just pressure. Camino catheters measure their respective values at the tip of the catheter, which eliminates the need for a fluid-filled system that uses an external transducer to measure pressure. The Camino Flex Ventricular Intracranial Pressure Monitoring Kit has a catheter that allows both the measurement of ICP and CSF drainage.
•Natus EDS 3®. The EDS 3 is a CSF External Drainage System used to manage increased ICP by safely eliminating CSF from the ventricles of the brain or lumbar spine. This drainage can be performed continuously or intermittently. Clinical conditions that may require its use include trauma, stroke or an expansile lesion. 
•Cranial Access Kits. Cranial Access Kits are convenient procedural kits that include all the instrumentation and items needed to access the subarachnoid space or the lateral ventricles of the brain. The kit is intended to be used with an external drainage and monitoring system in selected patients to reduce intracranial pressure, to provide temporary drainage of CSF, and to monitor ICP. The kit is a convenient, pre-packaged sterile set containing all necessary components for entry into the cranium and is available with or without drugs and with a variety of drill bits and instrumentation.
Neurosurgical Products
Brain surgery is performed to place shunts in the brain to help drain excess CSF either into the body for reabsorption to help treat hydrocephalus or to place subdural electrodes for functional brain mapping. 
•Shunts. Shunts are used in the operating room to provide solutions for hydrocephalus or brain trauma. Shunts are used to manage the drainage of cerebrospinal fluid from the brain to maintain appropriate levels of CSF when treating hydrocephalus.

Newborn Hearing Screening
Hearing impairment is the most common treatable chronic disorder in newborns, affecting as many as five babies out of every 1,000 newborns. It is estimated that 20,000 hearing-impaired babies are born in the United States (“U.S.”) every year, and as many as 60,000 more in the rest of the developed world. Until the introduction of newborn hearing screening programs, screening was generally performed only on those newborns that had identifiable risk factors for hearing impairment. However, screening only those newborns with risk factors for hearing impairment overlooks approximately half of newborns with some level of hearing impairment.
Early identification of hearing impairment and early intervention has been shown to improve language development significantly. Undetected hearing impairment often results in the failure to learn, process spoken language, and speak.
Newborn Hearing Screening Techniques
The two traditional technologies used to screen newborns and infants for hearing impairment are auditory brainstem response and otoacoustic emissions.
Auditory brainstem response (“ABR”).    ABR technology is the most accurate and comprehensive method for screening and diagnosing hearing impairment. ABR technology is based on detecting the brain’s electrical impulses resulting from a specific auditory stimulus.
Otoacoustic emission (“OAE”).    OAEs are sounds created by the active biomechanical processes within the sensory cells of the cochlea. They occur both spontaneously and in response to acoustic stimuli. OAE screening uses a probe placed in the ear canal to deliver auditory stimuli and to measure the response of the sensory cells with a sensitive microphone.
Newborn Hearing Screening Product Lines
Our newborn hearing screening product lines consist of the ALGO®, ABaer®, AuDX®, and Echo-Screen® newborn hearing screeners. These hearing screening products utilize proprietary signal detection technologies to provide accurate and non-invasive hearing screening for newborns and are designed to detect hearing loss at 30 or 35 dB nHL or higher. Each of these devices is designed to generate a PASS or REFER result.
•ALGO® 5 and 3i Newborn Hearing Screeners.    These Automated Auditory Brainstem Responses (“AABR”®) devices deliver thousands of soft audible clicks to the newborn’s ears through sound cables and disposable earphones connected to the instrument. Each click elicits an identifiable brain wave, which is detected by disposable 
electrodes placed on the head of the child and analyzed by the screening device. These devices use our proprietary AABR signal detection algorithm.
•ALGO® 7i.    The ALGO® 7i continues the Natus tradition of advancing standards in patient care, combining industry-leading performance with enhanced usability and taking AABR hearing screening to the next level. The ALGO 7i incorporates proven ALGO AABR® technology. The icon-driven interface intuitively guides users through each step of the screening process.
•ABaer Newborn Hearing Screener.    The ABaer, which is a PC-based newborn hearing screening device, offers a combination of AABR, OAE, and diagnostic ABR technologies in one system.
•Echo-Screen.    Our hand-held Echo-Screen products provide a choice or combination of proprietary ABR and OAE technologies that can also be used for children through adults. The Echo-Screen III device is a compact, multi-modality handheld hearing screener that is tightly integrated with audible Lite Hearing Screening Data Management.
Hearing Screening Supply Products
For infection control, accuracy, and ease of use, the supply products used with our newborn hearing screening devices are designed as single-use, disposable products. Each screening supply product is designed for a specific hearing screening technology.
•ABR Screening Supply Kits.    Each ABR screen is carried out with single-use earphones and electrodes, which are alcohol and latex-free. The adhesives used in these supply products are specially formulated for use on the sensitive skin of newborns. To meet the needs of our customers we offer a variety of packaging options. Echo-Screen and ABaer offer the choice of either an earphone or use of ear tips for perform ABR screening.
•OAE Supply Products.    Each OAE screen is carried out with single-use ear tips that are supplied in a variety of sizes and packaging options.
Jaundice Management
The American Academy of Pediatrics estimates that each year 60% of the approximately three and a half million newborns in the U.S. become jaundiced. According to the Journal of the American Medical Association, neonatal jaundice is the single largest cause for hospital readmission of newborns in the U.S., and accounts for approximately 50% of readmissions. Because of the serious consequences of hyperbilirubinemia, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all newborns be closely monitored for jaundice and that phototherapy is the standard of care for the treatment of hyperbilirubinemia. The guidelines further recommend that all nurseries have the necessary equipment to provide intensive phototherapy, and specifically recommend the use of the “blue” light as incorporated into our neoBLUE® products.
Jaundice Management Products
•neoBLUE Product Family.    This product line consists of our neoBLUE Overhead, neoBLUE Compact and neoBLUE blanket devices, which utilize light emitting diodes (“LEDs”) to generate a high-intensity, narrow spectrum of blue light that is clinically proven to be most effective in the treatment of newborn jaundice. Our neoBLUE phototherapy devices emit significantly less ultraviolet light and heat than conventional phototherapy devices, reducing the risk of skin damage and dehydration for infants undergoing treatment. Because of the high intensity of these lights, the treatment time associated with phototherapy is reduced.
Newborn Brain Injury
For many years, newborn infants admitted to the NICU of a hospital have been routinely monitored for heart activity, temperature, respiration, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure. Recently it has also been considered important to monitor brain activity. A cerebral function monitor, utilizing amplitude-integrated EEGs (“aEEGs”), is a device for monitoring background neurological activity. Our simplified aEEG devices, introduced over ten years ago, are designed to be simple for use by nurses and neonatologists. 
Newborn Brain Injury Products
Our newborn brain injury products record and display parameters that the neonatologist uses to assess and monitor neurological status in the newborn. These devices continuously monitor and record brain activity, aiding in the detection and treatment of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (“HIE”), and seizures. The devices also monitor the effects of drugs and other therapies on brain activity and improve the accuracy of newborn neurological assessments. They are used with electrodes attached to the head of the newborn to acquire an EEG signal that is then filtered, compressed, and displayed graphically on the 
device or as a hardcopy printout. The monitors have touch screens for easy navigation and onscreen keyboards for data entry at the bedside.
•Olympic Brainz Monitor.    The Olympic Brainz Monitor is our latest generation Cerebral Function Monitor. The device can be used in single-channel, two-channel or three-channel modes to continuously monitor and record brain activity.

Segment and Geographic Information
We determine our reportable segments by first identifying our operating segments, and then by assessing whether any components of these segments constitute a business for which discrete financial information is available and where segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. Prior to 2019, our operating segments were based on three strategic business units. Since then, we transitioned from an operating structure of three strategic business units to a single, unified company with globally led operational teams in Sales and Marketing, Manufacturing, Research and Development, Quality, and General and Administrative functions.
We operate as one operating segment and one reportable segment, which provides healthcare products, and services focused on the diagnosis and treatment of central nervous and sensory system disorders for patients of all ages. Financial information is reviewed on a consolidated basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. Consolidated financial information is accompanied by disaggregated information about revenues by end market and geographic region. We do not assess the performance of our end markets or geographic regions on measures of profit or loss, or asset-based metrics. We have disclosed the revenues for each of our end markets and geographic regions to provide the reader of the financial statements transparency into our operations.
Information regarding our revenues and long-lived assets in the U.S. and in countries outside the U.S. is contained in Note 19—Segment, Customer and Geographic Information of our Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report and is incorporated in this section by this reference.

Backlog
In general, we do not manufacture our products against a backlog of orders and do not consider backlog to be a significant indicator of the level of annual future sales activity. Production and inventory levels are based on the level of incoming orders as well as projections of future demand. Therefore, we believe that backlog information is not meaningful to understanding our overall business and should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
Marketing and Sales
Marketing
Our marketing strategies differ by product market, incorporating market dynamics, trends and competition in the positioning, promotion and pricing of each product. The value proposition that we communicate is focused on the quality, clinical performance, and customer benefit. We invest in educating our customers worldwide about our products through trade conferences and direct presentations to healthcare professionals.
Domestic Direct and Distributor Sales
We sell our products in North America primarily through a direct sales organization. We believe this direct sales organization allows us to maintain a higher level of customer service and satisfaction than would otherwise be possible by other distribution methods. We also sell certain products under private label and distribution arrangements.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, domestic revenue as a percent of total revenue was approximately as follows:
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Domestic revenue | 60.4 | % | | 60.7 | % | 59.0 | %

International Direct and Distributor Sales
We sell some of our products outside the U.S. through direct sales channels in Australia, Canada, China, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Nordics (Finland, Sweden, Norway), Spain, and the United Kingdom; we sell other products in those regions and into more than 100 other countries through a distributor sales channel.
    For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, international revenue as a percent of total revenue was approximately as follows:
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
International revenue | 39.6 | % | | 39.3 | % | 41.0 | %

We sell products to our distributors under substantially the same terms as sales through our direct sales channels. Terms of sales to international distributors are generally “ex works,” where title and risk of loss are assumed by the distributor at the shipping point. Distributors are generally given exclusive rights in their territories to purchase products from Natus and to resell to end users or sub-distributors in their respective markets. Our distributors typically perform marketing, sales, and technical support functions in their respective markets. Each distributor may sell Natus products to their customer directly, via other distributors or resellers, or both. We actively train our distributors in product marketing, selling, and technical service techniques.
Seasonality in Revenue
We experience seasonality in our revenue. Demand for our products is historically higher in the second half of the year compared to the first. Our seasonality results from the purchasing habits of our hospital-based customers, whose purchases are often governed by calendar year budgets.
Group Purchasing Organizations
More than 90% of the hospitals in the U.S. are members of group purchasing organizations (“GPO”s), which negotiate volume purchase agreements for member hospitals, group practices, and other clinics.
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, revenue from direct purchases under a GPO contract as a percent of total revenue was approximately as follows:
 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2021 | | 2020 | | 2019
Direct purchases by GPO members | 23.6 | % | | 22.5 | % | 18.7 | %

Third-Party Reimbursement
In the U.S., healthcare providers generally rely on third-party payors, including private health insurance plans, federal Medicare, state Medicaid, and managed care organizations, to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedures they perform. Third-party payors can affect the pricing or the relative attractiveness of our products by regulating the maximum amount of reimbursement these payors provide for services utilizing our products. 
Customer Service and Support
We generally provide a one-year warranty on our medical device and system products. We also sell extended service agreements on our medical device and system products. Service, repair, and calibration services for our domestic customers are provided by Company-owned service centers and our field service specialists. Service for international customers is provided by a combination of Company-owned facilities and vendors on a contract basis.
Manufacturing
We procure a significant portion of the components used in our products from other manufacturers; however, we perform final assembly, testing, and packaging of many of the devices ourselves to control quality and manufacturing efficiency and we are the manufacturer of record. We also use contract manufacturers to manufacture some of our disposable supply and medical device products. We perform regular quality assessments of these contract manufacturers, which include on-site quality audits.
We purchase materials and components from qualified suppliers that are subject to our quality specifications and inspections. We conduct quality audits of our key suppliers, several of which are experienced in the supply of components to manufacturers of finished medical devices or supplies for use with medical devices. Most of our purchased components are available from more than one supplier.
Our manufacturing, service, and repair facilities are subject to periodic inspection by local and foreign regulatory authorities. Our quality assurance system is subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and other government agencies. We are required to conduct our product design, testing, manufacturing, and control activities in conformance with the FDA’s quality system regulations and to maintain our documentation of these activities in a prescribed manner. In addition, our production facilities have received International Organization for Standardization (“ISO”) 13485 certification. ISO 13485 certification standards for quality operations have been developed to ensure that medical device companies meet the standards of quality on a worldwide basis. We have also received the EC Certificate pursuant to the European Union Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC, which allows us to place a CE mark on our products.
Research and Development
We are committed to introducing new products and supporting current product offerings in our markets through a combination of internal as well as external efforts that are consistent with our corporate strategy.
Internal product development capabilities.    We believe the ability to develop innovative products is essential to providing our customers with new product offerings. We plan to leverage our core technologies by introducing product line extensions as well as new product offerings. 
Partnerships that complement our expertise. We continue to seek strategic partners in order to develop products that may not otherwise be available to us. By taking advantage of our core competencies, we believe that we can bring acquired or distributed products to market in an efficient manner and leverage our distribution channels. 
New opportunities through technology acquisition. We continue to evaluate new, emerging, and complementary technologies in order to identify new product opportunities. With our knowledge of our current markets, we believe that we can effectively develop acquired technologies into successful new products. 
Proprietary Rights
We protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by filing patent applications for new features and products we develop. We enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees, consultants, and corporate partners, and seek to control access to our intellectual property, distribution channels, documentation, and other proprietary information. However, we believe that these measures afford only limited protection.
The intellectual rights to some of the original patents for technology incorporated into our products are now in the public domain. However, we do not consider these patents, or any currently viable patent or related group of patents, to be of such importance that their expiration or termination would materially affect our business.
We capitalize the cost of purchased technology and intellectual property, as well as certain costs incurred in obtaining patent rights, and amortize these costs over the estimated economic lives of the related assets.
We have numerous registered trademarks and service marks. Our marks are pending or registered trademarks in the United States and several foreign countries. We intend to file for additional trademarks to strengthen our trademark rights, but we cannot be certain that our trademark applications will result in registration or that our trademarks will be enforceable.
Competition
We sell our products in competitive and rapidly evolving markets. We face competition from other companies in all of our product lines. Our competitors range from small privately-held companies to multinational corporations and their product offerings vary in scope and breadth. We do not believe that any single competitor is dominant in any of our product lines.
We derive a significant portion of our revenue from the sale of disposable supplies that are used with our medical devices. In the U.S., we sell our supply products in a mature market and we expect that our products could face increasing competition, including competitors offering lower prices, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue and profit margins.
We believe the principal factors that will draw clinicians and other buyers to our products, include:
•The clinical performance of our products including the level of specificity, sensitivity, and reliability of the product;
•Time required to obtain results with the product, such as to test for or treat a clinical condition;
•Relative ease of use of the product;
•Our level of expertise in these fields which produces the depth and breadth of the products features;
•Quality of customer support for the product;
•Internet connectivity and cyber-security of the product;
•Frequency of product updates;
•Extent of third-party reimbursement of the cost of the product or procedure;
•Extent to which the products conform to standard of care guidelines; and
•Price of the product.
We believe that our primary competitive strength relates to the clinical functionality and reliability of our products. 
Government Regulation
FDA’s Premarket Clearance and Approval Requirements
Unless an exemption applies, the medical devices we sell in the United States, must first receive one of the following types of FDA premarket review authorizations under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetics Act, as amended:
•Clearance via Section 510(k); or
•Premarket approval via Section 515 if the FDA has determined that the medical device in question poses a greater risk of injury.
FDA review-time goal for 510(k) applications are 90 days, but clearance may take longer. The process of obtaining premarket approval via Section 515 is much more costly, lengthy, and uncertain. FDA review-time goal for premarket approval applications are 320 days, but approval may take longer. We cannot be sure that the FDA will ever grant either 510(k) clearance or premarket approval for any product we propose to market in the United States.
The FDA decides whether a device must undergo either the 510(k) clearance or premarket approval process based upon statutory criteria. These criteria include the level of risk that the FDA perceives to be associated with the device and a determination of whether the product is a type of device that is substantially equivalent to devices that are already legally marketed. The FDA places devices deemed to pose relatively less risk in either Class I or Class II, which requires the manufacturer to submit a premarket notification requesting 510(k) clearance, unless an exemption applies. The premarket notification under Section 510(k) must demonstrate that the proposed device is substantially equivalent in intended use and in safety and effectiveness to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of premarket approval applications.
The FDA places devices deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed to be not substantially equivalent to a predicate device, in its Class III classification. The FDA requires these devices to undergo the premarket approval process via Section 515 in which the manufacturer must prove the safety and effectiveness of the device. A premarket approval application must provide extensive pre-clinical and clinical trial data.
The FDA may require results of clinical trials in support of a 510(k) submission and generally requires clinical trial results for a premarket approval application. In order to conduct a clinical trial on a significant-risk device, the FDA requires manufacturers to apply for and obtain, in advance, an investigational-device exemption. The investigational-device exemption application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results. If the FDA and the Institutional Review Boards at the clinical trial sites approve the investigational-device exemption application for a significant-risk device, the manufacturer may begin the clinical trial. An investigational-device exemption approval provides for a specified clinical protocol, including the number of patients and study sites. If the manufacturer deems the product a non-significant risk device, the product will be eligible for more abbreviated investigational-device exemption requirements. If the Institutional Review Boards at the clinical trial sites concur with the non-significant risk determination, the manufacturer may begin the clinical trial.
Most of our products have been cleared by the FDA as Class II devices.
FDA Regulation
Numerous FDA regulatory requirements apply to our products. These requirements include:
•FDA quality system regulations which require manufacturers to create, implement, and follow design, testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance procedures;
•Medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA certain types of adverse and other events involving their products; and
•FDA general prohibitions against promoting products for unapproved uses.
Class II and III devices may also be subject to special controls applied to them, such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, patient registries, and FDA guidelines that may not apply to Class I devices. We believe we are in 
compliance with applicable FDA guidelines, but we could be required to change our compliance activities or be subject to other special controls if the FDA changes existing regulations or adopts new requirements.
We are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the FDA to determine compliance with regulatory requirements. If the FDA finds that we have failed to adequately comply, the FDA can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, including:
•Issuance of a Form 483 citation;
•Fines, injunctions, and civil penalties;
•Recall or seizure of our products;
•Issuance of public notices or warnings;
•Imposition of operating restrictions, partial suspension, or total shutdown of production;
•Refusal of our requests for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new products;
•Withdrawal of 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval already granted; or
•Criminal prosecution.
The FDA also has the authority to require us to repair or replace any misbranded or adulterated medical device manufactured or distributed by us.
Other Regulations
We also must comply with numerous additional federal, state, and local laws relating to matters such as safe working conditions, manufacturing practices, environmental protection, biohazards, fire hazard control, and hazardous substance disposal. We believe we are currently in compliance with such regulations.
Countries outside of the U.S. regulate medical devices in a manner similar to that of the FDA. Our manufacturing facilities are subject to audit and have been certified to be ISO 13485:2016, Medical Device Directive 93/42/EEC, and MDSAP compliant, which allows us to sell our products in Europe, Canada, and other territories around the world. All of our manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by our notified bodies or other competent authorities, and in some cases without advance notice. We plan to seek approval to sell our products in additional countries, while maintaining our current approvals. The time and cost of obtaining new, and maintaining existing, market authorizations from countries outside of North America, and the requirements for licensing products in these countries may differ significantly from FDA requirements.
In 2017, the European Union (“EU”) adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (Council Regulations 2017/745) which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including new quality system and post-market surveillance requirements. The regulation has a three-year implementation period that has now been extended to May 2021 and will replace the existing directives on medical devices in the EU. After May 2021, medical devices marketed in the EU require certification according to these new requirements, except that devices with valid CE certificates, issued pursuant to the Medical Device Directive before May 2021, may be placed on the market until 2024. Complying with this new regulation requires us to incur significant costs on product design history file transition. Failure to meet the requirements of the regulation could adversely impact our business in the European Union and other countries that utilize or rely on European Union requirements for medical device registrations.
Human Capital 
Overview
Our Natus Pledge to our Teammates is to create a safe and secure (physical, psychological, financial, and social) environment where each Teammate feels they belong and have the resources and training to respond to the needs of our customers, the quality of life to grow as a person and professional, and time for family, health, and their community.
Workforce Demographics
As of December 31, 2021, we are a workforce of approximately 1,400 full-time Teammates, with about 50% of our Teammates located outside the United States. 
We are organized by function, which breaks down as follows: Commercial with 692 Teammates (including Sales, Service & Marketing), Manufacturing Operations with 252 Teammates, Engineering with 173 Teammates, General and Administrative with 177 Teammates and Quality and Regulatory Affairs with 104 Teammates.
Our gender distribution of our Teammates is 34% women and 66% men. Our Teammates' average length of service is 8 years.
We experienced an increase in voluntary turnover in 2021 due to the effects of the global pandemic and other related factors, including more competitive demand for talent, low unemployment in core locations, increasing compensation expectations and more retirements than in previous years.
We formalized a flexible and remote work policy in 2021 to support our Teammates safety and well-being. Managers and Teammates were given tools, training and support to make a smooth transition to a more flexible work environment. Today our workforce is 28% flexible, 42% fully remote and 30% on-site as required by their role and/or preference. We believe this transition also opens additional and more diverse talent recruitment opportunities for Natus.
Teammate Engagement
We conduct a semi-annual engagement survey to collect feedback from our Teammates. In 2021, our engagement actions were focused on increasing communications, collaboration across our diverse and global organization, recognition and employee development. 
Teammate feedback is also gathered through a variety of focus groups, onboarding and exit surveys and a diverse culture council to help support, retain and attract Teammates. We recognize that a culture of inclusion makes us stronger. Providing appropriate forums where Teammates globally can share ideas and feedback is an important component of our diversity and inclusion efforts. 
We believe building a culture of appreciation starts with a simple thank you and acknowledgments, so we started a Peer Appreciation channel which has had hundreds of our Teammates recognizing one another from across the company, across the globe, across teams and functions.
Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging
Our commitment to a diverse and inclusive environment seeks to ensure our global teammates feel a sense of belonging, helping us to produce innovative products that serve our diverse customers and their patients. We know a diverse workforce also strengthens our ability to attract and retain talent who want to grow a career where their perspective is valued and encouraged.
We have an outreach program to recruit and promote our job opportunities to a broad range of organizations and hundreds of job boards with the intent of developing a diverse pool of qualified candidates. 
We are committed to providing a work environment free of discrimination or harassment of any kind, supported by policies, training and communication. We have an open and robust support system for Teammates to address any issues, concerns or complaints. We provide management escalation paths, Human Resources support systems and a confidential ethics hotline that is monitored by the Corporate Compliance Officer and the Board of Directors. As part of our onboarding process, all Teammates must go through training on Natus Policies & Procedures and attest to our company Code of Conduct which outlines the standards for appropriate conduct and behavior.
Continuous learning and Development
We provide internal training to Teammates globally through our online learning platforms. In addition to our extensive quality and business process training, we provide comprehensive training resources to Teammates including an on-demand online learning system with over 7,000 courses to support skill building in a wide variety of areas from business, technical, leadership/management to personal productivity and wellness. Our Teammates each took an average of 20 hours of training in 2021. 
Total rewards
Our global Total Rewards Philosophy is to establish and maintain total compensation programs that include competitive cash compensation for Teammates in all geographical regions where we operate, short and long-term incentives and comprehensive global health and welfare benefits that meet the varying needs of our Teammates. We added new mental, physical, family and financial wellness resources for Teammates in 2021 to cover a wide variety of personal needs and situations.
All Teammates (except those on commission) are eligible to participate in the corporate bonus program. Payment of the bonus is dependent upon financial and operating goals that our Teammates drive throughout the year. 
In 2021, 95% of our Teammates received a merit salary increase based on performance. Our average salary increase was 3% with 6% of our population receiving a merit increase greater than 5%.
Health and safety
Protecting the safety, health, and well-being of our Teammates around the world is a key priority. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have remained focused on the health and safety of our Teammates by implementing new safety 
protocols, providing personal protective equipment, increasing cleaning procedures and requiring the wearing of masks globally. In addition, we trained Teammates and increased communications, reconfigured our facilities to add space for physical distancing, implemented remote work where possible and enhanced our IT systems to facilitate working from home and improved cybersecurity. 
We mandated the COVID-19 vaccine where permissible. We also anticipated the need for virus testing kits early on and secured a supply for our manufacturing sites and provided Teammates and their families with an onsite COVID-19 vaccination clinic at our largest manufacturing site.
Technology
Our HR Technology Roadmap was accelerated with more Teammates working remotely. In 2021, we implemented various technology enhancements like automation, standardization and increased security features to improve access, enhance the online experience and reduce risk in a globally distributed and often remote workforce.
