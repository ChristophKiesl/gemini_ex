Item 1. Business
 
Generation Hemp, formerly known as Home Treasure Finders, Inc. (“HTF”), was initially incorporated on July 28, 2008 in the State of Colorado. On November 27, 2019, HTF purchased approximately 68% of the common stock of Energy Hunter Resources, Inc. (“EHR”) through the issuance of 6,328,948 shares of the Company’s Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”). Each share of the Series A Preferred; (a) converts into 12 shares of common stock of the Company, (b) possesses full voting rights, on an as-converted basis, with the common stock of the Company, and (c) has no dividend rate. The acquisition, together with the other transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated August 15, 2019 are referred to herein as the “Transaction”. In connection with the closing of the Transaction, HTF changed its name to Generation Hemp, Inc.
 
The Transaction was accounted for as a reverse merger, whereby EHR is considered to be the accounting acquirer and became a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company. Accordingly, the Company’s historical financial statements prior to the reverse merger were replaced with the historical financial statements of EHR prior to the reverse merger and in this and all future filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
 
Upon completion of the Transaction, Gary C. Evans, previous Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Energy Hunter Resources, Inc., became Chairman of the Board of Directors and Chief Executive Officer of the Company.
 
In an exchange transaction also effective November 27, 2019, the Company acquired an additional 26% of the common stock of EHR through the issuance of common stock and warrants.
 
The Company owns approximately 94% of the issued and outstanding common stock of EHR. Thus, EHR is a majority-owned subsidiary of the Company. EHR was formerly an oil and gas exploration and production company. As of December 31, 2020, EHR held an 8% working interest in an oil & gas property located in Cochran County, Texas within the Slaughter-Levelland Field of the San Andres formation in the Northwest Shelf of West Texas. EHR’s oil & gas activities are currently held for sale and are presented in these consolidated financial statements as discontinued operations for each of the periods presented.
 
Our management team has been and continues to actively review acquisition candidates of growing hemp companies that operate within a number of vertical businesses attractive to us and within the hemp supply chain. We presently generate revenue from rental of our “Cannabis Zoned” (Hemp) warehouse property located in Denver, Colorado leased to a hemp seed company.
 
To fund our business activities, we have historically completed a number of private placements of equity and debt. We continue to seek additional private placements of our stock and debt. Our common shares are quoted on the OTC Markets under the symbol “GENH.”
 
Principal Services and their Markets
 
Generation Hemp. is positioning to be a pure-play, fully integrated hemp company through its acquisitions of existing established companies operating in the rapidly growing hemp sector with success as profitable first movers.
 
We presently own one industrial warehouse located in Denver, Colorado and lease 100% of this space within that project to aid a licensed hemp seed grower. To-date, this project has been successful in generating net revenue to the Company. We exercise appropriate and reasonable care to screen our tenants. We require and verify that our tenants maintain proper licenses and operate in compliance with all applicable rules and regulations at the federal, state, and local level.
 
We may own properties for our own investment account and as such are solely at financial risk in connection with our investments. In the event we utilize funds loaned to us by third party groups, they may in some circumstances share certain risks.
 
We do not grow, distribute or sell any form of cannabis. We have no present plan to engage in such activities or obtain a license to do so, now, or in the future. We currently plan to only operate in the hemp space. We are in the process of expanding our operations into other states, predominantly Kentucky.

Acquisition of Assets of Halcyon Thruput, LLC
 
On January 11, 2021, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of Halcyon Thruput, LLC (“Halcyon Thruput”) pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement dated March 7, 2020, as amended on January 11, 2021. The purchase consideration totaled approximately $5.1 million consisting of 6,250,000 shares of Company common stock valued at $2.5 million (valued at $0.40 per share; restricted from trading for a period of up to one year), $1.75 million in cash, a promissory note for $850 thousand issued by the Company’s subsidiary, GenH Halcyon Acquisition, LLC, and guaranteed by Gary C. Evans, CEO of the Company, and assumption of approximately $1.0 million of new indebtedness of Halcyon Thruput. The Company was granted an option to purchase the real estate occupied by Halcyon Thruput for $993,000. This option is exercisable at any time before its expiration on January 11, 2022.
 
Concurrent with the closing of the asset acquisition, the Company entered into term employment agreements with Jack Sibley and Watt Stephens to serve as Vice Presidents of GenH Halcyon Acquisition, LLC for a term of at least two years. The term employment agreements each provide for the issuance of 250,000 shares of restricted common stock of the Company as a signing bonus. Such shares are subject to restrictions on the trading or transfer of such common stock as described therein.
 
Further, the term employment agreements each provide for the payment by the executives of liquidated damages if the employee terminates his employment without good reason during the initial term, other than due to the employee’s death or disability. Such liquidated damages total $600,000 if such termination occurs on or prior to January 11, 2022 or $375,000 if such termination occurs after January 11, 2022 and prior to January 11, 2023.
 
The Company will continue Halcyon Thruput’s business of providing post-harvest and midstream services to growers by drying, processing, cleaning, stripping harvested hemp directly from the field and wetbaled at its 48,000 square foot facility located in Hopkinsville, Kentucky. The drying services technology greatly increases efficiency and capacity during harvest for farmers who need to quickly move harvested hemp while preserving the cannabinoid potency by providing scalable infrastructure essential to receive and process hemp with high moisture content (“wet”) quickly. Additionally, the Company will offer safe storage services for processed hemp, which enables farmers to maximize strategic market timing. The midstream business is fee income oriented, based upon a price per pound of material handled, and therefore is more protected from significant commodity price variations. The facility is able to process approximately 10,000 wet pounds per hour and in development are plans to scale up to 20,000 wet pounds per hour in order to meet market demands as licensed and harvested hemp acreage continues to dramatically increase across Kentucky and Tennessee. 
 
Marketing of our Services
 
The market, clients, customers and distribution methods for hemp services and hemp-based products are large and diverse. These markets range from hemp mid-stream services for hemp growers/farmers, to hemp derived products like bioplastics, textiles, building materials, food additives, and dietary supplements.  Awareness and demand continues to grow for “green,” environmentally-friendly products derived from hemp, and the consumer market has already begun to integrate hemp products and products that contain hemp derivatives to existing product lines.  The distribution system is constantly evolving as small retailers, retail chains, and big box stores become increasingly educated on and familiar/comfortable with hemp and its derivatives.  The current market is focused on one of the cannabinoids derived from hemp called cannabidiol (“CBD”) and consumer goods that contain CBD. Additionally, consumer awareness followed by increased demand continues to drive and even force companies to make room on their shelves for hemp and products with hemp derivatives.  For products with hemp derivatives like CBD, direct to consumer Ecommerce through online store sales remains the main source of revenue for consumer goods companies, accounting for reported percentages of approximately 70-80% of sales.  
 
The Company continues to implement a plan to become more diversified within the midstream market.  Our marketing efforts began with a grass roots approach in order to meet with farmers, growers, and seed operations that would benefit from midstream services.  To supplement the grass roots outreach, we built our online web presence to reflect our desire to educate, to become a contributor and part of the hemp community, and also to act as a pioneer company to connect investors in the U.S. public markets to a hemp education and platform that is dually informed.

We maintain and update our website and engage on social media platforms to market our ongoing hemp sector efforts.  We use globally distributed YouTube video ad campaigns to increase our brand awareness and encourage markets and the investment community to learn more about the hemp space. These videos have been played on several business sites such as CNBC, MSNBC, Fox News, Fox Business, Yahoo Finance, among others.  We have also begun to market a version of “Fireside Chats” from our Chairman and CEO to talk about various topics of interest in the hemp space.  These video segments will post on our social media platforms and they will also be used to create awareness campaigns that should have a global outreach.  In order to reach region specific growers/farmers in hemp, we have teed up direct mail marketing materials which prove effective for service markets within a specified radius.  These materials will serve as invitations to the farmers and growers in areas that the midstream services which we are acquiring will reach.  These are designed to add an identity to the midstream facility and provide an offer of help and partnership.  As we continue to become involved with additional verticals in the hemp supply chain, we will expand and tailor these marketing and advertising efforts to the specific needs of each segment. To date all marketing, ad creation, ad campaigns, and creative work has been done internally and with a very lean budget. 
 
Competition
 
The hemp industry and hemp-based consumer product industry is highly competitive and fragmented in its nascency with numerous companies, consisting of publicly (mostly Canadian) and privately-owned companies. There are also large, well-funded companies beginning to emerge in the U.S. with a similar intention as Generation Hemp; to consolidate and vertically integrate along the hemp supply chain through acquisitions. These companies have indicated their intention to compete in the hemp industry and hemp-based product category. However, certain holding companies such as Acreage Holdings (domiciled in British Columbia) also include cannabis companies in their portfolio, whereas Generation Hemp is hemp only. We routinely evaluate internal and external opportunities to optimize value for shareholders through market research, strategic relationships and/or partnerships, and by asset acquisitions. Based upon our management team experience, we believe we are well-positioned to capitalize in the growing hemp industry and hemp-based product industry. 
 
There are several companies developing hemp-based products and materials that will potentially displace existing products and materials sourced from less sustainable or less environmentally friendly sources. These hemp-based products are developing in the markets of textiles, building materials, biofuels, as food additives, skin care topicals and other therapeutics, and dietary supplements. Also, it is thought that cannabinoids derived from hemp can be used as therapeutics for a range of medical indications. The hemp-derived cannabinoid therapeutic market currently includes extracts of the hemp plant in several formulations, including proprietary formulations from several companies. These formulations include CBD and other cannabinoid such as,” CBG”, “CBC”, and “CBN” or a combination of several cannabinoids as the active ingredients. There are over one hundred different cannabinoids, therefore the market potential is only beginning to be realized. The therapeutics and supplement market are flooded with competition for hemp-based cannabinoid therapeutics. There are also companies that are using hemp-based cannabinoids as active ingredients in pharmaceutical formulations. Certain companies such as GW Pharmaceuticals plc have focused on plant-based CBD formulations; while other companies, such as Zynerba Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Insys Therapeutics Inc., have focused on synthetic CBD formulations.
 
Our Competitive Strengths
 
We believe that we have the following competitive strengths:
 

● | Experienced and Committed Management Team. Gary C. Evans, our CEO, and other anticipated members of our senior management team have substantial experience in all aspects of growing a public company in a highly competitive sector, including acquisitions, dispositions, construction, development, management, finance and capital markets. Mr. Evans has previously been the Chairman and CEO of three different public companies that obtained financial success on the New York Stock Exchange. Additionally, he currently serves on the Board of Directors of a vaccine company traded on the NASDAQ having a $15 billion market capitalization. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Focus on Consolidating Atomized Industry. Our focus on revenue generating and positive cash flow businesses is a key part of our growth strategy. Moreover, we believe the beginning of an entire new industry creates numerous opportunities to evaluate and consolidate very fragmented businesses. Our ultimate goal of being a more fully integrated enterprise within the midstream sector will eventually give us control of very profitable values chain and separate us from most of our competition. 
● | Demonstrated Investment and Capital Raising Acumen. We will continue to utilize rigorous underwriting standards for evaluating acquisitions and potential tenants to ensure that they meet our strategic and financial criteria. Our management team’s extensive experience and relationships established in mergers and acquisitions over the past 35 years and over 100 separate transactions should enable us to identify, negotiate and close on acquisitions cost effectively, efficiently, and with shareholder interest first in mind.

Our Growth Strategy
 
Since the first harvests following the signing of the 2018 Farm Bill, the rush to capitalize on the hemp sector led to several pioneers launching a number of businesses within each vertical – many with very little capital resources available to them. Today:

● | The strong have survived 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Hemp/CBD space is ripe for consolidation 
● | Time for expansion and more vertical integration 
● | Seasoned business professionals have now just begun to enter the space 

 
Generation Hemp has taken a boots-on-the-ground approach to its analysis of the overall industry and due diligence on specific businesses. We believe there are significant opportunities to grow a vertically integrated hemp business by executing the following elements of our strategy:
 

● | rigorous, hands-on vetting process to enable our management to meet with target companies’ teams all across the country 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | site tours 
--+----------------------------------------------------


● | verification of operations 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


● | in person discussions on operating activities 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | validation of historical financial results 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | stress testing of projections 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Intellectual Property
 
As a company within the hemp industry, one of the fastest growing new industries in the United States, our current initial effort is to protect and distinguish our company and brand identity amidst other entities currently operating within and entering the space. One of our first steps to this end is registering both our company name and company logo with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in each applicable Class.
Governmental Regulation
 
We are subject to local and federal laws in our operating jurisdictions. We will hold required licenses for product production and distribution to the extent that our business requires and will monitor changes in laws, regulations, treaties and agreements.
 
The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 known as the “2018 Farm Bill,” is United States federal legislation signed into law on December 20, 2018, which provides much of the legal framework for the hemp-based CBD product category. The 2018 Farm Bill permanently removed “hemp” from the purview of the Controlled Substances Act, and accordingly, the Drug Enforcement Administration (“DEA”) no longer has any claim to interfere with the interstate commerce of hemp products. Some of the immediate impact from this legislation includes the ability for farmers to access crop insurance and U.S. Department of Agriculture programs for certification and competitive grants. While the DEA is now officially not involved in hemp regulation, the FDA retains its authority to regulate ingestible and topical products, including those that contain hemp and hemp extracts such as CBD.
 
A range of federal regulations govern any potential product development, manufacturing, distribution, sales and marketing, including the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (the “DSHEA”). Under DSHEA, supplements are effectively regulated by the FDA for Good Manufacturing Practices under 21 CFR Part 111. DSHEA defines a “dietary supplement” as a product intended to supplement the diet that contains one or more of the following: (a) a vitamin; (b) a mineral; (c) an herb or other botanical; (d) an amino acid; (e) a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake; or (f) a concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract, or combination of any ingredient described in clause (a) through (e). Thus, the law permits a wide range of dietary ingredients in dietary supplements, including CBD which is an extract of a botanical (Cannabis sativa L. plant). CBD also falls under clause (e) as it is a dietary substance for use by man to supplement the diet by increasing the total dietary intake.

Markets and Distribution Methods
 
The market, customers and distribution methods for hemp-based products are large and diverse. These markets range from hemp-based bio plastics to textiles. This is an ever-evolving distribution system that today includes early adopter retailers and ecommerce entities, and product development companies. We believe that as awareness grows for the “green”, environmentally-friendly products derived from hemp/cannabis, the consumer market will continue to adapt its current product lines to integrate them with hemp-based additives or replace harmful components in their existing products with certain components of hemp.
Environmental Matters
 
Compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had, nor are they expected to have, any material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company.
Properties
 
Our industrial warehouse is located at 4430 Garfield Street, Denver, Colorado 80216 in an industrial neighborhood zoned for cannabis cultivation. Properties located in the 80216 zip code have recently had some of the highest appreciation rates in the Denver region due to significant infrastructure expenditures by governmental agencies. Numerous warehouses utilized for cannabis cultivation are located in this industrial district of Denver.
Employees
 
As of the date of this report we have one employee, Gary C. Evans our Chairman and CEO. We also utilize contract employees to provide certain specialized skills and expertise that may be required from time to time.
