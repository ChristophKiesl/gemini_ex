Our Company
 
SPAR Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“SGRP”), and its subsidiaries (together with SGRP, the “SPAR Group” or the “Company”), is a leading global merchandising and marketing services company, providing a broad range of services to retailers, manufacturers and distributors around the world.  With more than 40 years of experience, 20,000 merchandising specialists around the world, an average 200,000 store visits a week and long-term relationships with some of the world’s leading manufacturers and retail businesses, we provide specialized capabilities across 10 countries and 5 continents.  Our unique combination of scale, expertise and unwavering commitment to excellence, separate us from the competition. 
 
Our focus is merchandising and marketing.  Our specialists are in stores restocking shelves, auditing inventory, performing competitive price shopping, setting up exciting promotions, assembling fixtures and furniture, preparing new locations for grand openings, assisting with sales and more.  We provide the “last mile” of retailing and manufacturer product merchandising and marketing. 
 
Our services apply to a wide range of segments and categories.  We serve retailers in the grocery, drug, dollar, discount, convenience, cash and carry, home improvement, consumer electronics, automotive, pharmacy, office supply and mass merchandise segments.  We serve manufacturers and distributors in the personal technology, electronics, beverage, household product, consumables, automotive aftermarket and consumer product segments.  Our ability to recognize trends and opportunities across segments and geographies distinguishes us from local or regional competition.

Our Industry
 
The merchandising and marketing services industry plays an important role in the growth and performance of some of the world’s most successful product and retail companies. Merchandising services includes placing orders, retail shelf maintenance, merchandising display setup, reconfiguring products on store shelves and replenishing product inventory. Additional marketing services include, but are not limited to, new store sets and remodels, audits, sales assistance, installation and assembly, product demos/sampling, promotion and more. The Company believes that merchandising and marketing services add value to retailers, manufacturers and other businesses by making a product more visible and more available to consumers.
 
Historically, retailers staffed their stores to ensure the store was well merchandised and product was properly featured and placed. However, in an effort to control costs and improve margins, most retailers have reduced store payroll and increased their reliance on manufacturers to set up their own products and merchandise the shelves on behalf of the retailer. To begin, manufacturers utilized their own sales representatives to do this work.  Over time, this resulted in competing manufacturer representatives working in the same stores.  This often led to the best presentation of merchandise resulting from the last manufacturer representative physically in the store.  As a result, retailers began looking for third parties who could manage the merchandising process and ensure that the store, in total, was ready for the consumer. The result was the growth of the merchandising and marketing services industry. 
 
We believe this industry is more important today than ever before.  With the acceleration of digital and online retailing, the pressure on the physical store to remain relevant, efficient and compelling has never been higher.  In addition, product manufacturers are constantly trying to grab the consumer’s attention and make sure they are everywhere the consumer wants to shop.  These are exactly the issues merchandising and marketing services companies solve. 
 
Merchandising and marketing services companies work to ensure the store is exceptionally merchandised and products thoughtfully featured while enabling the retailer to maintain margins and leverage payroll.  As the retail industry evolves, these services will continue to be a significant part of retailer and manufacturer success.
 
SPAR Group’s role in this industry is as one of the leading providers of these services to companies across the globe.  With more than 40 years of history, the Company has established itself as a strategic partner to many of the world’s most exciting product manufacturers and retailers. 
 
Our Growth Strategy
 
As the need for merchandising and marketing services continues to increase both in the United States and internationally, many large retailers and manufacturers will continue to rely on third-party providers for these services.  We are uniquely able to meet these needs because of our global reach, more than 40-year track record, access to over 20,000 merchandisers, breadth of capability, unwavering focus on excellence and deep expertise. 
 
To capitalize on the growing demand, the Company’s current business strategy is focused on four priorities: 1) Expand the Core Business; 2) Grow Internationally; 3) Innovate with Technology; and 4) Introduce New Services.
 
Expand the Core Business
 
The Company is constantly pursuing new merchandising and marketing services business while working to earn more business from current clients.  We have a number of long-tenured client relationships that we invest resources and time to ensure we understand their business and are well-positioned to meet their needs in the future.  At the same time, we pursue and solicit request for proposals (“RFPs”), we actively market our services, we participate in industry events and we continuously look for opportunities to grow our business.  We believe our history, relationships, expertise, technology and scale are all competitive advantages for us. 
Grow Internationally 
 
As part of our overall strategy, the Company is constantly exploring new international markets where we can bring our merchandising and marketing services expertise as well as expanding our current international businesses. For new markets, we look for markets with population density, high penetration of brand products and strong retail channels. We believe our understanding of how to successfully establish these markets coupled with our global manufacturer relationships puts us in a unique position for future opportunities.
 
At the same time, we are continuously exploring ways to expand our current international businesses.  As retail channels continue to consolidate around the globe, we look for unique, compelling financial opportunities to acquire, partner or organically grow into new segments, verticals and geographies. 
 
Innovate with Technology
 
We believe our current SPARView technology is a core competitive strength.  Our technology enables us to communicate, plan, track, analyze and optimize our merchandising and marketing services work.  However, we recognize that technology and our opportunity to leverage technology continues to change.  As a result, we are constantly adapting and innovating.  We explore relationships within and across geographies with solution providers while making investments in our own solutions.  Our objective is to provide technology to field merchandisers, our client partners and our management to make smarter decisions that yield better Company results.
Introduce New Services
 
The Company believes in testing new ideas and services to increase revenues and expand relationships.  Our objective is to identify and introduce capabilities that we believe the market and our clients need now and in the future.  To accomplish this, we pursue partnerships and explore ideas based on market trends and our own unique client experiences.  We also carefully measure the results of these tests and look for new services that can have a material impact on our financial and operational performance. 
Our Domestic and International Business
 
The Company has two divisions: Domestic, International.  The Domestic division is comprised of all operations within the United States.  The International division is a consolidation of all other operations and joint ventures. 
 
The Company’s business is distributed across 10 countries and 5 continents.  The Domestic business is led and operated from our global headquarters in Auburn Hills, MI.  The International business is led from our global headquarters, but then has regional leadership and offices in the respective countries. 
 
Our approach to the international marketplace has historically been to establish joint ventures.  We believe this approach enables us to bring the breadth of our global capabilities and tools while capitalizing on the strength and importance of local executive leadership and resources.
 
We continue to be excited about our international growth opportunities and the performance of our individual businesses.
 
The following table provides details of the structure of our Domestic and International businesses:
 

Primary Territory | SPAR Percentage Ownership | Principal Office Location
-------------------------------------------+---------------------------+--------------------------
Domestic | | 
United States of America | 100% | Auburn Hills, Michigan 
National Merchandising Services, LLC (NMS) | 51% | Fayetteville, Georgia 
Resource Plus of North Florida, Inc. (RPI) | 51% | Jacksonville, Florida 
International | | 
Japan | 100% | Tokyo, Japan 
Canada | 100% | Vaughan, Ontario, Canada 
South Africa | 51% | Durban, South Africa 
India | 51% | New Delhi, India 
Australia | 51% | Melbourne, Australia 
China | 51% | Shanghai, China 
Mexico | 51% | Mexico City, Mexico 
Turkey | 51% | Istanbul, Turkey 
Brazil | 51% | Sao Paulo, Brazil 

 
The Company tracks and reports certain financial information separately for the Domestic and International divisions using the same metrics. The primary measurement utilized by management is operating profit, historically the key indicator of long-term growth and profitability, as the Company is focused primarily on reinvesting the operating profits of each of its international subsidiaries back into local markets in an effort to improve its market share and continued expansion efforts. Certain financial information regarding each of the Company's two segments, which includes their respective net revenues and operating income for each of the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, and their respective assets as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, is provided in Note 12 to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements – Segment Information, below.

The Company's Global Technology Systems (including the Co-Owned Software) are maintained and further developed and improved by the Company at its own expense at a cost of $1.0 million and $1.3 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Except for SBS and Infotech (that do not need such software licenses because of their co-ownership), each subsidiary and vendor trademark license and arrangement also licenses the Co-Owned Software to the licensee.
Our Labor Force 
 
Worldwide, the Company utilized a labor force of approximately 20,000 people in 2020, including the services of Field Specialists and Field Administrators provided by independent third parties.
 
The Company executes and administers its domestic field services through the services of field merchandising, auditing, assembly and other field personnel (each a "Field Specialist"), substantially all of whom are provided to the Company and engaged by independent third parties and located, scheduled, deployed and administered domestically through the services of local, regional, district and other personnel (each a "Field Administrator"), and substantially all of the Field Administrators are in turn employed by other independent third parties.
 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company's Domestic division's labor force totaled approximately 4,500 including the services of Field Specialists and Field Administrators furnished by independent third parties.  The Company's Domestic division employed a labor force of 833 individuals, 805 full-time employees and 28 part-time employees engaged in domestic operations. In the Company's Domestic division, the Company's merchandising, audit, assembly and other services for its domestic clients are performed by Field Specialists, and the services of a significant portion of them (approximately 3,600) were supplied to the Company by an independent vendor (the "Independent Field Vendor") under contract and license with the Company (and to the Company's knowledge substantially all of whom were engaged as independent contractors by that vendor).  The services of a significant portion of the Field Administrators who supervise the Field Specialists (approximately 57) were provided to the Company by an independent vendor (the "Independent Field Administrator") under contract and license with the Company.
 
As of December 31, 2020, the Company's International division's labor force totaled approximately 15,000 including the services of field personnel and others furnished by independent third parties. Approximately 5,000 individuals were engaged locally by its foreign subsidiaries, 4,954 full-time and 273 part-time employees.  The International Division's field force consisted of approximately 9,500 Field Specialists engaged locally by our foreign subsidiaries in their respective international operations. 
 
The Company continues to evaluate its business model of using third party independent contractors as Field Specialists (whether or not provided by others) in light of changing client requirements and legal and regulatory environments. 
 
The Company considers its relations with its own employees and independent vendors to be generally good.
 
Our Competition
 
The marketing services industry is highly competitive. The Company's competition in the Domestic and International markets arises from a number of large enterprises, many of which are national or international in scope. The Company also competes with a large number of relatively small enterprises with specific client, channel or geographic coverage, as well as with the internal marketing and merchandising operations of its existing and prospective clients. The Company believes that the principal competitive factors within its industry include breadth and quality of client services, cost, development and deployment of technology, the ability to execute specific client priorities rapidly and consistently over a wide geographic area, and the ability to ideate and operate as a business partner delivering value above the base services. The Company believes that its current structure favorably addresses these factors and establishes it as a leader in many retailer and manufacturer verticals. The Company also believes it has the ability to execute major national and international initiatives and develop and administer national and international manufacturer programs.
