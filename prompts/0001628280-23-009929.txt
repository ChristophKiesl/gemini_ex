Introduction
We are a blank check company incorporated in the Cayman Islands on January 11, 2021 formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, amalgamation, share exchange, asset acquisition, share purchase, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses. We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.

Company History
On January 15, 2021, the Sponsor paid $25,000 to cover certain offering and formation costs of the Company in consideration for 3,593,750 Class B ordinary shares (the “Founder Shares”). On January 28, 2021, the Sponsor transferred 10,000 Founder Shares to certain of the Company’s directors, resulting in the Sponsor holding 3,533,750 Founder Shares. On March 3, 2021, the Company effected a share capitalization and issued an additional 287,500 Founders Shares to the Sponsor, resulting in the Sponsor and the Company’s directors collectively holding 3,881,250 Founder Shares. Prior to the initial investment in the Company of $25,000 by the Sponsor, the Company had no assets - tangible or intangible. 
On March 8, 2021, we consummated the initial public offering (the “Initial Public Offering”) of 15,525,000 units (the “Units”), which included the full exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional Units (the “Over-Allotment Option”) in the amount of 2,025,000 Units at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of $155,250,000.
Simultaneously with the consummation of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement of an aggregate of 6,105,000 private placement warrants, each exercisable to purchase one share of the Company’s Class A ordinary shares for $11.50 per share (the “Private Placement Warrants”), to the Sponsor at a price of $1.00 per Private Placement Warrant, generating total proceeds of $6,105,000. The $155,250,000 in gross proceeds received from the Initial Public Offering and the Private Placement Warrants was placed in a trust account (the “Trust Account”). The balance of the Trust Account at December 31, 2022 was $157,023,966.
On April 23, 2021, we announced that, commencing April 26, 2021, holders of the Units could elect to separately trade the Class A ordinary shares and the warrants included in the Units. Those Units not separated continue to trade on The New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) under the symbol “ATAQ.U” and the Class A ordinary shares and warrants that were separated trade under the symbols “ATAQ” and “ATAQ WS,” respectively. No fractional warrants were issued upon separation of the Units and only whole warrants trade.
At an Extraordinary General Meeting held on March 6, 2023 (the “Extraordinary General Meeting”), the Company's shareholders approved amendments to the Company's Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association, as amended to (i) extend the date by which the Company must consummate its initial business combination from March 8, 2023 to September 8, 2023, and (ii) eliminate the limitation that the Company shall not redeem public shares to the extent that such redemption would cause the Company's net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. In connection with the Extraordinary General Meeting, shareholders holding an aggregate of 11,505,961 shares of the Company's Class A Ordinary Shares exercised their right to redeem their shares. Following such redemptions, 4,019,039 Class A Ordinary Shares remain outstanding. We refer to the amendments approved at the Extraordinary General Meeting and the related redemptions of Class A Ordinary

Corporate Information
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of: (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.235 billion or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of the prior fiscal year’s second fiscal quarter; and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.00 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30 or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
Facilities
We currently maintain our executive offices at 40 West 57th Street, 33rd Floor, New York, NY 10019. The cost for our use of this space is included in the $10,000 per month fee we pay to an affiliate of our Sponsor for office space, administrative and support services. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations.
Employees
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until the earlier of completion of the business combination or liquidation. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the earlier of the completion of the business combination or liquidation.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
We have registered our Units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, this Annual Report contains financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting.
