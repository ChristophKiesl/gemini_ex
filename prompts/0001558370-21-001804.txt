Item 1.   Business
Overview
We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of novel therapeutics to treat progressive non-viral liver diseases with high unmet medical need utilizing our proprietary bile acid chemistry. Our first marketed product, Ocaliva® (obeticholic acid or “OCA”), is a farnesoid X receptor (“FXR”) agonist approved in the United States, the European Union and several other jurisdictions for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (“PBC”) in combination with ursodeoxycholic acid (“UDCA”) in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA. In addition to commercializing OCA for PBC under the Ocaliva brand name, we are currently developing OCA for additional indications, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”). We are also developing other product candidates in various stages of clinical and preclinical development. We believe that OCA and our other product candidates have the potential to treat orphan and other more prevalent liver diseases such as NASH for which there are currently limited therapeutic options.
Ocaliva was approved for PBC by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in May 2016 under the accelerated approval pathway. We commenced sales and marketing of Ocaliva in the United States shortly after receiving approval, and Ocaliva is now available to U.S. patients primarily through a network of specialty pharmacy distributors. Ocaliva received conditional approval for PBC from the European Commission in December 2016 and we commenced our European commercial launch in January 2017. We have submitted dossiers and obtained, or are otherwise pursuing, reimbursement from a number of national authorities in Europe. Since January 2017, Ocaliva has also received regulatory approval in several of our target markets outside the United States and Europe, including Canada, Israel and Australia, and we are pursuing marketing approval of Ocaliva for PBC in our other international target markets. Ocaliva received orphan drug designation in both the United States and the European Union for the treatment of PBC.
Our lead product candidate is OCA for the potential treatment of NASH. In February 2019, we announced topline results from the planned 18-month interim analysis of our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of OCA in patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH, known as the REGENERATE trial. In the primary efficacy analysis, once-daily OCA 25 mg met the primary endpoint agreed with the FDA of fibrosis improvement by at least one stage with no worsening of NASH at the planned 18-month interim analysis. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and the most common were consistent with the known profile of OCA. Interim analysis results at 18 months were based on surrogate endpoints and the impact on clinical outcomes has not been confirmed. The REGENERATE trial is ongoing and is expected to continue through clinical outcomes for verification and description of the clinical benefit of OCA. OCA also achieved the primary endpoint in a Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of NASH that completed in late July 2014, known as the FLINT trial, which was sponsored by the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, a part of the National Institutes of Health. OCA has received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for the treatment of NASH patients with liver fibrosis. In September 2019, we submitted a New Drug Application (“NDA”) to the FDA seeking accelerated approval of OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH. In November 2019, the FDA accepted our NDA for filing and granted a priority review designation of OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH. In December 2019, we submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (“MAA”) to the European Medicines Agency (the “EMA”) seeking conditional approval of OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH. In January 2020, the EMA validated our MAA and thereby confirmed that our MAA was sufficiently complete to begin the formal review process. In June 2020, we received a complete response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA stating that our NDA for OCA for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH could not be approved in its present form. The CRL indicated that, based on the data the FDA had reviewed, the FDA has determined that the predicted benefit of OCA based on a surrogate histopathologic endpoint remains uncertain and does not sufficiently outweigh the potential risks to support accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH. At that time, the FDA recommended that we submit additional post-interim analysis efficacy and safety data from the ongoing REGENERATE trial in support of potential accelerated approval and that the long-term outcomes phase of the trial should continue. We are in discussions with the FDA with respect to the potential resubmission of our NDA seeking accelerated approval of OCA for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH. We had our end of review meeting with the FDA in October 2020 to discuss the FDA’s risk-benefit assessment in the CRL based on its review of the available data, as well as our proposed resubmission of our NDA for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH. The meeting was

constructive and the FDA has provided us with helpful guidance regarding supplemental data we can provide to further characterize OCA’s efficacy and safety profile that could support resubmission based on our Phase 3 REGENERATE 18-month biopsy data, together with a safety update from our ongoing studies. We are advancing accordingly and plan to hold additional meetings with the FDA with the goal of achieving sufficient alignment to proceed on this basis and potentially resubmit our NDA for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH by the end of 2021. In addition, we continue to work collaboratively with the EMA on its review of our MAA.
As part of our product development activities, we expect to continue to invest in evaluating the potential of OCA in progressive non-viral liver diseases. We are currently conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial in NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis, known as the REVERSE trial. In January 2020, we announced that we completed enrollment of the REVERSE trial with over 900 patients randomized. We are also studying OCA in combination with bezafibrate, a pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist, in patients with PBC and potentially may study such combination in other liver diseases. In addition, we have other compounds in early stages of research and development in our pipeline.
Liver Function, Bile Acids and Progressive Non-Viral Liver Diseases
The liver performs many functions that are vital for maintaining health, including the regulation of bile acid metabolism. Bile acids are natural detergent-like emulsifying agents that are released from the gallbladder into the intestine when food is ingested, and are essential for the absorption of dietary cholesterol and other nutrients. Cholesterol bound by bile acids is taken up by the liver, where the cholesterol is then converted into one of two primary bile acids. The bile acids are then actively secreted into bile ducts, which eventually empty into the gallbladder. This digestive cycle of bile flow from gallbladder to intestine to liver and back is called the enterohepatic recirculation of bile.
In addition to facilitating nutrient absorption, bile acids act as important signals that help regulate multiple other biological functions. They are also complex signaling molecules that integrate metabolic and immune pathways involved in the healthy functioning of various tissues and organs. For example, the actions of bile acids in the liver, intestine and kidney regulate repair mechanisms that modulate inflammation and fibrosis (scarring), which can lead to progressive organ damage.
The biological effects of bile acids are mediated through dedicated receptors. The best understood receptor is FXR, a nuclear receptor that regulates bile acid synthesis and clearance from the liver, thereby preventing excessive bile acid build-up in the liver, which may be toxic. As such, FXR is a target for the treatment of several liver diseases such as PBC that involve impaired bile flow, a condition called cholestasis. In cholestasis, the liver is typically exposed to higher than normal levels of bile acids, which can cause significant damage over time. In addition, bile acid activation of FXR is believed to induce anti-fibrotic, anti-inflammatory, anti-steatotic and other mechanisms that are necessary for the normal regeneration of the liver. As a result, FXR is also a target for the treatment of more common liver diseases such as NASH and alcoholic hepatitis. Further, based on the discovery of similar FXR-mediated protective mechanisms in other organs exposed to bile acids, we believe that FXR may also be a potential target for the treatment of a number of intestinal, kidney and other diseases.
OCA is a bile acid analog, a chemical substance that has a structure based on a naturally occurring human bile acid, that selectively binds to and activates FXR. We believe that OCA has broad liver-protective properties and may effectively counter a variety of chronic insults to the liver that cause fibrosis (scarring), which can eventually lead to cirrhosis, liver transplant and death. Due to OCA’s bile acid-like properties, it circulates enterohepatically and engages FXR in both the liver and intestine. FXR engagement in the liver is believed to be critical to successfully treat pathologic injury due to progressive underlying disease. 
By virtue of our patent portfolio and the proprietary know-how of our employees and collaboration partners, we believe that we hold a leading position in the fields of bile acid chemistry and therapeutics. Our research and development efforts have resulted in a pipeline of bile acid analogs in addition to OCA and through our on-going work with our collaboration partners such as Professor Roberto Pellicciari, Ph.D., one of our co-founders, and TES Pharma S.r.l., we are continuing our research to rationally design compounds that bind selectively and potently to FXR and other bile acid receptors.

Our Strategy
Our objective is to develop and commercialize novel therapeutics for the treatment of progressive non-viral liver diseases with high unmet medical need. The key elements of our strategy are to: 

● | Further strengthen our foundational PBC business. We intend to further strengthen our foundational PBC business through expanding access to Ocaliva to eligible patients by increasing Ocaliva’s penetration in the markets where it has been approved and pursuing regulatory approval for Ocaliva in our target markets where it has not yet been approved. In addition, we continue to work to execute on our post-marketing regulatory commitments with respect to Ocaliva in the U.S. and Europe.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Execute on our clinical and regulatory goals and timelines. We remain focused on progressing our development program in liver fibrosis due to NASH in the United States and Europe and are working to potentially resubmit our NDA to the FDA by the end of 2021. We also expect to continue REGENERATE through clinical outcomes and to progress our Phase 3 REVERSE trial for NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis. We also plan to advance our Phase 2 study evaluating bezafibrate in combination with OCA for PBC as part of a broader early development program.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand our portfolio and pipeline. We intend to identify additional opportunities to develop OCA and our other product candidates, alone or in combination, in rare liver diseases. In addition, we intend to initiate a first-in-human clinical trial of our INT-787 compound, which is an FXR agonist that we are currently evaluating in preclinical studies
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand and protect our intellectual property. We intend to continue to expand and aggressively prosecute our intellectual property in the area of bile acid chemistry and therapeutics with the objective of maintaining a valuable intellectual property portfolio and to vigorously defend and enforce our intellectual property rights protecting Ocaliva.

History and Development of the Company
In September 2002, we were incorporated in Delaware and shortly thereafter began operations in New York. In October 2012, following several rounds of private funding, we completed our initial public offering (the “IPO”) and received net proceeds of approximately $78.7 million therefrom. We used the proceeds from our IPO to fund, among other things, preclinical and clinical development activities, including our Phase 3 POISE trial studying OCA for PBC and work performed in anticipation of our submission of regulatory filings for the approval of OCA for PBC. In addition, between June 2013 and April 2015, we completed four registered public offerings of our common stock and received aggregate net proceeds of approximately $803.4 million therefrom. 
In March 2014, we announced the results of our Phase 3 POISE trial of OCA for PBC. In November 2014, results from the FLINT Phase 2b clinical trial of OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH were published in The Lancet. Both of these trials met their primary endpoints.
In June 2015, we submitted a NDA to the FDA seeking accelerated approval of OCA for PBC and a MAA to the EMA seeking conditional approval of OCA for PBC. In September 2015, we announced the initiation of our Phase 3 REGENERATE trial of OCA in patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH.
In May 2016, Ocaliva was approved for PBC by the FDA. We commenced sales and marketing of Ocaliva in the United States shortly after receiving approval. In July 2016, we issued and sold $460.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Convertible Notes”) in a registered public offering and received net proceeds of approximately $447.6 million therefrom. In December 2016, Ocaliva received conditional approval for PBC from the European Commission. 
In January 2017, we commenced our European launch of Ocaliva for PBC. Since January 2017, Ocaliva has also received regulatory approval in several of our target markets outside the United States and Europe, including Canada, 

3



Israel and Australia, and we are pursuing marketing approval of Ocaliva for PBC in our other international target markets. In July 2017, we announced positive results from our Phase 2 CONTROL trial, the goal of which was to characterize the lipid metabolic effects of OCA and cholesterol management effects of concomitant statin administration in NASH patients, as well as positive top-line results from our Phase 2 AESOP trial of OCA for primary sclerosing cholangitis (“PSC”). 
In February 2018, we announced our Phase 3 REVERSE trial of OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis. In April 2018, we issued and sold an aggregate of approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock in a registered public offering and a concurrent private placement (the “2018 Concurrent Private Placement”) exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and received net proceeds of approximately $261.4 million therefrom. In December 2018, we entered into an agreement (the “Aralez Agreement”) with Aralez Pharmaceuticals Canada Inc. (“Aralez”), pursuant to which we acquired (i) Aralez’s license to develop and commercialize bezafibrate in the United States, (ii) Aralez’s investigational new drug application (“IND”) on file with the FDA and other associated regulatory documentation and (iii) a non-exclusive license to certain of Aralez’s intellectual property. We are evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of bezafibrate in combination with OCA in patients with PBC in a Phase 2 study, with the longer-term goal of developing and seeking regulatory approval for a fixed dose combination regimen in this indication and potentially other liver diseases. 
In February 2019, we announced topline results from our pivotal Phase 3 REGENERATE trial in patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH. In the primary efficacy analysis, once-daily OCA 25 mg met the primary endpoint agreed with the FDA of fibrosis improvement by at least one stage with no worsening of NASH at the planned 18-month analysis. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and the most common were consistent with the known profile of OCA. 
In May 2019, we issued and sold $230.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Convertible Notes” and together with the 2023 Convertible Notes, the “Convertible Notes”) in a registered public offering and received net proceeds of approximately $223.4 million therefrom. In May 2019, we issued and sold 2,760,000 shares of common stock in a registered public offering (“the 2019 Public Offering”) and 119,760 shares of common stock in a concurrent private placement of common stock (the “2019 Concurrent Private Placement”) and received net proceeds of approximately $227.3 million. 
In September 2019, we submitted a NDA to the FDA seeking accelerated approval of OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH. In November 2019, the FDA accepted our NDA for filing and granted a priority review designation for OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH. Under PDUFA, the FDA has set a target action date of June 26, 2020 for the completion of its review of our NDA, after giving effect to a 90-day extension of its initial target action date. The FDA has also notified us that it has tentatively scheduled an advisory committee meeting relating to our NDA for April 22, 2020.
In December 2019, we submitted a MAA to the EMA seeking conditional approval of OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH. In January 2020, the EMA validated our MAA and thereby confirmed that our MAA was sufficiently complete to begin the formal review process.
In June 2020, we received a complete response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA stating that our NDA for OCA for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH could not be approved in its present form. The CRL indicated that, based on the data the FDA had reviewed, the FDA has determined that the predicted benefit of OCA based on a surrogate histopathologic endpoint remains uncertain and does not sufficiently outweigh the potential risks to support accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH. At that time, the FDA recommended that we submit additional post-interim analysis efficacy and safety data from the ongoing REGENERATE trial in support of potential accelerated approval and that the long-term outcomes phase of the trial should continue.
In October 2020, we had our end of review meeting with the FDA to discuss the FDA’s risk-benefit assessment in the CRL based on its review of the available data, as well as our proposed resubmission of our NDA for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH. The meeting was constructive and the FDA has provided us with helpful guidance regarding supplemental data we can provide to further characterize OCA’s efficacy and safety profile that could support resubmission based on our Phase 3 REGENERATE 18-month biopsy data, together with a safety update from our ongoing studies.

Our First Approved Product 
Ocaliva
Ocaliva was approved for PBC by the FDA in May 2016 under the accelerated approval pathway. We commenced sales and marketing of Ocaliva in the United States shortly after receiving approval, and Ocaliva is now available to U.S. patients primarily through a network of specialty pharmacy distributors. Ocaliva received conditional approval for PBC from the European Commission in December 2016 and we commenced our European commercial launch in January 2017. We have submitted dossiers and obtained, or are otherwise pursuing, reimbursement from a number of national authorities in Europe. Since January 2017, Ocaliva has also received regulatory approval in several of our target markets outside the United States and Europe, including Canada, Israel and Australia, and we are pursuing marketing approval of Ocaliva for PBC in our other international target markets. Ocaliva received orphan drug designation in both the United States and the European Union for the treatment of PBC.
Overview of PBC
PBC is a rare liver disease that primarily results from autoimmune destruction of the bile ducts that transport bile acids out of the liver, resulting in cholestasis. The build-up of bile acids in the liver damages liver cells. These damaged liver cells, in turn, release abnormal amounts of serum alkaline phosphatase (“ALP”), a liver enzyme that is a key biomarker of the disease pathology. As shown in numerous clinical trials of treatment with UDCA (available generically as ursodiol), a positive therapeutic response is primarily determined by sustained reduction of ALP levels, along with maintenance of normal bilirubin levels, indicating adequately compensated liver function. This biochemical improvement has been shown to correlate well with improved clinical outcomes such as transplant-free survival. As the disease progresses, it causes progressive liver damage marked by chronic inflammation and fibrosis. Despite its rarity, PBC is the most common cholestatic liver disease and is among the leading indications for liver transplant among women in the United States. Disease progression in PBC varies significantly, with median survival in untreated patients estimated to be 7.5 years if symptomatic at diagnosis and up to 16 years if asymptomatic at diagnosis. PBC patients whose disease is progressing have persistently elevated levels of ALP and other liver enzymes, with abnormal bilirubin levels heralding more advanced disease. Data from published long-term studies demonstrate that a significant portion of such patients with advancing disease progress to liver failure, transplant or death within five to ten years.
Based on our analysis of 2016 industry data, there were approximately 290,000 people with PBC at the time of our U.S. launch in the United States, certain European countries, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. An estimated 90% of PBC patients are women, with approximately one in 1,000 women over the age of 40 afflicted by the disease. The mean age of diagnosis is about 40 years old and the typical initial presentation occurs between the ages of 30 and 65 years old. A majority of PBC patients are asymptomatic at the time of initial diagnosis, but most develop symptoms over time. Fatigue and pruritus are the most common symptoms in PBC patients. Less common symptoms include dry eyes and mouth, as well as jaundice, which can be seen in more advanced disease. Based on the guidelines of the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease and the European Association for the Study of the Liver, the clinical diagnosis of PBC is established based on the presence of (i) a positive antimitochondrial antibody (“AMA”), a marker of this autoimmune disease seen in up to 95% of PBC patients and (ii) elevated serum levels of ALP. In the earlier stages of PBC, ALP is often the only abnormally elevated liver enzyme, rising to between two to ten times higher than normal values. Bilirubin is a marker of liver function and is also monitored in PBC to provide an indication of how well the liver is 

5



functioning. Liver biopsy can be used to confirm the diagnosis of PBC, but is not required and is becoming less-frequently performed.
A number of published clinical studies have demonstrated that lower levels of ALP, both independently or in conjunction with normal bilirubin levels, correlate with a significant reduction in adverse clinical outcomes such as liver transplant and/or death in PBC patients. These studies include the result of meta-analyses of PBC clinical outcomes data of more than 6,000 PBC patients from 15 academic centers in eight countries that have been compiled by the Global PBC Study Group, which we sponsored, as well as a dataset of over 6,000 PBC patients across the United Kingdom compiled by the UK PBC Group.
Prior to Ocaliva, the only approved drug indicated for the treatment of PBC was UDCA, which is widely considered the standard first-line therapy for PBC patients. In patients for whom UDCA is effective, the treatment slows the progression of PBC, reducing the likelihood of liver failure and the need for transplant.
Phase 3 POISE Trial
Ocaliva’s accelerated approval in the United States and conditional approval in the European Union was supported by the results of our Phase 3 POISE trial, which was completed in March 2014. The data from the POISE trial showed that Ocaliva, at both a once-daily 10 mg dose and a once-daily 5 mg dose titrated to 10 mg, met the trial’s primary endpoint of achieving a reduction in ALP to below a threshold of 1.67 times the upper limit of normal (“ULN”), with a minimum of a 15% reduction in ALP level from baseline, and a normal bilirubin level after 12 months of therapy. The percentage of patients meeting the POISE trial’s primary endpoint was 10% in the placebo group, 47% in the 10 mg Ocaliva group and 46% in the Ocaliva titration group (both dose groups p < 0.0001 as compared to placebo) in an intent-to-treat analysis. The placebo group experienced a mean decrease in ALP from baseline of 5%, compared to a mean decrease of 39% in the 10 mg Ocaliva dose group and 33% in the Ocaliva titration group (both dose groups p < 0.0001 as compared to placebo). Pruritus, generally mild to moderate, was the most frequently reported adverse event associated with Ocaliva treatment and was observed in 38% of patients on placebo, 70% of patients in the 10 mg Ocaliva group and 56% of patients in the Ocaliva titration group. Eight patients discontinued due to pruritus, of whom none were in the placebo group, seven (10%) were in the 10 mg Ocaliva group and one (1%) was in the Ocaliva titration group. Decreases in high density lipoprotein (“HDL”) cholesterol were also observed during treatment. 
Following the completion of the double-blind portion of the POISE trial described above, patients were given the option to enroll in a five-year open-label long-term safety and efficacy extension trial, which has been completed. Patients received Ocaliva at a once-daily 5 mg dose for three months, after which patients were titrated based on tolerability. The data from the open-label extension portion of the trial showed that 46% of patients responded after 12 months of treatment with Ocaliva and 50% to 56% of patients responded after 48 to 72 months of treatment with Ocaliva (based on the same criteria used to define the primary endpoint in the 12 month placebo controlled trial). Reductions in ALP were sustained through the double-blind and extension portions of the trial and total bilirubin levels remained stable and within the normal range for most patients for the duration of the trial (ALP p < 0.0001 for all post-baseline visits; total bilirubin: p-values were not consistently significant throughout the extension portion of the POISE trial). Adverse events were consistent with the safety profile of Ocaliva in patients with PBC. The most commonly reported adverse events were pruritis and fatigue, which were generally mild to moderate in severity.
Ongoing Confirmatory Clinical Outcomes Trial and Other Post Marketing Requirements
In connection with Ocaliva’s accelerated approval in the United States and conditional approval in the European Union, we committed to conduct a Phase 4 confirmatory outcomes trial of Ocaliva, known as the COBALT trial, and other clinical trials to satisfy post-marketing regulatory requirements. Continued approval of Ocaliva for PBC in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions is contingent upon the verification and description of clinical benefit in the COBALT trial and our satisfaction of our other post-marketing regulatory requirements. Any delay or failure by us to satisfy such requirements, including any delay or failure relating to our Phase 4 COBALT trial, may jeopardize the continued approval of Ocaliva for PBC in the United States, European Union and other jurisdictions.

6



The goal of the COBALT trial is to confirm that reduction of ALP based upon Ocaliva treatment is associated with a longer-term benefit on liver-related clinical outcomes. COBALT is designed to assess the effect of a once-daily dose of 5 mg or 10 mg of Ocaliva in approximately 430 PBC patients with an inadequate therapeutic response to UDCA or who are unable to tolerate UDCA. In this trial, eligible patients with PBC continue their UDCA treatment, except for those patients unable to tolerate UDCA, have been randomized into one of two treatment arms of approximately 215 patients each. Patients have been randomized to receive either (i) placebo or (ii) Ocaliva starting at 5 mg and increasing over the course of the trial to 10 mg of Ocaliva based on tolerability. Dosing frequency has been determined by disease stage. The primary endpoint of the trial is based on clinical outcomes as measured by time to first occurrence of any of the following adjudicated events: death (all-cause), liver transplant, Model of End Stage Liver Disease (“MELD”) score greater than 15, uncontrolled ascites or hospitalization due to variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy or spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. The study evaluates subjects across the spectrum of PBC disease, including early and advanced PBC.
Further, as part of our post-marketing requirements for Ocaliva, we are undertaking a Phase 4 clinical trial of Ocaliva in patients with PBC who have moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B and C) (known as the 401 trial). This double-blind, placebo-controlled study is designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of Ocaliva and its conjugates, as well as safety and tolerability. Additional objectives include an evaluation of Ocaliva treatment compared to placebo on liver biochemistry, Child-Pugh scores and non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis and stiffness. The trial as designed is targeted to enroll approximately 50 patients in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions for 48 weeks.
While we remain blinded to safety and efficacy data in the ongoing COBALT trial and 401 trial, a data monitoring committee (“DMC”) reviewed the unblinded results of a pre-specified interim efficacy analysis of the COBALT trial and separately reviewed unblinded safety and pharmacokinetic data from both the COBALT and 401 trials. Following these reviews, the DMC stated that it was not feasible to continue the COBALT trial as designed and noted the challenges in enrolling and maintaining placebo-controlled post-marketing studies in this rare disease setting. No acute safety concerns were noted by the DMC. Given the feasibility concerns noted by the DMC as well as the potential confounding impact of subjects discontinuing treatment and/or transitioning from investigational product to commercial drug during clinical trials, we continue to discuss with the FDA and the EMA proposed modifications to the COBALT trial as well as proposals with respect to the 401 trial. We have notified the FDA and the EMA of the DMC’s recommendation and, as they previously advised, are in ongoing discussions with the FDA on the matter and are seeking formal EU scientific advice with respect to potential alternative study designs. In addition, future changes to our Ocaliva label related to the most advanced PBC patients will influence the modifications to our study design. Both the COBALT and 401 trials are ongoing but not currently enrolling patients.
We are also undertaking a Phase 2 clinical trial of Ocaliva in pediatric patients with biliary atresia, a life-threatening condition in infants in which the bile ducts inside or outside the liver do not have normal openings. This trial, known as the CARE trial, is a part of an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”) supporting the conditional approval of Ocaliva for PBC in the European Union as PBC is not believed to occur in the pediatric population. The CARE trial is designed to evaluate the effects of 11 weeks of Ocaliva treatment where patients with biliary atresia are randomized to varying doses. The primary endpoint is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and the safety and tolerability of Ocaliva treatment. In addition, Ocaliva’s effect on hepatobiliary indices and biomarkers will be assessed. This trial is targeted to enroll approximately 60 patients in the United States and Europe. 
Ocaliva Label Update
In the course of our post-marketing pharmacovigilance activities, deaths have been reported in PBC patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment. In an analysis performed by us and in consultation with the FDA, we concluded that certain of these patients were prescribed once daily doses of Ocaliva, which is seven times higher than the recommended weekly dose in such patients. As a result, in September 2017, we issued a Dear Health Care Provider (“DHCP”) letter, and the FDA also subsequently issued its own drug safety communication to reinforce recommended label dosing. Both communications remind healthcare providers of the importance of the recommended reduced dosing of Ocaliva in PBC patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, while reiterating the importance of monitoring PBC patients for progression of their disease and the occurrence of liver-related adverse reactions. In addition to the DHCP letter, we took actions to enhance education about appropriate use of Ocaliva. These initiatives included: reeducating physicians on the label, with a focus on ensuring appropriate dosing for patients with moderate or severe hepatic 

7



impairment; enhancing monitoring of patients for liver-related adverse reactions; and adjudicating reported cases of serious liver injury, including in patients with no or mild hepatic impairment. 
In February 2018, we announced that the Ocaliva label in the United States had been updated by the FDA to include a boxed warning and a dosing table that reinforced the then-existing dosing schedule for patients with Child-Pugh Class B or C or decompensated cirrhosis. In addition, the FDA issued an updated drug safety communication to accompany the revised label. We remain focused on the safety of all of the patients using Ocaliva within and outside of our ongoing clinical studies and have engaged with relevant regulatory authorities to ensure that the Ocaliva label sufficiently reinforces the importance of appropriate dosing in patients with advanced cirrhosis.
The FDA has notified us that, in the course of its routine safety surveillance, in May 2020 the FDA began to evaluate a newly identified safety signal, or NISS, regarding liver disorder for Ocaliva which the FDA classified as a potential risk. The FDA has informed us that its review of the NISS is focused on a subset of the cirrhotic, or more advanced, PBC patients who have taken Ocaliva. As part of our routine pharmacovigilance efforts, we worked with the FDA to reconcile our internal safety database with the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System database and we completed a comprehensive assessment of all available data, including data from our completed clinical trials, blinded reviews of ongoing clinical trial data, unblinded reviews of certain ongoing clinical trial data by the DMC, post-marketing data and natural history data, which we submitted to the FDA and had a meeting earlier in 2021 to discuss. We are working with the FDA to align on changes to the Ocaliva label regarding patients with the most advanced stages of PBC. Based on our communications with the FDA, this update will come in the form of a safety labeling change. These communications are ongoing.
Our Product Candidates
The following summarizes the current status and the anticipated next steps in our development plans for our product candidates. We continually evaluate each product candidate in an effort to efficiently allocate research and development funds to projects we deem to be in our best interests based on, among other factors, the product candidate’s performance in pre-clinical and/or clinical studies, our expectations regarding the potential future regulatory approval of the product candidate and our view of the potential commercial viability of the product candidate in light of market conditions.
OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH
Our lead product candidate is OCA for the potential treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH. In February 2019, we announced topline results from the planned 18-month interim analysis of our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of OCA in patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH, known as the REGENERATE trial. In the primary efficacy analysis, once-daily OCA 25 mg met the primary endpoint agreed with the FDA of fibrosis improvement by at least one stage with no worsening of NASH at the planned 18-month interim analysis. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and the most common were consistent with the known profile of OCA. OCA has received breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for the treatment of NASH patients with liver fibrosis. In September 2019, we submitted a NDA seeking accelerated approval of OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH in the United States and, in December 2019, we submitted a MAA seeking conditional approval of OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH in Europe. The FDA subsequently accepted our NDA for filing and granted a priority review designation for OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH. In January 2020, the EMA validated our MAA and thereby confirmed that our MAA was sufficiently complete to begin the formal review process. In June 2020, we received a complete response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA stating that our NDA for OCA for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH could not be approved in its present form. The CRL indicated that, based on the data the FDA had reviewed, the FDA has determined that the predicted benefit of OCA based on a surrogate histopathologic endpoint remains uncertain and does not sufficiently outweigh the potential risks to support accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH. At that time, the FDA recommended that we submit additional post-interim analysis efficacy and safety data from the ongoing REGENERATE trial in support of potential accelerated approval and that the long-term outcomes phase of the trial should continue. In October 2020, we had our end of review meeting with the FDA to discuss the FDA’s risk-benefit assessment in the CRL based on its review of the available data, as well as our proposed resubmission of our NDA for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH. The meeting was constructive and the FDA has provided us with helpful guidance regarding supplemental data we can provide to further characterize OCA’s efficacy and safety profile that could support resubmission based on our Phase 3 REGENERATE 18-month biopsy data, together with a safety update from our ongoing studies. We are advancing 

8



accordingly and plan to hold additional meetings with the FDA with the goal of achieving sufficient alignment to proceed on this basis and potentially resubmit our NDA for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH by the end of 2021. We also continue to work collaboratively with the EMA on its review of our MAA. In addition, we have conducted a number of other trials and studies in connection with our NASH development program, and our Phase 3 trial in NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis, known as the REVERSE trial, is ongoing.
Overview of NASH
NASH is a serious progressive liver disease caused by excessive fat accumulation in the liver (steatosis) that induces chronic inflammation, resulting in progressive fibrosis (scarring) that can lead to cirrhosis, eventual liver failure, cancer and death. More than 20% of patients with NASH are estimated to progress to cirrhosis within a decade of diagnosis and, compared to the general population, have a ten-fold greater risk of liver-related mortality. The proportion of liver transplants attributable to NASH has increased rapidly in recent years with NASH currently the second leading cause of liver transplantation in the United States and, in females, the leading cause. NASH is anticipated to become the leading indication for liver transplantation in Europe within the next decade. Additionally, NASH is now considered to be the leading, and a rapidly increasing, cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (primary liver cancer), of which up to 40% of cases in NASH patients develop prior to developing cirrhosis.
Although difficult to precisely estimate, epidemiology research estimates that the global prevalence of NASH is approximately 3 – 5% and is expected to increase markedly by 2030. Fibrosis is the most robust predictor of long-term overall mortality, liver transplantation and liver-related events in patients with NASH and advanced fibrosis is associated with a substantially higher risk of liver-related morbidity and mortality in patients with NASH. We believe that a majority of NASH patients diagnosed and under specialist care have fibrosis of stage 2 or greater. Although the prevalence of NASH is lower in children, it has also become a serious disease burden in the pediatric population. Other common co-existing conditions such as obesity and type 2 diabetes, which are present in a majority of NASH patients, raise important risks. NASH has been linked in both developed and developing countries to the adoption of a Western diet, with increased consumption of processed foods containing polyunsaturated fatty acids and fructose.
Generally in clinical trials in NASH, a definitive diagnosis requires a histologic assessment of a liver biopsy for several key features associated with NASH, including, but not limited to, steatosis, lobular inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning. However, we believe that the majority of NASH patients currently under treater care have been assessed for liver fibrosis without a liver biopsy. Several imaging and circulating biomarkers are being investigated as non-invasive diagnostic methods, including transient elastography (an ultrasound technology approved in the United States and Europe for the measurement of liver fibrosis), magnetic resonance imaging and serum biomarkers. NASH diagnosis rates in the United States and the EU5 countries are very low, owing to a lack of approved treatment options and a lack of validated non-invasive diagnosis options. We believe the availability of novel therapeutics and non-invasive technologies will be instrumental in improving diagnosis rates.
There are currently no medications approved for the treatment of NASH in the United States or Europe. However, various therapeutics are used “off-label”, such as vitamin E (an antioxidant), insulin sensitizers (e.g., metformin, pioglitazone), pentoxifylline and UDCA. Lifestyle changes, including modification of diet and exercise to reduce body weight, as well as treatment of concomitant diabetes and dyslipidemia, are commonly accepted as the standard of care, but have not conclusively been shown to prevent disease progression. Although some of the off-label treatments described above have been studied as possible treatments for NASH, none has been approved by the FDA or EMA as a treatment for this disease. Currently, treatment options for NASH patients with advanced cirrhosis are limited. Although liver transplant can be life-saving, many patients fail to receive a donor organ in time, and for those who do, there are very significant clinical risks, such as infection and organ rejection, as well as significant costs. In addition, the post-transplant recurrence rate of NASH has been shown to be as high as 25% at 18 months. Given the lack of available treatment options, we believe that there is a significant unmet need for novel therapies for NASH, particularly in those patients with advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis and those with a high risk of disease progression due to other co-morbidities such as type 2 diabetes.
FXR activation has been shown to play a key role in the regulation of the metabolic pathways relevant to NASH, highlighting FXR as a potential drug target for treatment of the disease. Given the significant unmet medical need of patients with NASH, we believe that the ability of OCA to potently activate FXR has the potential to convey clinical 

9



benefit by improving key histologic parameters of the disease. This is supported by our preclinical and clinical results to date, and is being further investigated in our ongoing clinical trial program.
Phase 3 REGENERATE Trial
We are currently conducting a pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of OCA in patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH, known as the REGENERATE trial. REGENERATE is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study assessing the safety and efficacy of OCA on liver-related clinical outcomes in patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH. Patients with biopsy proven NASH with fibrosis are randomized 1:1:1 to receive placebo, OCA 10 mg or OCA 25 mg once daily. In August 2019, we announced the completion of the enrollment of the clinical outcomes cohort of REGENERATE, with 2,480 adult NASH patients with fibrosis randomized at over 300 qualified centers worldwide. REGENERATE will continue through clinical outcomes for verification and description of clinical benefit. The end-of-study analysis will evaluate the effect of OCA on all-cause mortality and liver-related clinical outcomes.
An 18-month interim analysis was conducted to assess the effect of OCA in liver histology comparing month 18 biopsy with baseline. Patients without a repeat biopsy due to study discontinuation or other reason were treated as non-responders in the primary efficacy analysis and full efficacy analysis (each as described below). A smaller exploratory cohort of patients with stage 1 liver fibrosis and at least one accompanying comorbidity (specified as diabetes, obesity or alanine transaminase (“ALT”) greater than 1.5 times ULN) were also enrolled in REGENERATE, but were not included in the primary efficacy analysis. As described below, these patients were included in the full efficacy analysis and safety analysis. The end-of-study analysis will evaluate the effect of OCA on all-cause mortality and liver-related clinical outcomes.
In February 2019, we announced topline results from the REGENERATE trial. In the primary efficacy analysis, once-daily OCA 25 mg met, with statistical significance, the primary endpoint agreed with the FDA of fibrosis improvement by at least one stage with no worsening of NASH (defined as no worsening of hepatocellular ballooning, no worsening of lobular inflammation and no worsening of steatosis) at the planned 18-month analysis and adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and the most common were consistent with the known profile of OCA. Although a numerically greater proportion of patients in both OCA treatment arms compared to placebo achieved the primary endpoint of NASH resolution with no worsening of liver fibrosis in the primary efficacy analysis, this result did not reach statistical significance. NASH resolution is defined as the overall histopathologic interpretation of (i) no fatty liver disease or (ii) fatty liver disease (simple or isolated steatosis) without steatohepatitis AND a nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (“NAFLD”) activity score (“NAS”) of 0 for ballooning and 0-1 for inflammation. As agreed with the FDA, in order for the primary objective to be met, the study was required to achieve one of the two primary endpoints. In November 2019, the results of the 18-month interim analysis from the REGENERATE trial were published in The Lancet.
The “primary efficacy analysis” (Intent-to-Treat or “ITT”) assessed efficacy at 18 months in 931 patients with stage 2 or 3 liver fibrosis due to NASH. Overall study discontinuations in the primary efficacy analysis population were balanced across treatment arms: 16% in placebo, 17% in OCA 10 mg and 15% in OCA 25 mg. An additional pre-specified “full efficacy analysis” at 18 months added an exploratory cohort of 287 NASH patients with stage 1 liver fibrosis and additional risk factors who were at increased risk of progression to cirrhosis (N = 1,218). 
Set forth below is a summary of the 18-month primary efficacy analysis and additional full efficacy analysis from the REGENERATE trial.

​
The “safety population” in the planned 18-month analysis of REGENERATE included 1,968 randomized patients who received at least one dose of investigational product (OCA or placebo).
​
Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and the most common were consistent with the known profile of OCA. The frequency of serious adverse events was similar across treatment arms (11% in placebo, 11% in OCA 10 mg and 14% in OCA 25 mg) and no serious adverse event occurred in > 1% of patients in any treatment arm. There were 3 deaths (2 in placebo: bone cancer and cardiac arrest, 1 in OCA 25 mg: glioblastoma) and none were considered related to treatment. 
The most common adverse event reported was dose-related pruritus (19% in placebo, 28% in OCA 10 mg and 51% in OCA 25 mg). The large majority of pruritus events were mild to moderate, with severe pruritus occurring in a small number of patients (< 1% in placebo, < 1% in OCA 10 mg and 5% in OCA 25 mg). A higher incidence of pruritus associated treatment discontinuation was observed for OCA 25 mg (< 1% in placebo, < 1% in OCA 10 mg and 9% in OCA 25 mg). According to the clinical study protocol, investigator assessed severe pruritus mandated treatment discontinuation.
Consistent with observations from previous NASH studies, OCA treatment was associated with an increase in low density lipoprotein (“LDL”) cholesterol, with a peak increase of 22.6 mg/dL at four weeks and subsequently reversing and approaching baseline at month 18 (4.0 mg/dL increase from baseline). Statin therapy was initiated in 10% of placebo patients and 24% of each OCA treatment arm. Among OCA patients who initiated statins, LDL cholesterol increases reversed and fell to below baseline levels by month 6. Triglycerides rapidly and continually decreased in the OCA treatment arms through month 18. There were few and varied serious cardiovascular events and incidence was balanced across the three treatment arms (2% in placebo, 1% in OCA 10 mg and 2% in OCA 25 mg).

11



In patients with type 2 diabetes, OCA treatment was associated with an early transient increase in fasting glucose and hemoglobin A1c with return to levels similar to placebo by month 6. No clinically meaningful changes were noted in non-diabetic patients.
With respect to hepatobiliary events, more patients (3%) on OCA 25 mg experienced gallstones or cholecystitis compared to < 1% on placebo and 1% on OCA 10 mg. While numerically higher in the OCA 25 mg treatment arm, serious hepatic adverse events were uncommon with < 1% incidence in each of the three treatment arms.
Phase 3 REVERSE Trial
We are currently conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial in NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis, known as the REVERSE trial. REVERSE is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of OCA in NASH patients with compensated cirrhosis. In January 2020, we announced that we completed enrollment of the REVERSE trial with over 900 patients with a biopsy-confirmed diagnosis of cirrhosis due to NASH randomized. 
The primary endpoint for REVERSE is the percentage of subjects with histological improvement in fibrosis by at least one stage with no worsening of NASH using the NASH Clinical Research Network scoring system after 18 months of treatment. Patients are randomized 1:1:1 into one of three treatment arms receiving a once-daily dose of placebo, OCA 10 mg or OCA 10 mg for the first three months with titration in accordance with the study protocol up to OCA 25 mg for the remaining study period. Patients who successfully complete the double-blind phase of REVERSE will be eligible to enroll in an open-label extension phase for up to 12 additional months.
Phase 2 CONTROL Trial
In December 2015, we initiated a Phase 2 clinical trial, known as the CONTROL trial, to characterize the lipid metabolic effects of OCA and cholesterol management effects of concomitant statin administration in NASH patients. CONTROL enrolled approximately 80 NASH patients who were naïve to statin therapy or had undergone a statin washout period. Statin-naïve or washout patients were randomized to receive one of three doses of OCA (5 mg, 10 mg or 25 mg) or placebo. The study included a 16-week double-blind phase followed by an optional long-term safety extension (“LTSE”).
In July 2017, we announced that CONTROL met its primary objective by showing that newly initiated treatment with atorvastatin rapidly reversed OCA-associated increases in LDL cholesterol to below baseline levels. Most of the effect was observed four weeks after initiation of the lowest available dose of atorvastatin and was sustained throughout the study period. OCA treatment in the absence of statin therapy over the first four weeks resulted in an increase in LDL cholesterol across all OCA treatment groups, while the placebo group was relatively unchanged. Treatment with atorvastatin beginning at week four and continuing through week 16 reversed OCA-related increases in LDL cholesterol to below baseline levels in all OCA treatment groups. Dose-dependent pruritus was the most common adverse event in patients treated with OCA, occurring in 5% of patients on placebo, 5% of patients in the OCA 5 mg group, 10% of patients in the OCA 10 mg group and 55% of patients in the OCA 25 mg group. All adverse events were mild to moderate and two patients discontinued treatment in the OCA 25 mg group due to pruritus. Over 95% of the patients completing the double-blind phase of CONTROL enrolled in the LTSE phase of the trial. During the LTSE phase of CONTROL, there was one patient death, which the principal investigator determined was unlikely related to OCA.
Phase 2 Sumitomo Dainippon Trial
In October 2015, we announced the results of a 72-week Phase 2 dose ranging trial of OCA in 200 adult patients with NASH in Japan. The trial was conducted by our former collaborator, Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. (“Sumitomo Dainippon”). In this trial, 202 Japanese biopsy-proven NASH patients (NAS of 5-8) were randomized into one of four arms to receive either a 10 mg, 20 mg or 40 mg dose of OCA or placebo, and 200 of these patients (50 per group) initiated treatment for a 72-week double-blind treatment phase, followed by a 24-week off treatment phase. The primary endpoint was histologic improvement defined as at least a two-point improvement in NAS with no worsening of fibrosis.

12



The primary efficacy analysis was conducted on an ITT basis, testing the dose dependent effects of once daily OCA (10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg) versus placebo on the primary endpoint. The ITT analysis included all randomized patients who received treatment (50 per group), and patients who discontinued or did not have a repeat biopsy were treated as non-responders. A pre-specified completer analysis was conducted on the patients who had biopsies at both baseline and 72 weeks (45, 44, 44 and 37 patients in the placebo, OCA 10 mg, OCA 20 mg and OCA 40 mg groups, respectively).
The Sumitomo Dainippon trial did not meet statistical significance for the primary endpoint. The ITT results in the table below show a dose dependent increase in the percentage of OCA-treated patients compared to placebo who achieved the primary endpoint (p = 0.053). Dose-dependent trends not reaching statistical significance were observed for several other pre-specified histologic endpoints, including the percentage of patients with steatosis and inflammation improvement, ballooning resolution and NASH resolution. No difference was seen in fibrosis improvement in the OCA groups compared to placebo.

*      Primary efficacy analysis is a stratified Cochran-Armitage test with multiple contrast coefficients. Statistical significance is based on a p-value < 0.05.
**    The secondary efficacy analysis is a Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (“CMH”) test stratified by baseline fibrosis stage for Pairwise comparison of each OCA group compared to the placebo group. The multiplicity was not adjusted.
In the completer analysis, similar dose dependent effects were observed, with 51% of patients in the OCA 40 mg dose group compared to 22% in the placebo group meeting the primary endpoint (p = 0.0061).
With the exception of dose dependent pruritus, OCA appeared to be generally safe and well tolerated. The number of pruritus associated discontinuations were 0, 0, 2 and 5 patients in the placebo, OCA 10 mg, OCA 20 mg and OCA 40 mg groups, respectively. Changes in lipid parameters, including LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, appeared to be consistent with previously reported lipid changes in Western NASH patients. No other meaningful differences in the rate of adverse events between the OCA and placebo groups were noted.
Phase 2b FLINT Trial 
In November 2014, the results from a Phase 2b clinical trial for the treatment of NASH, known as the FLINT trial, which was sponsored by the NIDDK, a part of the National Institutes of Health, were published in The Lancet. The FLINT trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of a once-daily dose of OCA 25 mg or placebo given for 72 weeks in 283 patients with biopsy-proven NASH. OCA achieved the primary endpoint in the FLINT trial, which was defined as an improvement of two or more points in NAS with no worsening of liver fibrosis. 
The percentage of patients meeting the primary histological endpoint, based on liver biopsies, in the FLINT trial was 45% in the OCA treatment group and 21% in the placebo group (p = 0.0002, n = 219). The mean pre-treatment baseline NAS for patients in the OCA treatment group was 5.3 of a total possible score of eight (comprised of a NAS of 0-2 for hepatocellular ballooning, 0-3 for lobular inflammation and 0-3 for steatosis). Subgroup analyses showed significant response rates in the OCA treatment group in patients with risk factors for disease progression, including baseline fibrosis stage, co-morbid type 2 diabetes mellitus, ALT, insulin resistance and severe obesity (each factor p < 0.05 for OCA compared to placebo based on 95% confidence interval of published odds ratios). 
A significantly greater number of OCA-treated patients also achieved the secondary endpoint of improvement of at least one fibrosis stage (35% versus 19%, p = 0.004), with OCA showing greater response rates as compared to placebo across all stages of fibrosis. Based on our retrospective analyses of the FLINT data, more OCA-treated patients exhibited fibrosis improvement of at least two fibrosis stages (15% versus 6%, not significant) and exhibited fibrosis improvements regardless of baseline fibrosis stage and a significantly greater number of OCA-treated patients also achieved complete 

13



resolution of fibrosis (17% versus 5%, p = 0.0018). Also, our retrospective analysis of the FLINT data showed that fewer OCA-treated patients progressed to bridging fibrosis (15% versus 18%, not significant) or to cirrhosis (2% versus 5%, not significant). Retrospective analyses after the unblinding of results can potentially introduce bias and regulatory authorities typically give greatest weight to results from pre-specified analyses as compared to retrospective analyses. The NASH Clinical Research Network fibrosis staging system was used to categorize the pattern of fibrosis and architectural remodeling of the liver: no fibrosis (F0), perisinuoidal or periportal fibrosis (F1), perisinusoidal and periportal fibrosis (F2), bridging fibrosis (F3) and cirrhosis (F4). Fibrosis sub-stages 1a, 1b and 1c were considered F1 for the analysis.
​
The secondary endpoint of NASH resolution, based on a global histological assessment, also showed improvement, although not statistically significant (22% versus 13%, p = 0.0832). A central reading of all baseline and end-of-trial biopsies was performed at the end of the trial, based on which only 80% of patients were confirmed to have definite NASH, while the remaining 20% were diagnosed as borderline NASH (10%) or not-NASH (10%). A retrospective subgroup analysis on the completer population comprised only of definite NASH patients at baseline showed that a significantly greater number of OCA-treated patients achieved NASH resolution compared with placebo-treated patients (19% versus 8%; p = 0.0278).
​
In an additional retrospective analysis of data from the FLINT trial conducted in a REGENERATE-matched patient cohort published in 2018, (i) approximately 40% of OCA-treated patients as compared to approximately 21% of patients on placebo achieved at least a one-stage improvement in liver fibrosis without any worsening of NASH (p = 0.02) and (ii) approximately 20% of OCA-treated patients as compared to approximately 7% of patients on placebo achieved NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis (p = 0.03) using the definition we selected for NASH resolution in the REGENERATE trial.
​
In the FLINT trial, more OCA-treated patients experienced significant improvements in the major histological features of NASH, including steatosis (61% versus 38%, p = 0.001), lobular inflammation (53% versus 35%, p = 0.006) and hepatocellular ballooning (46% versus 31%, p = 0.03), as compared to the placebo treatment group. Trends were similar between the two treatment groups for portal inflammation, which is not a component of NAS and is typically mild in adult NASH patients.
​
The histological improvements observed in OCA-treated patients versus placebo were accompanied by statistically significant reductions in relevant biochemical parameters, including the serum liver enzymes ALT (p < 0.0001), aspartate aminotransferase (“AST”) (p = 0.0001) and gamma-glutamyl transferase (“GGT”) (p < 0.0001), each of which were above generally accepted normal limits at baseline, and total bilirubin (p = 0.002). A modest but statistically significant increase in ALP (p < 0.0001) in the OCA treatment group was also observed, but levels remained within typical normal limits.
​
OCA treatment was associated with serum lipid changes, including increases in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol and a decrease in HDL cholesterol, that developed within 12 weeks of treatment initiation, then reversed through the end of treatment and returned to baseline during the 24-week post-treatment follow-up phase. Based on these observations, lipid management was emphasized partway into the trial, using accepted guidelines. At 72 weeks as compared to baseline, the following effects were observed in the OCA treatment group: an increase in mean total cholesterol (0.16 mmol/L or 6 mg/dL increase OCA versus 0.19 mmol/L or 7mg/dL decrease placebo, p = 0.0009), an increase in mean LDL cholesterol (0.22 mmol/L or 9 mg/dL increase OCA versus 0.22 mmol/L or 8 mg/dL decrease placebo, p < 0.0001), a decrease in mean HDL cholesterol (0.02 mmol/L or 1 mg/dL decrease OCA versus 0.03 mmol/L or 1 mg/dL increase placebo, p = 0.01) and a decrease in triglycerides (0.22 mmol/L or 20 mg/dL decrease OCA versus 0.08 mmol/L or 7 mg/dL decrease placebo, p = 0.88, not significant). These changes in cholesterol levels, along with the achievement of predefined efficacy criteria, played a role in the decision of the FLINT data and safety monitoring board to terminate the treatment phase of the FLINT trial, and the publication of the FLINT results noted the need for further study of these changes.
​
A post-hoc analysis showed OCA-treated patients who initiated statins during the FLINT trial (n = 26) experienced a rapid reversal of their observed mean LDL cholesterol increase to below baseline levels, with a mean decrease after 72 weeks of treatment of -18.9 mg/dL. In contrast, other OCA-treated patients with no reported initiation or change in statin therapy experienced an increase in LDL cholesterol that peaked at week 12 and was sustained over the 72-week treatment period. Patients treated with statins at baseline who maintained statin treatment over the duration of the study (n = 50) experienced a mean LDL cholesterol increase of 8.7 mg/dL at 72 weeks. Patients not treated with statins during the study 

14



(n = 65) experienced a mean LDL cholesterol increase of 16.0 mg/dL. Treatment related LDL cholesterol increases in all groups reversed with treatment discontinuation. This analysis suggests that the OCA-associated LDL cholesterol increase reaches a maximum peak and plateaus soon after initiation of therapy and that concomitant statin use in NASH patients receiving OCA may mitigate treatment-related LDL cholesterol increases.
​
In the FLINT trial, statistically significant weight loss of an average of 2.3 kilograms was observed in OCA patients compared to no weight loss in the placebo group (p = 0.008), and this weight loss reverted towards baseline during the 24-week follow-up phase. A pre-specified sensitivity analysis conducted by the investigators showed that weight loss was not a driver of the primary endpoint. An increase in a marker of hepatic insulin resistance known as homoeostasis model assessment – estimated insulin resistance (“HOMA-IR”) (calculated using the product of fasting plasma insulin and glucose) was observed at 72 weeks in the OCA treatment group (p = 0.01). However, there was an imbalance in baseline plasma insulin levels (201 pmol/L OCA versus 138 pmol/L placebo), and an even larger relative and absolute increase in HOMA-IR was observed in the placebo group at the conclusion of the 24-week follow-up phase. This is potentially attributable to the inherent variability in HOMA-IR measurements, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes, that have been shown to make single time-point to time-point changes of this magnitude clinically uninterpretable. There were virtually no changes in mean hemoglobin A1c, a measure of average blood sugar control over a period of approximately three months, in either OCA or placebo groups at 72 weeks. In an earlier study of OCA in diabetic NAFLD patients employing the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic insulin clamp, the gold standard for detecting changes in insulin resistance, OCA improved the glucose disposal rate consistent with reduced insulin resistance.
​
OCA was generally well tolerated in the FLINT trial. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and the incidence in the OCA and placebo treatment groups was similar for all symptoms except pruritus. Pruritus occurred more frequently in the OCA treatment group than in the placebo treatment group (23% vs. 6%, p < 0.0001) and at a higher grade (predominately moderate pruritus) but resulted in only one patient discontinuation. The incidence of severe or life-threatening events was not different between the two treatment groups and most of the events in both groups were deemed to be unrelated to treatment, including all severe or life-threatening cardiovascular events. There were two patient deaths in the Phase 2b FLINT trial and neither death was considered related to OCA treatment.
​
OCA and Bezafibrate
In December 2018, we entered into the Aralez Agreement, pursuant to which we acquired (i) Aralez’s license to develop and commercialize bezafibrate in the United States (as amended and restated in connection therewith, the “Bezafibrate License”), (ii) Aralez’s IND on file with the FDA and other associated regulatory documentation and (iii) a non-exclusive license to certain of Aralez’s intellectual property. Pursuant to the Aralez Agreement, we paid $9.0 million to Aralez in connection with the closing of the transactions in December 2018 and are obligated to make a $2.0 million milestone payment to Aralez based on the occurrence of specified regulatory-related events. Bezafibrate, a PPAR agonist that has been studied in PBC, is not approved in the U.S. for any indication. We are evaluating the efficacy, safety and tolerability of bezafibrate in combination with OCA in patients with PBC in a Phase 2 study outside of the United States, and we filed an IND with the FDA in January 2021 to prepare to expand such development into the United States, with the longer-term goal of developing and seeking regulatory approval for a fixed dose combination regimen in this indication and potentially may study this combination in other liver diseases. Pursuant to the Bezafibrate License, we are also obligated to make a $2.5 million milestone payment based on the occurrence of specified regulatory-related events with respect to such a combination product, as well as mid-single digit percentage royalty payments based on the net sales of such a combination product. 
Other Product Candidates
The discovery and development of safe and effective new product candidates and the development of additional uses for our existing product candidates and approved products, are important for the continued strength of our business. We, together with our collaborators, have discovered several bile acid chemistry-based compounds that are in the early stages of research and development. Among these compounds is INT-787. INT-787 is an FXR agonist that we are currently evaluating in preclinical studies. INT-787 has distinct pharmacological properties that differ from those of OCA and has shown potential anti-fibrotic and anti-inflammatory effects in animal models. We believe that bile acid analogs may have 

15



utility in a broad range of diseases beyond non-viral liver disease and we have in the past, and may in the future, explore the potential application of our development compounds outside of our core areas of focus.
​
The process from discovery to development to regulatory approval of a product candidate can take more than ten years. Product candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and product candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research and development and significant investment. In addition, we may decide to terminate or deprioritize the development of our product candidates due to a number of factors, including our views of the relevant regulatory development pathway, competitive landscape, commercial viability of the product candidate, or superior alternative uses of capital. For example, we have studied OCA for PSC, a rare, serious, chronic cholestatic liver disease characterized by a progressive, autoimmune-based destruction of bile ducts with eventual onset of cirrhosis. While we believe that the results of our Phase 2 AESOP trial announced in 2017 established a proof of concept of OCA in a second cholestatic liver disease, we have deprioritized development of OCA in PSC based, in part, on the lack of clarity on the regulatory pathway for this rare but serious disease. In addition, we are no longer actively developing INT-767, an orally administered dual FXR and TGR5 agonist derived from the primary human bile acid chenodeoxycholic acid.
​
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We have competitors in the United States, Europe and other jurisdictions, including major multinational pharmaceutical companies, established biotechnology companies, specialty pharmaceutical and generic drug companies and universities and other research institutions. Many of our competitors have financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing and distribution, legal, regulatory and product development resources substantially greater than ours. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies.
The ability of Ocaliva for PBC, OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH, if approved, and other future approved products, if any, to compete with products sold by other companies will depend on a number of factors, including efficacy, safety and tolerability, reliability, convenience of dosing, price, the level of branded and generic competition and reimbursement. We believe that the competitive environment for Ocaliva for PBC and, if approved, OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH is as follows.
Ocaliva for PBC
Ocaliva competes with UDCA (or ursodiol), a first-line therapy approved for the treatment of PBC that is available generically at a significantly lower cost than Ocaliva. Additional product candidates in Phase 3 or earlier clinical or preclinical development for the treatment of PBC include Genfit SA’s dual PPAR alpha/delta agonist (elafibranor), CymaBay’s PPAR delta agonist (seladelpar), Genkyotex’s NOX1/NOX4 inhibitor (setanaxib), HighTide’s AMPK activator/FXR agonist combination (HTD1801) and Fast Forward Pharmaceuticals BV’s anti-CD40 monoclonal antibody (FFP104). Additionally, several companies have product candidates aimed at the cholestatic-induced pruritus associated with PBC, including apical sodium dependent bile acid transport inhibitors being developed by GlaxoSmithKline plc (GSK2330672).
Off-label uses of other potential treatments may also compete with Ocaliva for PBC. For example, while fibrates are not approved for use in PBC, off-label use of fibrate drugs has been reported. Bezafibrate, a fibrate that is not approved by the FDA for any indication and is only available outside of the United States, has been studied in PBC.
OCA for Liver Fibrosis Due to NASH
There are currently no medications approved for the treatment of NASH. However, various therapeutics are used off-label for the treatment of NASH, including vitamin E (an antioxidant), insulin sensitizers (e.g., metformin, pioglitazone), antihyperlipidemic agents (e.g., gemfibrozil), pentoxifylline and UDCA. There are several product candidates in Phase 3 or earlier clinical or preclinical development for the treatment of NASH, including Madrigal’s THR beta agonist (resmetirom), Novo Nordisk’s GLP1 agonist (semaglutide), and Inventiva’s pan-PPAR agonist (lanifibranor), as well as 

16



FXR agonists from Novartis AG (tropifexor, nidufexor), Metacrine (MET409, MET642), Terns Pharmaceuticals (TERN-101), Gilead Sciences, Inc. (cilofexor) and Enanta Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (EDP-305).
Additional pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies with product candidates in development for the treatment of NASH include AstraZeneca plc, Altimmune Inc., Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Durect Corporation, Galectin Therapeutics Inc., Galmed Pharmaceuticals Ltd., Immuron Ltd., Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Islet Sciences, Inc., Madrigal Pharmaceuticals, Inc., MediciNova, Inc., MiNA Therapeutics, NGM Biopharmaceuticals, Inc., NuSirt Sciences Inc., Pfizer Inc., Viking Therapeutics, Inc. and Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. NASH is a complex disease and we believe that it is unlikely that any one therapeutic option will be optimal for every NASH patient.
In addition, many universities and private and public research institutions may become active in our target disease areas. The results from our clinical trials and the approval of Ocaliva for PBC have brought more attention to our targeted indications and bile acid chemistry. As a result, we believe that additional companies and organizations may seek to compete with us in the future. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing on an exclusive basis, technologies and drug products that are more effective or less costly than OCA or any other product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop, which could render our products or product candidates obsolete and noncompetitive. Our ability to compete may also be affected because, in many cases, insurers or other third-party payors seek to encourage the use of generic products.
Intellectual Property
Protecting our intellectual property, such as our patents, is a key part of our strategy. We are the owner of record of numerous issued U.S. and non-U.S. patents with claims directed to pharmaceutical compounds, pharmaceutical compositions, methods of making these compounds and methods of using these compounds in various indications. In addition, we are the owner of record of numerous pending U.S. and non-U.S. patent applications, and regularly pursue additional patent applications in various jurisdictions. We also have numerous trademark and service mark registrations and pending trademark and service mark applications in the United States and abroad. 
The patent portfolio for OCA contains U.S. and non-U.S. patents and patent applications directed to compositions of matter, methods of use and manufacturing methods. Our primary composition of matter patent for OCA was to expire in 2022. In light of the U.S. marketing approval of Ocaliva for PBC in May 2016, we applied for an extension of the patent term for this patent in the United States into 2027, which extension has been granted. In addition, in connection with the conditional approval of Ocaliva for PBC in the European Union, we have applied for supplementary patent certification (“SPC”) to extend the patent term for this patent in the European Union into 2027. To date, we have received grants of SPC in Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden and we expect to take similar actions in other jurisdictions and countries where similar regulations exist.
The table set forth below summarizes the U.S. patents covering OCA that are listed in the FDA’s Orange Book List of Approved Drug Products With Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the “Orange Book”). The issued patents covering OCA are expected to expire in 2022 at the earliest and 2036 at the latest if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other government fees are paid. We expect that the patents in the OCA portfolio that are listed in the Orange Book would expire as set forth below, assuming the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid.

----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In addition, we have intellectual property protecting OCA that we would expect to list in the Orange Book if OCA is approved for the treatment of NASH.
We may rely on trade secrets to protect our proprietary technologies, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We rely in part on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data, trade secrets and know-how by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems.
Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent, trademark and trade secret protection covering our products such as Ocaliva and product candidates, as well as our ability to successfully defend our intellectual property against third-party challenges. Our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our products is dependent upon the extent to which we have regulatory exclusivity or intellectual property-based exclusivity rights under valid and enforceable patents or other intellectual property that cover our products. If we fail to obtain and maintain adequate intellectual property protection, we may not be able to prevent third parties from launching generic versions of our products, from using our proprietary technologies or from marketing products that are very similar or identical to ours. The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the United States or in foreign jurisdictions, and the legal standards relating to the patentability, validity and enforceability of pharmaceutical patents are evolving.
Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in U.S. and foreign jurisdictions may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be enforced in the patents that we currently own or that may issue from the applications we have filed or may file in the future or those that we may license from third parties. Additionally, our currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents, and any term extensions that we seek may not be granted. Further, if any patents we obtain or license are deemed invalid or unenforceable, it could impact our ability to commercialize or license our technology or enable third parties to develop and market products that are similar or identical to ours.

Manufacturing and Supply
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of Ocaliva, OCA or any of our other product candidates, and we do not have any plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future. We rely on third-party contract manufacturers for all of our required raw materials, API and finished product for our commercial sales and for our clinical trials and preclinical studies.
We source the manufacture and commercial supply of API from such manufacturers, for use in Ocaliva and, if approved, OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH. We believe that we have secured supplies of API sufficient to meet our PBC and NASH commercial supply requirements during the initial stages of our NASH launch following the expected approval of OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH. One such supply agreement is with PharmaZell GmbH (“PharmaZell”). That contract does not require us to purchase a specific percentage of our annual commercial requirements of API from PharmaZell. We have also qualified an additional API supplier from which we may currently acquire API on a purchase order basis and continue to engage in activities intended to ensure that our long-term commercial supply requirements are satisfied. In connection with such efforts, we entered into an agreement with a third potential supplier of API for the manufacture of Ocaliva and, if approved, OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH, under which we may in the future be obligated to purchase a portion of our API requirements in the event of the achievement of agreed regulatory and product development milestones.
We do not have long-term supply agreements for any of our product candidates other than OCA, and regularly obtain supplies and services relating to our product candidates from third-party contract manufacturers on a purchase order basis. Contract manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulation and we depend on them for compliance with the requirements of U.S. and non-U.S. regulators for the manufacture of our finished products, including Ocaliva. We intend to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for the manufacture of clinical supplies of our product candidates and commercial supplies of our approved products, including Ocaliva and, if approved, OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH. We believe this manufacturing strategy will enable us to direct financial resources to the development and commercialization of products rather than diverting resources to establishing a manufacturing infrastructure. If PharmaZell and our other current and future suppliers are not able to meet our on-going commercial supply requirements, including those relating to Ocaliva or, if approved, OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH, on acceptable terms, or at all, our business may be materially and adversely affected. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Development and the Regulatory Review and Approval of Our Products and Product Candidates — We rely entirely on third parties for the manufacture of our product requirements for our preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as our commercial supply of Ocaliva and, if approved, OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH and our other product candidates, and also depend on third-party vendors and CROs for certain of our clinical trial and product development activities. Our business could be harmed if our third-party manufacturers fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of drug product, or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices, or if our third-party vendors or CROs assisting us with our clinical trials and product development activities fail to comply with their contractual commitments or applicable regulatory obligations or if we lose our relationships with our third-party vendors and CROs.”
Sales and Marketing
Ocaliva is our first approved product and the commercial launch of Ocaliva for PBC is our first product launch. We are commercializing Ocaliva for PBC using a combination of our internal commercial organization, a contract sales organization and third-party distributors depending on the jurisdiction. We are developing our commercialization strategy for OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH, if approved, and have not yet decided on our commercialization strategy for OCA for other indications or for our other product candidates, in each case, if approved. We intend to continue to evaluate how best to commercialize our product candidates, if approved, in the United States and internationally, and may choose to collaborate with third parties that have sales and marketing capabilities and established distribution systems, either to augment our own capabilities or in lieu thereof.
Customers
We commenced our commercial launch of Ocaliva for the treatment of PBC in the United States in June 2016. In December 2016, the European Commission granted conditional approval for Ocaliva for the treatment of PBC and we 

19



commenced our European commercial launch in January 2017. Since January 2017, Ocaliva has also received regulatory approval in several of our target markets outside the United States and Europe, including Canada, Israel and Australia. We recognized net product sales of Ocaliva of $312.7 million, $249.6 million and $177.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We sell Ocaliva to a limited number of specialty pharmacies which dispense the product directly to patients. The specialty pharmacies are referred to as our customers. For a discussion of our customer concentration, see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and analogous authorities in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, marketing, sampling, post-approval monitoring and reporting and export and import of products such as Ocaliva and those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States and by the European Commission following a favorable assessment provided by the EMA through the MAA process for a product falling within the scope of the Centralized procedure or a national MAA process (albeit through the process of Mutual Recognition or Decentralized procedure) before they may be legally marketed in the European Union. Our product candidates will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
United States Government Regulation
NDA Approval Processes
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended (the “FDCA”) and implementing regulations. An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following: 

● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice regulations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must take effect before human clinical testing may begin;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), representing each clinical site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practices (“GCP”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the new drug product for each indication for which FDA approval is sought;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation and submission to the FDA of a NDA;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | review of the new drug product by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable, although the FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the new drug product, or components thereof, are produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the new drug product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

20




● | satisfactory completion of FDA audits of clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP and the integrity of the clinical data;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | payment of user fees and procurement of FDA approval of the NDA; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including, as applicable, Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies (“REMS”) and post-approval studies required by the FDA.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Studies
Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In order to conduct clinical research, an IND sponsor must submit an IND. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, or any time thereafter, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin or continue. A clinical hold may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure, or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. An IRB at each institution must, among other things, review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at such institution, and approve the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with regulations applicable to the IRB.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, although the phases may overlap or be combined: 

● | Phase 1. The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested to assess pharmacological actions, safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination and, in some cases, early evidence of effectiveness. In the case of some products intended for the treatment of severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2. Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population generally at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling, should it ultimately be approved for marketing. In most cases the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials with statistically significant results to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical trial with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in certain instances.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or 

21



terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. In some cases, clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, or the clinical monitoring board or data monitoring committee. This group typically provides recommendations to the trial sponsor for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points. These decisions are based on the data monitoring committee’s independent review of data from the ongoing trial.
Sponsors of clinical trials of certain FDA-regulated products, including prescription drugs, are required to register and disclose clinical trial information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, clinical trial sites and investigator, and other aspects of the clinical trial on a public website maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of these clinical trials after completion. For a new product or a new indication for a previously approved product, sponsors can delay submission of clinical study results for up to two years until the product has been approved or approved for the new use. Competitors and others may use this publicly-available information to gain knowledge regarding the design and progress of our development programs.
During the development of a new drug, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points, including prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before a NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice and feedback on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) that they believe will support the approval of the new drug. If a Phase 2 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at the end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a special protocol assessment (“SPA”), the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim.
According to published guidance on the SPA process, a sponsor which meets the prerequisites may make a specific request for an SPA and provide information regarding the design and size of the proposed clinical trial. The FDA is supposed to evaluate the protocol within 45 days of the request to assess whether the proposed trial is adequate, and that evaluation may result in discussions and a request for additional information. An SPA request must be made before the proposed trial begins, and all open issues must be resolved before the trial begins. If a written agreement is reached, it will be documented and made part of the record. The agreement is generally expected to be binding on the FDA, in that the critical design elements agreed to as part of an SPA agreement may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the drug was identified after the testing began. The presence of an SPA agreement does not guarantee that a marketing application will be filed or approved, even if the trial is conducted in accordance with the protocol and achieves the specified endpoints. In rare cases, the FDA may rescind an SPA agreement.
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the drug prior to release. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life.
The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of a NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of a NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. Currently, the application fee is approximately $2.9 million for NDAs with clinical data and approximately $1.5 million for NDAs without clinical data. The sponsor under an approved NDA is also subject to annual program user fees, currently approximately $336,000. Program fees are assessed for each approved prescription drug product identified in an approved application, up to five program fees per application. These fees are typically modified annually. The FDA reviews all 

22



NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept a NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
Once the NDA is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. NDAs receive either standard or, as discussed more fully below, priority review. The FDA may refuse to approve a NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA reviews a NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe, effective, and can be properly manufactured for its intended use or uses. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee. Before approving a NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and tested to ensure compliance with cGMPs. An approval letter from the FDA authorizes commercial marketing of the product and specifies the prescribing information for the approved indication(s).
Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Priority Review and Accelerated Approval 
The FDA is authorized to designate certain products for expedited review if they are intended to address an unmet medical need in the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. These programs include fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation and priority review designation.
Specifically, the FDA may designate a product for fast track review if it is intended, whether alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such a disease or condition. For fast track designated products, sponsors may have a higher number of interactions with the FDA and the FDA may initiate review of sections of a fast track product’s NDA before the application is complete.
A product may also be designated as a breakthrough therapy if it is intended, either alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The FDA may take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, including holding meetings with the sponsor throughout the development process; providing timely advice to the product sponsor regarding development and approval; involving more senior staff in the review process; assigning a cross-disciplinary project lead for the review team; and taking other steps to design the clinical trials in an efficient manner.
The FDA may also designate a product for priority review if it would provide a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness of the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a serious condition. Certain other applications may also qualify for priority review. The FDA determines, on a case-by-case basis, whether the proposed drug represents a significant improvement when compared with other available therapies. A priority designation by the FDA is intended to direct the agency’s attention and resources to the evaluation of such applications, and to shorten the FDA’s goal for taking action on a marketing application from ten months to six months.
In addition, the FDA may grant accelerated approval to a drug for a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic advantage to patients over existing treatments based upon a determination that the drug has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. The FDA may also grant accelerated approval for such a condition when the product has an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality, and that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. Drugs granted accelerated approval must meet the same statutory standards for safety and effectiveness as those granted traditional approval. In the case of unprecedented accelerated approval endpoints, this determination occurs during the review of the NDA. Unless otherwise informed by the FDA, an applicant must submit to the FDA for consideration during the preapproval review period copies of all promotional materials, including promotional labeling as well as advertisements, intended for dissemination or publication within 120 

23



days following marketing approval. After 120 days following marketing approval, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the applicant must submit promotional materials at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination of the labeling or initial publication of the advertisement.
As a condition of a grant of accelerated approval, the FDA may require that the sponsor perform one or more controlled post-marketing clinical trials. Approval of a drug may be withdrawn if these trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug (e.g., show a significantly smaller magnitude or duration of benefit than was anticipated based on the observed effect on the surrogate).
Ocaliva was granted fast track designation by the FDA for the treatment of patients with PBC who have an inadequate response to or are intolerant of UDCA. In August 2015, the FDA accepted for review our NDA and granted priority review for Ocaliva in PBC. On May 27, 2016, Ocaliva was approved under the accelerated approval pathway in the United States for PBC in combination with UDCA in adults with an inadequate response to UDCA, or as monotherapy in adults unable to tolerate UDCA.
In January 2015, OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the FDA for the treatment of patients with NASH with liver fibrosis. In November 2019, the FDA accepted for review our NDA and granted priority review for OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH. In June 2020, we received a complete response letter (“CRL”) from the FDA stating that our NDA for OCA for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH could not be approved in its present form. The CRL indicated that, based on the data the FDA had reviewed, the FDA has determined that the predicted benefit of OCA based on a surrogate histopathologic endpoint remains uncertain and does not sufficiently
outweigh the potential risks to support accelerated approval for the treatment of patients with liver fibrosis due to NASH.
At that time, the FDA recommended that we submit additional post-interim analysis efficacy and safety data from the ongoing REGENERATE trial in support of potential accelerated approval and that the long-term outcomes phase of the
trial should continue. We are in discussions with the FDA with respect to the potential resubmission of our NDA seeking accelerated approval of OCA for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH. We had our end of review meeting with the FDA in October 2020 to discuss the FDA’s risk-benefit assessment in the CRL based on its review of the available data, as well as our proposed resubmission of our NDA for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH. The meeting was constructive and the FDA has provided us with helpful guidance regarding supplemental data we can provide to further characterize OCA’s efficacy and safety profile that could support resubmission based on our Phase 3 REGENERATE 18-month biopsy data, together with a safety update from our ongoing studies. We are advancing accordingly and plan to hold additional meetings with the FDA with the goal of achieving sufficient alignment to proceed on this basis and potentially resubmit our NDA for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH by the end of 2021.
​
Post-approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA post-approval, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if safety or other problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in new labeling information (e.g., warnings), customer training and/or education requirements, restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require studies, trials, analyses, and surveillance programs to monitor or evaluate the effect of approved products that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to limit further marketing of a product, or seek withdrawal of approval, based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon 

24



the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process or approval process, or after approval, may subject us to judicial, regulatory or statutory sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. 
These sanctions could include: 
​

● | refusal to approve pending applications;
--+-----------------------------------------

​

● | withdrawal of an approval;
--+---------------------------

​

● | imposition of a clinical hold;
--+-------------------------------

​

● | warning or untitled letters;
--+-----------------------------

​

● | product recalls;
--+-----------------

​

● | product seizures;
--+------------------

​

● | total or partial suspension of production or distribution; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | injunctions, fines, disgorgement, civil penalties and criminal prosecution.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FDA and other U.S. state and federal authorities regulate marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in a manner otherwise consistent with the provisions of the approved label and FDA regulations. The FDA and other authorities actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting false, misleading, deceptive, or off-label promotional practices; violations of these prohibitions can lead to significant liability. Additional regulations apply for advertising and promotion of products approved under the accelerated approval pathway. For example, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, an applicant must submit to the FDA for consideration during the preapproval review period copies of all promotional materials, including promotional labeling as well as advertisements, intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days following marketing approval. After 120 days following marketing approval, unless otherwise informed by the FDA, the applicant must submit promotional materials at least 30 days prior to the intended time of initial dissemination of the labeling or initial publication of the advertisement.
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct.
From time to time, legislation is introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
In accordance with the applicable requirements under the accelerated approval pathway, we initiated our Phase 4 COBALT clinical outcomes confirmatory trial for Ocaliva in PBC in December 2014, following discussions with the FDA. The study evaluates subjects across the spectrum of PBC disease, including early and advanced PBC. We have also agreed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Ocaliva in patients with moderate to severe hepatic impairment in a study known as the 401 trial and as monotherapy in patients with PBC. In addition, we have agreed to develop and characterize a lower dose formulation of Ocaliva to allow for once daily dosing in patients with moderate or advanced hepatic impairment. We 

25



are in discussions with the FDA and the EMA with respect to the status of the COBALT trial and the 401 trial and proposals for modifications to these post-marketing studies.
Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy
The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 created a new section of the FDCA which authorizes the FDA to require a REMS as a condition of NDA approval, or based upon new safety information regarding an approved drug, when the FDA determines a REMS is necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the potential risks. Under a REMS, the FDA may require various measures to address serious risks, such as medication guides, communication plans, training or registries, as well as steps to monitor and assess the effectiveness of those measures. Such requirements may impose significant burdens on prescribers, pharmacists or patients. The requirement for a REMS may materially affect the potential market and profitability of a drug.
We do not have a REMS for Ocaliva for the treatment of PBC.
Patent Term Extension and Data Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, (the “Hatch-Waxman Act”). The Hatch-Waxman Act permits an extension of a patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, the extension of patent term cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term extension period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND, and the submission date of a NDA, plus the time between the submission date of a NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. Our primary composition of matter patent for OCA was to expire in 2022, but in light of the U.S. marketing approval of Ocaliva for PBC in May 2016, we applied for an extension of the patent term for this patent in the United States into 2027, which extension has been granted. In addition, in connection with the conditional approval of Ocaliva for PBC in the European Union, we have applied for SPC to extend the patent term for this patent in the European Union into 2027. To date, we have received grants of SPC in Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Norway, Portugal, Spain and Sweden and we expect to take similar actions in other jurisdictions and countries where similar regulations exist.
Data exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent data exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of a NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is considered a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance as further defined in FDA regulations. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or a 505(b)(2) NDA for a drug with the same active moiety. However, an application may be submitted four years from the NDA approval date if it contains a paragraph IV certification that a reference product patent is invalid or not infringed by the ANDA or 505(b)(2) product. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs or 505(b)(2) NDAs for drugs containing the original active moiety for other conditions of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA; however, an applicant submitting a full NDA may be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.

26



Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use 
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, sponsors may obtain a six month extension of unexpired regulatory exclusivities and terms of unexpired Orange Book-listed patents relating to their drug, if pediatric studies substantially complying with a written request are completed and submitted by the sponsor to the FDA within the statutory time frame. We have not received such a written request from the FDA for such pediatric studies, although we may ask the FDA to issue a written request for such studies in the future.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (the “PREA”), a NDA or supplement to a NDA for certain drugs must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective, unless the sponsor receives a deferral or waiver. However, the FDA has recently issued guidance limiting a sponsor’s ability to waive the PREA study requirements. 
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to drugs intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting a NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any applications from any other party to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in very limited circumstances such as where there is a demonstration of clinical superiority. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also work to block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor develops the same drug as one of our product candidates and obtains approval and orphan exclusivity for the same indication or disease for which our product candidate is being developed. Orphan drug exclusivity would not block approval of the same drug developed by a competitor for a use different from our orphan-protected approved use. If a drug or drug product designated as an orphan product ultimately receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what was designated in its orphan product application, it may not be entitled to orphan exclusivity for the full scope of its approved use.
As in the United States, we may apply for designation of a product as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the European Union before the application for marketing authorization is made. Orphan drugs in Europe enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved indication. The market exclusivity period for the authorized therapeutic indication may be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the orphan designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity. In addition, a competing similar medicinal product may in limited circumstances be authorized prior to the expiration of the market exclusivity period, including if it is shown to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. 
OCA has received orphan drug designation in the United States and the European Union for the treatment of PBC and PSC. In the United States, Ocaliva has also received orphan exclusivity for its approved PBC indication that runs until May 27, 2023.
Regulation Outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to regulations of other countries governing clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the United States before we can commence 

27



clinical trials in such countries and approval of the regulators of such countries or economic areas, such as the European Union, before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Under European Union regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications under the centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition marketing authorization procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization for a medicinal product by the European Commission on the basis of an opinion provided by the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (the “CHMP”). A centralized marketing authorization is valid for all European Union member states and the European Economic Area States (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway). The decentralized marketing authorization procedure involves the submission of an application for marketing authorization to the competent authorities in each of the European Union member states chosen by the applicant in which the product is to be marketed. One national competent authority, selected by the applicant (Reference Member State) leads the assessment of the application for marketing authorization. The competent authorities of the other chosen European Union member states concerned by the procedure (Concerned Member States) are subsequently required to review the initial evaluation and, if the assessment is positive and all issues are resolved, grant marketing authorization for their territory on the basis of the assessment, except where grounds of potential serious risk to public health require the application for authorization to be refused. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of a marketing authorization which has already been granted by the national competent authority of a European Union member state by the competent authorities of the other European Union member states where further marketing authorizations are progressively sought. The holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the competent authority of a European Union member state requesting the recognition of the marketing authorization granted by the competent authority of another European Union member state.
Prior to obtaining a marketing authorization in the European Union submitted as a full stand-alone dossier, applicants have to demonstrate compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved PIP covering all subsets of the pediatric population, unless the EMA has granted (1) a product-specific waiver, (2) a class waiver, or (3) a deferral for one or more of the measures included in the PIP. In the case of orphan medicinal products, completion of an approved PIP can result in an extension of the aforementioned market exclusivity period from ten to twelve years.
It is also possible that a centralized marketing authorization could be conditional on post-approval studies and not considered a full approval, but subject to annual renewal until comprehensive data are provided to confirm the benefit/risk assessment. A manufacturer’s ability to obtain and maintain conditional marketing authorization in the European Union will be limited to specific circumstances and subject to several conditions and obligations, if obtained at all. Conditional marketing authorizations can be granted, based on a clinical dataset that is not comprehensive. Granting of such an authorization may be granted for a limited number of medicinal products for human use referenced in the applicable European Union law governing conditional marketing authorization, including products designated as orphan medicinal products under European Union law, if (1) the risk-benefit balance of the product is positive, (2) it is likely that the applicant will be in a position to provide the required comprehensive clinical trial data, (3) unmet medical needs will be fulfilled and (4) the benefit to public health of the immediate availability on the market of the medicinal product outweighs the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. Specific obligations, including with respect to the completion of ongoing or new studies, and with respect to the collection of pharmacovigilance data, may be specified in the conditional marketing authorization. Conditional marketing authorizations are valid for one year, and may be renewed annually, if the risk-benefit balance remains positive, and after an assessment of the need for additional or modified conditions.
Similarly to the United States, both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA and the competent authorities of the individual European Union member states both before and after grant of the manufacturing and marketing authorizations. This includes European Union cGMP rules, which govern quality control of the manufacturing process and require documentation policies and procedures. We and our third-party manufacturers are required to ensure that all of our processes, methods, and equipment are compliant with cGMP.

28



Failure by us or by any of our third-party partners, including suppliers, manufacturers, and distributors to comply with European Union laws and the related national laws of individual European Union member states governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of medicinal products and manufacturing and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of marketing authorization, may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays in or refusals to authorize the conduct of clinical trials or the grant of marketing authorizations, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspensions, withdrawals, or variations of previously granted marketing authorizations, total or partial suspensions of production, distribution, manufacturing, or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
In October 2016, the CHMP of the EMA adopted a positive opinion recommending the granting of a conditional marketing authorization of Ocaliva in PBC. Based on the CHMP’s positive recommendation, the European Commission granted a conditional marketing authorization of Ocaliva in PBC in December 2016. Although we have successfully renewed our conditional marketing authorization in the European Union in the past, there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to do so in the future. Failure to renew our conditional marketing authorization would prevent us from continuing to market Ocaliva for PBC in Europe. PBC is not believed to occur in the pediatric population. Therefore, in accordance with applicable regulations, the PBC marketing authorization required demonstration of compliance with all measures included in an EMA-approved Pediatric Investigation Plan for OCA for the treatment of biliary atresia, a pediatric cholestatic disease.
Pricing and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance plans and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority for federal and state governments and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of new or more restrictive price controls and cost-containment measures in the jurisdictions in which we operate could materially and adversely impact our net sales and financial results.
Third-party payers are responsible for managing overall pharmaceutical drug spending for their client membership. Third-party payers continue to scrutinize and manage the prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services, and many also limit reimbursement for newly-approved or innovating products and indications. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may (i) not cover our approved products as part of their plans’ benefits, (ii) apply utilization management restrictions or high patient cost-sharing obligations or (iii) restrict the level of reimbursement for our approved products and any such actions may affect our ability to sell our approved products on a profitable basis or at all.
Medicare is a U.S. federal healthcare program that provides coverage for certain healthcare items and services to individuals aged 65 years or older, as well as individuals of any age with certain disabilities and illnesses. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D of the MMA, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which provide coverage for outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as part of Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all outpatient drugs, and each Part D plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D plan drug formularies must include at least two drugs within each therapeutic category and class of Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutics committee. Part D plan coverage and reimbursement may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval in the United States. Moreover, while Part D provides prescription drug benefits only to Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in reimbursement by Medicare may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors. Medicare Part D may affect reimbursement of our products upon approval.

29



Medicaid is a U.S. healthcare program that provides coverage for certain healthcare items and services to low-income children, families, pregnant women and people with disabilities. It is jointly funded by the federal and state governments, and it is administered by individual states within parameters established by the federal government. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drugs may vary by state Medicaid program. A manufacturer must enter into a Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement to have its products covered by Medicaid. Under the Medicaid program, and per the Medicaid Drug Rebate Agreement, manufacturers agree to report certain prices to the government and pay rebates to state Medicaid programs based on Medicaid utilization of the manufacturer’s covered drugs. 
In addition to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, federal law requires companies to participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B Drug Pricing Program in order to have the manufacturer’s drugs covered under Medicaid. The 340B Drug Pricing Program requires participating manufacturers to charge statutorily-defined covered entities no more than the 340B “ceiling price” for the manufacturer’s covered outpatient drugs. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “ACA”), extended eligibility to participate in the 340B program to certain additional types of hospitals (including critical access hospitals, sole community hospitals, rural referral centers and freestanding cancer hospitals). For purposes of these newly eligible covered entities, the ACA specifically excluded from the definition of “covered outpatient drugs” certain drugs designated as “orphan drugs” under section 526 of the FDCA. We are also required as a condition of Medicaid participation to discount our products to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, including the TRICARE retail pharmacy program, under which additional laws and requirements apply. 
These programs require submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, and the guidance governing such calculations is not always clear. Compliance with such requirements can require significant investment in personnel, systems and resources, but failure to properly calculate prices, or offer required discounts or rebates can subject manufacturers to substantial penalties.
In 2010, the ACA was enacted to, among other things, expand access and increase consumer insurance protections while reducing the cost of health care for consumers. The law substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. The ACA requires manufacturers to provide discounts on the prices of brand named drugs in the coverage gap under Medicare Part D and increased the rebates paid by pharmaceutical companies on drugs covered by Medicaid. The ACA also imposes an annual fee, which increases each year, on sales by branded pharmaceutical manufacturers. Since its enactment, there have been a number of judicial, executive and legislative challenges to the ACA, including tax legislation that removed the financial penalties for people who do not carry health insurance (known as the “individual mandate”) and an Executive Order signed in October 2017 by former President Trump directing federal agencies to modify how the ACA is implemented. Congress may continue to consider legislation to repeal and replace some or all elements of the ACA. Further, in December 2018, a federal district court in Texas ruled that the entire ACA was unconstitutional because it could not be considered an exercise of Congressional taxing authority following the repeal of the individual mandate penalties. In December 2019, a federal court of appeals upheld the district court's decision that the ACA individual mandate was unconstitutional absent financial penalties, but remanded the case back to the district court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA were nonetheless valid. However, in March 2020, before the district court could rule on the ACA’s remaining provisions, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the case and oral arguments were held in November 2020. A decision is expected before June 2021. We cannot predict the outcome of this, or any other, litigation regarding the ACA or the impact it may have on our business.
There has been particular and increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices, particularly with respect to drugs that have been subject to relatively large price increases over relatively short time periods. At the federal level, there have been several U.S. Congressional inquiries, proposed bills, and proposed administrative rules designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. The outcome and potential effects of these proposals, and other proposals that may be forthcoming is unclear. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.

30



In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before its cost may be funded within the respective national healthcare systems. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, European Union member states can restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and may control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profits the medicinal product generates for the company placing it on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products on cost-effectiveness grounds. Historically, products launched in countries in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally their prices tend to be significantly lower. 
U.S. Fraud and Abuse Laws
Interactions and arrangements with third-party payors, healthcare providers and professionals and customers, including patients and patient advocacy groups, are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may restrict certain marketing and contracting practices. These laws include, federal and state anti-kickback and false claims statutes as well as other statutes and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse. Other pharmaceutical companies have settled alleged or admitted violations of these fraud and abuse laws with state and federal authorities in recent years and in some cases these settlements have amounted to hundreds of millions, or even billions, of dollars in damages, fines, and penalties, as well as the imposition of compliance program obligations through Corporate Integrity Agreements and other means. Lawsuits, or enforcement actions brought under fraud and abuse laws, can be extremely costly to defend, even if a company has strong defenses and ultimately succeeds in getting the allegations or enforcement action dismissed.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute (42 U.S.C. §1320a-7b(b)) prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging for any good or service, for which payment may be made under federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. Remuneration is not defined in the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and has been broadly interpreted by regulators to include for example, cash payments, gifts, discounts, coupons, and the furnishing of free or discounted services or supplies, and other items or services of value to the recipient. This statute has been broadly interpreted to apply to manufacturer arrangements with prescribers, purchasers, formulary managers and patients, among others. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution or other regulatory sanctions, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and practices that involve remuneration intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for such exceptions or safe harbors.
The federal False Claims Act imposes civil penalties, including treble damages and significant per-claim penalties, which may be pursued through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The government and qui tam relators have brought False Claims Act actions against pharmaceutical companies on the theory that their practices have caused false claims to be presented to the government. There is also a separate false claims provision imposing criminal penalties.
Other federal healthcare fraud-related laws also impose criminal liability for violations. The Criminal Healthcare Fraud statute (18 U.S.C. §1347) prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. Federal criminal law also prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
A number of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Some state anti-kickback statutes apply not just to government payors, but to all payors, including commercial payors and patients.

Other Laws
The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively, “HIPAA”), imposes obligations, on “covered entities,” including health plans and healthcare providers, and their business associates with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Although drug manufacturers are not directly subject to HIPAA, we could be subject to criminal penalties if we knowingly obtain individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. We are also subject to state, federal and international privacy and security laws governing the processing and security of personal identifiable information.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requirements under the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to report to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to certain direct and indirect payments and other transfers of value made to covered recipients, such as physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Payments made to physicians and research institutions for clinical trials are included within the ambit of this law. We are also subject to similar laws in several states and various European Union countries where we have operations. Some of these state and EU laws are broader in scope than federal laws. 
In addition, several states now require prescription drug companies to report expenses relating to the marketing and promotion of drug products. Several states prohibit providing certain payments or items of value to healthcare providers or other enumerated individuals or entities, as well as various other marketing-related activities. Certain states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies and their outcomes. In addition, California, Connecticut, Nevada and Massachusetts require pharmaceutical companies to implement compliance programs and marketing codes. Several additional states are considering similar proposals. Some of the state laws are broader in scope than federal laws. Compliance with these laws is challenging and requires significant time and resources, and any failure to comply with such laws could result in significant civil penalties and other adverse consequences.
Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2020, we had 498 employees, of which 359 were based in the United States, including at our facilities in New York and San Diego, and 139 were based outside the United States, including at our offices in London. A significant percentage of our employees have obtained advanced degrees in their professions. We consider the intellectual capital of our employees to be an essential driver of our business and key to our future prospects. Given our unique opportunity as a leader in the treatment of progressive non-viral liver disease coupled with our disciplined management of our financial resources, we continue to be able to fill the vacated positions and, if needed, grow our headcount in support of our commercial organization and our pipeline of research and development programs and product candidates. We monitor our compensation programs closely and provide what we consider to be a very competitive mix of compensation and insurance benefits for all our employees, as well as participation in our equity programs. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good. In addition, we continually evaluate our headcount with respect to our business needs and opportunities and seek to balance in house expertise and capacity with outsourced expertise and capacity. In August 2020, we adopted a plan to reduce our workforce in light of the receipt of the CRL from the FDA regarding our NDA for OCA for liver fibrosis due to NASH (the “2020 Workforce Plan”). The 2020 Workforce Plan sought to streamline our operations and reduce operating expenses, while maintaining the critical resources needed to continue to support the NASH and PBC clinical programs, pursue the approval of OCA for the treatment of liver fibrosis due to NASH and support our successful PBC business.
