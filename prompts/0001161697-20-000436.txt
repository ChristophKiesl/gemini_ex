ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware, August 18, 1992. Prior to the Acquisition (as defined below), we were a “shell company” (as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). As a result of the Acquisition, we have ceased to be a “shell company” and will continue as a publicly traded company under the name StemGen, Inc. The existing business operations of D3esports, Inc. will continue as our wholly subsidiary.

On January 29, 2019 (the “Closing Date”), we completed and closed the acquisition (the “Acquisition”) under an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the “Reorganization Agreement”), entered into by and among (i) StemGen, Inc.(“StemGen”); (ii) D3esports, Inc., a Wyoming corporation (“D3esports”); and (iii) the shareholders of D3esports (“Sellers”) pursuant to which D3esports became a wholly owned subsidiary of ours. Pursuant to the Reorganization Agreement, we acquired from the Sellers all of the issued and outstanding equity interests of D3esports in exchange for 39,631,587 shares of our common stock, par value $0.001 per share and 7,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 per share. As a result of the Acquisition, the Sellers, as the former shareholders of D3esports, became the controlling shareholders of the Company. The Acquisition was accounted for as a reverse merger notwithstanding it is legally a reverse acquisition. For accounting purposes, D3esports is the acquiring entity. Current and comparative consolidated financial statements include the accounts of D3esports since inception (May 1, 2018) and StemGen from the date of acquisition (January 29, 2019) (collectively, the “Company”).

On the 20th day of May 2019 we incorporated StemGen Connect in the State of Texas and issued 1,000,000 shares (50%) of common stock to The Learning Partnership.com Trading Limited, 500,000 shares (25%) of common stock to D3esports Corp. and 500,000 shares (25%) of common stock to Dawson Racing, Inc. D3esports Corp. is a wholly owned subsidiary of StemGen, Dawson Racing, Inc. is an affiliate of Simon Dawson, the president and CEO of StemGen.

The Learning Partnership.com Trading Limited is a UK based company engaged in educational leadership, teaching and learner engagement creating a social learning platform division for education, www.DendriteConnect.com.

The joint venture agreement was terminated effective June 1, 2020.
