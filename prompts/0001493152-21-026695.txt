ITEM 1. BUSINESS.
General
 
Hartford Great Health Corp. (“the Company”, “Hartford” “we”, “us” or our”) was incorporated in the State of Nevada on April 2, 2008 (“Inception) under the name PhotoAmigo, Inc. It changed its name to Hartford Great Health Corp. on August 20, 2018, and since then we have been engaged in activities to formulate and implement our business plan as set forth below.
Overview
 
Up until August 2018, we provided social networking and photo sharing from the website PhotoAmigo.com. We also maintained the domain names PhotoAmigo.net, fotoamigo.com and fotoamigo.net. These domain names all redirect incoming traffic to our main website, PhotoAmigo.com.
 
In August 2018, the Company changed its future plans of operations. Through its wholly owned subsidiary - Hangzhou Hartford Comprehensive Health Management, Ltd (“HZHF) and HZHF’s 60 percent owned subsidiary - Hangzhou Longjing Qiao Fu Vacation Hotel Co., Ltd. (“HZLJ”), and through Shanghai Hartford Comprehensive Health Management, Ltd. (“HFSH”) and its 90 percent owned subsidiary - Shanghai Qiao Garden International Travel Agency (“Qiao Garden Int’l Travel”), the Company engages in hospitality industry in China. Qiao Garden Int’l Travel was disposed on December 31, 2020, see note 4 Acquisitions, Joint Ventures and Deconsolidation.
 
The Company started to engage in early childhood education industry at Hartford International Education Technology Co., Ltd (“HF Int’l Education”), a 75.5% ownership subsidiary of HFSH in March 2019. On July 24, 2019 and March 23, 2020, HF Int’l Education established two 100% owned subsidiaries, Pudong Haojin Childhood Education Ltd. (“PDHJ”) and Shanghai Hongkou HaiDeFuDe Childcare Co., Ltd.(“HDFD”), respectively, to operate the early childhood education service under the brand name of “HaiDeFuDe” in Shanghai, China. On July 20, 2020, HF Int’l Education entered an agreement with two individuals to acquire the whole ownership of Shanghai Gelinke Childcare Education Center (“Gelinke”).
 
In March 2021, HF Int’l Education entered agreements with a third party, Hartford Health Management (Shanghai), Co. Ltd. (“HFHM”). HFHM purchased seven education & intellectual property copy rights and ten “HaiDeFuDe” registered trademarks from HF Int’l Education for a total amount of RMB1.2M and RMB1.0M, respectively. As a part of the purchase agreement, HFHM will be paid the 90% of gross tuition income from the three childcare centers. During the board meeting, SH Jingyu and another noncontrolling shareholders also sold a total of 14.5% equity at zero value to HFSH. As a result, HFSH holds 90% of HF Int’l Education and a total of 10% equity is held by two other noncontrolling shareholders.
 
The following business plan is based on research and discussions between the board and third party suppliers and experts. Only preliminary activities relating to the following objectives have been undertaken and therefore, there is no assurance that any of the proposed activities set forth below will be started by the Company or if started will be successful.
 
Strategy
 
The initial plan focuses on the development of the Sino-U.S. health industry in the following four areas:
 
A. International Anti-Aging Membership Program,
 B. Artificial Intelligence and Medical Equipment Sales,
 C. Mobile Lifestyle Health & Wellness Management Platform,
 D. Integrated Health Management of Metabolic Diseases.

The Company has also expanded its strategy into the hospitality industry, focusing on hotels, restaurants, and travel arrangements. The Company plans to integrate hospitality with health management through its membership-based program by arranging travel accommodations for Chinese citizen members to the United States to obtain stem cell beauty treatments.
 
The initial plan in early 2019 that focused on the development of the Sino-U.S. health industry in the areas of International Anti-Aging membership based program; Artificial Intelligence and Medical Equipment Sales; Mobile Lifestyle Management Platform; and Integrated management of metabolic diseases have been put on hold due to economic uncertainties caused by the increasing tension between the US and China international relation.
 
Near the end of 2019, the Company has found another opportunity to expand its market reach in the Chinese childhood education industry. The Company plans to formulate a proprietary early childhood education center management model beginning with the opening of several early childhood education centers in the greater Shanghai area with the goal of demonstrating the management model in action in order to attract interest from potential franchisees. Currently, there are three early child education and development center in operation despite the economic slowdown during the pandemic. The recent “Three-child policy” announced on May 1, 2021, by Chinese government further increases the market opportunities in early childhood education industry. On July 24, 2021, the Chinese government announced a “Double-Reduction” education policy to be taken effective on August 31, 2021. This new education policy has since impacted the Company’s early childhood education business. In the short future, the Company is optimistic on the increasing demand for childcare and childhood education; therefore, the Company will remain focus mainly on childcare and childhood educational development industry.
 
There can be no assurance following consummation of any of the business ventures will develop into a going concern or, if the business is already operating, that it will continue to operate successfully. Many of the potential business opportunities available to the Company may involve new and untested products, processes or market strategies which may not ultimately prove successful.
 
The Company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. At present, the Company has limited operations and the continuation of the Company as a going concern is dependent upon financial support from its stockholders, its ability to obtain necessary equity financing to continue operations and/or to successfully locate and negotiate with a business entity for the combination of that target company with the Company. There is no assurance that the Company will ever be profitable.
 
Competition
 
We believe there are only limited barriers to entry in our business. With regards to the education industry, the Company carefully selected to invest in a business with established expertise and knowledge of the early childhood education industry in China. The Company recognizes that there are numerous childcare centers throughout China; however, these centers lack standard curriculums for educating children and many fall into the designation of daycares rather than education centers. As such, the Company’s interests with regards to early childhood education mainly relate to creating a nationwide standardized curriculum to be implemented throughout all of China which is an idea that faces little competition as it has remained unexplored by other childcare businesses. To successfully compete in our industries, we will need to:

● | Ensure that investments in our projects are affordable; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | That our investment strategy is simple to understand; and 
● | That we provide outstanding customer service and rigid integrity in our business dealings. 

 
However, there can be no assurance that even if we do these things, we will be able to compete effectively with the other companies in our industry. We believe that we have the required management expertise in sourcing properties with good development potential and affordable price. We are committed to work and communicate with our investors and sales consultants to identify their goals and needs which will make it easier to continually provide them with the best products and services.
