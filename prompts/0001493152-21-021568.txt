Item 1. Business.
Overview
 
We were formed in April 2000 to develop the Dick’s Wings and Grill® restaurant franchise (“Dick’s Wings”), and are the owner, operator and franchisor of the Dick’s Wings brand of restaurants. Our Dick’s Wings franchise is currently comprised of 43 restaurants owned and/or franchised located in the States of Florida, Georgia, Texas, Kentucky, and West Virginia. Dick’s Wings offers a variety of boldly-flavored menu items highlighted by our Buffalo, New York-style chicken wings spun in our signature sauces and seasonings. We offer our customers a casual, family-fun restaurant environment designed to appeal to both families and sports fans alike. At Dick’s Wings, we strive to provide our customers with a unique and enjoyable experience Flavor. From first bite to last call®.
 
On August 30, 2018, we acquired the Fat Patty’s® restaurant concept (“Fat Patty’s”), which is currently comprised of four restaurants located in West Virginia and Kentucky. Fat Patty’s offers a variety of specialty burgers and sandwiches, wings, appetizers, salads, wraps, and steak and chicken dinners in a family friendly, sports-oriented environment designed to appeal to a mix of families, students, professors, locals, and visitors.
 
During fiscal year 2019, we were the franchisee of a Tilted Kilt restaurant in Gonzales, Louisiana which we forfeited at the end of 2019.
 
On October 11, 2019, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of WingHouse. WingHouse was comprised of 24 company-owned restaurants located in Florida
 
Our restaurants serve lunch and dinner and provide a full-service bar. They offer a variety of specialty burgers and sandwiches, wings, appetizers, salads, wraps, and steak and chicken dinners in a family friendly, sports-oriented environment designed to appeal to a mix of families, students, professors, locals, and visitors as well as offering kids meal options for children. We offer dine-in, take-out and third-party delivery services at all our locations. All our restaurants offer an extensive selection of domestic, imported and craft beers and wine, and the majority of our restaurants feature a full bar offering a variety of liquor and spirits. We also introduce new menu items from time to time.
 
We are focused on continually elevating our unique and high-quality food and beverage offerings. Our goal is to balance the established menu offerings that appeal to our loyal customers with new menu items that increase customer frequency and attract new customers. We believe that the development of new products can drive traffic by expanding our customer base and help us continue to build brand leadership in food quality and taste. For all new menu rollouts, new product launches are combined with a new menu design and updated pricing to reflect the current economic environment, as well as our current strategic marketing and creative plan. All our menu items are made-to-order and are available for take-out.


The restaurants are established and operated under a comprehensive and unique system that includes: (i) distinctive signage, interior and exterior design, decor and color scheme; (ii) special recipes and menu items, including proprietary products and ingredients; (iii) uniform standards, specifications, and procedures for operations; (iv) quality and uniformity of products and services offered; (v) inventory, management and financial control procedures (including point of purchase and tracking systems); (vi) training and assistance; and (vii) advertising and promotional programs, all of which we may change, improve, and further develop.
 
Dick’s Wings Franchise
 
Restaurants
 
As of December 30, 2019, our Dick’s Wings franchise was comprised of traditional restaurants like our Dick’s Wings & Grill restaurants, which are full- service restaurants, and non-traditional units such as the Dick’s Wings concession stands at TIAA Bank Field (formerly EverBank Field) and Veterans Memorial Arena in Jacksonville, Florida (the “Concession Stand”). The Concession Stand ceased its operations on January 2020, due to the effects of COVID-19. On December 31, 2019, the Company had 194 Dick’s Wings & Grill restaurants owned and operated by franchisees, three (3) Dick’s Wings & Grill restaurants owned and operated by the Company; and one restaurant under construction in Tallahassee. The Concession Stand at TIAA Bank Field and Veterans Memorial Arena was owned and operated by us. As of the date of this Annual Report, the Company has 16 Dick’s Wings & Grill Restaurants owned and operated by franchisees, with three (3) Dick’s Wings & Grill restaurants owned and operated by us.
 
The restaurants typically range in size from 3,500 to 5,500 square feet and require an initial capital investment per restaurant of between $237,500 and $772,500. The initial capital investment is comprised of cash pre-opening costs and build-out costs. Factors contributing to the fluctuation in the initial capital investment per location include the size of the property, the geographical location, the type of construction, the cost of liquor and other licenses, and the type and amount of concessions, if any, received from landlords. We offer lower cost conversion packages that provide prospective franchisees with flexibility to convert existing restaurants of other brands into a Dick’s Wings restaurant. Because of this, some of our restaurants may be smaller or larger or cost more or less than the typical ranges.
 
The restaurants are typically open on a daily basis from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, and from 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. on Friday and Saturday, although closing times may vary depending on the day of the week and applicable regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages.
 
Menus
 
Our Dick’s Wings restaurants feature a variety of menu items highlighted by our traditional and boneless Buffalo, New York- style chicken wings spun in our signature sauces and seasonings. Our sauces and seasonings range in heat intensity from mild to very hot and combined with such flavors as Bourbon, Cajun Ranch, Caribbean Jerk, Florida Girl, Garlic Parmesan, Georgia Girl, Gold Rush, Honey BBQ, Lemon Pepper, Mango Habanero, Ragin’ Cajun, Smokey Mountain Gold, and our signature flavor, the Victory Lane Wings™. Our proprietary hot sauces include our Firestorm™ and our ultra-hot Dick’s Secret Sauce™. These sauces and seasonings can be blended to create more than 365 flavors. We also sell our proprietary Dick’s Secret Sauce and Firestorm sauces at our restaurants. Our sauces and seasonings complement and distinguish our chicken wings and other menu offerings to create a bold flavor profile for our customers. Other menu items that we offer include chicken tenders, quesadillas, specialty burgers and sandwiches, salads, wraps, flatbreads, and desserts.
Franchisees and Franchise Agreements
 
Our Dick’s Wings franchise program is designed to promote consistency and quality. We believe that it is important to maintain strong and open relationships with our franchisees. To this end, we invest a significant amount of time working with our franchisees on key aspects of the business, including products, equipment, operational improvements and standards, and management techniques. Franchisees are approved on the basis of their business background, evidence of restaurant management experience, net worth and capital available for investment in relation to the scope of the proposed business relationship. Franchisees can range in size from individuals owning a single restaurant to larger corporate entities owning several restaurants.

Franchisees are required to execute a franchise agreement containing a standard set of terms and conditions prior to opening a Dick’s Wings restaurant. Under our franchise agreement, we grant franchisees the right to operate restaurants using the “Dick’s Wings” trademarks, trade dress and other intellectual property within the Dick’s Wings system, which includes uniform operating procedures, standards for consistency and quality of products, technical knowledge, and procedures for accounting, inventory control and management. In return, franchisees supply capital, initially by paying a franchisee fee to us in the amount of $35,000, purchasing or leasing the building and land, and purchasing the equipment, signs, seating, inventories and supplies necessary for the operation of the restaurant, and, over the longer term, by reinvesting in the restaurant. Franchisees are required to make weekly royalty payments to us in an amount equal to five percent of the gross revenue they generate during the applicable week. They are also required to spend at least two percent of their gross revenue on local advertising and contribute at least one percent, but not more than two percent, of their gross revenue to our general advertising fund.
 
Our franchise agreements require that each franchised restaurant be operated in accordance with our defined operating procedures, adhere to the menu established by us, meet applicable quality, service, health and cleanliness standards, and comply with all applicable laws. We have the right to terminate a franchise agreement if the franchisee fails to pay us royalties, make contributions and expenditures for advertising, or otherwise operate and maintain its restaurant in accordance with the requirements of the agreement. Franchise agreements are not assignable by the franchisee without our consent, and we have a right of first refusal if a franchisee proposes to sell a restaurant. The initial term of the typical franchise agreement is 10 years with a 10-year renewal option for the franchisee, subject to conditions contained in the franchise agreement.
 
We also offer area development agreements pursuant to which we grant franchisees the right to open a specified number of Dick’s Wings restaurants within an exclusive development area in accordance with a specified development schedule. Our area development agreement establishes the number of restaurants that must be developed within a defined geographic area and the deadlines by which these restaurants must open. Franchisees that enter into an area development agreement pay us an initial franchise fee of $35,000 for the first restaurant and an area development fee determined by multiplying $15,000 by the number of additional restaurants to be opened in the area. Thereafter, franchisees pay us an initial franchise fee of $30,000 for each subsequent restaurant that they open, against which a credit in the amount of $15,000 is applied. The area development agreement can be terminated by us if, among other reasons, the area developer fails to open restaurants on schedule.
 
Fat Patty’s Concept
 
On August 30, 2018, we acquired Fat Patty’s. Our Fat Patty’s concept is comprised of four Fat Patty’s restaurants located in Ashland, Kentucky, and Hurricane, Huntington and Barboursville, West Virginia. The Huntington restaurant is located in the heart of Marshall University in Huntington, West Virginia, and is the original location of the Fat Patty’s brand.
 
Our Fat Patty’s restaurants are typically located in free standing units or end units in shopping centers, and range in size between 5,000 to 6,000 square feet of space. The restaurants are typically open on a daily basis from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. Monday through Saturday, and from 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. on Sunday, although closing times may vary depending on the day of the week and applicable regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages.

WingHouse Bar and Grill Concept
 
On October 11, 2019, we acquired WingHouse Bar & Grill. Our WingHouse concept is comprised of twenty WingHouse Bar & Grill restaurants located throughout the State of Florida.
 
Our WingHouse restaurants are typically located in free standing units or end units in shopping centers, and range in size between 5,000 to 8,000 square feet of space. The restaurants are typically open on a daily basis from 11 a.m. to 12 a.m. Sunday through Thursday, and from 11 a.m. to 1 a.m. on Saturday and Sunday, although closing times may vary depending on the day of the week and applicable regulations governing the sale of alcoholic beverages.
 
We feature The WingHouse Girl at every guest encounter. The WingHouse Girls, from the hostess to the bartender, set the tone of the unforgettable experience – the WingHouse experience. Our guests can go anywhere to get a chicken sandwich or a hamburger. Why the WingHouse? Because of “The WingHouse Girl!” Always upbeat, always saying “Hello!”. WingHouse Girls are friendly and courteous; they say “Hi!” and “Bye!” to every single guest. The music is always playing and inside our four walls there is a feeling of: forget your troubles and enjoy the fun!

Branding
 
We established our Dick’s Wings, Fat Patty’s, and WingHouse brands through coordinated marketing and operational execution that ensures brand recognition, quality and consistency throughout our concepts. These efforts include marketing programs and advertising to support our restaurants. We prominently feature our Dick’s Wings, Fat Patty’s, and WingHouse logos, bright colors, sports memorabilia, televisions and exterior trade dress at our restaurants and as branding for our marketing and advertising materials. Our brands are further strengthened by our emphasis on operational excellence supported by operating guidelines and employee training in our restaurants. We believe our brands have broad appeal because they attract customers of all ages and our menu offers a variety of distinctive items that allow customers to customize their experience, appealing to many tastes. Our distinctive concepts, combined with our high-quality food, make Dick’s Wings, WingHouse, and Fat Patty’s appealing to families, children, teenagers and adults of all ages and socio-economic backgrounds.
Site Selection
 
Our site selection process for our brands is integral to the successful execution of our growth strategy, and we devote significant effort to the investigation of new locations utilizing a variety of analytical techniques. The process begins with the selection of a proposed site by us or a franchisee. In the case of franchisees, the process is initiated by the franchisee submitting a site proposal package to us. Once the proposal is submitted to us, we review it to determine whether or not we will accept it. Criteria that we consider for our prospective sites and those of our franchisees include:

● | local market demographics, population density and psychographic profiles; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | occupancy rates and projected growth rates in the trade area; 
● | the location and performance of big box retailers and nationally branded peers; 
● | available square footage, parking and lease economics; 
● | local investment and operating costs; 
● | development and expansion constraints; 
● | vehicle traffic patterns, visibility and access; 
● | regional consumer trends and preferences; 
● | those characteristics that are similar to our most successful existing restaurants; and 
● | other quantitative and qualitative measures. 

 
The specific rate at which we and our franchisees are able to open new restaurants is determined, in part, by our and their success in locating satisfactory sites, negotiating acceptable lease or purchase terms, securing appropriate local governmental permits and approvals, and by our and their capacity to supervise construction and recruit and train management and hourly employees.
 
We periodically re-evaluate restaurant sites to ensure attributes have not deteriorated below our minimum acceptable standards. In the event site deterioration occurs with respect to one of our or our franchisee’s restaurants, we make a concerted effort to improve the restaurant’s performance by providing physical, operating and marketing enhancements unique to each restaurant’s situation. If efforts to restore the restaurant’s performance to acceptable minimum standards are unsuccessful, we consider relocation to a proximate, more desirable site, that will strengthen our presence in the applicable trade area or market. We also evaluate closing the restaurant if the brand’s measurement criteria, such as return on investment and area demographic trends, do not support relocation. Historically, restaurants that we have closed were generally performing below our standards or were near or at the expiration of their lease terms. Our strategic plan is targeted to support our long-term growth objectives, with a focus on continued development of those restaurant locations that have the greatest return potential for us and our shareholders.

Restaurant Atmosphere
 
We offer our Dick’s Wings, Fat Patty’s, and WingHouse customers a casual, environment designed to appeal to sports fans of all ages. Our restaurants have high-definition televisions located throughout the restaurants, making our restaurants an ideal gathering place for sports enthusiasts. We tailor the content and volume of our video and audio programming to reflect our customers’ tastes. Our Dick’s Wings restaurants also have a children’s area filled with video games and other forms of children’s entertainment that is visible from most of the tables in the restaurant, making our restaurants an ideal place for families to take their children. We believe the design of our restaurants enhances our customers’ experiences, drives repeat visits, and solidifies the broad appeal of our brand.
Operations
 
We believe that operational excellence is critical to our long-term success. We define operational excellence as an uncompromising attention to the details of our recipes, food preparation, cooking procedures, handling procedures, sanitation, cleanliness and safety. Our operations strategy is designed to drive best-in-class restaurant operations by us and our franchisees and improve friendliness, cleanliness, speed of service and overall customer satisfaction to drive long-term growth.
 
Our restaurants are required to be operated in accordance with uniform operating standards and specifications relating to the selection, handling and preparation of menu items, food quality and safety, signage, decor, equipment maintenance, cleanliness, uniforms, suppliers, facility standards, customer service and accounting controls. We and our franchisees utilize detailed operations manuals covering all aspects of our restaurant operations, as well as food and beverage manuals that detail the preparation procedures of our recipes. Each franchisee is required to furnish us with weekly sales and operating reports that assist us in monitoring the franchisee’s compliance with its franchise agreement. We make both announced and unannounced inspections of our restaurants to ensure that our practices and procedures are being followed. We systematically review the performance of our restaurants to ensure that each one meets our standards and conduct meetings with our franchisees to discuss the results of our reviews. When a restaurant falls below minimum standards, we conduct a thorough analysis to determine the causes, and implement marketing and operational plans to improve the restaurant’s performance. If the restaurant’s performance does not improve to acceptable levels, the restaurant is evaluated for relocation or closing.
 
An important aspect of our operating strategy is the efficient design, layout and execution of our kitchen operations. Due to the relatively simple preparation of our menu items, the kitchen consists of fryers, grills and food preparation stations that are arranged assembly-line style for maximum productivity. Given our menu and kitchen design, our kitchens are staffed with hourly employees who require only basic training before reaching full productivity. We do not require the added expense of an on-site chef. The ease and simplicity of our kitchen operations allows us to achieve our goal of preparing quality food with minimal wait times.
 
Training
 
Our training program is available to our employees as well as our franchisees and their employees. It offers food safety, quality assurance and other programs that are designed to ensure that our employees and our franchisees and their employees are trained in proper food handling techniques. Before a restaurant opens for business, each of our company-owned restaurant managers and franchisees must attend and successfully complete our training program. The training program is conducted in Jacksonville, Florida and lasts for between two and four weeks, unless we determine that additional training is needed. During our training program, we describe our philosophies and policies for administration, marketing, general manager tasks, operations by position, food preparation, set up and closing procedures, cleaning and sanitation, food borne illnesses and employee hygiene. We also utilize operation simulations. We offer customized instruction as needed and offer additional or refresher training courses from time to time. Our Dick’s Wings company-owned restaurant managers and franchisees are certified in comprehensive state-approved food safety and sanitation courses, such as ServSafe, developed by the National Restaurant Association.
Marketing and Advertising
 
We market our Dicks’ Wings restaurants as “Wingin’ it since 1994®” where both families and sports fans can go to have a unique and enjoyable restaurant experience from first bite to last call. We market our Fat Patty’s restaurants as places where both families and sports fans can enjoy a meal in a family friendly, sports-themed environment. The Fat Patty’s brand has become a staple in the communities in which it operates creating a cult-like following with its tag line, “Bite This” on a burger logo. WingHouse’s focus is on good food, served beautifully. Our marketing programs are designed to differentiate our Dick’s Wings, WingHouse, and Fat Patty’s restaurants from the restaurants of our competitors and showcase our food and brand in a family fun atmosphere. These efforts include marketing campaigns and advertising to support our restaurants. The primary goal of these efforts is to build brand awareness throughout the areas where we have restaurants located. Our marketing and advertising campaigns are also designed to: (i) support strong restaurant openings, (ii) drive positive same-store sales through additional visits by our existing customers and visits by new customers, (iii) increase average order size, and (iv) increase profit margins. Given our strategy to be a neighborhood destination, community marketing is key to driving sales and developing brand awareness in each market.

Our marketing strategy is fact-based, using consumer insights to build brand affinity and drive menu optimization. Local advertising is developed and implemented by us and our franchisees, and includes such events as live bands, car shows, pay-per-view television events and pool tournaments. System-wide marketing, advertising and promotions are developed and implemented by us. We pay directly for such activities with respect to our Fat Patty’s brand. We use our general advertising fund as well as our own funds to pay for such activities with respect to our Dick’s Wings brand. We implement periodic promotions as appropriate to maintain and increase the sales and profits of us and our franchisees and strengthen our brands. We also rely on outdoor billboard, direct mail and email advertising, as well as radio, newspapers, digital coupons, search engine marketing and social media such as Facebook and Twitter, as appropriate, to attract and retain customers for us and our franchisees. As part of our marketing strategy, we provide our company-owned restaurants and franchisees with advertising support and guidance to ensure that a consistent message is being delivered to the public.
 
Supply and Distribution
 
We strive to maintain high quality standards. In furtherance of this, we establish the standards and specifications for the products used in the development and operation of all of our restaurants and for the direct and indirect sources of most of those items. We also have the right to require, and generally do require, that our company-owned restaurants and franchisees purchase products and services only from manufacturers and suppliers that we approve and utilize distributors that we approve. For example, we have arranged for our Dick’s Wings and WingHouse company-owned restaurants and franchisees to purchase food, supplies and paper goods from Sysco and purchase soda beverages from The Coca-Cola Company. Fat Patty’s orders food, supplies, and paper goods from Gordon Foods. These requirements help us assure the quality and consistency of the products sold at our restaurants and help us protect and enhance the image of the Dick’s Wings, Fat Patty’s and WingHouse brands.
 
We provide detailed specifications to suppliers for our food ingredients, products and supplies. To maximize our purchasing efficiencies and obtain the lowest possible prices for our ingredients, products and supplies, we negotiate prices based on system-wide usage of these items by our restaurants. Suppliers are chosen based upon their ability to provide competitive pricing, a continuous supply of product that meets all safety and quality specifications, logistics expertise and freight management, customer service, and transparency of business relationships. We have not experienced any significant continuous shortages of supplies, and believe that competitively priced, high quality alternative suppliers are available should the need arise. We do not utilize the services of any purchasing or distribution cooperatives.
 
Information Technology
 
All of our restaurants are equipped with a computerized point-of-sale system. Our point-of-sale systems provide effective communication between the kitchen and the server, allowing employees to serve customers in a quick and consistent manner while maintaining a high level of control. Our point-of-sale systems include a back-office system that has the capability to provide support for inventory, payroll, accounting, accounts payable, cash management and management reporting functions. They also help dispatch and monitor delivery activities in our restaurants. Our point-of-sale systems provide us with the ability to generate weekly and period- to-date operating results on a company-wide, brand-wide, regional or individual restaurant basis. This enables us to closely monitor sales, food and beverage costs, and labor and operating expenses at each of our restaurants. Our point-of-sale systems run on non- proprietary hardware with open architecture and offers intuitive touch screen interface and integrated credit and gift card processing.
 
We intend to implement additional technology-enabled business solutions in the future targeted at improved financial control, cost management, enhanced customer service and improved employee effectiveness. These solutions will be designed to be used across all of our restaurants and brands. Our strategy is to fully integrate the systems to drive operational efficiencies and enable our employees and franchisees to focus on restaurant operations excellence.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We own U.S. registered trademarks for many of the logos, designs and expressions that identify the products and services that we use in our business, including “Dick’s Wings.” “Dick’s Wings & Grill”, “Fat Patty’s” and “WingHouse”. We also have common law trademark rights for certain of our proprietary marks. We believe that our trademarks have significant value and are important to our business. Our policy is to pursue registration of our important trademarks whenever feasible and to oppose vigorously any infringement of our trademarks. Under current law and with proper use and registration, our rights in our trademarks will generally last indefinitely. The use of these trademarks by our franchisees has been authorized in our franchise agreements.

-


We may rely, and in some circumstances do rely, on trade secrets and common law rights to protect our intellectual property. We have established the standards and specifications for most of the goods and services used in the development, improvement and operation of our restaurants. These proprietary standards, specifications and restaurant operating procedures are trade secrets owned by us. We protect our trade secrets and proprietary information, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees and franchisees and have included confidentiality provisions in our franchise agreements. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary information by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Notwithstanding these protective measures, trade secrets and proprietary rights can be difficult to enforce. While we have confidence in the protective measures that we have implemented, our agreements and security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach.
 
Competition
 
The restaurant industry is fragmented and intensely competitive. Dick’s Wings and WingHouse compete directly with Buffalo Wild Wings, East Coast Wings & Grill, Hooters, Hurricane Grill & Wings, Wings ‘N More, Wings N’ Things, Wingstop and other restaurants offering chicken wings as one of their primary food offerings. Fat Patty’s competes directly with gourmet burger restaurants and other restaurants offering burgers as one of their primary food offerings. Dick’s Wings and Fat Patty’s also compete with local and regional sports bars and national casual dining establishments, and to a lesser extent with quick service restaurants such as wing-based and burger-based take-out concepts. Furthermore, because the restaurant industry has few barriers to entry, new competitors may emerge at any time. Dick’s Wings and Fat Patty’s compete with other restaurants and retail establishments on the basis of taste, quality and price of food offered, menu offering, perceived value, service, atmosphere, location and overall dining experience. They also compete with other restaurants and retail establishments for qualified franchisees, site locations and employees to work in our restaurants.
 
Many of our direct and indirect competitors are well-established national, regional and local restaurant chains that have been in business longer than we have, have greater consumer awareness than we do, and have substantially greater capital, marketing and human resources than we do. Many of our competitors also have greater influence over their respective restaurant systems than we do because of their significantly higher percentage of company-owned restaurants and/or ownership of franchise real estate, giving them a greater ability to implement operational initiatives and business strategies. Some of our competitors are local restaurants that, in some cases, have a loyal customer base and strong brand recognition within a particular market. As our competitors expand their operations and as new competitors enter the industry, we expect competition to intensify. Increased competition could result in price reductions, decreases in profitability and loss of market share by us and our franchisees. In the event we are unable to compete successfully with our current and future competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.
 
Government Regulation
 
The restaurant industry is subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to health, safety, sanitation, and building and fire codes, including compliance with applicable zoning, land use and environmental laws and regulations. We and our franchisees are required to obtain various permits and licenses to comply with some of these laws and regulations. Difficulties experienced by us or our franchisees in obtaining, or the failure by us or our franchisees to obtain, required licenses or approvals could delay or prevent the development of a new restaurant in a particular area. Difficulties experienced by us or our franchisees in renewing, or the failure by us or our franchisees to maintain, required licenses or approvals could result in the restaurant being shut down temporarily or permanently by the applicable government agency. We have implemented policies, procedures and training to help ensure that our employees and franchisees comply with these laws and regulations.
 
Our restaurants are subject to licensing and regulation by federal, state and local departments relating to alcoholic beverages. We and our franchisees must obtain appropriate licenses from regulatory authorities allowing them to sell liquor, beer and wine at our restaurants. These licenses must be renewed annually and may be suspended or revoked at any time. In addition, alcoholic beverage control regulations affect many aspects of our restaurant operations, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, trade practices, wholesale purchasing, inventory control, and the handling, storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. We and our franchisees may also be subject in certain states to “dram-shop” statutes, which generally allow a person injured by an intoxicated person to recover damages from an establishment that wrongfully served alcoholic beverages to the intoxicated person.

We and our franchisees are subject to federal and state employment laws and regulations, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act and the Immigration Reform and Control Act. These laws and regulations govern such matters as wage and hour requirements, workers’ compensation insurance, unemployment and other taxes, working and safety conditions, and citizenship and immigration status. A significant number of our and our franchisees’ service, food preparation and other employees are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage, which is currently $7.25 per hour, and state minimum wages. The amount that we and our franchisees must pay these employees is influenced by the tip credit allowance, which is the amount that an employer is permitted to assume an employee receives in tips when the employer calculates the employee’s hourly wage for minimum wage compliance purposes. Increases in the federal minimum wage, directly or by either a decrease in the tip credit amount or an insufficient increase in the tip credit amount to match an increase in the federal minimum wage, would increase labor costs for us and our franchisees. In addition, employee claims based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, wage and hour requirements, and payments to employees who receive gratuities, may divert financial and management resources and adversely affect our operations or those of our franchisees.
 
We and our franchisees must comply with applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act and related state laws. Under the Americans with Disabilities Act and related state laws, we and our franchisees must provide equivalent service to disabled persons and make reasonable accommodation for their employment, and when constructing or undertaking significant re modeling of our restaurants, we must make those facilities accessible to disabled persons. We and our franchisees must also comply with other anti-discrimination laws and regulations, such as the Civil Rights Act and the Age Discrimination Act, which mandate that people be dealt with on an equal basis regardless of such personal traits as sex, age, race, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation and gender identity.
 
Our franchising activities are subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission (the “FTC”) as well as the rules and regulations of the states in which we operate. The FTC’s “Franchise Rule” and other federal and state laws regulate the sale of franchises, require registration of a franchise disclosure document with state authorities, and require the delivery of a franchise disclosure document to prospective franchisees. These state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non- competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise, and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply.
 
The operation of our restaurants is subject to laws and regulations relating to nutritional content, nutritional labeling, product safety, menu labeling and other regulations imposed by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), including the Food Safety Modernization Act. Regulations relating to nutritional labeling may lead to increased operational complexity and expenses and may negatively impact sales by us and our franchisees.
 
We and our franchisees are also subject to laws relating to information security, privacy, cashless payments and consumer credit, protection and fraud. An increasing number of government agencies and industry groups have established data privacy laws and standards for the protection of personal information, including social security numbers and financial information.
 
Environmental Matters
 
We and our franchisees are subject to various federal, state and local environmental regulations, and increasing focus by U.S. governmental authorities on environmental matters is likely to lead to new governmental initiatives. Various laws concerning the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and restaurant waste and the operation of restaurants in environmentally sensitive locations may impact aspects of our and our franchisees’ operations. To the extent these initiatives cause an increase in supply or distribution costs for us or our franchisees, they may impact our business both directly and indirectly. However, we do not expect compliance with applicable environmental regulations to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, financial condition, results of operations, or competitive position.
Seasonality
 
We do not consider our business to be seasonal to any material degree.
 
Employees
 
We currently have a total of 1,192 employees. Of this number, 27 full-time employees and 157 part-time employees work in our Fat Patty’s restaurants, 1 full-time employees and 22 part-time employees work in our Tilted Kilt restaurant, and 95 full-time employees and 872 part-time employees work in our Dick’s Wings and WingHouse restaurants. The remaining 18 employees, which were full-time employees, work in our corporate office. Our franchisees are independent business owners, so their employees are not employees of ours and, therefore, are not included in our employee count. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we have never experienced a work stoppage. We believe that our working conditions and compensation packages are competitive and that our relations with our employees are good.

Growth Strategy
 
We are committed to strategies and initiatives that we believe are centered on growing long-term sales, increasing profits, enhancing the customer experience and engaging our franchisees and employees. These strategies are intended to differentiate our brands from the competition, reduce the costs associated with managing our restaurants, and establish a strong presence for our brands in key markets across the country.
 
Our plan is to grow our company into a diversified restaurant holding company operating a portfolio of premium restaurant brands. We intend to focus on developing brands that offer a variety of high-quality food and beverages in a distinctive, casual, high- energy atmosphere in a diverse set of markets across the United States.
 
The first major component of our growth strategy is the continued development and expansion of our Dick’s Wings, Fat Patty’s and WingHouse brands. Key elements of our strategy include strengthening the brands, developing new menu items, lowering our costs, improving our operations and service, driving customer satisfaction, and opening new restaurants in new and existing markets in the United States. We believe there are meaningful opportunities to grow the number of Dick’s Wings, Fat Patty’s and WingHouse restaurants in the United States and have implemented a rigorous and disciplined approach to increasing the number of company-owned and franchised restaurants. In our existing markets, we plan to continue to open new restaurants until a market is penetrated to a point that will enable us to gain marketing, operational, cost and other efficiencies. In new markets, we plan to open several restaurants at a time to quickly build brand awareness.
 
The other major component of our growth strategy is the acquisition of controlling and non-controlling financial interests in other restaurant brands offering us product and geographic diversification, like our acquisition of Fat Patty’s and WingHouse. We plan to complete, and are actively seeking, potential mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures and other strategic initiatives through which we can acquire or develop additional restaurant brands. We are seeking brands offering proprietary menu items that emphasize the preparation of food with high quality ingredients, as well as unique recipes and special seasonings to provide appealing, tasty, convenient and attractive food at competitive prices. As we acquire complementary brands, we intend to develop a scalable infrastructure that will help us expand our margins as we execute upon our growth strategy. Benefits of this infrastructure may include centralized support services for all of our brands, including marketing, menu development, human resources, legal, accounting and information systems. Additional benefits may include the ability to cost effectively employ advertising and marketing agencies for all of our brands, and efficiencies associated with being able to utilize a single distribution model for all of our restaurants. Accordingly, this structure should enable us to leverage our scale and share best practices across key functional areas that are common to all of our brands.
 
Recent Developments
 
Acquisition of Fat Patty’s
 
On August 3, 2018, we entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire all of the assets associated with Fat Patty’s (the “Fat Patty’s Acquisition”). On August 30, 2018, we completed the Fat Patty’s Acquisition. We agreed to pay the sellers $12,352,000, of which $12,000,000 was paid at closing, $40,000 was paid in September 2018, and the remaining $312,000 was to be paid on the first anniversary of the closing date but the Company did not have the available cash to pay so this amount was settled by Seenu Kasturi directly for $312,000. The Company now owes Seenu Kasturi $312,000 for this payment.
 
In connection with the Fat Patty’s Acquisition, on August 30, 2018, we issued a secured convertible promissory note (the “Fat Patty’s Note”) to Seenu G. Kasturi, who is our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer and Chairman of our Board of Directors, pursuant to which we borrowed $622,929 to finance the Fat Patty’s Acquisition. All principal and accrued but unpaid interest is due and payable in full on the earlier of: (i) the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date of the Fat Patty’s Note, or (ii) the date that Mr. Kasturi demands repayment in full by providing written notice thereof to us. Interest accrues at the rate of 6% per annum and is payable in full on the maturity date. Mr. Kasturi has the right, at any time during the term of the Fat Patty’s Note and from time to time, to convert all of any portion of the outstanding principal of the Fat Patty’s Note, together with accrued and unpaid interest payable thereon, into shares of our Class A common stock at a conversion rate of $1.36 per share. Mr. Kasturi has not converted any of this note. The Fat Patty’s Note is secured by all of our assets.
 
On August 3, 2018, we also entered into a purchase and sale agreement with Store Capital Acquisitions, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Store Capital”), pursuant to which we agreed to sell all of the real property acquired in the Fat Patty’s Acquisition to Store Capital. On August 30, 2018, we completed our sale of all of the real property acquired in the Fat Patty’s acquisition to Store Capital for a purchase price of $11,500,000. In connection with the sale, we entered into a master lease agreement with Store Capital pursuant to which we leased the four properties upon which the restaurants acquired in the asset acquisition are located (collectively, “Properties”). The initial term of the lease expires on August 31, 2038. We have the option to extend the term of the lease for four additional successive periods of five years each. The aggregate initial base annual rent is $876,875 and is subject to annual increases commencing September 1, 2019, in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) 1.75%, or (ii) 1.25 times the change in the Consumer Price Index. We are responsible for all costs and obligations relating to the Properties.

Acquisition of WingHouse
 
On October 11, 2019, the Company and ARC WingHouse, LLC, a Florida limited liability company that was formed as a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (“ARC WingHouse”), entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Asset Purchase Agreement”) with Soaring Wings, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“Soaring Wings”), Soaring Wings HQ, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“Soaring Wings HQ”), Soaring Wings Advertising, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“Soaring Wings Advertising”), Soaring Wings IP, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“Soaring Wings IP”), and the wholly-owned subsidiaries of Soaring Wings that own and operate all of the Restaurants (as defined below) (the “WH Operating Entities”). Soaring Wings, Soaring Wings HQ, Soaring Wings Advertising, Soaring Wings IP and the WH Operating Entities are sometimes collectively referred to as the “Sellers” and each a “Seller”. The Company and ARC WingHouse are sometimes collectively referred to as the “Purchasers”. The transactions contemplated by the Asset Purchase Agreement are sometimes referred to herein collectively as the “WingHouse Acquisition”. The closing of the WingHouse Acquisition occurred on October 11, 2019 (the “Closing Date”).
 
Sellers were the owners and operators of the WingHouse Bar and Grill restaurant concept (the “WingHouse Concept”), which is comprised of 24 WingHouse Bar and Grill restaurants (the “Restaurants”). Purchasers agreed to pay the Sellers a total of $18,000,000 as adjusted pursuant to a working capital adjustment (the “Purchase Price”), and to assume, satisfy and discharge certain assumed liabilities. On the Closing Date, ARC WingHouse paid $12,000,000 to the Sellers. In addition, ARC WingHouse delivered to SW WH Holdings, LLC, a Florida limited liability company (“SW WH Holdings”), an equity interest in ARC WingHouse of ten percent (10%) ownership interest in ARC WingHouse (the “Equity Interest”). The Company also agreed to deliver to Soaring Wings shares (the “ARC Stock”) of the Company’s common stock on each of the first three anniversaries of the Closing Date. The number of shares of common stock to be delivered on each anniversary will be equal to the quotient of $1,000,000 divided by the following per share prices: (i) $1.40 per share of common stock on the first anniversary, (ii) 2.00 per share of common stock on the second anniversary, and (iii) $3.00 per share of common stock on the third anniversary (collectively, the “ARC Stock Consideration”). The per share price of the ARC Stock Consideration will be equitably adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, reverse stock split or recapitalization. If the ARC Stock is not listed and quoted for trading on the NYSE, NASDAQ Global Select Market, NASDAQ Global Market or NASDAQ Capital Market on any of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Closing (the first such anniversary referred to as a “Listing Failure Anniversary”), then ARC WingHouse will pay $1,000,000 cash to Soaring Wings on the Listing Failure Anniversary and each anniversary of the Closing after a Listing Failure Anniversary (if any), ending on the third anniversary of the Closing Date in full satisfaction of the Company’s obligation to deliver the ARC Stock Consideration to Soaring Wings on the Listing Failure Anniversary and each anniversary thereafter, ending on the 3rd anniversary (the “Contingent Cash Consideration”). Notwithstanding the existence of a Listing Failure Anniversary, Soaring Wings may, in its sole discretion, elect to receive ARC Stock on the Listing Failure Anniversary and/or any anniversary after the Listing Failure Anniversary in lieu of a $1,000,000 cash payment by providing ARC WingHouse with written notice no less than 30 days before the Listing Failure Anniversary or subsequent anniversary, as applicable. The ARC Stock Consideration is subject to the terms of a Put Agreement (as defined below), and Sellers were granted customary piggy-back registration rights with respect to the ARC Stock Consideration.
 
In connection therewith, on October 11, 2019, the Purchasers entered into a Put Agreement (the “Put Agreement”; together with the Asset Purchase Agreement, the “Purchase Agreements”) with Soaring Wings pursuant to which Soaring Wings was granted the right, but not the obligation, upon written notice to the Purchasers given at any time before the Put Deadline (as defined below), to require the Company to purchase, for cash, at the Put Closing (as defined below), all or any portion of the shares of ARC Stock received by Soaring Wings under Section 1.2(c) of the Asset Purchase Agreement or Section 15 of the Put Agreement (the “Put Option”). In the event Soaring Wings receives ARC Stock pursuant to Section 1.2(c) of the Asset Purchase Agreement and puts all of such ARC Stock to the Company, then the amount payable by the Company to Soaring Wings at the Put Closing will be equal to the Put Price (as defined below). In the event Soaring Wings elects to put only a portion of such shares to the Company, either because Soaring Wings received Contingent Cash Consideration on one or more of such anniversaries, Soaring Wings sold some of the ARC Stock, Soaring Wings elected to retain some of the ARC Stock and put only a portion of the ARC Stock to the Company, and/or for any other reason, then the amount payable by the Company to Soaring Wings at the Put Closing will be calculated in the following manner: (x) the Put Price, multiplied by (y) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of shares of ARC Stock put to the Company by Soaring Wings hereunder, and the denominator of which is the number of shares of ARC Stock received by Soaring Wings under the Asset Purchase Agreement had Soaring Wings received ARC Stock on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the Closing Date. The amount payable by the Company to Soaring Wings at the Put Closing is referred to herein as, the “Put Payment”. In the event that Soaring Wings receives the Put Price from Purchasers, then, without any action on the part of the Purchasers, SW WH Holdings or any other person, the Equity Interest will be immediately terminated and forfeited to ARC WingHouse and no longer be owned beneficially or of record by SW WH Holdings. The material portions of the note are as follows:
 
“For the purposes hereof, “Put Price” means an amount equal to: (i) $6,000,000, less (ii) the aggregate dividends (if any) received by Soaring Wings from the Company attributable to any shares of ARC Stock received by Soaring Wings under Section 1.2(c) of the Asset Purchase Agreement and not required to be paid to City National Bank (as defined below) pursuant to that certain Subordination Agreement, dated October 11, 2019, by ARC WingHouse and Soaring Wings for the benefit of City National Bank (the “Subordination Agreement”), less (iii) the aggregate distributions (other than tax distributions) made by ARC WingHouse to Soaring Wings under its operating agreement that are not required to be paid to City National Bank pursuant to the Subordination Agreement, less (iv) the aggregate cash payments made by Purchaser to Soaring Wings following a Listing Failure Anniversary pursuant to Section 1.2(c) of the Asset Purchase Agreement that are not required to be paid to City National Bank pursuant to the Subordination Agreement (and for the avoidance of doubt, were not applied to satisfy losses pursuant to Section 7.9(b) under the Asset Purchase Agreement), less (v) the aggregate amount of losses satisfied by Sellers to Purchasers or their indemnitees pursuant to Sections 7.9(a), (b) and (c) under the Asset Purchase Agreement that are not required to be paid to City National Bank pursuant to the Subordination Agreement.

“For the purposes hereof, “Put Deadline” means the later of (y) the fifth anniversary of the Closing Date and (z) 12 months following the date on which the Company provides written notice to Soaring Wings that: (i) it has indefeasibly paid and satisfied in full the Loan (as defined below), (ii) Soaring Wings is not restricted from exercising its rights under this Agreement (in whole or in part) pursuant to the Subordination Agreement, or otherwise, and (iii) the Company has legally sufficient funds to pay the Put Payment in full.”
 
In connection with the closing of the WingHouse Acquisition, Seenu G. Kasturi executed a guaranty in favor of Soaring Wings guaranteeing all of the Purchasers’ obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Put Agreement, and the SW Note (as defined below).
 
On October 11, 2019, ARC WingHouse entered into a Loan Agreement (the “Loan Agreement”) with City National Bank of Florida (“City National Bank”) pursuant to which the Company borrowed $12,250,000 (the “Loan”) to help fund the acquisition of the WingHouse Concept. In connection therewith, ARC WingHouse issued a promissory note in favor of City National Bank in the amount of $12,250,000 (the “CNB Note”). Interest accrues under the CNB Note at a rate of six percent (6%) per annum. The Company makes monthly payments of principal and interest of $179,481 to City National Bank under the CNB Note. The entire outstanding principal balance of the CNB Note plus all accrued interest is due and payable in full on October 11, 2024.
 
ARC WingHouse may make prepayments of principal under the CNB Note, provided, however, that (i) if ARC WingHouse prepays any portion of the outstanding balance of the CNB Note during the first year of the term of the CNB Note, ARC WingHouse will pay a fee to City National Bank in an amount equal to three percent (3%) of the amount prepaid by ARC WingHouse in excess of $2,250,000, (ii) if ARC WingHouse prepays any portion of the outstanding balance of the CNB Note during the second year of the term of the CNB Note, ARC WingHouse will pay to City National Bank a fee in an amount equal to two percent (2%) of the amount prepaid by ARC WingHouse, and (iii) if ARC WingHouse prepays any portion of the outstanding balance of the CNB Note during the third (3rd) year of the term of the CNB Note, ARC WingHouse will pay to City National Bank a fee in an amount equal to one percent (1%) of the amount prepaid by ARC WingHouse. Thereafter, ARC WingHouse may make prepayments of principal under the CNB Note without penalty or premium.
 
ARC WingHouse deposited $1,250,000 with City National Bank WingHouse in an account that is under the sole control of City National Bank (the “First ARCWH Deposit”). ARC WingHouse granted a security interest to City National Bank in the account and the funds held therein as security for the loan. In connection therewith, to secure the funds for the First ARCWH Deposit, ARC WingHouse issued a promissory note in favor of the Kasturi Children’s Trust, a trust formed under the laws of Louisiana (the “Kasturi Children’s Trust”), in the amount of $1,250,000 (the “KCT Note”) pursuant to which ARC WingHouse borrowed the funds comprising the First ARCWH Deposit. Interest accrues under the KCT Note at a rate of six percent (6%) per annum. The entire outstanding principal balance of the KCT Note plus all accrued interest is due and payable in full on the earlier of (i) the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date of the KCT Note, and (ii) the date that the Kasturi Children’s Trust demands repaying in full by providing written notice thereof to ARC WingHouse. The KCT Note is secured by all of the assets of ARC WingHouse. City National Bank will return the funds to Seenu G. Kasturi, as guarantor for the CNB Note, in the event ARC WingHouse contributes a like amount of funds to City National Bank. City National Bank will return all funds held in the account to Mr. Kasturi or ARC WingHouse, as applicable, upon repayment of the loan by ARC WingHouse.
 
In addition, ARC WingHouse deposited $1,000,000 with City National Bank in an account that is under the sole control of City National Bank (the “Second ARCWH Deposit”). ARC WingHouse granted a security interest to City National Bank in the account and the funds held therein as security for the loan. In connection therewith, to secure the funds for the Second ARCWH Deposit, ARC WingHouse issued a promissory note in favor of Soaring Wings in the amount of $1,000,000 (the “SW Note”) pursuant to which ARC WingHouse borrowed the funds comprising the Second ARCWH Deposit. Interest accrues under the SW Note at a rate of five percent (5%) per annum. The entire outstanding principal balance of the SW Note plus all accrued interest is due and payable in full on the earliest to occur of: (i) the first anniversary of the date of the SW Note, (ii) the merger or sale of substantially all the membership interest or assets of ARC WingHouse, and (iii) the liquidation, dissolution or winding up of ARC WingHouse. After April 11, 2020, but no sooner than City National Bank receives ARC WingHouse’s audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019 and ARC WingHouse’s quarterly financial statements for the quarter end March 30, 2020, so long as ARC WingHouse is in compliance with the financial covenants contained in the Loan Agreement and no event of default has occurred, City National Bank, upon the request of ARC WingHouse, will disburse certain amounts to pay down the SW Note.

The CNB Note is secured, in part, by that that certain Security Agreement, dated October 11, 2019, executed by ARC WingHouse in favor of City National Bank (as the same may be amended or modified from time to time, the “Security Agreement”), granting City National Bank a lien and security interest in and to all assets owned by ARC WingHouse. In addition, the Company entered into a Negative Pledge Agreement, dated October 11, 2019, pursuant to which the Company agreed not to: (i) sell, transfer, assign or lease any of its assets, except for the transfer or sale of assets in the ordinary course of business for at least equal consideration, (ii) create, incur, assume or suffer to exist certain types of liens on its assets, (iii) enter into any agreement with any person other than City National Bank which prohibits or limits the ability of the Company to create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any security interest, mortgage, pledge, lien or other encumbrance upon any of its assets, and (iv) create, incur, assume or suffer to exist certain types of indebtedness.
 
In connection with the completion of the Loan, Seenu G. Kasturi executed a guaranty in favor of City National Bank guaranteeing all of ARC WingHouse’s obligations under the CNB Note, the Loan Agreement and the other loan documents executed in connection therewith.
 
On October 11, 2019, ARC WingHouse entered into an agreement (the “WH Assignment Agreement”) with Soaring Wings and Store Master Funding IX, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“Store Master Funding”), pursuant to which Soaring Wings assigned all of its rights and obligations under that certain master lease agreement, dated January 31, 2017 between Store Master Funding and Soaring Wings (the “WH Master Lease”) to ARC WingHouse. Under the WH Master Lease, ARC WingHouse leased properties from Store Master Funding upon which 14 restaurants acquired in the WingHouse Acquisition are located (collectively, the “WH Properties”). The initial term of the lease expires on January 31, 2032. The Company has the option to extend the term of the lease for four additional successive periods of five years each. The aggregate base annual rent is $2,041,848 and is subject to increases commencing February 1, 2022 and every five years thereafter in an amount equal to the lesser of: (i) 10%, or (ii) 1.3 times the change in the Consumer Price Index. The Company is responsible for all costs and obligations relating to the WH Properties.
