Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage precision oncology company focused on the discovery, design and development of small molecule kinase inhibitors for difficult-to-treat, genomically defined cancers. Our mission is to inspire hope for those battling cancer by expanding on the promise of targeted therapies. Our Kinnate Discovery Engine, which starts with the identification of an unmet need among validated oncogenic drivers, utilizes our deep expertise in medicinal chemistry and structure-based design, and the tailored ecosystems of our partners to develop our targeted therapies. We focus our discovery and development efforts on three patient populations: (1) those with cancers that harbor known oncogenic drivers (gene alterations that cause cancers) with no currently available targeted therapies, (2) those with genomically well-characterized tumors that have intrinsic resistance to currently available treatments (non-responders), and (3) those whose tumors have acquired resistance over the course of therapy to currently available treatments. Our Kinnate Discovery Engine, together with a biomarker-driven approach to our drug development strategy, our continual translational research and early global expansion in development, may enable us to develop drugs with an increased probability of clinical success while reducing the cost and risk of drug development.
 
Our lead product candidate is exarafenib (KIN-2787), which is a Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (RAF) inhibitor in development for the treatment of patients with lung cancer, melanoma and other solid tumors. Unlike currently available treatments that target only B-Rapidly Accelerated Fibrosarcoma (BRAF) kinase Class I alterations, we have designed exarafenib to target BRAF Class II and Class III alterations, where it would be a first-line targeted therapy, in addition to covering BRAF Class I alterations. In April 2021, we filed an Investigational New Drug application (IND) for exarafenib with the FDA. In May 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for exarafenib and we initiated KN-8701, a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating exarafenib. We began dosing exarafenib in humans in the second half of 2021. In 2022, we announced the addition of patients with NRAS mutant melanoma into KN-8701 both in monotherapy and in combination with a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK) inhibitor binimetinib. KN-8701 is currently ongoing. We anticipate disclosing exarafenib monotherapy and combination dose escalation data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2023. In the first quarter of 2023, we announced that we initiated enrollment of patients into the monotherapy dose expansion cohorts of KN-8701.
 
Our second product candidate is KIN-3248, a Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptors (FGFR) inhibitor, designed for the treatment of patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC), a cancer of the bile ducts in the liver, and urothelial carcinoma (UC), a cancer of the bladder lining, as well as other solid tumors. KIN-3248 is designed to address clinically observed kinase domain mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 that drive resistance to current therapies. In January 2022, the FDA cleared our IND for KIN-3248 and we initiated KN-4802, a Phase 1 clinical trial evaluating KIN-3248, in the first quarter of 2022. KIN-3248 has demonstrated proof of concept in preclinical models showing activity across both initial FGFR 2/3 genomic alterations and a broad range of common resistant variants that arise from first generation FGFR 2/3 targeted therapies. We anticipate initial dose escalation data from the ongoing KN-4802 clinical trial in the second half of 2023.
 
We are also advancing other small molecule research programs, including a Cyclin-Dependent Kinase 12 (CDK12) inhibitor in our KIN004 program for the treatment of ovarian carcinoma (OC), triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) and metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).
 
 In February 2023, we announced that we acquired the ownership stake of Kinnjiu Biopharma Inc. (Kinnjiu), the China joint venture that we established in May 2021, previously held by the Series A investors for $24.0 million, using a combination of $9.1 million in cash and 2.2 million shares of common stock of Kinnate. We retain Kinnjiu’s cash, intellectual property and other assets, including key personnel and its legal entity structure. The transaction gives Kinnate greater control over its clinical development programs in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan. Kinnjiu is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of Kinnate. 
 
Precision medicine is predicated on the relationship between genomic alterations, protein dysfunctions and diseases, and aims to specifically and potently drug genomically validated target proteins (i.e., genomic variants potentially implicated in the biology of disease) while minimizing side effects. As genomic profiling of cancer patients becomes more commonplace, it is becoming increasingly clear that cancers developing in various sites throughout the body may share the same type of genomic alterations. As such, tumors may be identified and treated according to their distinctive genomic alterations, rather than focusing on simply the tissue of origin. Both research and clinical data suggest that some tumors, while having multiple identifiable genomic alterations, are primarily dependent on an aberrantly activated kinase for their proliferation and survival. Kinases, which are cellular enzymes that regulate the biological activity of proteins through a ubiquitous process known as phosphorylation, play a central role in the formation and metastatic spread of many cancers and therefore are the focus of our drug development efforts. Kinase inhibition is a proven approach to fighting cancer, and for two decades, has addressed an increasing number of oncology indications. Mutated kinases can result in deregulated activity that results in cancerous cell proliferation. Currently-approved drugs that inhibit the activity of mutated oncogenic kinases (kinase inhibitors) have demonstrated significant clinical benefit to hundreds of thousands of patients with cancer globally.
 



The worldwide sales of small molecule kinase inhibitors in oncology were reported to be $23 billion in 2019 and are estimated to grow to more than $50 billion in 2024. However, because of the limitations of currently-approved drugs, it is estimated that only 10% of all patients with advanced or metastatic cancer today are eligible for these treatments. This low penetration of targeted therapies demonstrates a substantial unmet patient need and market opportunity. In the current RAF inhibitor landscape, no targeted therapies have been approved for BRAF Class II or Class III alteration-driven cancers. In the current FGFR inhibitor landscape, approved and clinical-phase FGFR inhibitors provide benefit, but the duration of response (DoR) of such inhibitors is limited due to acquired mutational resistance. Taken together, this represents a substantial opportunity for developing novel and potentially transformative drugs for underserved patient populations with difficult-to-treat, genomically defined cancers.
 
Our Approach
 Our Kinnate Discovery Engine leverages our team’s significant industry expertise to drive toward accelerated clinical development, regulatory review, and ultimately, potential new drug approval.
 
We are led by a management team of precision oncology experts with decades of collective experience in the discovery, development and commercialization of novel therapeutics who have held leadership positions at top global oncology companies: Amgen Inc., Merck & Co., Novartis AG, and Pfizer Inc. This expertise extends to our established collaborations with leaders at experienced precision medicine cancer centers and research institutions.
 
We believe our expertise and the foundational principles driving our Kinnate Discovery Engine and our focused drug development strategy offer an opportunity to identify and develop precision medicine solutions for populations that are currently underserved. Since our inception in 2018, our Kinnate Discovery Engine has led to the design of two  product candidates now in Phase 1 clinical trials, exarafenib and KIN-3248, and is generating multiple additional research programs, with a goal to have one IND a year.
 
Our Kinnate Discovery Engine encompasses:
 
1 | Identifying Unmet Need in Validated Oncogenic Drivers. Our relationships with prominent academic centers provide insight into the drug targets that are validated oncogenic drivers, along with innate or acquired resistance and new patient populations that represent the unmet need. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2 | Deep Medicinal Chemistry Expertise. Through our internal expertise in structure based small molecule drug discovery, deep understanding of binding modes and biology, we identify compounds that have the potential to achieve a best-in-class product profile spanning alteration coverage including resistance mutations, selectivity, and pharmaceutical properties. For example, the proprietary co-crystal structure of exarafenib in the BRAF protein developed by our team has demonstrated what we believe is a unique and highly selective BRAF inhibitor. 
3 | Leveraging Tailored Ecosystem of Partners. We leverage an ecosystem of commercial and academic partners to provide scale to our discovery efforts. For example, we have a range of 35-70 medicinal chemists at contract research organizations (CROs) working on our pipeline and sponsored research agreements (SRAs) with prominent academic centers to advance the development of our targeted therapies. Further, we leverage a range of relevant technologies such as bioinformatics, crystallography, organoid and xenograft models for discovery and translational research.

Our Drug Development Strategy
 
Our drug development strategy begins with a biomarker-driven approach and is paired with continual translational research and early global expansion. We are focused on the oncogenic driver as the biomarker and enriching for patient populations with the highest likelihood of response. We believe in continued investment in translational research throughout drug development to help identify new patient populations, responsive subsets and resistance mechanisms. For example, our collaborations with leaders at experienced precision medicine cancer centers enable us to perform extensive cellular testing in BRAF Class II and Class III alterations, including BRAF fusions and indels, and in profiling compounds in FGFR2 fusion-driven cancer cells that mimic secondary resistance mutations found in specific populations of patients. Together, these translational research programs have allowed us to develop a deep understanding of specific pathways and accelerate the progression of our programs into seminal cellular screening and in vivo efficacy studies. We are focused on expanding our clinical trials globally early in development.
Our Programs
 
We are currently advancing two clinical programs, exarafenib and KIN-3248. We are also advancing a number of other small molecule research programs, including a CDK12 inhibitor. We currently own worldwide development and commercial rights for all our programs. Our pipeline for our previously disclosed programs is summarized in Figure 2 below.
Figure 2: Advancing Multiple Ongoing Programs with Single Agent and Combination Opportunities
 
RAF Program: Exarafenib
 
In our most advanced program, we are developing exarafenib, a small molecule kinase inhibitor targeting specific classes of BRAF kinase alterations (BRAF Class II and Class III alterations) that characterize subsets of lung cancer, melanoma and other solid tumors. No targeted therapies are approved for BRAF Class II or Class III alteration-driven cancers, unlike the BRAF Class I alterations where three BRAF-targeted kinase inhibitor drugs have been approved by the FDA.
 
Patients with cancers driven by BRAF Class II or Class III alterations have not responded to existing targeted therapies and have few treatment options currently available to them. Initially, we plan to develop exarafenib for the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and melanoma subpopulations with BRAF Class II or Class III alterations that include specific BRAF point mutations (other than BRAF V600E), BRAF insertions/deletions (indels) and BRAF gene fusion events, as well as other BRAF-altered advanced metastatic solid tumors. In addition, we plan to develop exarafenib for treatment of patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma, which is a RAF-dependent cancer. We believe exarafenib may provide substantial clinical benefit to these patients who are inadequately served by current therapies.
 
In our in vitro and in vivo preclinical studies evaluating exarafenib, we observed kinase inhibition selectivity and a reduction in the size of tumors from drug treated models of human cancer. In internal in vitro and in vivo head-to-head comparisons, we have seen improved kinase inhibition selectivity and pharmaceutical properties compared to a number of currently-approved and in-development drugs. Importantly, exarafenib demonstrated inhibition of RAF dimer signaling while minimizing mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) paradoxical activation, potentially resulting in a broad therapeutic index.
 



In May 2021, we initiated KN-8701, a Phase 1 clinical trial for exarafenib, upon FDA clearance of our IND. We began dosing exarafenib in humans in the second half of 2021. KN-8701 is designed primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of exarafenib in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors driven by specific classes of BRAF alterations, which are known oncogenic drivers, while also characterizing pharmacological and anti-cancer properties of exarafenib. KN-8701 is currently ongoing and we anticipate disclosing detailed monotherapy dose escalation data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2023. In the first quarter of 2023, we announced that we initiated enrollment of patients into the monotherapy dose expansion cohorts of KN-8701. 
 
Exarafenib has also demonstrated preclinical proof of concept in NRAS-mutant melanoma models as a single agent and in combination with binimetinib, a MEK inhibitor. Based on this preclinical proof of concept, in January 2022, we announced the addition of patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma into our ongoing KN-8701 clinical trial both as monotherapy and in combination with binimetinib. We initiated the combination portion of this clinical trial in the second quarter of 2022 and expect initial combination dose escalation data in the first half of 2023.
 
FGFR Program: KIN-3248
 
We are developing KIN-3248, a small-molecule kinase inhibitor targeting cancer-associated alterations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 genes, which (together with BRAF alterations) are among the most commonly identified oncogenic drivers detected in solid tumor cancers. KIN-3248 aims to address the initial alteration, and clinically-observed and predicted mutations in FGFR2 fusion gene-positive ICC and FGFR3-altered UC that drive resistance to current FGFR2- and FGFR3-targeted therapies. We believe this will translate to deeper, more sustained and more clinically impactful responses than those observed with the currently FDA-approved FGFR inhibitors, or other targeted drugs that, to our knowledge, are currently in development.
 
We are evaluating KIN-3248 for the treatment of patients with ICC and UC as well as other solid tumors. In preclinical studies, we have observed inhibitory activity across a broad range of clinically-relevant mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 that drive resistance to current therapies. Because our preclinical studies demonstrated our candidates’ ability to cover the initial alterations and preemptively address these resistance mutations, we believe we may be able to meaningfully increase the DoR for certain patients by addressing these alterations. We plan to develop KIN-3248 initially for patients whose tumors have acquired resistance to therapies targeting FGFR2 or FGFR3 alterations, which limits the durability of response. As with other precision oncology approaches, addressing resistance mutations may also ultimately enable us to develop a first-line therapy. In this program, we will primarily focus on cancers that are driven by alterations in FGFR2 and FGFR3.
 
In January 2022, the FDA cleared our IND for KIN-3248 and we initiated KN-4802, a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-3248 in the first quarter of 2022. The Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-3248 is designed to assess the safety and tolerability of KIN-3248 in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors driven by FGFR2 or FGFR3 alterations, both initial driver alterations as well as resistance mutations. This clinical trial is also designed to characterize pharmacological and anti-cancer properties of KIN-3248.
 
CDK12 Inhibitor Program (KIN004) and Other Research programs
 
Through the broad applicability of our Kinnate Discovery Engine, we are also advancing other small molecule research programs, including a CDK12 inhibitor in our KIN004 program. CDK12 is an essential regulator of DNA damage response and repair (DDR) genes for which no targeted therapies are currently approved or, to our knowledge, in clinical development. We expect to develop a CDK12 inhibitor candidate to target the treatment of OC, mCRPC and TNBC. CDK12 and our other small molecule research programs are aimed at addressing cancer cases not covered by existing targeted therapies.
Our Strategy
 
The key elements of our strategy are to:
 

• | Rapidly advance the development of our lead targeted therapy RAF and FGFR candidates, exarafenib and KIN-3248, respectively. Our lead product candidates are designed to address clinically validated cancer targets in patient populations with limited treatment options. Exarafenib is designed to address either BRAF Class II and Class III or NRAS alterations. KIN-3248 is designed to address FGFR2 and FGFR3 genomic alterations. We believe that these small molecule candidates offer the potential for substantial clinical benefit when administered as monotherapies. Additionally, because of their enhanced pharmacological properties, we believe there may be future opportunities for combination therapy development. If we are successful in achieving clinically meaningful anti-cancer activity in specific solid tumor types, we expect to engage with regulatory authorities to discuss whether we may qualify for any of the FDA’s existing expedited regulatory approval pathways. Ultimately, the procedures and length of time that will be required to satisfy the FDA’s review and approval are outside of our control

• | Develop a pipeline of product candidates focused on overcoming the limitations of current targeted oncology therapeutics. Currently, it is estimated that only 10% of all patients with advanced or metastatic cancer today are eligible for commercially available small molecule kinase inhibitors. Additionally, up to half of these patients may not respond to these treatments and up to half of those who do initially respond may develop resistance. Ultimately, it is estimated that only 2% to 3% of patients with advanced or metastatic cancer will have durable responses to currently available targeted therapeutics. We are therefore focused on developing drugs that can: 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Target known oncogenic drivers (e.g., BRAF Class II or Class III alterations) in selected cancer types that are not currently addressed by approved therapies. Our BRAF-targeting small molecule kinase inhibitors exemplify this strategy. The successful development and FDA approval of three BRAF-targeted kinase inhibitor drugs for use in BRAF Class I alterations establish BRAF as a validated cancer drug target. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Overcome acquired resistance mutations to existing targeted therapies, potentially improving the durability of response. For example, in our FGFR program we seek to develop targeted therapies that cover initial genomic alterations and preemptively address acquired resistance mutations that arise with current targeted therapies. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Treat non-responders to currently-approved therapies where advancements in next generation sequencing have identified, and will continue to reveal, genomic drivers of intrinsic resistance. We expect to develop our CDK12 inhibitor and future programs that will target mechanisms of intrinsic resistance. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increase our probability of clinical success by prioritizing known oncogenic drivers for development, incorporating biomarkers into preclinical and clinical development and exploring continual translational research. Typically, drug development carries high attrition rates from the preclinical stage through FDA approval, with some studies showing that only approximately 10% of the candidates entering Phase 1 trials are ultimately approved. We aim to improve the probability of clinical success through several approaches: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Targeting known oncogenic drivers. We attempt to select targets for drug development that behave as oncogenic drivers, which increases the likelihood of seeing objective measures of tumor responses early in clinical development. If we are successful in inhibiting these targets with our product candidates, we may increase the likelihood of achieving tumor responses. This approach has been successful for kinase inhibitors designed to treat patients with oncogenic alterations in lung cancer, melanoma, leukemia and other types of cancer. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Developing small molecule kinase inhibitors. Small molecule kinase inhibitors are a proven modality that have demonstrated success in the past with multiple currently-approved drugs across many solid tumor and hematologic malignancy indications. By testing our molecules against in vitro and in vivo models utilized by previously approved drugs, we believe we can efficiently benchmark and optimize our compounds. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Incorporating biomarkers into our preclinical and clinical development. By evaluating a wide range of biomarkers in our preclinical studies and our clinical trials, we can more rapidly determine patient populations that may or may not respond to our candidates. Continuing to use biomarkers in clinical trials potentially allows us to select defined patient populations that may demonstrate a stronger benefit and thereby ultimately increase our probability of success. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Continual translational research. Through extensive translational research starting from preclinical studies through clinical development, we can potentially identify new patient populations, responsive subsets and resistance mechanisms to our candidates. This also provides input into combination strategies we may explore with our candidates. Further, investment in molecular landscape collaborations can also help us refine the unmet need for our candidates and outcomes of existing therapies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
While we aim to improve our probability of clinical success by utilizing these strategies, any drug development program carries potential safety liabilities and uncertainty and there is no guarantee that any of our candidates will obtain regulatory approval.
 

• | Leverage our existing relationships, collaborations and experience to efficiently develop and expand our product portfolio. Our team has extensive experience in identifying, discovering, developing and commercializing innovative cancer therapeutics. We are combining this broad oncology expertise with a network of collaborators to further develop our existing pipeline as well as to identify new research and development opportunities. We have established deep collaborations with leaders, with whom we have advisory agreements, at experienced precision medicine cancer centers and research institutions, including Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and University of California, San Francisco, with whom we have sponsored research agreements, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and Moores Cancer Center at UCSD. These collaborations allow us to explore the mechanistic understanding of the biology of our targets and sensitivity and resistance to our molecules. We also leverage our relationships of global external partners to advance our pipeline. For example, we have service agreements with academic and industrial partners who contribute highly enabling technologies and services that include: (1) approximately 35-70 medicinal chemists at leading CROs with whom we can modulate utilization based on our needs, (2) bioinformatics support for our translational research efforts, (3) crystallography and biophysical assay platforms to enable structure-based drug discovery, (4) biochemical and cell-based assays to guide lead generation and optimization, and (5) patient-derived organoid and xenograft models to translate our findings to the clinical setting. We use this external network of collaborations and partnerships in many aspects of preclinical development for our pipeline of candidates and anticipate further utilizing them in our clinical development efforts. Additionally, these collaborations and partnerships may allow us to accelerate identification of new opportunities, including new patient populations we may target to understand emerging mechanisms of resistance. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maximize the clinical impact and value of our portfolio. We retain global development and commercialization rights to our pipeline of candidates. We intend to build an integrated precision oncology company that will manage all aspects of product development and commercialization globally. We may seek to develop rational combination therapy strategies among products within our own portfolio, while also maximizing portfolio value through selective co-development and/or commercialization collaborations. Further, we are focused on expanding globally early in clinical development to accelerate enrollment in geographies with high unmet need. Through Kinnjiu, we have the potential to accelerate enrollment of our programs through global clinical trial recruitment as well as retain commercial rights to our programs in People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau.

Background
 
Cancer is a heterogeneous group of diseases that share the commonality of abnormal cell growth and proliferation and enhanced cellular survival. This unregulated cell replication is driven by the progressive accumulation of mutations in, and dysregulated gene expression of, critical genes that ordinarily tightly regulate processes of cellular growth and metabolism, survival, proliferation and cellular lifespan.
 
Over the last several years, as genomic profiling of cancer patients has become more commonplace and genomic sequencing technology has undergone key advancements, it has become increasingly clear that cancers developing in various sites throughout the body may share the same genomic alterations. Further, when evaluated in controlled experimental systems, these cancer-associated genomic alterations (oncogenes) represent critical genomic drivers for which these cancers are dependent for their growth and survival, a concept referred to as oncogene addiction. The ultimate validation of an oncogene as a true driver gene to which the cancer is addicted is achieved when selected cancer patients whose tumors carry the mutated oncogene gain substantial clinical benefit from treatment with specific and potent drugs that target the oncogene in question.
 
Research and clinical data suggest that some tumors, while having multiple identifiable genomic alterations, are primarily dependent on an aberrantly activated kinase for their proliferation and survival. Kinases, which are cellular enzymes that regulate the biological activity of proteins through a ubiquitous process known as phosphorylation, represent one of the largest classes of oncogenic drivers when aberrantly mutated or expressed in the cell. Kinase inhibition is a proven approach to fighting cancer and for nearly two decades has addressed an increasing number of oncology indications. Kinases represent the largest class of oncogenic drivers for which many targeted therapy cancer drugs have been successfully developed. Currently-approved kinase inhibitors have demonstrated significant clinical benefit to hundreds of thousands of cancer patients globally. It has been shown that patients with tumors driven by oncogenic kinases can demonstrate rapid and measurable tumor shrinkage when treated with the corresponding kinase inhibitor. Furthermore, while therapeutic benefit can often be significant and durable, tolerability is also frequently improved compared to conventional cancer treatments like chemotherapies. An example of this benefit has been seen when an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase inhibitor is administered to a lung cancer patient with a tumor-bearing activating EGFR kinase mutation. In many cases, such clinical responses and increases in patient tolerability can be dramatic enough to support expedited regulatory approval and commercialization of these targeted therapies.
 
Despite the advancement of precision medicine in oncology, a significant unmet need remains for the majority of cancer patients for whom no genomically targeted therapies exist or for which a resistance to targeted treatments has evolved. As depicted in Figure 3 below, we estimate that currently only 10% of all patients with advanced or metastatic cancer are eligible for targeted therapeutics, where a defined genomic driver is matched with a currently-approved targeted therapy. Of those patients, up to 50% (5% of all patients) will respond to the therapy (the responders), while the remainder gain no clinical benefit due to intrinsic resistance (the non-responders). Furthermore, among the responders, the majority (conservatively estimated at 50% to 80%) will eventually develop acquired resistance, lose their beneficial response to the therapy and experience disease progression despite continued treatment with the targeted therapy. Therefore, it is estimated that only 2% to 3% of current patients with advanced or metastatic cancer will have durable responses to currently available targeted therapeutics.

Limitations of Current Targeted Oncology Therapies
 
RAF Inhibitors
 
RAF kinases are a family of proteins that are involved in growth signaling, and include ARAF, BRAF and CRAF. BRAF alterations, which increase signaling, are divided into three classes: alterations where BRAF signals as a monomer (Class I), as a dimer of BRAF molecules (Class II) and as a dimer of BRAF and CRAF molecules (Class III). BRAF alterations occur in approximately 6% of all human cancers but there are only three BRAF targeted kinase inhibitor drugs currently approved by the FDA for use in Class I BRAF mutation-driven cancers: Tafinlar (dabrafenib), Zelboraf (vemurafenib) and Braftovi (encorafenib) are used in mutated melanomas, Tafinlar (dabrafenib) is also used in mutated NSCLC, anaplastic thyroid cancer and metastatic solid tumors, and Braftovi (encorafenib) is also used in mutated colorectal cancer (CRC). BRAF Class I alterations activate the BRAF kinase as a monomer, an individual protein molecule, not depending on dimerization, which is the binding of two protein molecules, for increased kinase activity. These inhibitors produce objective responses in approximately 50% of melanoma patients, meaning approximately 50% of patients are non-responders. An even higher percentage of CRC, NSCLC and thyroid cancer patients do not respond to targeted therapies.
 
BRAF Class II and Class III alterations drive many cancers and have been historically more challenging to target. In collaboration with Guardant Health, we conducted a genomic landscape study of patients that had BRAF alterations. Among the nearly 150,000 samples of BRAF alteration-positive cancers, approximately 55% were found to be harboring BRAF Class II and III alterations in over 25 common adult solid tumors, including NSCLC, melanoma, CRC, prostate cancer and breast cancer. Therefore, a significant unmet medical need remains to develop new drugs that can effectively treat cancers driven by BRAF Class II and Class III alterations. Further, in another collaborative study with Tempus Labs looking at over 55,000 patients with tumor biopsies it was determined that patients with NSCLC and BRAF Class II or Class III alterations experienced shorter time to treatment discontinuation in first line and second line of therapy compared to patients with NSCLC and BRAF Class I alterations which is suggestive of inferior treatment outcomes.
 



FGFR Inhibitors
 
Genomic alterations in the FGFR gene family occur in approximately 7% of human cancers. Approximately 30% to 35% of patients with UC and ICC whose tumors are driven by FGFR-dependent driver genes will respond to currently-approved FGFR-targeting drugs, such as: Incyte Corporation’s Pemazyre (pemigatinib), Janssen Biotech, Inc.’s Balversa (erdafitinib), and Taiho Oncology, Inc.’s Lytgobi (futibatinib). Of the responding patients, the majority only demonstrate partial responses (i.e., partial tumor shrinkage) and the median DoR is only five months for Balversa (erdafitinib) and nine months for Pemazyre (pemigatinib), presenting a substantial need to develop potent and selective next-generation FGFR-targeting agents that can drive deeper responses and longer lasting clinical benefit among responding patients. Most recently, the emergence of mutational resistance in FGFR driver genes in 67% of drug-treated ICC patients who received clinical benefit from an FGFR inhibitor has highlighted the limitation of both currently-approved FGFR-targeting drugs and other clinical stage compounds. While this acquired mutational resistance in FGFR serves to further validate FGFR driver genes as drug targets, it also highlights both the need and the opportunity to develop potent, selective and specific FGFR-targeting agents which target existing mutational resistance and prevent emergence of new resistance mutations.
 
Our Programs
 
Our programs include small molecule inhibitors targeting specific classes of BRAF kinase alterations (BRAF Class II and Class III alterations) and RAF-dependent cancers, and specific alterations of FGFR2 and FGFR3 that aim to overcome the genomic resistance that commonly limits the efficacy of existing therapies. We are also advancing other undisclosed small molecule research programs, including a CDK12 inhibitor.
Our RAF Program: Exarafenib
 
Overview
 
Our most advanced product candidate is exarafenib, an orally administered, reversible small molecule RAF inhibitor. Exarafenib selectively targets RAF kinases and has demonstrated anti-cancer activity in sensitized cancer models driven by BRAF Class II fusions and BRAF homodimer-dependent indels and BRAF Class III alterations as well as NRAS-mutant melanoma. In our in vivo and in vitro preclinical studies evaluating exarafenib, we observed anti-tumor activity and kinase selectivity. Importantly, exarafenib demonstrated inhibition of RAF dimer signaling while minimizing MAPK paradoxical activation, potentially resulting in a broad therapeutic index.
 
In May 2021, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for exarafenib (KN-8701) upon FDA clearance of our IND. We began dosing exarafenib in humans in the second half of 2021. KN-8701 is designed primarily to assess the safety and tolerability of exarafenib in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors driven by specific classes of BRAF alterations, which are known oncogenic drivers, while also characterizing pharmacological and anti-cancer properties of exarafenib. In January 2022, we announced the addition of patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma, a RAF-dependent cancer, into our ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial, KN-8701. In addition, we initiated a combination portion of KN-8701 with the MEK inhibitor binimetinib in patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma in the second quarter of 2022.
 
Background
 
BRAF alterations are found in multiple solid tumor cancer indications, including NSCLC, melanoma, CRC, ovarian cancer and thyroid cancer. BRAF alterations drive tumor growth by activating the MAPK pathway. BRAF alterations can be divided into three classes:
 

• | Class I: BRAF alterations where BRAF monomers activate the MAPK signaling pathway.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Class II: BRAF alterations that generate BRAF homodimers, where two BRAF molecules combine, which are RAS-independent and activate the MAPK pathway. These are frequently the result of point mutations, indels or gene fusions, in which the kinase domain of BRAF is aberrantly joined to a partner gene. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Class III: BRAF alterations with minimal kinase activity that induce BRAF’s dimerization to other RAF kinase family members (e.g., ARAF or CRAF), creating a RAF heterodimer with enhanced affinity to activated RAS and increased enzymatic activity and downstream signaling. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Currently-approved RAF inhibitors and many of those in clinical development target BRAF Class I mutations. Unlike currently available treatments that target only BRAF Class I kinase alterations, our RAF program is focused on developing potent and selective RAF kinase inhibitors that can address additional BRAF dimer-dependent Class II and Class III alterations, which represent cancer patient populations not currently treated by existing targeted therapeutics and where it would be a first-line targeted therapy, in addition to covering BRAF Class I alterations and NRAS-mutant melanoma.
 



Figure 4: Cellular Signaling of The Three Classes of BRAF Alterations in Human Cancers
 

BRAF alterations occur in approximately 6% of all human cancers, including solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Currently, all approved RAF inhibitors target Class I mutations. We believe that a significant opportunity remains to develop novel kinase inhibitors that address patients with BRAF Class II and Class III alterations. The RAF market opportunity has grown due to recent advances in genomic profiling, allowing for the identification of BRAF Class II and Class III alterations that had not previously been possible. We believe there are patients with BRAF Class II and Class III alterations in a number of different cancers, including NSCLC, melanoma and CRC, as well as breast cancer, prostate cancer, ovarian cancer and thyroid cancer, among other tumors. As commercially available diagnostic panels covering BRAF Class II and Class III alterations are more widely accessible and adopted, we believe the BRAF market will continue to grow.
 
Further, we believe that there remains a significant opportunity to develop novel kinase inhibitors that address patients with RAF-dependent cancers, such as NRAS-mutant melanoma, where signaling is highly CRAF-dependent. Approved BRAF inhibitors that target BRAF Class I alterations are not effective in treating patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma. Currently there is no approved targeted therapy approved for this patient population.
 
Additionally, approximately 40-60% of patients are likely to progress on BRAF Class 1 inhibitors, of which about 20% may develop dimer-based resistance (BRAF KD Duplication, BRAF Splice Variants) that may be characterized as BRAF Class II or Class III alterations.
 
We believe alteration type and tumor type are likely good proxies for how sensitive patient will be to therapy. Figure 5 below illustrates the range of sensitivity to BRAF inhibition in BRAF and NRAS alteration driven cancers. For tumor types like CRC and alterations like Class III there is a higher likelihood of other drivers also being present – decreasing overall dependence on the RAF alteration.

Our Opportunity and Solution
 
The lack of currently available therapies for BRAF Class II and Class III and NRAS kinase mutations presents a substantial need to develop potent inhibitors that can demonstrate inhibition of RAF dimer signaling while minimizing MAPK activation (paradoxical activation) for patients with lung cancer, melanoma and other solid tumors that harbor BRAF Class II and Class III alterations and/or oncogenic NRAS mutations.
 



Paradoxical activation
 
The paradoxical activation challenge
 
Currently-approved RAF inhibitor therapies do not inhibit both molecules in the dimer. Consequently, the non-inhibited molecule in the dimer is activated as depicted in the figure below. Therefore, instead of inhibiting the MAPK signaling pathway, the drug activates signaling, which is referred to as paradoxical activation. This paradoxical activation, which sometimes reaches levels that are significantly higher than the original signal, limits the RAF inhibitor’s efficacy against cancer growth and often causes other unwanted effects such as spurring additional cancer growth in non-cancerous tissues. For example, patients with Class I alterations treated by Zelboraf (vemurafenib) have been shown to develop squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) and skin hyperplasias (e.g., hyperkeratosis) because this paradoxical activation activates the MAPK signaling pathway in previously normal skin tissue.
 
Figure 7: Paradoxical Activation Is a Limitation of Approved RAF Kinase Inhibitors
 

In BRAF Class II alterations, the dimer is asymmetric and the active site of the second BRAF molecule is structurally distinct, making it difficult for current therapies to effectively inhibit RAF dimer dependent signaling. Furthermore, in BRAF Class III alterations, the second molecule of the dimer is often CRAF (see figure above), which emphasizes the requirement to bind and inhibit both BRAF and CRAF for effective signaling inhibition. To effectively block both molecules in these dimers, while avoiding paradoxical activation and maintaining anti-tumor efficacy in patients with BRAF Class II and Class III alterations, a compound needs to have activity across RAF isoforms while maintaining selectivity against other kinases.
 
Our solution to paradoxical activation
 
To address paradoxical activation, exarafenib is specifically designed to inhibit both molecules of the dimer simultaneously, regardless of RAF isoform type. By inhibiting both molecules simultaneously, we aim to overcome the challenges created by asymmetric molecules and the subsequent potential for paradoxical activation. We develop candidates using structure-based design and a screen with disease-relevant human cancer cell lines sensitive to paradoxical activation. Enzymatic (biochemical) assays, as opposed to cellular screens, cannot identify compounds that may be effective against both molecules of a dimer because dimer formation does not occur outside of a cellular context. Our approach allows us to develop small molecules that may bind to both sides of the RAF dimer.
 



Maintaining Target Coverage
 
The target coverage challenge
 
An additional factor to address when developing drugs for BRAF Class II or Class III alterations is the requirement to maintain high levels of target coverage between doses. Low drug concentration may trigger paradoxical activation as there may be insufficient coverage to inhibit both molecules of the RAF dimer. Maintaining adequate target coverage at all times is critical to avoid rebound signaling. We believe that other product candidates in development for BRAF Class II or Class III alterations, such as Fore Biotherapeutics’ PLX8394, Genentech / Hanmi Pharmaceutical co. ltd’s belvarafenib (HM95573, RG6185), and Erasca’s naporafenib, possess certain pharmaceutical properties that may have limited their target coverage. As a result, these product candidates have been dosed to high levels and/or combined with other drugs in clinical trials, which has the potential to lead to increased toxicity and treatment complexity, in an attempt to maintain inhibition of the pathway.
 
Our solution to maintain broad target coverage
 
Once we identify compounds that can bind to both molecules of the dimer, we focus on optimization of pharmaceutical properties to ensure sufficient coverage to inhibit both molecules of the RAF dimer, ultimately aiming to achieve optimal target coverage.  Exarafenib is designed to have enhanced solubility, which has led to improved pharmacokinetic (PK) properties across animal models that result in improved anti-cancer activity. We believe that the pharmaceutical property enhancements of our candidate will afford better patient tolerability and more complete and effective coverage of the intended target. We anticipate this will translate to deeper and more sustained disease control and greater flexibility for rational combination therapy strategies in the future.
 
Exarafenib
 
We are focusing our clinical development efforts in BRAF Class II or Class III alteration-driven cancers, as well as NRAS-mutant melanoma, where patients do not respond to existing therapies or have few treatment options currently available to them. We plan to develop exarafenib for the treatment of patients with NSCLC and melanoma subpopulations with BRAF Class II or Class III alterations. These tumor types are especially dependent upon these BRAF alterations, creating promising opportunities to therapeutically target these genomic drivers. We also plan to develop exarafenib for the treatment of patients with NRAS-mutant melanoma and explore treatment of other tumor types.
Preclinical Results
 
Our preclinical studies of exarafenib have demonstrated tumor regressions in specific cancer models representing our target patient populations that harbor tumors driven by BRAF Class II and Class III alterations where no approved targeted therapy currently exists.  Exarafenib has also demonstrated improved pharmaceutical properties and human equivalent dose (HED) predictions compared to certain ongoing clinical development programs. These results support our belief that exarafenib has the potential to demonstrate therapeutic response by addressing challenges related to MAPK paradoxical activation and target coverage. Further, preclinical studies of exarafenib as a single agent, and in combination with binimetinib has shown both in vitro and in vivo activity in NRAS-mutant melanoma, including showing significant tumor regressions at clinically relevant doses of exarafenib and binimetinib. We have conducted 28-day good laboratory practice (GLP) oral toxicology studies for exarafenib using rat and cynomolgus monkey as relevant species for human risk assessment.
 
We are also developing related backup molecules that we would plan to advance into the clinic only if, following the initiation of clinical trials for exarafenib, we determine such molecules may have a superior safety or efficacy profile.
 
Based on evaluating more than 300 kinase assays, exarafenib displayed a highly selective kinome profile. These results were determined by radiometric kinase inhibition assays, a preferred standard for evaluating small molecule inhibitors. As depicted in the figure below, in this kinome profiling study, exarafenib substantially inhibited all three RAF kinases (ARAF, BRAF, CRAF) and partially inhibited few other (off-target) kinases. It therefore demonstrated a selective kinase profile relative to other pan-RAF inhibitors.

Percent (%) inhibition is relative to DMSO control. Kinases with >50% inhibition are shown with circle size indicating the relative potency. Kinome tree graphic was generated using CORAL (http://phanstiel-lab.med.unc.edu/CORAL/).
    We performed additional studies to characterize the kinase inhibitory activity of exarafenib on kinases that were inhibited in the kinome profiling studies. As depicted in the table below, we measured the inhibitory activity of exarafenib on selected kinases typically inhibited by the RAF inhibitor class by utilizing an enzymatic (biochemical) assay. The drug concentrations that inhibited 50% of kinase activity are presented in nanomolar (nM) concentrations. We observed a highly selective kinome profile for exarafenib with greater than 867X inhibitory activity against RAF family kinases compared to the other notable off-target kinases, an exception is DDR1 (more than 15X higher IC50 than BRAF), which has a highly similar active site.
 
Figure 9: Inhibitory Concentrations 50% (IC50s) Determined from Dose-Response Inhibition Curves of Kinases Inhibited in the Kinome Profiling





The selectivity of exarafenib was evaluated by comparing the inhibitory activity against ARAF, BRAF, and CRAF to off-target kinases discovered in the kinome profiling that was performed at a compound concentration of 1000 nM. Radiometric kinase assays were run at Km ATP concentration with compounds starting at 3000 nM. The half-maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC50) were determined using a four-parameter fit model from a 10-point dose response curve performed with 3 replicates at each drug concentration and are presented in nM concentrations. Common BRAF inhibitor off-targets (EPHA2, KDR, LCK, and SRC) are represented as greater than the top drug concentration tested (> 3000 nM).
 
As shown in the table below, exarafenib exhibited activity against BRAF Class II and Class III mutations in cellular settings as measured by inhibition of pathway signaling. In these studies, we utilized phosphorylation of extra-cellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) as a sensitive measure of MAPK signaling inhibition. With exarafenib we observed much lower MAPK pathway inhibition in cells expressing WT BRAF as exemplified by the NCI-H358, CHL-1 and BJ normal fibroblast cells. Naporafenib and belvarafenib, development stage type II pan-RAF inhibitors, demonstrate similar profiles to exarafenib with greatest potencies in BRAF Class II and Class III mutant cells. In contrast, a representative MEK inhibitor, Mektovi (binimetinib), demonstrated inhibition across all evaluated cellular settings including BRAF WT relative to MEK inhibition. We believe this selectivity of BRAF mutant versus BRAF WT is a differentiator and advantage of exarafenib by avoiding pathway inhibition in normal cells.

Cellular inhibitory activity for exarafenib compared to binimetinib, naporafenib and belvarafenib. More potent inhibition is reflected by a lower EC50 number presented in nM concentration. Cells were treated with the indicated compounds for 1 hour and pERK was measured in cell lysates using a homogenous time-resolved fluorescence assay. The compounds were run in 10-point, 3-fold serial dilution response starting at 10,000 nM to determine EC50 using a 4-parameter fit model. All samples were run in triplicate and represent an average of 3 or more independent experiments.
 
Enhancement of pharmaceutical properties was a major priority for our RAF inhibitor designs as traditional RAF inhibitors, both currently approved and in clinical development, have suffered from poor pharmaceutical properties including aqueous solubility. High aqueous solubility improves drug absorption, which enhances our ability to achieve greater target coverage in vivo. By modifying structural features that improve aqueous solubility while maintaining potency of RAF inhibition, we identified exarafenib which demonstrated an aqueous solubility greater than 100 micromolar (uM) at pH 4.5 and greater than 300 uM at pH 2.0. These are substantially improved aqueous solubilities as compared to naporafenib and belvarafenib, as shown in the table below. Further, exarafenib has shown greater than seven-fold more plasma free fraction (i.e., unbound drug) than naporafenib and belvarafenib. These improved pharmaceutical properties of exarafenib and increased drug exposure all enhance the likelihood that exarafenib may achieve greater target coverage in the clinical setting, which we anticipate may lead to enhanced anti-tumor activity.

Tumor regressions in internal head-to-head preclinical studies for exarafenib
 
Daily dosing of exarafenib was well tolerated in athymic nude mice bearing A375 (BRAF Class I mutation), BxPC-3 (BRAF Class II mutation) or WM3629 (BRAF Class III mutation) human tumor cell xenografts in doses up to 60 mg/kg/day. As shown in Figure 12, all three tumor models demonstrated tumor growth inhibition, as measured by mean tumor volume, at a dose of 60 mg/kg/day. For comparison, we treated cohorts of tumor-bearing animals with 200 mg/kg/day of naporafenib leading to similar inhibitory activity to 60 mg/kg of exarafenib. This 200 mg/kg/day dose of naporafenib represents more than a four-fold increased free drug exposure relative to the highest clinical dose (600 mg BID).

Exarafenib or naporafenib or vehicle control dosing was initiated when tumors reached >200 mm3 after tumor inoculation and was performed by oral administration once a day. Groups consisted of n=9 mice and represent the average of tumor measurements +/- standard error of the mean (SEM). The 60mg/kg dose of exarafenib reflects the freebase formulation.
 
PD Studies and Paradoxical Activation
 
In these studies, we measured phosphorylated ERK (pERK) as a sensitive marker of MAPK signaling in human WM3629 cancer cell line xenografts (BRAF Class III mutation) that were recovered from tumor-bearing mice after they had received a single dose of exarafenib. As depicted in the figure below, a single 60 mg/kg dose demonstrated inhibition of ERK phosphorylation within 1 hour of treatment which was maintained through 7 hours post-treatment, while ERK phosphorylation partially recovered by 24 hours and returned to pre-treatment levels (100% of the control or baseline value) by 48 hours after treatment. Treatment with a single dose of naporafenib at 200 mg/kg led to paradoxical activation of ERK phosphorylation to levels above 400% at 48 hours post-treatment, as depicted by the area shaded in red above 100% in the figure on the left below. In contrast, as depicted in the figure on the right below, exarafenib did not demonstrate significant paradoxical activation in these studies in BRAF Class III mutant tumors.

Exarafenib is designed to and has demonstrated the ability in preclinical studies to:
 

• | inhibit RAF across both sides of the RAF dimer, which enables populations beyond BRAF Class I alterations to be targeted;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | enable large drug exposures in vivo for BRAF mutant target coverage while avoiding paradoxical activation; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | target BRAF Class II and Class III alterations, which has been enabled by technological advances and increased access to genomic profiling.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
To support translation of exarafenib into biomarker-defined clinical trials, we have established research programs with Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and University of California, San Francisco. These programs evaluate exarafenib in BRAF Class II alterations and in patient-derived xenograft models of BRAF Class II and Class III alterations. Outcomes are focused on supporting PK and PD relationships in clinically relevant models of BRAF Class II and Class III alterations.
 
We have completed a 28-day GLP toxicology study in rats and a 28-day GLP toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys that together define the anticipated first-in-human dose for exarafenib. All drug dose levels were well tolerated with no exposure-associated mortality, adverse clinical pathology observations, or substantive changes in vital measurements following completion of 28 days of dosing in both species. We believe exarafenib has a favorable therapeutic index as these GLP toxicology results demonstrated that the drug was well tolerated at levels that have shown anti-tumor activity in our other preclinical studies.
 
NRAS-mutant Melanoma Preclinical Proof of Concept
 
Exarafenib, as a single agent, and in combination with binimetinib, a MEK inhibitor, has shown activity in NRAS-mutant melanoma in preclinical studies. In vitro data indicates meaningful and synergistic combination benefit of exarafenib with binimetinib in NRAS-mutant melanoma cells. In in vivo xenograft models of NRAS-mutant melanoma, treatment with exarafenib in combination with binimetinib was well tolerated and resulted in significant tumor growth inhibition, including tumor regressions at clinically relevant twice-daily (BID) doses of exarafenib and binimetinib, respectively.

Clinical Development Plan: KN-8701
 
KN-8701 is designed as follows:
 

• | Part A1: Dose Escalation (Monotherapy): Patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors bearing any BRAF Class I, Class II or Class III alteration (including NSCLC, melanoma, and other solid tumors) or NRAS-mutant melanoma will be enrolled in cohorts of 1 to 3 patients (modified 3+3 design) each to receive oral exarafenib monotherapy for up to 40 patients. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Part A2: Dose Escalation (Combination with Binimetinib): Patients, including those with advanced or metastatic NRAS-mutant melanoma will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 patients (3+3 design) each to receive oral exarafenib in combination with binimetinib for up to approximately 36 patients. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Part B: Dose Expansion: Patients with BRAF-altered cancers including lung cancer, melanoma and other solid tumors will be enrolled in one of a number of cohorts defined by cancer type or BRAF alteration of up to 20-30 patients per cohort to receive oral exarafenib as a single anti-cancer agent. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The objectives of this clinical trial are to (1) assess the safety and tolerability of exarafenib when administered to cancer patients, (2) understand the relationship between dose and schedule of drug with PK, PD, and changes in tumor-associated biomarkers, (3) determine a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule, and (4) gain an initial understanding of single agent anti-cancer efficacy in defined cancer patient populations. Our primary efficacy measures include objective measures of tumor response using RECIST v1.1, including number of responding patients, response rate, depth of response and DoR, utilizing standardized tumor imaging assessments at pre-specified intervals. The figure below illustrates our current clinical development plan for KN-8701.
 



Figure 15: Clinical Development Plan for Exarafenib in Patients with BRAF-Altered Advanced Solid Tumors and NRAS Mutant Melanoma
 

In both Parts A and B, we leverage CLIA-compliant local tumor tissue or blood-based genomic profiling, such as MSK-IMPACT profiling, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, or tumor tissue or blood-based genomic analysis performed at a central commercial laboratory, such as Foundation Medicine, Inc., for detection and inclusion of patients with specific BRAF alteration-driven cancers or NRAS-mutant melanoma in KN-8701. We also biobank tumor tissue and blood specimens for central retrospective analysis which we believe will enable the assessment of primary genomic alterations and other exploratory analyses. The Phase 1 KN-8701 clinical trial is active at multiple sites globally. This clinical trial is designed to enroll a total of approximately 155 patients. Based on the totality of clinical data from KN-8701 and predicated upon an acceptable safety and tolerability profile and a strong positive efficacy signal, we then expect to engage with the FDA and other regulatory authorities to plan one or more Phase 2 potentially registration-enabling clinical trials in the United States and potentially other geographies. Where possible, we will explore applicable regulatory strategies pursued by other targeted therapy companies, for example orphan drug designation, Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track designation, Priority Review and/or Accelerated Approval.
Growing Our RAF Franchise
    Beyond development of exarafenib, we continue activities on chemotypes that are differentiated from exarafenib. Additionally, we are investigating potential next-generation candidates with the possibility of expanding the therapeutic index and enabling further precision medicine strategies. For example, we may target RAF 1 (CRAF protein) gene fusions that are known drivers in primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors, which remains a substantial unmet need. These programs are currently in preclinical research and we intend to develop them for future precision oncology clinical trials.
Our FGFR Program: KIN-3248
 
Overview
 
We are evaluating our FGFR inhibitor candidate, KIN-3248, for the treatment of patients with ICC and UC and other solid tumors. In preclinical studies, we have observed inhibitory activity across a broad range of clinically-relevant mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 that drive resistance to current therapies. Because our preclinical studies demonstrated our candidates’ ability to cover the initial alterations and preemptively address these resistance mutations, we believe we may be able to meaningfully increase the DoR for certain patients by addressing these alterations. We plan to develop our candidates initially for patients whose tumors have acquired resistance to therapies targeting FGFR2 or FGFR3 alterations, which limits the durability of response. As with other precision oncology approaches, addressing resistance mutations may also ultimately enable us to develop a first-line therapy. In January 2022, the FDA cleared our IND for KIN-3248 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-3248 in the first quarter of 2022.
Background
 
Aberrations in FGFR signaling are an emerging opportunity for targeted therapy across multiple types of cancer, particularly UC and ICC and also gastric and breast cancers. Currently-approved FGFR inhibitors have demonstrated clinical benefit, but response rates and DoR are limited. For FDA-approved FGFR targeted drugs Balversa (erdafitinib), Pemazyre (pemigatinib), and Taiho Oncology Inc.’s, Lytgobi (futibatinib), , the response rate is approximately up to 40% among UC and ICC patients whose tumors are driven by FGFR-dependent driver genes. Further, the vast majority of those responding patients only demonstrate partial responses (i.e., partial tumor shrinkage) and the median DoR is only five months for Balversa (erdafitinib) and 9-10 months for Pemazyre (pemigatinib) and Lytgobi (futibatinib) These resistance profiles are often caused by gatekeeper and molecular brake variants that emerge within the FGFR driver gene. The figure below shows the sensitivity and resistance of various oncogenic FGFR2 and FGFR3 indels and fusion genes. This lack of a response for most patients and short DoR for others presents a substantial need to develop potent and selective next-generation FGFR-targeting agents that can drive deeper and longer-lasting clinical benefit among responding patients.
 
First-generation inhibitors including Balversa (erdafitinib), Pemazyre (pemigatinib) and Lytgobi (futibatinib),  and our next-generation FGFR-targeting small molecules currently in development, effectively target non drug-resistant FGFR2 and FGFR3 driver genes. Among these, we believe only KIN-3248 has been shown in preclinical studies to effectively inhibit the full spectrum of clinically-described and predicted resistance mutations in FGFR cancer driver genes.
 
Figure 16: Kinnate’s FGFR Inhibitors Retain Activity Against Common FGFR2 and FGFR3 Resistance Mutations
 


Hyperphosphatemia, an elevated level of phosphate in the blood, is a common, and typically manageable, adverse effect of FGFR-targeting drugs. This adverse event is driven by FGFR1-dependent inhibition of phosphate reabsorption in the kidney. Typically, hyperphosphatemia is managed by dietary modification and phosphate-binding medication. Many oncology drug developers have tried to select against FGFR1 instead of targeting 1, 2 or 3 specific FGFR isoforms, but given very high sequence similarity in the kinase domains of FGFR family members, it remains exceptionally challenging to retain potent FGFR2 and FGFR3 inhibition and avoid FGFR1 kinase inhibition. Based on our conversations with clinicians and key opinion leaders, we believe that broad coverage of primary FGFR2 and FGFR3 oncogenic driver alterations and the acquired, on-target resistance mutations is more important clinically than reducing hyperphosphatemia. Additionally, inhibition of FGFR1 may have clinical benefits.
 
Oncogenic FGFR2 gene fusions have been observed in 10% to 16% of patients with ICC, while oncogenic FGFR3 alterations are estimated to be found in approximately 15% to 20% of patients with UC. Given these populations and the significant percentage of patients who develop resistance to currently-approved FGFR inhibitors, we believe there is a significant commercial opportunity to develop a next-generation FGFR inhibitor that will effectively cover the initial fusions or alterations and the common resistance alleles that may eventually develop.

The Opportunity
 
The lack of a response for most patients and short DoR for others with respect to existing therapies presents a substantial need to develop potent and selective next-generation FGFR-targeting agents that can drive deeper and longer-lasting clinical benefit among responding patients.
Resistance Mutations
 
The challenge of resistance mutations
 
Most recently, the emergence of resistance mutations in FGFR driver genes (at or even prior to the emergence of clinical progression or relapse in drug-treated patients) has highlighted the limitation of both currently-approved FGFR-targeting drugs and other clinical stage compounds. While this acquired mutational resistance in FGFR serves to further validate FGFR driver genes as drug targets, it also highlights both the need and the opportunity to develop potent, selective, and specific FGFR-targeting agents that target existing mutational resistance and prevent emergence of new resistance mutations.
 
Common mechanisms driving this acquired resistance are referred to as gatekeeper mutations (V565F/I in FGFR2 and V555M in FGFR3) and molecular brake mutations (N550K/H in FGFR2 or N540S or K650M/E in FGFR3). The mutated gatekeeper amino acid influences binding site properties which can prevent binding of FGFR inhibitors to the target site (FGFR2 and FGFR3). Molecular brake mutations increase kinase activation, overcoming drug efficacy. Both gatekeeper and molecular brake mutations drive acquired resistance to current therapies.
 
Our solution to resistance mutations
 
We believe that selectively targeting the initial oncogenic alteration in addition to acquired gatekeeper and/or molecular brake alterations has the potential to overcome the challenges presented by resistance mutations. To improve DoR, our next-generation FGFR inhibitors, which are currently in development, target acquired resistance mutations identified in patients treated with FGFR targeted therapies. We are seeking to develop product candidates to inhibit the initial alteration or fusion in addition to the gatekeeper and molecular brake resistance mutations. Specifically, we have designed our candidates to address mutations, such as gatekeeper and molecular brake mutations, which we believe to be the most common acquired resistance mutations.
 
While we are initially pursuing this as a second-line treatment, we ultimately plan to explore first-line therapy as well, where coverage across both initial and acquired mutations may translate to longer DoR, displacing existing FGFR2 and FGFR3 targeting drugs. This is analogous to the path taken in the successful development of Tagrisso (osimertinib), an EGFR-targeting small molecule drug that potently inhibits both WT and specific, critical gatekeeper EGFR mutations that confer resistance to first-generation EGFR-targeting drugs such as Tarceva (erlotinib).
 



Limited Coverage
 
The challenge with limited coverage
 
Isoform-selective FGFR inhibition may lead to activation of other FGFR kinases. This reactivation of FGFR1, FGFR2, or FGFR3 signaling represents a potential compensation mechanism that drives resistance to selective therapies. Evidence of this has already been seen with FGFR2-specific inhibitors that have resulted in the appearance of FGFR1 or FGFR3 oncogenic driver alterations. Without broad inhibition of the FGFR kinase family, DoR and response rates may be limited.
 
Our solution to overcoming limited coverage
 
Our next-generation FGFR inhibitor candidates are structurally designed to inhibit molecular brake and gatekeeper mutations while maintaining broad coverage across FGFR isoforms (i.e., FGFR1, FGFR2 and FGFR3). This broad-based approach may prevent compensatory mechanisms that would otherwise limit response rates or DoR.
 
FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 alterations are predominantly found in different tumor types. FGFR2 alterations are known oncogenic drivers in ICC and FGFR3 alterations are known oncogenic drivers in urothelial tumors. In addition, evidence suggests that FGFR1 alterations exist in breast cancer and may be oncogenic drivers. Therefore, a drug that broadly inhibits FGFR isoforms may be effective across multiple tumor types. In addition to covering broad FGFR isoforms, there is an opportunity to cover other potential escape routes by providing coverage of FGFR indels and single nucleotide variants (SNVs) beyond the fusions targeted by currently-approved therapies. Coverage across both the intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms may translate into more durable DoR, displacing existing FGFR2 and FGFR3 targeting drugs.
 
Our FGFR Program: KIN-3248
 
Our FGFR candidate, KIN-3248, is a covalent (irreversible) kinase inhibitor, designed to address clinically-observed mutations in FGFR2 and FGFR3 that drive resistance to current therapies. We are evaluating KIN-3248 for the treatment of patients with ICC and UC and may expand into other FGFR-driven solid tumors, such as breast cancer.
 
In preclinical studies we have observed inhibitory activity across a broad range of clinically relevant mutations that drive acquired resistance. We believe that by addressing these mutations and broadly covering FGFR isoforms, we may be able to meaningfully increase the DoR. We have completed in vitro and in vivo profiling of KIN-3248. We have conducted 28-day GLP oral toxicology studies for KIN-3248 using rat and dog as relevant species for human risk assessment. In January 2022, the FDA cleared our IND for KIN-3248 and we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial for KIN-3248 in the first quarter of 2022.
 
Preclinical Results
 
Based on evaluating more than 300 kinase assays, KIN-3248 displayed a highly selective kinome profile. As depicted in the figure below, in this kinome profiling study, KIN-3248 substantially inhibited (> 90% kinase inhibition) three FGFR kinases (FGFR2, FGFR3, and FGFR4) and partially inhibited a few other (off-target) kinases including TNK1 and STK10. By comparison, the FDA-approved FGFR2/3 inhibitor erdafitinib (Balversa) inhibited the FGFR family of kinases but demonstrated off-target inhibition of several receptor tyrosine kinases (e.g., KDR, PDGFRalpha, KIT, CSF1R, DDR1, DDR2) that are known to be common off-targets for FGFR inhibitors. Therefore, KIN-3248 demonstrated an improved kinase selectivity profile relative to erdafitinib.

Biochemical assays were measured by a shift in electrophoretic mobility of a peptide substrate upon phosphorylation with the designated kinase. Percent (%) inhibition is relative to DMSO control. Kinases with >50% inhibition are shown with circle size indicating the relative potency as depicted in the legend. Kinome tree graphic was generated using CORAL (http://phanstiel-lab. med.unc.edu/CORAL/).
 
As shown in the table below, initial preclinical study results for our FGFR inhibitor candidate, KIN-3248, showed improved inhibition of the gatekeeper mutations (FGFR2 V565F and FGFR3 V555M) when compared to FDA-approved FGFR inhibitors, Balversa (erdafitinib), Pemazyre (pemigatinib), and Lytgobi (futibatinib), in enzymatic assays.
 



Figure 19: Biochemical Inhibition of WT FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 and Selected FGFR2 and FGFR3 Resistance Mutations by Indicated FGFR-targeting Reference Compounds and KIN-3248
 


Enzymatic inhibitory activity of KIN-3248 against FGFR family kinases and common resistance mutations compared to Balversa (erdafitinib), Pemazyre (pemigatinib) and Lytgobi (futibatinib) in internal head-to-head comparisons. Biochemical activity is measured by a shift in electrophoretic mobility of a peptide substrate upon phosphorylation with the designated FGFR kinase. The potency of kinase inhibition is presented as the concentration of specified compound that inhibited 50% of the maximum kinase activity (IC50). Kinase inhibition assays were performed at 100 uM ATP concentration with no pre-incubation of the compounds with the kinase. In the lower section of the table, the relative inhibitory activity of the specified compound toward mutant versus respective WT kinase is displayed as fold differences in IC50 values. Ratios <10X (as highlighted by green text for KIN-3248) represent retained activity of either the resistance mutation or corresponding WT kinase. Ratios >10X (as highlighted by red text) represent a substantial loss of activity against the indicated resistance mutation compared to the corresponding WT kinase.
 
KIN-3248 similarly demonstrated inhibition of cell viability in patient-derived CCLP-1 cholangiocarcinoma cells engineered to express either unmutated FGFR2 gene fusions (WT) or comparable gene fusions that harbor secondary resistance mutations (e.g., V565F and N550K). Other FGFR-targeting compounds were assayed in the same studies and displayed significantly less inhibition of specific mutant FGFR2 alleles. For example, Pemazyre (pemigatinib) and Lytgobi (futibatinib) had EC50 values for the FGFR2 V565F mutation that were more than 6,000 nM and 129 nM, respectively. For example, Pemazyre (pemigatinib) and Lytgobi (futibatinib) had fold-difference in EC50 values for the FGFR2 V565F mutation relative to WT that were >1000x and >300x, respectively. This compares to 1.5x for KIN-3248. Fold-difference in EC50 values for specific FGFR2 mutant alleles compared to WT are presented in the figure / heatmap below (left panel).
 
In addition to the acquired resistance mutations described above, there are other clinically relevant FGFR2 mutations, including additional gatekeeper (e.g., V565L and V565I), molecular brake / regulatory region (e.g., N550H and E566A), and activating mutations (e.g., K650M), as well as the corresponding FGFR3 mutations. These mutations may limit the potency of both approved FGFR inhibitors (e.g., pemigatinib) and FGFR therapies in clinical development, such as RLY-4008. Consistent with the biochemical data, KIN-3248 demonstrated a ratio less than 5-fold for these resistance mutations compared to the unmutated FGFR2 fusion in cell-based assays. This suggests that KIN-3248 has a unique ability to retain activity across V565L, V565I, and M538I, and therefore demonstrates a potential advantage in limiting the emergence of these resistance mutations in patients with FGFR2-driven cancers.

The cellular activity of KIN-3248 compared to Pemazyre (pemigatinib) and Lytgobi (futibatinib), was evaluated in patient-derived FGFR2 fusion-positive cholangiocarcinoma cell lines, CCLP-1 and ICC13-7, engineered to express selected secondary FGFR2 resistance mutations. Inhibition of cell viability was measured by MTT assay following 3 or 10 days of treatment in multiple independent experiments. EC50 values were calculated using a dose-response regression curve fitting utilizing a 4-parameter analytical method. Relative inhibitory activity of the specified compound toward mutant versus WT FGFR2 kinase is displayed as fold differences in EC50 values (left panel). To evaluate clonal outgrowth (right panel), FGFR2 mutants were pooled and treated with KIN-3248 or the indicated FGFR inhibitors for 2 weeks. Clonal prevalence at the start and end of treatment was determined by droplet digital PCR and presented as relative mutant allele frequency. Data for RLY-4008 excerpted from Relay Therapeutics’ public filings.

The cellular activity of KIN-3248 compared to Pemazyre (pemigatinib), Balversa (erdafitinib), infigratinib, Lytgobi (futibatinib)was evaluated in a human FGFR3 fusion-positive bladder cancer cell line, RT-112, engineered to express selected secondary FGFR3 resistance mutations. Inhibition of cell viability was measured following 5 days of treatment in multiple independent experiments. EC50 values were calculated using a dose-response regression curve fitting utilizing a 4-parameter analytical method. Relative inhibitory activity of the specified compound toward mutant versus WT FGFR3 kinase is displayed as fold differences in EC50 values.
 
Tumor regressions in internal head-to-head preclinical studies for KIN-3248 in Primary and Resistant FGFR2/3 oncogenic driver alterations in vivo
 
Continuous daily dosing of KIN-3248 was well tolerated in athymic nude mice bearing SNU-16 (FGFR2 amplified and fusion-positive gastric cancer), and RT-112 (FGFR3 fusion-positive bladder cancer) human tumor cell xenografts at doses up to 15 mg/kg/day. As shown in the figure below, both tumor models demonstrated tumor growth inhibition, as measured by mean tumor volume, at 5 and 15 mg/kg/day doses.

 Tumor growth inhibition of SNU-16 gastric cancer (FGFR2 amplified and FGFR2-PDHX+) and RT-112 bladder cancer (FGFR3-TACC3+) xenografts in athymic nude mice. KIN-3248 or vehicle control dosing was initiated when tumors reached >200 mm3 and was performed by oral administration once a day. Groups consisted of n=9 mice and represent the average tumor volume +/- standard error of the mean (SEM).

The anti-tumor activity of KIN-3248 was next evaluated in cancer cell line (CDX)- and patient-derived (PDX) tumor xenograft models with FGFR2 resistance mutations. Treatment with KIN-3248 at 15 mg/kg/day led to 72%, 116%, and 102% tumor growth inhibition and regressions in models harboring M538I / M539L (activation loop), V565L (gatekeeper), and N550K (molecular brake) mutations associated with clinical resistance to FGFR inhibitors. In contrast, Pemazyre (pemigatinib) and Lytgobi (futibatinib) displayed a lack of or limited efficacy against these FGFR2 resistance mutations.

KIN-3248, Pemazyre (pemigatinib, Lytgobi (futibatinib)or vehicle control dosing was initiated when tumors reached >200 mm3 and was performed by oral administration once a day. Groups consisted of n=6-12 mice and represent the average tumor volume +/- standard error of the mean (SEM).
 
The currently-approved FGFR inhibitors bind to the kinase active site in a reversible binding mode. By modifying small molecules with a reactive chemical warhead that irreversibly (covalently) reacts with a specific cysteine amino acid found in the active site of the kinase, we believe that FGFR inhibitors can achieve enhanced selectivity and potency across clinically-relevant secondary resistance mutations, including those that have been observed among Lytgobi (futibatinib)-treated patients.
 
Examples of approved kinase inhibitors that employ this irreversible binding mode include Imbruvica (ibrutinib) and Tagrisso (osimertinib), each of which covalently reacts with a specific cysteine found in the active sites of BTK and EGFR kinases, respectively. Similar to osimertinib’s irreversible binding to EGFR while maintaining activity against T790M gatekeeper mutations, our designs enable an irreversible interaction with the cysteine in the FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR3 kinase active site, while avoiding the hindrance of binding by gatekeeper mutations that was observed with Lytgobi (futibatinib).
 



We have completed a 28-day GLP toxicology study in rats and a 28-day GLP toxicology study in dogs that together define the anticipated first-in-human dose for KIN-3248. All drug dose levels were well tolerated with no exposure-associated mortality, adverse clinical pathology observations, or substantive changes in vital measurements following completion of 28 days of dosing in both species. We believe KIN-3248 has a favorable therapeutic index as these GLP toxicology results demonstrated that the drug was well tolerated at levels that have shown anti-tumor activity in our other preclinical studies.
 
Clinical Development Plan: KN-4802
 
KN-4802 is designed as follows:
 

• | Part A: Dose Escalation: Patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors in both FGFR inhibitor naïve and pre-treated patient populations with molecularly-defined FGFR2- and/or FGFR3-alteration driven cancers, including a limited number of patients with FGFR2 or FGFR3 amplification-driven cancers. Patients will be enrolled in cohorts of 3 patients each to receive oral KIN-3248 as a single agent for up to 45 patients. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Part B: Dose Expansion: Patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors bearing with molecularly-defined FGFR2- and/or FGFR3-alteration driven cancers will be enrolled in one of a number of cohorts defined by disease or biomarker of up to 20 to 30 patients per cohort to receive oral KIN-3248 as a single agent. This would include both FGFR inhibitor naïve and pre-treated patient populations. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The objectives of this clinical trial are to (1) assess the safety and tolerability of KIN-3248 when administered to cancer patients, (2) understand the relationship between dose and schedule of drug with PK, PD and changes in tumor-associated biomarkers, (3) determine a recommended Phase 2 dose and schedule, and (4) gain an initial understanding of single agent anti-cancer efficacy in defined cancer patient cohorts. Our primary efficacy measures include objective measures of tumor response using RECIST v1.1, including number of responding patients, response rate, depth of response and DoR, utilizing standardized tumor imaging assessments at pre-specified intervals. The figure below illustrates our current clinical development plan.
 
Figure 24: Clinical Development Plan for KIN-3248 in Patients with FGFR2- and/or FGFR3-driven Advanced Solid Tumors
 

In both Parts A and B, we leverage CLIA-compliant local tumor tissue or blood-based genomic profiling, such as MSK-IMPACT profiling, at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, or tumor or blood-based genomic analysis performed at a central commercial laboratory, such as Foundation Medicine, Inc., for detection and inclusion of specific FGFR2 or FGFR3 alterations. We also biobank tumor tissue and blood specimens for central retrospective analysis which we believe will enable the assessment of primary genomic alterations and other exploratory analyses.
Additional Research Programs
 
We are also advancing a number of other small molecule research programs, including a CDK12 inhibitor in our KIN004 program. CDK12 is an essential regulator of DDR genes and no approved CDK12-targeting therapies are currently available or, to our knowledge, in clinical development. We are developing a candidate to target the unmet clinical need in the treatment of OC, mCRPC and TNBC.
 



Despite the significant clinical benefits of approved poly ADP-Ribose polymerase (PARP) inhibitors in the treatment of eligible patients with advanced or metastatic OC and mCRPC, and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) (including PD-1 and PD-L1 targeting agents) for those with TNBC, acquired drug resistance remains a significant challenge in the majority of cases.
 
We believe that targeted CDK12 inhibition with a selective small molecule therapeutic offers the potential to:
 

• | significantly augment the clinical benefits of PARP inhibitors, chemotherapeutic agents and ICIs in the subset of these cancer patients who are currently eligible to be treated with these drugs; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | therapeutically sensitize cancers from expanded populations of OC, mCRPC and TNBC patients who are not currently eligible to receive PARP inhibitors or ICIs, and who yet may gain substantial benefit from combination therapy with either PARP inhibitors, conventional chemotherapies, or an ICI agent. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
CDK12 is a critical regulator of both the DDR pathway and neoantigen formation in tumors. The figure below illustrates the CDK12 pathway regulating DDR gene transcription. We are developing selective CDK12 irreversible kinase inhibitors that are designed to induce DDR deficiencies in patients with DDR-proficient tumors.
 
Figure 25: Therapeutic CDK12 Inhibition Sensitizes Cancer Cells to Existing Cancer Therapies Through Two Distinct Mechanisms Which Operate in Parallel.
 
 (Left) CDK12 inhibition significantly reduces expression of DDR genes through its selective impact on transcription of long genes, many of which encode regulators of the DNA damage pathway. This inhibition leads to dramatic sensitization of cancer cells to DNA damaging chemotherapy and PARP inhibitors (PARPi). (Right) CDK12 inhibition is expected to produce large tandem duplications in cellular DNA that express neoantigens that are subsequently presented on the cell surface. We expect that expression of these neoantigens provides a unique opportunity to synergize with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to produce an enhanced anti-tumor immune response.
 
CDK12 inhibition sensitizes tumors to DNA damaging agents and induces synthetic lethality in both DDR-deficient and, more importantly, DDR-proficient tumors. Synthetic lethality is an approach in oncology drug development that is focused on identifying and selecting patient subgroups with specific genomic alterations in tumors that are most likely to benefit from these therapies and improving tolerability and reducing toxicity by not affecting normal, non-cancerous cells.
 
Our goal is to limit the expression of DDR genes including BRCA1 and BRCA2, among other DDR genes, to shift DDR-proficient tumors into a sensitized DDR-deficient state. This would enable a synthetic lethality approach in DDR-proficient tumors via combination therapy with currently-approved PARP inhibitors.
 
Additionally, in published third party preclinical studies, CDK12 inactivation induced formation of large tandem duplications that expressed as fusion-induced neoantigens and synergized with ICIs to augment an enhanced anti-tumor immune response, which we anticipate will translate to a deeper and more durable clinical benefit.
 



CDK12 has a novel cysteine in the active site of the enzyme, enabling specificity via an irreversible (covalent) binding mode as described for our FGFR program. We have employed structure-based drug discovery efforts from an early co-crystal structure that led to identification of highly specific small molecules that covalently bind to and inhibit CDK12, as shown by the kinome profile in the figure below.
 
Figure 26: Selective CDK12 Kinase Enzymatic Inhibition as Demonstrated by Kinome Profiling of KIN004
 
 Kinome tree depicting kinase selectivity for KIN004 at 1000 nM across 275 kinases in single dose, duplicate measurements (272 kinases at Thermo Fisher Scientific and 3 kinases at Reaction Biology Europe GmbH). Percent (%) inhibition is relative to DMSO control. Kinases with >50% inhibition are shown with circle size indicating the relative potency as depicted in the legend. Kinome tree graphic was generated using CORAL (http://phanstiel-lab. Med.unc.edu/CORAL/).
 
Following kinome profiling, related CDK family members were tested in radiometric enzymatic assays and demonstrated a >40X selectivity of CDK12 compared to CDK7 and CDK9 and >50X selectivity of CDK12 compared to CDK2. These active sites are highly related among the CDK family members and these selectivity ratios enable specific targeting of CDK12 in vivo.
 
Figure 27: Inhibitory Concentrations 50% (IC50s) Determined from Dose-Response Inhibition Curves of Kinases Inhibited In the Kinome Profiling
 
 KIN004 follow-up 10-point dose response kinase assays demonstrated selective CDK12 inhibition compared to highly homologous CDK2, CDK7, and CDK9 family members. Results in the table represent IC50 averages (from curves fitted with a 4-parameter analysis) of greater than 3 independent experiments for CDK7, CDK9, and CDK12, and 2 independent experiments for CDK2 performed at Reaction Biology Europe GmbH. All radiometric assays were performed for 30 minutes with an optimal ATP concentration for the respective kinase.
 
In our preclinical studies, selective CDK12 pharmacological inhibition via biweekly, intravenous administration of a compound in the KIN004 program demonstrated tumor regressions at 25 mg/kg in two independent BRCA1/2 WT breast (HCC70 tumors) and ovarian (OVCAR-3) tumors implanted in athymic nude mice shown in the figure below. This is important as DDR-deficient tumors (e.g., BRCA1 mutant) are hypersensitive to both CDK12 and PARP inhibition. This proof of concept suggests that CDK12 inhibition impacted DDR pathways and has the potential to expand into patient populations beyond those settings that are currently approved for treatment with PARP inhibitors.
 



Figure 28: Anti-tumor Activity of KIN004 in DDR-proficient Breast and Ovarian Tumors In Vivo
 

HCC70 breast tumors (left) and OVCAR-3 ovarian tumors (right) represent BRCA1/2 WT cancers that were DDR-proficient and were not sensitized to PARP inhibitor treatment. KIN004 was dosed at 25 mg/kg twice per week by intravenous administration and tumor volumes represent averages of n=8 tumors / group +/-SEM.
 
Treatment of HCC70 tumor xenografts with 25 mg/kg KIN004 demonstrated a time-dependent inhibition of biomarkers known to be the target of CDK12 activity in the cell. The same HCC70 tumors demonstrated time-dependent inhibition of gene expression of known DDR genes including BRCA1 and BRCA2 shown in the central panel of the outlined figure below. As a control, MCL1 expression was measured as this gene is regulated by CDK7, and no change in expression was observed. The absence of any effect of KIN004 on gene expression of MCL1 confirmed the selective inhibition of CDK12 over CDK7 that was demonstrated in biochemical assays. This in vivo modulation of CDK12-regulated DDR genes in BRCA1/2 WT tumors further supports the mechanism by which DDR-proficient tumors are converted to a DDR-deficient state by selective pharmacological CDK12 irreversible inhibition.
 
Figure 29: CDK12 Inhibition Downregulated DDR Gene Expression In Vivo in Breast Tumors
 

(Left) HCC70 tumors treated with 25 mg/kg KIN004 demonstrated time-dependent inhibition of phosphorylation of RNA Polymerase II on serine 2. Middle (teal outlined cluster of 2 graphs): Treatment of HCC70 tumors with 25 mg/kg KIN004 decreased expression of BRCA1 and BRCA2 as expected since CDK12 activity is well-documented as regulating transcription of these and additional DNA damage response genes. (Right) KIN004 did not modulate MCL1 gene expression in vivo and signals selective CDK12 inhibition relative to CDK7 inhibition. CDK7 is known to regulate MCL1 gene expression, a proapoptotic gene, and lack of CDK7 inhibition is expected to leave MCL1 gene expression unaffected as depicted in the graph. All time points represent analysis of n=3 HCC70 tumors for each readout presented. In all figures above, black circles represent untreated tumors (Vehicle) for reference and teal circles represent tumors treated by intravenous administration with 25 mg/kg of KIN004.
 



We are currently optimizing an orally bioavailable compound series in the KIN004 program. Additionally, we are evaluating fusion-induced neoantigen generation with selective pharmacological CDK12 inhibition in mouse cancer models with intact immune systems. These “proof of mechanism” studies will enable combination efficacy experiments with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs - e.g., anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody) to understand the synthetic lethality potential of this combination approach. There is an evolving biological understanding of CDK12 inactivating mutations in prostate and ovarian cancers that produce fusion-induced neoantigens, sensitizing these tumors for combinations with ICIs. Currently ICIs are being tested clinically in patients with tumors with naturally occurring inactive CDK12.
 
Our Kinnate Discovery Engine is continuing to execute on target and lead identification to develop therapeutics that address oncogenic drivers in high unmet need populations. We are exploring intrinsic and acquired resistance mechanisms to drugs that are currently approved or in development to improve clinical benefit and response rates. To enable efficiency, we are leveraging our global collaborations with leaders at a variety of academic centers, respected industry partners, and key opinion leader networks, to identify additional development opportunities that complement our internal research and development efforts.
 
Competition
 
The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, the expertise of our team, and our development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face increasing competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Additional mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors.
 
Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, and are more convenient or less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we can, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or could otherwise make our development more complicated. We believe the key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be efficacy, including DoR and breadth of coverage, safety and patient convenience.
 
For our RAF program, there are currently three BRAF-targeted kinase inhibitor drugs approved for use in Class I BRAF mutations: Novartis AG’s Tafinlar (dabrafenib), Genentech’s, a member of the Roche Group, Zelboraf (vemurafenib) and Pfizer’s Braftovi (encorafenib) are used in BRAF mutated melanomas. Tafinlar (dabrafenib) is also used in mutated NSCLC, anaplastic thyroid cancer, and unresectable and metastatic solid tumors, and Braftovi (encorafenib) is also used in mutated CRC. FORE-8394 / PLX8394, a BRAF homodimer disruptor, is currently in Phase 2 clinical trials with Fore Biotherapeutics. Second-generation BRAF dimer signaling inhibitors, such as naporafenib and belvarafenib (HM95573, RG6185) are designed to inhibit mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway signaling without causing paradoxical activation and are in Phase 1 or Phase 2 clinical trials with Erasca and Genentech / Hanmi Pharmaceutical co. ltd, respectively. Mapkure, LLC’s BGB-3245 and Day One Pharmaceuticals’ DAY101 are also currently in clinical development, along with other RAF inhibitors.

For KIN004, we own two issued United States patents, one pending United States patent application, and 29 pending patent applications in various markets outside of the United States, including Europe, China and Japan. The issued United States patent covers KIN004 as composition of matter and pharmaceutical compositions and is expected to expire in June 2039, absent any patent term extensions for regulatory delay. Any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications are expected to expire between June 2039 and December 2040, absent any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions for regulatory delay.
 



We also possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including related manufacturing processes and technology.
 
With respect to our product candidates and processes that we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue patent protection covering, when possible, compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies.
 
Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for patent applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The term of United States patents may be extended by delays encountered during prosecution that are caused by the USPTO, also known as patent term adjustment. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued United States patent that covers or claims an FDA-approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called patent term extension. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of oncology has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States are also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. Moreover, even our issued patents may not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides.
 
Commercialization
 
We intend to retain significant development and commercial rights to our product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, to commercialize our product candidates on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the United States and other regions. We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence or alter our commercialization plans.
Manufacturing
 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacturing if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our investigational product candidates, as well as our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates.
 



To date, we have obtained for our product candidates active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) from Patheon API Services, Inc. and Shanghai STA Pharmaceutical Co. and drug product from Serán BioScience, Inc., Patheon, Inc., and BioDuro LLC, some of whom we currently rely on as single-source contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs).
 
As we advance our product candidates through development, we will explore adding backup suppliers for the API and drug product for each of our product candidates to protect against any potential supply disruptions.
 
We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we may develop.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
U.S. Drug Development
 
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Drugs also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
 
Our product candidates are considered small molecule drugs and must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following:
 

• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each clinical trial may be initiated;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (GCP) requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for substantive review;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements assuring that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA filing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any current and future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
 



Preclinical Studies and IND
 
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events, which support subsequent clinical testing, and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature, plans for clinical studies and a proposed clinical protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.  Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
 
Clinical Trials
 
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an institutional review board (IRB) for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB must also approve the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries.
 
A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will generally accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles contained in the Declaration of Helsinki pursuant to 21 CFR 312.120(c)(4), incorporating the 1989 version of the Declaration, or with the laws and regulations of the foreign regulatory authority where the trial was conducted, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA), whichever provides greater protection of the human subjects, and with GCP and GMP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary, and the practice of medicine in the foreign country is consistent with the United States.
 
Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap.
 

• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose and dosing schedule required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use and its safety in use, and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These clinical trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, are conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
 
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. The sponsor is also responsible for submitting written IND safety reports, including reports of serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically significant increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
 



Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a clinical trial may move forward at designated check-points based on access to certain data from the clinical trial.
 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process, as performed by the manufacturing facility, must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of our product candidates. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their labeled shelf life.
 
We may be required to develop and implement additional clinical trial policies and procedures designed to help protect subjects from COVID-19 or other public health concerns. Since March 2020, the FDA has issued various COVID-19 related documents, including guidance on conducting clinical trials during the pandemic, Good Manufacturing Practices, remote interactive evaluations of drug manufacturing and bioresearch monitoring facilities, and drug product manufacturing and supply chain inspections, among others. Recently, President Biden announced that the administration intends to end the COVID-19 national and public health emergencies on May 11, 2023; however, the full impact of the termination of the public health emergencies on FDA and other regulatory policies and operations is unclear.
 
NDA Review Process
 
Following completion of the clinical trials, data is analyzed to assess whether the safety and efficacy of the investigational product has been demonstrated for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA is a request for approval to market the drug in the United States for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug.
 
The application must include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of the FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be legally marketed in the United States.
 
Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication.
 
The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification.
 
Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies and/or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA’s interpretation of data may differ from our interpretation.
 



Orphan Drugs
 
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product.
 
Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
 
If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. However, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication for which we are seeking approval, or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits.
 
In Catalyst Pharms., Inc. v. Becerra, 14 F.4th 1299 (11th Cir. 2021), the court disagreed with the FDA’s longstanding position that orphan drug exclusivity only applies to the approved use or indication within an eligible disease. In particular, the circuit court held that orphan-drug exclusivity for Catalyst’s drug blocked FDA approval of another drug for all uses or indications within the same orphan-designated disease, or Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS), even though Catalyst’s drug was approved at that time only for use in the treatment of LEMS in adults. Accordingly, the court ordered the FDA to set aside the approval of a drug indicated for LEMS in children. This decision created uncertainty in the application of orphan drug exclusivity. On January 24, 2023, the FDA published a notice in the Federal Register to clarify that while the agency complies with the court’s order in Catalyst, the FDA intends to continue to apply its longstanding interpretation of the regulations to matters outside of the scope of the Catalyst order – that is, the FDA will continue tying the scope of orphan-drug exclusivity to the uses or indications for which a drug is approved, which permits other sponsors to obtain approval of a drug for new uses or indications within the same orphan- designated disease or condition that have not yet been approved. It is unclear how future litigation, legislation, agency decisions, and administrative actions will impact the scope of the orphan drug exclusivity.
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA meeting with the FDA.
 
Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies.
 



A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM), which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. The FDA may withdraw drug approval or require changes to the labeled indication of the drug if confirmatory post-market clinical trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product.
 
Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently-approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or may decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.
 
FDA Regulation of Companion Diagnostics
 
A therapeutic product may rely upon an in vitro companion diagnostic for use in selecting the patients that will be more likely to respond to that therapy. If an in vitro diagnostic is essential to the safe and effective use of the therapeutic product and if the manufacturer wishes to market or distribute such diagnostic for use as a companion diagnostic, then the FDA will require separate approval or clearance of the diagnostic as a companion diagnostic to the therapeutic product. According to FDA guidance, an unapproved or uncleared companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational medical device unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. The sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations for clinical studies involving the investigational diagnostic device. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same clinical trial, if the clinical trial meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the clinical trial protocol, the investigational product(s), and subjects involved, a sponsor may seek to submit an IDE alone (e.g., if the drug has already been approved by the FDA and is used consistent with its approved labeling), or both an IND and an IDE.
 
Pursuing FDA approval/clearance of an in vitro companion diagnostic would require either a pre-market notification, also called 510(k) clearance, or a pre-market approval, or PMA, or a de novo classification for that diagnostic. The review of companion diagnostics involves coordination of review with the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health.
 
510(k) clearance process
 
To obtain 510(k) clearance, a pre-market notification is submitted to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet required the submission of a PMA application. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process may take three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take longer if the FDA requests additional information, among other reasons. In some cases, the FDA may require clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification submission, the FDA may request additional information, which may significantly prolong the review process. Notwithstanding compliance with all these requirements, clearance is never assured.
 
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or require a PMA. In addition, the FDA may make substantial changes to industry requirements, including which devices are eligible for 510(k) clearance, which may significantly affect the process.
 
De novo classification process
 
If a new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a different route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification process. This process allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. The FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk and requires PMA or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
 



Obtaining FDA marketing authorization, de novo down-classification, or approval for medical devices is expensive and uncertain, and may take several years, and generally requires significant scientific and clinical data.
 
PMA process
 
The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. The applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness, including information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for medical devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes extensive testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance and GMP requirements.
 
Post-approval Requirements
 
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse events and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as “off-label promotion,” and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials.
 
The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing.
 
The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 

• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention;
--+------------------------------


• | refusal to permit the import or export of products; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 



Similar to post-approval regulatory requirements that apply to drug products, for any medical devices that we may develop in the future, after a medical device is placed on the market, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the quality manufacturing requirements set forth in the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, labeling regulations, the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off label” uses, registration and listing, the Medical Device Reporting, or MDR, regulation (which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if the device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur), and the Reports of Corrections and Removals regulation (which requires manufacturers to report recalls and field actions to the FDA if initiated to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act). The FDA enforces these requirements by unannounced inspection, market surveillance and other means. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from an untitled regulatory letter or a warning letter, to more severe sanctions such as fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; refusing requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products; withdrawing 510(k) clearance or PMA approvals already granted; and criminal prosecution.
 
Other U.S. Regulatory Matters
 
Pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to various healthcare laws, regulation, and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Our conduct, including those of our employees, as well as our business operations and relationships with third parties, including current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors, customers, and others may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market, and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to:

• | The federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. Moreover, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal false claims, including the civil False Claims Act that can be enforced by private citizens through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and civil monetary penalties prohibit individuals or entities from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government, and/or impose exclusions from federal health care programs and/or penalties for parties who engage in such prohibited conduct. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), prohibits, among other things, executing or attempting to execute a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and their implementing regulations also impose obligations on covered entities such as health insurance plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain health care providers and their respective business associates, including mandatory contractual terms as well as their covered subcontractors, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires applicable manufacturers of covered drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to annually report to Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), information regarding certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, among others), and teaching hospitals, as well as information regarding ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers, state laws that require biotechnology companies to comply with the biotechnology industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and require the registration of their sales representatives, state laws that require biotechnology companies to report information on the pricing of certain drug products, and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 



Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. In addition, the distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act as well as other applicable consumer safety requirements.
 
The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.
 
U.S. Patent-term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
 
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA.
 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for a generic version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness or generate such data themselves.
 
European Union Drug Development
 
Similar to the United States, the various phases of preclinical and clinical research in the European Union are subject to significant regulatory controls. Although the EU Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC has sought to harmonize the EU clinical trials regulatory framework, setting out common rules for the control and authorization of clinical trials in the EU, the EU Member States have transposed and applied the provisions of the Directive differently. This has led to significant variations in the member state regimes. Under the current regime, before a clinical trial can be initiated, it must be approved in each of the EU countries where the clinical trial is to be conducted by two distinct bodies: the National Competent Authority (NCA), and one or more Ethics Committees (ECs). Under the current regime all suspected unexpected serious adverse reactions to the investigated drug that occur during the clinical trial have to be reported to the NCA and ECs of the Member State where they occurred.
 



The EU clinical trials legislation currently is undergoing a transition process mainly aimed at harmonizing and streamlining clinical-trial authorization, simplifying adverse-event reporting procedures, improving the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Recently enacted Clinical Trials Regulation EU No 536/2014, which entered into application on January 31, 2022, ensures that the rules for conducting clinical trials in the EU will be identical and simplifies the rules for clinical trial authorization and standards of performance.
 
European Union Drug Review and Approval
 
In the European Economic Area (EEA), which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union and three European Free Trade Association States (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein), medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (MA). There are two types of marketing authorizations.

• | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, advanced-therapy medicines such as gene-therapy, somatic cell-therapy or tissue-engineered medicines and medicinal products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a Member State of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another Member States through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any Member State at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various Member States through the Decentralized Procedure. Under the Decentralized Procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the competent authorities of each of the Member States in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the Reference Member State (RMS). The competent authority of the RMS prepares a draft assessment report, a draft summary of the product characteristics (SmPC), and a draft of the labeling and package leaflet, which are sent to the other Member States (referred to as the Member States Concerned) for their approval. If the Member States Concerned raise no objections, based on a potential serious risk to public health, to the assessment, SmPC, labeling or packaging proposed by the RMS, the product is subsequently granted a national MA in all the Member States (i.e., in the RMS and the Member States Concerned). 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Under the above described procedures, before granting the MA, EMA or the competent authorities of the Member States of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy. Similar to the U.S. patent term-restoration, Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) serve as an extension to a patent right in Europe for up to five years. SPCs apply to specific pharmaceutical products to offset the loss of patent protection due to the lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval.
 
Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Sales of our products, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis.
 
Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained.
 



In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics.
 
In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower.
 
Healthcare Reform
 
The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of HHS as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Additionally, for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer.
 
Since its enactment, there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the BBA), among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D drug plans. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court held that Texas and other challengers had no legal standing to challenge the ACA, dismissing the case on procedural grounds without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Thus, the ACA will remain in effect in its current form. In January 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order that initiates a special enrollment period to allow people to obtain health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace, and instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, among others. It is possible that the ACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how any such challenges and healthcare measures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact the ACA, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
 
Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2031, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations.




Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, effective January 1, 2024, the statutory cap on Medicaid Drug Rebate Program rebates that manufacturers pay to state Medicaid programs will be eliminated. Elimination of this cap may require pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay more in rebates than it receives on the sale of products, which could have a material impact on our business. In August 2022, Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, which includes prescription drug provisions that have significant implications for the pharmaceutical industry and Medicare beneficiaries, including allowing the federal government to negotiate a maximum fair price for certain high-priced single source Medicare drugs, imposing penalties and excise tax for manufacturers that fail to comply with the drug price negotiation requirements, requiring inflation rebates for all Medicare Part B and Part D drugs, with limited exceptions, if their drug prices increase faster than inflation, and redesigning Medicare Part D to reduce out-of-pocket prescription drug costs for beneficiaries, among other changes. The impact of these legislative, executive, and administrative actions and any future healthcare measures and agency rules implemented by the Biden administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is unclear. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our product candidates if approved.
 
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, a number of states are considering or have recently enacted state drug price transparency and reporting laws that could substantially increase our compliance burdens and expose us to greater liability under such state laws once we begin commercialization after obtaining regulatory approval for any of our products. We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation in the United States directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature, or extent of health reform initiatives that may arise from future federal and state legislation or administrative action. If we or any third parties we may engage are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or the adoption of new requirements or policies, or if we or such third parties are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, our product candidates may lose any regulatory approval that may have been obtained and we may not achieve or sustain profitability.
 
Facilities
 
Our offices are located in San Francisco and San Diego, California. In San Francisco, we lease 5,698 square feet of office space, under a lease that expires on June 30, 2026, with an option to extend for an additional three years at the end of the initial term. In San Diego, we occupy 8,088 square feet of office space under a lease which commenced in March 2022 for an initial term of five years and four months. We believe that our facilities are sufficient to meet our current needs and that suitable additional space will be available as and when needed.
 
 Corporate Responsibility
 
Overview
 
We believe it is our responsibility and duty to patients to utilize and expand our drug discovery capabilities and to create a broad portfolio of targeted oncology product candidates.
 
In 2022, we examined our environmental, social and governance (ESG) practices and with support from senior management and cross-functional contributions by human resources, legal department and investor relations/corporate communications personnel, we are advancing our efforts to mitigate relevant ESG risks appropriate for a company of our stage and size. Our board of directors and executive management team oversee our overall strategy, risk management and corporate governance and sustainability.

 
 Social
 
We are committed to driving social impact through our product candidate pipeline and operating in a way that is respectful and inclusive of all stakeholders. As a clinical-stage precision oncology company, our product candidates have not achieved marketing authorizations in any global geography. In 2022, we spent $88.2 million on research and development activities—a 31% increase over 2021. We currently have two programs in the clinic and multiple undisclosed programs in research stage.
 



 We believe our two clinical product candidates, exarafenib and KIN-3248, could help over 100,000 patients and their caregivers. For example, for exarafenib, patients with BRAF Class II or Class III alterations have no approved targeted therapy treatment options today and for KIN-3248, patients who have been treated with first-generation FGFR inhibitors often develop resistance to treatment, which shortens their duration of response. We estimate that each month of life extension for patients could lead to a risk-adjusted lifetime value for all patients of over $1 billion from both programs. Further, caregivers of patients with cancer typically need to significantly change their lives to provide care, which can lead to increased psychological morbidity and economic burden. Approximately 50% of caregivers experience severe decline of quality of life. Providing new treatment options for patients who are currently underserved could improve caregivers’ quality of life.

Below are additional examples that demonstrate our commitment to social impact.

 
 Drug Safety & Quality

 
 The safety of patients in our clinical trials is a company-wide focus. We conduct ongoing assessments of the safety risk profile of our product candidates throughout all stages of development.

• | Before entering clinical trials, our product candidates are subjected to preclinical testing to evaluate their potential for therapeutic benefit in humans. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability, and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential toxicity and biological activity. We are committed to the ethical use of animals in preclinical testing. Animal studies are carefully reviewed by an Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC), which is charged with ensuring that a proposed preclinical study is essential. IACUC review is required by U.S. federal and state laws. Additionally, we adhere to the principles of the "Three Rs"—Replacement, Reduction and Refinement—the ethical principles that are embedded in the conduct of animal-based science. Replacement refers to technologies or approaches that directly replace or avoid the use of animals in studies where they would otherwise have been used. Reduction refers to methods that minimize the number of animals used per study consistent with scientific aims. Refinement refers to methods that minimize the pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm that may be experienced by research animals, and which improve their welfare.

• | Potential safety concerns are communicated to researchers, participants and regulators in compliance with FDA, EU and other global regulations and global industry Good Vigilance Practice (GVP). All pharmacovigilance activities are conducted under internal standard operating procedures or those of our contracted partners. All relevant staff undertake training on pharmacovigilance processes. We also monitor the quality of the safety work done by our partners and confirm adherence to regulations and guidelines. We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for any of our product candidates. Instead, we rely on third-party CMOs to supply the required raw materials and finished products for our preclinical studies and clinical trials. These CMOs are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) regulations. The cGMP regulations require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, as well as corresponding maintenance of records and documentation.

Clinical Trials

 
 
• | We comply with Good Clinical Practice (GCP) for designing, conducting, recording and reporting clinical trials. GCP is an international ethical and scientific quality standard that is provided by the International Council on Harmonization. Compliance with this standard provides public assurance that the rights, safety and well-being of clinical trial patients are protected and that the clinical trial data are credible. For each of our clinical trials, an Informed Consent Form (ICF) template is developed and submitted to an Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee for approval before adoption. The ICF provides information regarding the rights of clinical trial patients and includes relevant contact information in the event of a concern or complaint.

We believe that diversity of viewpoints, backgrounds, professional experiences, education and personal characteristics, including gender, race, ethnicity, national origin, age, sexual orientation, gender identity and other similar demographics cultivate a cohesive and productive work environment.

--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environmental
 
We are committed to minimizing the environmental impacts of our business. We currently do not operate laboratory facilities and therefore have limited hazardous waste. We encourage all employees to reduce waste and emissions through recycling and other energy conservation measures. The following are a few of the initiatives that demonstrate our commitment to environmental impact:

• | Our employees are required to promptly report any known or suspected violations of environmental laws or any events that may result in a discharge or emission of hazardous materials.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have recycling in our offices .
--+-----------------------------------


• | We minimize use of disposable bottles and printing of paper.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our facility in San Diego is LEED certified. LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is the most widely used green building rating system in the world.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have commuter benefits programs in place that encourage employees to walk, bike or utilize public transportation instead of cars for their commutes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We encourage video conferencing for non-essential meetings to reduce travel and commute emissions.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Governance
 
We are committed to transparent, efficient and fair business practices and have established a robust governance infrastructure to facilitate this. We expect everyone working for and with us to always act with integrity.

 
 
• | Our board of directors is currently chaired by an independent Chair. As a general policy, our board of directors believes that separation of the positions of Chair of our board of directors and Chief Executive Officer reinforces the independence of our board of directors from management, creates an environment that encourages objective oversight of management’s performance and enhances the effectiveness of our board of directors as a whole. As such, our Chief Executive Officer serves in that role (in addition to serving as our President) while the Chair of our board of directors serves in that role but is not an officer. We currently expect the positions of Chair of our board of directors and Chief Executive Officer to continue to be held by two individuals in the future.
