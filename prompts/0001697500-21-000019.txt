Item 1.      Business
Our Company
We are a Houston, Texas based business that designs and manufactures specialized equipment, which combined with field technician support, logistics services and our software solutions, enables us to provide a service offering that helps oil and natural gas operators and their suppliers drive efficiencies and reduce costs during the completion phase of well development. Our equipment and services are deployed in most of the active oil and natural gas basins in the United States. For a discussion of our Organizational Structure, See Part II, Item 6 “Selected Financial Data.”
Products and Services
We provide several products and services designed to increase efficiency, ensure reliable supply and reduce logistical costs to deliver and manage proppant and chemicals used during the completion phase of oil and gas well development. Our primary offerings include:

(1) | Systems – We provide equipment to manage the delivery, handling and storage of proppant and chemicals at the well site. Our systems are highly mobile and can be easily deployed to any North American basin. We use digital technology and machine learning to provide customers with customizable data tracking and analytics around sand usage, measurement accuracy and trucking logistics.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


a. | Mobile Proppant Management System – Our patented mobile proppant management systems typically store approximately 2.5 million pounds of proppant in a six-silo configuration and provide 24 unloading points for pneumatic trucks to deliver proppant into the silos. We also offer a non-pneumatic kit that allows our system to receive proppant from belly dump trucks. We believe our six-silo system provides increased inventory capacity compared to other systems, which reduces the amount of truck demurrage, or wait time, at the well site. Our systems are scalable in increments of three, including our 12-silo configuration, which provides a larger buffer to help manage increased proppant loadings and trucking logistics. Design enhancements include our AutoHopperTM technology, which automates the delivery of proppant into the blender and the addition of belt scales for improved measurement accuracy and data analytics around sand usage.

b. | Mobile Chemical Management System – Our patent-pending mobile chemical management systems typically contain three silos, one base unit, and a system of pumps, meters and hoses to measure and deliver up to six different completion chemicals to the pressure pumping company’s blender. The three-silo configuration provides increased inventory capacity and control in a smaller footprint when compared to traditional storage and delivery methods which typically include a chem add unit, frac tanks, ISO tanks and dozens of manually operated totes on flatbed trailers.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c. | Digital Inventory Software – Each of our systems is equipped with sensors and our integrated Solaris Lens® software system that enables our customers to track inventory and throughput volumes of each silo or silo compartment on a remote and real-time basis. With the integration of third-party trucking applications, we can provide full visibility of the proppant and chemical from the vendor to the well site supply chain for certain customers.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(2) | Field and Logistics Services – We provide trained personnel to support our systems, train our customers to operate the systems and assist in the transportation of our systems. In addition, we provide last mile proppant logistics services, including managing trucking logistics from source to well site.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Transloading Services – At our Kingfisher Facility in Oklahoma, we provide rail transloading services, store rail cars and provide forward staging storage of proppant and other industrial materials.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Properties 
Our corporate headquarters are located at 9811 Katy Freeway, Suite 700, Houston, TX 77024, and our offices are leased. Our other properties include:
Early, TX
We manufacture our systems in our facility in Early, Texas (the “Early Facility”). We own the Early Facility, and its location in central Texas provides convenient access to several of our most active operating areas, including the Permian Basin, the Eagle Ford Shale, the Haynesville Shale and the SCOOP/STACK formations.
Kingfisher, OK
Our 300 acre transload facility in Kingfisher, Oklahoma (the “Kingfisher Facility”), which is leased, is located central to the SCOOP/STACK plays and is capable of servicing multiple large volume customers through transloading, forward staging or storage services. The assets of the Kingfisher Facility were impaired during the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of reduced activities. 
Suppliers
We have built long-term relationships with third-party suppliers to both transport equipment and products and provide certain materials used in the manufacturing and maintenance of our systems. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, one supplier, Automatize Logistics, LLC, a provider of third party trucking services, accounted for approximately 24% and 19%, respectively, of our total spending.
To date, we have been able to obtain the third party-trucking services necessary to support our operations on a timely basis. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of third-party trucking services by one or more of our suppliers, we may not always be able to do so. We do not currently have long-term agreements with third-party trucking suppliers and could experience shortages and price increases in the future.
Our Customers and Contracts
Our primary customers are major E&P and oilfield service companies. We generally execute master service agreements ("MSAs") with our customers. Generally, the MSAs govern the relationship with our customers with specific work performed under individual work orders. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Devon Energy Corporation accounted for approximately 14% of our total revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2019, Devon Energy Corporation and ProPetro Services, Inc., accounted for approximately 19% and 10%, respectively, of our total revenue.
Competition 
The oil and natural gas services industry is highly competitive. We face competition from numerous proppant and chemical producers and proppant and chemical transporters who also offer solutions for unloading, storing and delivering proppant and chemicals at well sites and also from competitors who are focused on developing more efficient proppant and chemical logistic solutions. Our main competitors include U.S. Silica, Proppant Express Solutions, LLC and Hi-Crush Partners LP. We also face competition from pressure pumping, logistics and sand companies that own their own proppant and chemical handling equipment. Many of these companies may be customers of ours on certain jobs while also utilizing their own equipment on other jobs.

We believe that the principal competitive factors in the markets we serve are equipment reliability, technical expertise, patented-protected technology, unique services offerings, equipment capacity, transportation and storage, work force competency, efficiency, safety record, reputation, experience and price. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competitors by delivering the highest-quality services and equipment possible, coupled with superior execution and operating efficiency in a safe working environment.
Seasonality
Our business is not significantly impacted by seasonality, although our fourth quarter activity has historically been impacted by holidays and our clients’ budget cycles, during which we may experience declines in our operating results.
In addition, we provide our proppant and chemical systems and services to E&P companies operating in oil and natural gas producing basins where severe weather conditions may curtail drilling activities and, as a result, impact our revenues generated from those regions. For a discussion of the impact of weather on our operations, please see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Seasonal weather conditions and natural disasters could severely disrupt normal operations and harm our business.”
Human Capital
We believe that our employees are the foundation to fostering our innovative culture, the safe operation of our assets and delivery of services to our customers. We foster a collaborative, inclusive, and safety-minded work environment, focused on working safely every day. We seek to identify qualified internal and external talent for our organization, enabling us to execute on our strategic objectives.
As of December 31, 2020, we employed 125 employees overall, who were employed pursuant to an administrative services agreement that primarily supports our operations. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to fostering a work environment in which all employees treat each other with dignity and respect and are continually striving to attract a diverse workforce. Our employee demographic profile allows us to promote inclusion of thought, skill, knowledge, and culture across our operations to achieve our social obligations, commitments and to drive enhanced decision making and execution for the business. We are proud of the diversity of our workforce and promote inclusion at all levels of our organization. As of December 31, 2020:

(1) | Females represented approximately 16% of our organization and 24% of supervisory or managerial roles.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Minorities represented 28% of our organization and 21% of supervisory or managerial roles.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Health and Safety
Safety is a core value of ours and begins with the protection and safety of our employees. We value people above all else and remain committed to making safety and health our top priority. To protect our employees, contractors, and surrounding community from workplace hazards and risks, we implement and maintain an integrated system of policies, practices, and controls, including requirements to complete regular detailed safety and regulatory compliance training for all applicable individuals.
In response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we moved early and quickly to protect the health and safety of our employees and are continuing to proactively manage our response to an evolving national and global situation. We took several strategic and proactive measures in response to information from the Centers for Disease Control and the local, state and national authorities to try to minimize the risk of business disruption and to protect our ability to deliver reliable services to our customers. Some of these actions include forming a critical response team of senior management to collaborate, review and execute our business response to the pandemic, instituting social distancing practices and routine deep cleaning protocols at all facility locations to manage the spread of COVID-19, permitting our non-essential 

7



employees to work remotely until further notice, where applicable, and implementing plans for safely returning to our offices over time. Working remotely and under our revised policies has not significantly impacted our ability to maintain operations or caused us to incur significant additional expenses; however, we are unable to predict the duration or ultimate impact of these measures. 
Environmental and Occupational Health and Safety Regulations 
Our business operations are subject to stringent federal, tribal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing occupational health and safety, the discharge of materials into the environment and environmental protection. Numerous governmental entities, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations and the permits issued under them, often requiring difficult and costly actions, including the incurrence of potentially significant capital or operating expenditures to mitigate or prevent releases of materials from our equipment, facilities or from customer locations where we provide products and services. These laws and regulations may, among other things require the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities; restrict the types, quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment; require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations; impose specific safety and health criteria addressing worker protection; and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations and support services. For further information on the risks related to the effects that environmental, health and safety and other governmental regulations have on our business, see Part I, Item 1A.” Risk Factors”.
The more significant of these existing environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations include the following U.S. legal standards, as amended from time to time:

(1) | the Clean Air Act (“CAA”), which restricts the emission of air pollutants from many sources and imposes various pre-construction, operational, monitoring, and reporting requirements, and that the EPA has relied upon as authority for adopting climate change regulatory initiatives relating to greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, which regulates discharges of pollutants from facilities to state and federal waters, including wetlands, and establishes the extent to which waterways are subject to federal jurisdiction and rulemaking as protected waters of the United States;
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which, among other things, subjects owners and operators of onshore facilities to liability for removal costs and damages arising from an oil spill in waters of the United States;
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (“CERCLA”), which imposes liability on generators, transporters, disposers and arrangers of hazardous substances at sites where hazardous substance releases have occurred or are threatening to occur;
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”), which governs the generation, treatment, storage, transport, and disposal of solid wastes, including hazardous wastes;
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(6) | the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”), which ensures the quality of the nation’s public drinking water through adoption of drinking water standards and controlling the injection of waste fluids into below-ground formations that may adversely affect drinking water sources;
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(7) | the Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes workplace standards for the protection of the health and safety of employees, including the implementation of hazard communications programs designed to inform employees about hazardous substances in the workplace, potential harmful effects of these substances, and appropriate control measures;
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(8) | the Endangered Species Act, which restricts activities that may affect federally identified endangered and threatened species or their habitats by the implementation of operating restrictions or a temporary, seasonal, or permanent ban in affected areas; and
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8




(9) | the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) regulations, which relate to advancing the safe transportation of energy and hazardous materials and emergency response preparedness.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As a result of operating on properties that have been used for crude oil and natural gas wellsite support services for many years, regulations such as CERCLA and RCRA could impose significant liability and costs associated with damages to natural resources or remediation, an accidental release of materials into the environment and costs related to clean-up of third-party sites. Additionally, there exist regional, state and local jurisdictions in the United States where we operate that also have, or are developing or considering developing, similar environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations governing many of these same types of activities. We have incurred and will continue to incur operating and capital expenditures, some of which may be material, to comply with environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations and such costs may have a material adverse effect on our business and operational results in the future.
If existing regulatory requirements or enforcement policies change or new regulatory or enforcement initiatives are developed and implemented in the future, we or our customers may be required to make significant, unanticipated capital and operating expenditures. Examples of recent regulations or other regulatory initiatives in the United States include the following: 

(1) | Hydraulic Fracturing. At the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority under the SDWA over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and published permitting guidance for such activities. Additionally, the EPA issued a final regulation under the Clean Water Act prohibiting discharges to publicly owned treatment works of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities and released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that "water cycle" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances. While the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered but refused to adopt federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, with President Biden taking office and the shift in party control of the Congressional Senate in January 2021, there is a possibility that the Biden Administration will pursue such regulation through legislation or executive order. At the state level, many states have adopted legal requirements that have imposed new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, including states where our customers operate. States could also elect to place prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing and local governments may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place or manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. Finally, water is an essential component of shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Our customers' access to water to be used in these processes may be adversely affected due to reasons such as periods of extended drought, private, third party competition for water in localized areas or the implementation of local or state governmental programs to monitor or restrict the beneficial use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to assure adequate local water supplies. 
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Induced Seismicity. In recent years, wells used for the disposal by injection of flowback water or certain other oilfield fluids below ground into non-producing formations have been associated with an increased number of seismic events, with research suggesting that the link between seismic events and wastewater disposal may vary by region and local geology. In response to these concerns, regulators in some of the states in which our customers operate have adopted additional requirements related to seismicity and its potential association with hydraulic fracturing. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal. 
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | Ground-Level Ozone Standards. In 2015, the EPA issued a final rule under the CAA, making the National Ambient Air Quality Standard ("NAAQS") for ground-level ozone more stringent. Since that time, the EPA has issued area designations with respect to ground-level ozone. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of our or our customers' equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and significantly increase our or our customers' capital expenditures and operating costs. 
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(4) | Climate Change. In the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level, but President Biden has made addressing climate change one of his Administration’s top four priorities, has already signed several executive orders to this effect in January 2021 and is expected to pursue legislative as well as other executive and regulatory initiatives in the future to limit GHG emissions. Moreover, because the U.S. Supreme Court has held that GHG emissions constitute a pollutant under the CAA, the EPA has adopted rules impacting the oil and gas sector and relating to permitting, monitoring, reporting or restricting GHG emissions, such as methane. In recent years, there has been considerable uncertainty surrounding regulation of the emissions of methane, with the Obama Administration first implementing performance standards in 2016 and the Trump Administration subsequently taking measures to delay implementation of those standards, including issuing final policy amendments in September 2020 that, among other things, rescinded the 2016 methane standards. Various industry and environmental groups are separately challenging both the 2016 standards and the September 2020 final policy amendments, and President Biden has issued an executive order on January 20, 2021 that, among other things, called for issuance of proposed rules by no later than September 2021 that would restore the Obama-era Administration’s rules for methane standards applicable to new, modified, and reconstructed sources and establish new methane and volatile organic compound standards applicable to existing oil and gas operations, including the production, transmission, processing and storage segments. Separately, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, President Biden issued an executive order on January 20, 2021 recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement, which the United States under the Trump Administration had withdrawn from effective November 4, 2020. In other political actions, the Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Interior issued an order, effective immediately on January 20, 2021, that suspends new oil and gas leases and drilling permits on non-Indian federal lands and waters for a period of 60 days. Building on this suspension, President Biden issued an executive order on January 27, 2021 that suspends new leasing activities for oil and gas exploration and production on non-Indian federal lands and offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices that take into consideration potential climate and other impacts associated with oil and gas activities on such lands and waters. These January 20, 2021 and January 27, 2021 orders do not apply to existing leases, and the January 27, 2021 order further directs applicable agencies to take measures to eliminate fossil fuel subsidies from federal budget requests beginning in federal fiscal year 2022. Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of states, municipalities and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects and therefore are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers as well as other companies handling fossil fuels, as stockholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional investors who provide financing to fossil fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainability lending practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Finally, increasing concentrations of GHG in the earth's atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods, rising sea levels and other climatic events. 
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We are also subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA’s hazard communication standard, the EPA’s Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act and comparable state regulations and any implementing regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. We have an internal program of inspection designed to monitor and enforce compliance with worker safety requirements.

Additionally, as part of the services we provide, we engage third parties that operate as motor carriers and therefore, are subject to regulation by the DOT and analogous state agencies. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, regulatory safety, equipment testing, driver requirements and specifications, and insurance requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may impact our operations, including increased costs, such as changes in fuel emissions limits, hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period and limits on vehicle weight and size. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes or municipal ordinances applicable to our logistics operations will be enacted and to what extent any such legislation or regulations could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations. 
Intellectual Property
We continuously seek to innovate our product and service offerings to improve our operations and deliver increased value to our customers and our software team is constantly designing and building increased software capabilities to enable efficient supply chain planning and management for our customers. As such, we seek patent and trademark protections for our technology when we deem it prudent, and we aggressively pursue protection of these rights. We believe our patents, trademarks, and other protections for our proprietary technologies are adequate for the conduct of our business and that no single patent or trademark is critical to our business. In addition, we rely to a great extent on the technical expertise and know-how of our personnel to maintain our competitive position, and we take commercially reasonable measures to protect trade secrets and other confidential and/or proprietary information relating to the technologies we develop.
As of December 31, 2020, we had six issued patents in the United States, five corollary patents issued in Canada and two corollary patents issued in Mexico; two utility patent applications in the United States, two in Canada, and one in Mexico. Each patent and patent application relates to our systems and services and other technologies. Our issued patents expire, if all of the maintenance fees are paid, between 2032 and 2039. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent, or whether the examination process will require us to narrow our claims. In addition, any patents may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalid, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them.
