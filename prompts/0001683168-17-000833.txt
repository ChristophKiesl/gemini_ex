ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 
On June 21, 2016 we closed on a debt restructuring transaction with our former secured lenders as described below in “Debt Restructuring.” Following the transaction, our focus has been on managing the oil and gas assets in which we continue to have an indirect minority interest. In addition, we continue to pursue distressed asset acquisitions in the Bakken and/or Three Forks and other formations that may be acquired with capital from our existing joint venture partners or other capital providers.
 
Effective April 2, 2012, we changed our name to Black Ridge Oil & Gas, Inc. Our common stock is traded on the OTCQB under the trading symbol “ANFC.”
 
Debt Restructuring
 
On March 29, 2016, the Company entered into an Asset Contribution Agreement with Black Ridge Holding Company, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“BRHC”) which was formed by the Company to contribute and assign to BRHC, all of the Company's (i) oil and gas assets (including working capital and tangible and intangible assets) (the “Assets”), (ii) outstanding balances under the credit agreement between the Company, as borrower, and Cadence Bank, N.A. (“Cadence”), as lender (the “Cadence Credit Facility”) and the outstanding balances under the credit agreement between the Company, as borrower, and affiliates (specifically, Chambers Energy Capital II, LP and CEC II TE, LLC (collectively, the “Chambers Affiliates”)) of Chambers Energy Management, LP (“Chambers”), as administrative agent (the “Chambers Credit Facility”), and (iii) all current liabilities related to the Assets, in exchange for 5% of the issued and outstanding Class A Units (the “Class A Units”) in BRHC (the “Asset Contribution”). On March 29, 2016, the Chambers Affiliates entered into a Debt Contribution Agreement between BRHC and the Chambers Affiliates, pursuant to which BRHC issued a number of Class A Units representing 95% of the Class A Units of BRHC to the Chambers Affiliates in exchange for the release of BRHC's obligations under the Chambers Credit Facility (the “Satisfaction of Debt” and, together with the Asset Contribution, the “BRHC Transaction”). Concurrent with the Satisfaction of Debt, each warrant originally issued with the Chambers Credit Facility was automatically retired and cancelled. The closing of the BRHC Transaction was subject to the Company obtaining the approval of stockholders holding a majority of its outstanding capital stock and to the Company having assigned the Cadence Credit Agreement to BRHC with Cadence’s consent, and BRHC and Cadence entering into any applicable amendment agreements related to such assignment and waiver of financial covenant ratio compliance for the quarter ended December 31, 2015 and quarter ending September 30, 2015. On June 21, 2016, the Company satisfied all of these conditions and, for accounting purposes, the BRHC Transaction was consummated. The parties have agreed that the BRHC Transaction, the Asset Contribution and the Satisfaction of Debt are effective, for valuation purposes, as of April 1, 2016.
 
The terms of the Class A Units of BRHC are set forth in the limited liability company agreement of BRHC (the “LLC Agreement”), which became effective upon the closing of the BRHC Transaction. All distributions by BRHC of cash or other property, and whether upon liquidation or otherwise, will be made as follows:
 

• | First, 100% to the Class A Members, pro rata, until each Class A Member has received distributions in aggregate totaling the then Class A Preference, which is an amount equal to a 10.0% internal rate of return on the invested capital amount.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
• | Second, 90% to the Class A Members, pro rata, and 10% to the Class B Members, pro rata, until such time as the aggregate distributions to Chambers equals 250% of the capital contribution of its Class A Units. 
• | Third, 80% to the Class A Members, pro rata, and 20% to the Class B Members, pro rata. 

 
BRHC is managed by the BRHC Board, which is responsible for the conduct of the day-to-day business of BRHC and the management, oversight and disposition of the assets of BRHC. The BRHC Board is comprised of three managers, consisting of two managers appointed by Chambers and one member from the Company.

In addition, under the LLC Agreement, Chambers committed to contribute up to $30 million cash (the “Chambers Investment Commitment”) to BRHC in exchange for Class A Units. At Closing, Chambers funded $10 million (the “Initial Chambers Investment”) of the Chambers Investment Commitment, the proceeds of which were used to reduce outstanding amounts owed by BRHC to Cadence under the Cadence Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes. The remaining $20 million (the “Subsequent Chambers Investment”), subject to certain conditions, may be called from time to time during the Investment Period by the board of managers of BRHC (the “BRHC Board”). The Initial Chambers Investment and any Subsequent Chambers Investment shall serve to proportionately reduce the Company's Class A Units percentage ownership in BRHC. The investment period shall be the lesser of three years or such time as the entire Chambers Investment Commitment has been called by the BRHC Board (the “Investment Period”). Any portion of Chambers Investment Commitment not called by the BRHC Board prior to the expiration of the Investment Period will be cancelled. In no event will Chambers be required to make a capital contribution in an amount in excess of its undrawn commitment.
 
The Company was granted 1,000,000 Class B Units in BRHC at the Closing of the BRHC Transaction. At the discretion of the BRHC’s Board of Managers, the Company may be granted additional Class B Units in BRHC, and in turn, the Company may transfer such Class B Units to certain members of the Company's management. Subject to certain conditions, the Class B Units will entitle the holders to participate in any future distributions of BRHC after distributions equal to the capital contributions and preferred return have been made to the holders of Class A Units of BRHC.
 
At the closing of the BRHC Transaction, the Company entered into a Management Services Agreement with BRHC. Under the Management Services Agreement, the Company provides services to BRHC with respect to the business operations of BRHC, including but not limited to locating, investigating and analyzing potential non-operator oil and gas projects and day-to-day operations related to such projects. The Company is paid a fee under the Management Services Agreement intended to cover the costs of providing such services and is reimbursed for certain third party expenses. The term of the Management Services Agreement commenced on the closing of the BRHC Transaction and continued indefinitely, unless terminated. The Management Services Agreement could be cancelled by either party without penalty after January 1, 2017 with a three month notice and is paid in advance at the beginning of each calendar quarter.
 
The summaries of the LLC Agreement, Management Services Agreement, Asset Contribution Agreement, and Debt Contribution Agreement above do not purport to be complete and are qualified by reference to the LLC Agreement, Management Services Agreement, Asset Contribution Agreement, and Debt Contribution Agreement which are filed as exhibits to the Company's Information Statement filed on Form Schedule 14C.
 
Cancelation of Management Services Agreement and Sale of BRHC Assets
 
On April 3, 2017, we were notified by BRHC of their termination of our Management Services Agreement and that they had finalized the sale of BRHC’s oil and gas assets to a third party. On April 3, BRHC signed a Contribution Agreement that provides for the transfer of ownership and title of all oil and gas assets held by BRHC in exchange for preferred membership interest in the acquiring LLC (the “BRHC Sale”). Consistent with the terms of the Management Services Agreement, we will be paid for our management services for the three month period ended June 30, 2017. Additionally, Chambers Energy Capital II, LP and CEC II TE, LLC , have agreed to purchase for cash our 3.88% equity share in BRHC, which is estimated to be approximately $1.1 million.
 
Business
 
Following the BRHC Transaction, our focus has been managing the oil and gas assets for BRHC in which we continued to have a minority interest. In addition, we continue to pursue distressed asset acquisitions in the Bakken and/or Three Forks and other formations that may be acquired with capital from joint venture partners or other capital providers (our partners).
 
We believe we create value through identifying and targeting acreage positions with attractive returns on the capital employed by evaluating, amongst other factors, reserve potential, operator performance, anticipated well costs and anticipated operating expenses.
 
With the experience and connections of our personnel in the Williston Basin region, we believe that we are able to create value for our partners through opportunistic acreage acquisitions. We believe our experience enhances our ability to identify and acquire high value acreage in the Bakken and Three Forks trends. Because we primarily identify minority interests in multiple drilling units, we are able to diversify our partners’ risk across numerous wells. We believe that our prospective success revolves around our ability to identify and acquire for our partners mineral leases to participate in drilling activities by virtue of their ownership of such rights and through our experience and the relationships we have developed in the Williston Basin and our experience in managing those investments for our partners.

Principal Agreements Affecting Our Ordinary Business
 
Our principal agreements for our continuing operations take the form of management service agreements, whereby our partners pay a fee to us for managing the business operations and day to day-to-day transactions of the business, and joint venture agreements, whereby joint ventures are funded by our partners and we are paid a fee to identify prospective oil and gas related investments for purchase and manage the day-to-day operations of those assets once purchased. Under the joint venture agreements, after certain investor hurdles are met, the Company will generally receive a share of profits in the joint venture. 
 
Employees
 
We currently have 8 full time employees. We may hire additional technical or administrative personnel as appropriate. However, we do not expect a significant change in the number of full time employees over the next 12 months based upon our currently-projected business plan. We are using and will continue to use the services of independent consultants and contractors to perform various professional services for us or on behalf of our partners. We believe that this use of third-party service providers enhances our ability to contain general and administrative expenses.
Office Locations
 
Our executive offices are located at 110 North Fifth Street, Suite 410, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55403. Our office space consists of approximately 2,786 square feet leased pursuant to an annual lease agreement that commenced on July 1, 2016.
Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas
 
We have not segregated our operations into segments or geographic areas.
