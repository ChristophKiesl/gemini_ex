--------+---------

 The following discussion of our business contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. When used in this report, the words intend, anticipate, believe, estimate, plan and expect and similar expressions as they relate to us are included to identify forward-looking statements. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements and are a result of certain factors, including those set forth under Risk Factors and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 Overview 
 Repligen (Repligen, the Company, we or our) is a bioprocessing-focused, global life sciences company bringing over 30 years of expertise and innovation to our customers. Our mission is to inspire advances in bioprocessing as a trusted partner in the production of biologic drugs that improve human health worldwide. Focused on cost and process efficiencies, we deliver innovative technologies that help set new standards in the way biologic drugs are manufactured. We develop and market a broad range of high-value products and flexible solutions that address critical steps in the production of biologic drugs  principally antibody-based therapeutics, recombinant proteins and vaccines  while ensuring that the highest drug quality and safety standards are upheld. 
 Since our strategic decision in 2012 to focus fully on building our bioprocessing business, we have expanded and diversified our portfolio beyond our legacy Protein A affinity ligands business to include a number of technology leading bioprocessing products that we sell direct to biopharmaceutical companies and CDMOs (contract development and manufacturing organizations) worldwide. Our dedicated team of professionals has substantial experience in biomanufacturing and works proactively with industry leaders and customers to develop innovative solutions that address pressure points in the bioproduction process. 
 Our bioprocessing products drive process efficiency, cost and yield improvements. In upstream processes, our XCell ATF filtration devices and protein cell culture supplements are used in clinical and commercial-stage manufacturing to improve biologic drug yields. In downstream processes, our Protein A ligands are a critical component of Protein A resins used to purify over 50 antibody-based drugs on the market and more than 350 in clinical development. Also in downstream processes, our OPUS pre-packed chromatography columns (PPCs) are used in the purification of clinical-stage biologics, and our Sius tangential flow filtration (TFF) cassettes are used to concentrate clinical and commercial-stage biologic drugs. 
 We manufacture and supply Protein A ligands through long-term agreements with major life sciences companies such as GE Healthcare and MilliporeSigma, who in turn produce and sell Protein A resins to end users (biopharmaceutical companies and CDMOs). We manufacture and supply our cell culture supplements through a distribution agreement with MilliporeSigma. 
 We market our chromatography and filtration products globally through a direct commercial organization in the United States and Europe with a combination of direct sales and distributors in Asia. Since 2014, we have invested in expanding our global commercial organization adding 30 sales, marketing, product management, service and applications personnel to form a 37-person commercial team. Our commercial and R&D teams have a track record of successfully launching new products and applications, as well as building new markets for acquired technologies. For example, since acquiring the XCell ATF business in 2014, we have rapidly expanded its market penetration through increased customer interaction, new products and expanded applications that increase flexibility and convenience while streamlining biomanufacturing workflow for our customers. 
 Our portfolio of bioprocessing products has expanded from our legacy Protein A line since 2011 through strategic acquisitions and internal product development. We have focused on building a portfolio of technology-leading products that we sell directly to end users. In 2016, we added the Sius TFF filtration line through our 
 
2 
 
 purchase of TangenX Technology Corporation (TangenX and the TangenX Acquisition), and we added a lab-scale pre-packed chromatography column line through our purchase of Atoll GmbH (the Atoll Acquisition). In 2014, we acquired the XCell ATF filtration line from Refine Technologies LLC (the Refine Acquisition). In 2011, we added to our Protein A ligands business and added cell culture growth factors through our acquisition of Novozymes Biopharma Sweden AG (the Novozymes Acquisition). Internally, we develop and market our process-scale OPUS pre-packed chromatography columns. Also through internal innovation, we have extended both our OPUS and XCell ATF product lines, to include more size options and technology features to benefit our customers. For example in 2016 we introduced a resin recovery feature on our largest OPUS columns (OPUS R) and we launched a single-use (disposable) alternative to our stainless steel XCell ATF Systems. 
 Many of our products are early in their adoption cycle, and together with the expansion of our commercial organization and strategic acquisitions, have contributed to product revenue expansion from $41.8 million in 2012, to $104.5 million in 2016. While all product franchises have grown, our diversification strategy has resulted in our direct product sales accounting for approximately 52% of our bioprocessing revenue in 2016, compared to approximately 20% in 2012. To meet increased demand for our products, we have increased and continue to increase the volume and scale of manufacturing at our two manufacturing facilities in the United States and Sweden and plan to expand manufacturing capacity at our newly acquired manufacturing facilities in the United States and Germany. 
 Customers use our products to produce initial quantities of drug for clinical studies, then scale-up to larger volumes as the drug progresses to commercial production following regulatory approval. Detailed specifications for a drugs manufacturing process are included in applications that must be approved by regulators, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency, throughout the clinical trial process and prior to final commercial approval. As a result, products that become part of the manufacturing specifications of a late-stage clinical or commercial process can be very sticky due to the costs and uncertainties associated with displacing them. 
 We were incorporated in May 1981 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Our principal executive offices are located at 41 Seyon Street, Waltham, Massachusetts 02453 and our telephone number is (781) 250-0111. 
 Our Market Opportunity 
 The global biologics drug market is estimated to be over $200 billion. This market includes therapeutic antibodies, recombinant proteins and vaccines. Antibody-based biologics alone accounted for approximately $90 billion of global biopharma revenue and represented a majority of the top 10 best-selling drugs across the pharmaceutical industry in 2016. Industry sources project the biologics market to grow at a rate of 8%-10% annually over the next five years, driven by strength in the monoclonal antibody (mAb) class of biologics, as evidenced by the rate of new approvals, expanded labels for marketed antibodies and the emergence of biosimilar versions of originator mAbs. For example, in 2016, a record ten antibodies (seven originator and three biosimilar antibodies) were approved by the FDA to treat a diverse range of diseases. 
 There are currently more than 300 mAbs in various stages of clinical development addressing a wide range of medical conditions including asthma, migraines and Alzheimers disease. 
 In addition to investments in the discovery and development of novel biologic drugs, there has been substantial investment in follow-on products (biosimilars) by generic and specialty pharmaceutical as well as large biopharmaceutical companies. We believe development of follow-on products is accelerating as the first major mAbs begin to come off patent in the European Union and United States. For example, there are at least 12 companies attempting to market the first Humira® (adalimumab) biosimilar, for which patent protection expired in the United States at the end of 2016. Also, due to the high cost of biologic drugs, many countries in the developing and emerging markets have been aggressively investing in biomanufacturing capabilities to supply 
 
3 
 
 lower cost alternatives or biosimilars for the local markets. We believe they are focused on innovative technologies that offer greater manufacturing flexibility, production yields and lower-costs through improved process efficiencies. 
 The Biologics Manufacturing Process 
 Manufacturing biologic drugs requires three fundamental steps. First, upstream manufacturing involves the production of the biologic by living cells that are grown in a bioreactor under controlled conditions. These cells, or factories, are highly sensitive to the conditions under which they grow, including the composition of the cell culture media and the growth factors used to stimulate increased cell growth and protein production, or titre. In the second, downstream step, the biologic must be separated and purified, typically through various filtration and chromatography steps. In the third stage of the process, the purified biologic drug is formulated, quality controlled and packaged into its final injectable form. 
 Biologics are generally high value therapies. Given the inherent complexities of the process and drug product, we have observed that manufacturers are seeking and investing in innovative technologies that address pressure points in the production process in order to improve yields. We see that manufacturers are also seeking technologies that reduce costs as the biologic drug moves through clinical stages and into commercial processes by adopting single-use technologies as well as other products that confer more flexibility and efficiency. 
 Our Strategy 
 We are focused on the development, production and commercialization of differentiated, technology-leading solutions or products that address pressure points in the biologics manufacturing process and deliver substantial value to our customers. We are committed to supporting our customers with strong customer service and applications expertise. 
 We intend to build on our recent history of developing market leading solutions and delivering strong financial performance through the following strategies. 
 

 | Continued innovation. We plan to capitalize on our internal technological expertise to develop products that address unmet needs in upstream and downstream bioprocessing. We intend to invest further in our core ligands business while developing platform and derivative products to support our growth factor, XCell ATF System and OPUS franchises.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Platforming our products. A key strategy for accelerating market adoption of our products is delivery of enabling technologies that become the standard, or platform, technology in markets where we compete. We focus our efforts on winning early-stage technology evaluations through direct interaction with the key biomanufacturing decision makers in process development labs. This strategy is designed to establish both early adoption of our enabling technologies at key accounts and accelerate the implementation of our products as platform products, thereby strengthening our competitive advantage and contributing to long-term growth.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Targeted acquisitions. We will selectively pursue acquisitions of innovative technologies and products. We intend to leverage our balance sheet to acquire technologies and products that improve our overall financial performance by improving our competitiveness and/or moving us into adjacent markets with common commercial call points.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Geographical expansion. We intend to expand our commercial presence by continuing to build out our global sales, marketing, field applications and services infrastructure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Operational efficiency. We seek to expand operating margins through capacity utilization and process optimization strategies designed to increase our manufacturing yields. We plan to invest in systems to support our global operations, optimizing resources across our global footprint to maximize productivity.

Our Products 
 Protein Products 
 Protein A 
 We are the leading provider of Protein A ligands, an essential component of Protein A chromatography resins (media) used in the purification of virtually all mAb-based drugs on the market (more than 50) or in development (more than 300). We manufacture multiple forms of Protein A ligands under long term supply agreements for major life sciences companies including GE Healthcare and MilliporeSigma, who in turn sell their Protein A chromatography media to end users (biopharmaceutical manufacturers). We have two manufacturing sites, one in Lund, Sweden and another in Waltham, MA, collectively supporting overall global demand for our Protein A ligands. On February 22, 2016, we amended our long term supply agreements with GE Healthcare to, among other things, extend the terms of the supply agreement relating to our Lund, Sweden facility through 2019. The supply agreement relating to our Waltham, MA facility runs through 2021. We also extended a long term supply agreement with MilliporeSigma for Protein A ligands through 2023. This dual manufacturing capability gives us strong business continuity and reduces overall supply risk for our major customers. 
 Protein A chromatography media is considered the industry standard for purification of antibody-based therapeutics (primarily mAbs, and also including bi-specific antibodies and antibody drug conjugates), due to the ability of Protein A to selectively bind to or capture antibodies from crude protein mixtures. Protein A media is packed into chromatography columns as the standard first step in a purification process. As a result of Protein As high affinity for antibodies, the product is highly purified and concentrated within this first capture step before moving to polishing steps. The global Protein A media market that we supply generates annual revenues of $350-$400 million. We expect continued growth for our Protein A ligands as new drugs are approved and biosimilar manufacturing accelerates. 
 Cell Culture Growth Factors 
 Most biopharmaceuticals are produced through a mammalian cell fermentation process. In order to stimulate increased cell growth and maximize overall yield from a bioreactor, manufacturers often add growth factors, such as insulin, to the cell culture fermentation media. As part of the Novozymes Acquisition, we acquired several cell culture growth factor additives. Among those products is LONG®R3 IGF-1, our insulin-like growth factor that has been shown to be 100 times more biologically potent than insulin (the industry standard), thereby increasing recombinant protein production in cell culture fermentation applications. LONG®R3 IGF-1 is currently used in the manufacture of several commercial biopharmaceutical products and is sold through a distribution partnership with MilliporeSigma. Our goal over the last few years with MilliporeSigma has been to focus on pipeline development and work with customers already familiar with the product to more broadly adopt LONG®R3 IGF-1 as a platform product. 
 We estimate that the current market for cell culture growth factors is $75-$80 million. We are gaining share of this market as customers displace insulin with LONG®R3 IGF-1. 
 Chromatography Products 
 Our chromatography portfolio includes a number of products used in the downstream purification and quality control of biological drugs. The main driver of growth in this portfolio is our OPUS pre-packed chromatography (PPC) column line. Our other products include Protein A chromatography resins used in a small number of commercial drug processes and ELISA test kits used by quality control departments to detect and measure the presence of leached Protein A and/or growth factor in the final product. In April 2016, we acquired the OPUS PD (formerly MediaScout) PPC manufacturing business through our acquisition of Atoll GmbH, expanding our chromatography portfolio into high throughput process development screening, viral validation studies and scale down validation of chromatography processes.

Chromatography columns, packed with chromatography media, are used in biomanufacturing to purify the biological drugs once separated, typically using filtration technology, from the contents of a bioreactor. For late-stage clinical and large commercial processes, stainless steel columns are standard, and are packed in-house by the biomanufacturer. For clinical stage manufacturing, biomanufacturers value the quick turnover, cost savings and convenience of using pre-packed columns such as OPUS versus traditional glass columns. 
 OPUS columns are pre-packed with purification media and are an efficient plug-and-play solution for our customers, and represent a growing area of our business. As biomanufacturers have become acutely focused on improving the drug development process, they are moving towards flexible manufacturing and disposable solutions such as OPUS. In recent years, we have observed customers moving away from in-house solutions (self-packed glass columns). They are starting to adopt the OPUS ready-to-use format due to convenience, flexibility and consistent product performance. OPUS columns save labor time, reduce overall costs and improve overall manufacturing efficiency, allowing biomanufacturers to reassign resources to higher value-add processes. 
 Our OPUS line is distinctly open platform, providing desirable opportunities for customization. For example, most biopharmaceutical manufacturers utilize three different chromatography media in a given process, and our flexible columns are designed to meet these needs. We differentiate ourselves in the pre-packed column space by packing any brand of chromatography media in OPUS to any bed height, ensuring the most convenient and efficient process for end users. The plug-and-play nature of our OPUS columns make them ideal for purification of antibodies and recombinant proteins. With the launch of OPUS 45cm diameter columns in 2014 and 60cm columns in 2015, we have further differentiated ourselves from our competitors who offer a limited number of column diameter and resin (media) options. By offering these larger columns, we are making inroads in the glass column market which customers typically self-pack. To address customer feedback and further enhance our product offering, we developed and launched in October 2016, OPUS R, which are OPUS pre-packed columns with an innovative side port for recovering chromatography resin from inside the column. This allows our customers to re-use the unpacked resin in other applications. The unpacking port feature will be available in the first quarter of 2017 on our largest production-scale OPUS columns; we refer to these as our OPUS 45R and OPUS 60R columns. 
 Pre-packed chromatography columns are at the early stages of adoption; we estimate that currently, we and our competitors collectively capture approximately 30% of a $165 million addressable market. As our sales force expands and we increase the number of call points, we are seeing more multi-site adoption of our OPUS pre-packed columns, including increased use by contract manufacturers and large pharma companies, where quick turnover of multiple production runs is critical to profitability. 
 Filtration Products 
 Sius Filtration Products 
 We acquired the Sius line of tangential flow filtration (TFF) cassettes and hardware as part of our acquisition of TangenX Technology in December 2016. The acquisition of this product line complements our OPUS line of pre-packed chromatography columns used in downstream purification of biologics, and extends our filtration portfolio beyond our upstream XCell ATF offering. 
 TFF is a rapid and efficient method for separation and purification of biomolecules that is widely used in laboratory, process development and process scale applications in biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Sius is an innovative single-use TFF line of cassettes and hardware for lab-scale through process-scale biopharmaceutical manufacturing. Single-use Sius TFF cassettes with enclosed flat sheet membranes are designed to provide a high performing membrane at significantly lower cost compared to reusable TFF products. Each disposable cassette is delivered pre-sanitized, integrity tested and ready to be equilibrated and used for tangential flow diafiltration and ultrafiltration processing. Internal studies demonstrate that utilizing Sius TFF in downstream processing provides 
 
6 
 
 equivalent or higher performance while reducing filter costs, labor and buffer usage, eliminating non-value added steps of cleaning and flushing required in alternative TFF products. Sius TFF cassettes are interchangeable with filter hardware from multiple manufacturers, simplifying customer trial and adoption of Sius products. 
 The market for TFF cassettes in downstream purification is estimated at $200 million. The Sius TFF products have started to move into this market over the last few years as more customers opt for the convenience of single-use solutions. We expect this business to grow rapidly over the next few years as the technology gets adopted and we drive a greater number of evaluations through our larger commercial organization. 
 XCell ATF 
 The XCell ATF System is a technologically advanced filtration device used in upstream processes to continuously remove cellular metabolic waste products during the course of a fermentation run, freeing healthy cells to continue producing the biologic drug of interest. XCell ATF was designed to both increase the density of cells in a bioreactor and extend the production run. By continuously removing waste products from the fermentor, the XCell ATF System routinely increases cell densities to 2- or 3-times the levels achieved by standard batch fermentation. As a result, product yield is increased, which improves facility utilization and can reduce the size of a bioreactor required to manufacture a given volume of biologic drug product. This is important to biomanufacturers who seek to maximize output from their existing facilities. 
 XCell ATF Systems consist of either a stainless steel or plastic housing that contains a hollow-fiber filter, plus an associated pump and controller. We sell the XCell ATF System in a variety of sizes (ATF 2, ATF 4, ATF 6, ATF 10) suitable for use in laboratory and scale-up all the way to production bioreactors as large as 2,000 liters. XCell ATF Systems are used in the production of several FDA-approved mAbs. 
 Following our acquisition of the XCell ATF System from Refine Technology in 2014, we integrated the production of XCell ATF into our operations in Waltham, MA. We also invested in and developed the single-use version of XCell ATF, which we launched in October 2016. The XCell ATF device is now available as the original stainless steel configuration (steel housing and replaceable filters) in all sizes, or as a single-use device (disposable housing/filter combination) in select sizes (ATF 2 su, ATF 6 su). The availability of XCell ATF in a single-use format eliminates the pre-use workflow associated with autoclaving, leading to an 80% reduction in implementation time. We expect these advancements will enable our customers to accelerate evaluations, eliminate autoclaving, simplify implementation time and lower initial overall cost of ownership. 
 We estimate that the current market for cell retention devices is approximately $125-150 million. Within this market, we expect continued growth for our XCell ATF portfolio over the next several years, as biologics manufacturing accelerates globally and as large pharmaceutical customers who have evaluated the system adopt the technology as platform. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research activities are focused on developing new bioprocessing products. Specifically, we plan to focus these efforts on our expanding our product portfolio and applications for our OPUS PPC, XCell ATF and Sius TFF products, and developing next generation Protein A ligands. Research and development expenses totaled approximately $7.4 million, $5.7 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Sales and Marketing 
 Our sales and marketing strategy supports our objective of establishing Repligen as a leading provider of products and services, addressing upstream, downstream and quality control needs of bioprocessing customers in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries. Through our products and brands, including Protein A,

 LONG®R3 IGF-1, OPUS, XCell ATF and Sius TFF, we provide premier offerings and services to our bioprocessing customers. We are committed to being a partner of choice for our customers with distributor and supply agreements in place for our growth factor and Protein A products with GE Healthcare and MilliporeSigma. On February 22, 2016, we amended our long term supply agreements with GE Healthcare to, among other things, extend the terms of the supply agreement relating to our Lund, Sweden facility through 2019. The GE Healthcare supply agreement relating to our Waltham, MA facility runs through 2021. We also extended a long term supply agreement for Protein A with MilliporeSigma through 2023. 
 We have invested in our commercial organization and now have 37 sales, marketing, product management and service individuals providing service and support to our expanding customer base. Our global sales organization has both distributor and direct sales personnel, depending on the market and application area. We will continue to expand our commercial organization to support increasing demand for our products. Our commercial organization also helps us identify market opportunities, including potential new technologies that we can license and develop into new products.

Patents, Licenses and Proprietary Rights 
 We consider patents to be an important element in the protection of our competitive and proprietary position and actively, and selectively, pursue patent protection in the United States and in major countries abroad. As further described below, we own or have exclusive rights to a number of U.S. patents and U.S. pending patent applications as well as corresponding foreign patents and patent applications. The expiration of key patents owned or licensed by us or the failure of patents to issue on pending patent applications could create increased competition, with potential adverse effects on our business prospects. 
 Other forms of market protection, including trade secrets and know-how, are also considered important elements of our proprietary strategy. Our policy is to require each of our employees, consultants, business partners and major customers to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of an employment, consulting, business relationship, or product related audit with us. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the other party during the course of the relationship with us is to be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. In the case of employees and consultants, the agreements generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to Repligen shall be our exclusive property and must be assigned to Repligen. 
 Protein A 
 We have developed proprietary technology, trade secrets, and know-how relating to the manufacture of recombinant Protein A at a scale and quality standard that is consistent with the requirements of the biopharmaceutical industry. In addition, in April 2010, we were granted U.S. Patent No. 7,691,608, Nucleic Acids Encoding Recombinant Protein A, which claims an isolated nucleic acid molecule that encodes a Protein A molecule with an amino acid sequence identical to that of the natural Protein A molecule, which has long been commercialized for bioprocessing applications. This U.S. patent, with the term adjustment that was granted, will remain in effect until June 2028. Foreign equivalents of this patent have been issued in Sweden, Netherlands, Great Britain, France, Germany and Canada. The claims of U.S. Patent No. 7,691,608 cover compositions of matter including isolated nucleic acids, expression vectors, bacterial cells that include the nucleic acids, as well as methods of producing truncated Protein A polypeptides, methods of producing affinity chromatography resins, and methods of purifying proteins. 
OPUS 
 In January 2012, we filed a provisional patent application with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) which covers certain unique features of our OPUS pre-packed columns. Pending claims that relate to these unique features cover methods of making and loading these chromatography columns and the columns themselves. The ease and flexibility of column packing, bed height adjustment and cleaning of these new columns is improved over existing pre-packed column designs. In January 2013, we filed an international patent cooperation treaty (PCT) application as well as a utility application with the USPTO on the basis of the provisional application. The OPUS pre-packed column patent application is pending in the United States, Europe, Hong Kong, India, and Japan, and patents have been granted in Australia and Canada. 
 XCell ATF Systems 
 As part of the Refine Acquisition, we acquired the exclusive rights to an issued U.S. patent (US 6,544,424) covering the Alternating Tangential Flow (ATF) System and a process related to the filtration of biologic fluids from a bioreactor through hollow fiber filters by the action of a diaphragm pump which creates alternating tangential flow through the filter. The patent expires in 2020. Another patent has been issued in the U.S. covering improvements on the original ATF design that include a screen filter module (US 9,050,547). This family of patents and applications has issued or is pending in Brazil, China, Europe (issued in Germany, France and Great Britain), India, Korea and Sweden. Other additional improvements on the original ATF systems and methods are 
 
9 
 
 covered by patents and patent applications pending in one or more of the U.S., Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, India, Japan, and Korea. These patents and patent applications expire between 2029 and 2033. 
 Spinal Muscular Atrophy 
 In 2009, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with a non-profit organization, FSMA, now called CureSMA, for worldwide rights to patent applications related to compositions and methods for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). FSMA had funded the development of these compounds and identified a novel enzyme target (DcpS) that these compounds inhibit. In 2011, we were granted U.S. Patent Nos. 7,888,366 (the 366 patent) and 7,985,755 (the 755 patent),both entitled 2,4 Diaminoquinazolines for Spinal Muscular Atrophy, with allowed composition claims that cover both the genus and the species of the chemical structures of the lead clinical candidates. The expiration date of the 366 patent is in 2028 with potential for patent term extension. The expiration date of the 755 patent is in 2027 with potential for patent term extension. U.S. Patent No. 9,067,897, which is a continuation of the 366 patent, was issued in 2015 and expires in 2027. Foreign equivalents of these U.S. patents have been issued and/or are pending in Australia, Canada, Europe, Hong Kong, Japan, and New Zealand. 
 Pursuant to the License Agreement, we licensed all of our intellectual property related to SMA to Pfizer and Pfizer assumed responsibility for maintaining existing intellectual property and prosecuting new intellectual property relating to this program. On January 26, 2015, Pfizer issued to us a notice of its termination of the License Agreement for convenience, effective as of April 26, 2015. On March 17, 2016, we entered into a Termination Agreement with CureSMA through which we returned all patent rights and transferred all related data and materials back to CureSMA. 
 Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors 
 In 2007, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with The Scripps Research Institute for worldwide rights to a patent application claiming compounds and methods for treating Friedreichs ataxia with inhibitors of histone deacetylase. We extended this original work and filed additional patent applications which claim both methods and compositions for treating Friedreichs ataxia. On January 21, 2014, we out-licensed all of our intellectual property related to HDAC to BioMarin, and BioMarin has assumed responsibility for maintaining existing intellectual property and prosecuting new intellectual property relating to this program. Our out-licensed HDACi portfolio included patent applications in the United States as well as patent applications in Europe, Canada, Japan and Australia. Patents, if any, that are granted in the U.S. based on these patent applications are expected to expire from 2029 to 2032. 
Licensing Agreements 
 HDAC Agreement with BioMarin 
 On January 21, 2014, we out-licensed our HDACi portfolio, which includes the Friedreichs ataxia program, to BioMarin Pharmaceuticals Inc. Friedreichs ataxia is an inherited disease that causes progressive damage to the nervous system resulting in symptoms ranging from impaired walking and speech problems to heart disease. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, BioMarin agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize HDACi portfolio product until the later of (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of an issued and unexpired patent or pending patent application claiming a compound included in the agreement or (ii) 10 years. Under the terms of the agreement, Repligen received an upfront payment of $2 million in January 2014 from BioMarin and we have the potential to receive up to $160 million in future milestone payments for BioMarins development, regulatory approval and commercial sale of portfolio compounds included in the agreement. These potential milestone payments are approximately 37% related to clinical development and 63% related to initial commercial sales in specific geographies. In addition, Repligen is eligible to receive royalties on sales of qualified products developed. The royalty rates are tiered and begin in the mid-single-digits for the first

 HDACi portfolio product and for the first non-HDACi portfolio product with lesser amounts for any backup products developed under the agreement. Repligens receipt of these royalties is subject to customary offsets and deductions. There are no refund provisions in this agreement. Royalties under this agreement are paid on a country-by-country basis during the period beginning on the first commercial sale of a compound in such country, until the later of: (i) the expiration of exclusivity period granted by a governmental authority to prevent the entry of generic product into such country; (ii) the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of an issued and unexpired patent or pending patent application claiming such compound in such country; or (iii) ten years following the first commercial sale of such HDACi portfolio product in any country. Royalty payments on products derived from the compounds included in the agreement are calculated by multiplying net sales of such product for the calendar year by an applicable royalty rate based on incremental net sale amounts. We have no further obligations to BioMarin. 
 RG1068 
 Our clinical development portfolio previously included RG1068, a synthetic human hormone we had developed as a novel imaging agent for the improved detection of pancreatic duct abnormalities in combination with magnetic resonance imaging in patients with pancreatitis and potentially other pancreatic diseases. On December 23, 2014, Innovate Biopharmaceuticals, Inc. (Innovate) acquired our RG1068 program for a nominal amount. Innovate is solely responsible for future development and commercialization of RG1068. If Innovate gains marketing approval and successfully commercializes RG1068, Repligen is eligible to receive royalties through the latter of ten years after the first commercial sale or the entry of a generic equivalent into the U.S. market. 
 Competition 
 Our bioprocessing products compete on the basis of quality, performance, cost effectiveness, and application suitability with numerous established technologies. Additional products using new technologies that may be competitive with our products may also be introduced. Many of the companies selling or developing competitive products, which in some cases includes GE Healthcare and MilliporeSigma, our two largest customers, have greater financial and human resources, research and development, manufacturing and marketing experience than we do. They may succeed in developing products that are more effective or less costly than any that we may develop. These competitors may also prove to be more successful in their production, marketing and commercialization activities. We cannot be certain that the research, development and commercialization efforts of our competitors will not render any of our existing or potential products obsolete. 
Manufacturing 
 We manufacture seven commercial forms of Protein A, including native Protein A for life sciences companies including GE Healthcare and MilliporeSigma under long-term supply agreements which expire between 2019 and 2023. Native Protein A is manufactured in Lund, Sweden, while the recombinant forms are manufactured in both Waltham, Massachusetts and Lund, Sweden. We currently manufacture our growth factor products in Lund, Sweden; our OPUS chromatography columns and XCell ATF System products in Waltham, Massachusetts; our OPUS PD columns in Weingarten, Germany; and our Sius TFF products in Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. 
 We generally purchase raw materials from more than one commercially established company and believe that the necessary raw materials are currently commercially available in sufficient quantities necessary to meet market demand. However, there are only a limited number of suppliers of materials related to the XCell ATF System products, one of which is the primary supplier of materials used for consumable XCell ATF System products. 
 We utilize our own facilities in Waltham, Massachusetts and Lund, Sweden as well as third party contract manufacturing organizations to carry out certain fermentation and recovery operations, while the purification, immobilization, packaging and quality control testing of our bioprocessing products are conducted at our facilities. Our facilities located in Waltham, Massachusetts; Lund, Sweden; and Weingarten, Germany are
