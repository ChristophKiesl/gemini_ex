General Development of Business
Overview
Watermark Lodging Trust, Inc. (“WLT”), formerly known as Carey Watermark Investors 2 Incorporated (“CWI 2”), is a self-managed, publicly owned, non-traded real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, invests in, manages and seeks to enhance the value of, interests in lodging and lodging-related properties in the United States. As a REIT, we are not subject to U.S. federal income taxation as long as we satisfy certain requirements, principally relating to the nature of our income, the level of our distributions to our stockholders and other factors. As of December 31, 2020, substantially all of our assets and liabilities are held by, and all of our operations are conducted through, CWI 2 OP, LP (the “Operating Partnership”) and we are a general partner and a limited partner of, and own a 99.0% capital interest in, the Operating Partnership. Watermark Capital Partners, LLC (“Watermark Capital”), which is 100% owned by Mr. Michael G. Medzigian, our Chief Executive Officer, holds the remaining 1.0% in the Operating Partnership as of December 31, 2020. In order to qualify as a REIT, we cannot operate hotels directly; therefore, we lease our hotels to our wholly-owned taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs” and collectively the “TRS lessees”). As of December 31, 2020, we held ownership interests in 31 hotels, with a total of 9,615 rooms.
On April 13, 2020, we executed a business combination transaction in which a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary (“Merger Sub”) of CWI 2 merged with and into Carey Watermark Investors Incorporated (“CWI 1”) in an all-stock transaction (the “Merger”), and we became self-managed, discussed in further detail below. Prior to the transaction, we were managed by Carey Lodging Advisors, LLC (the “Former Advisor”), an indirect subsidiary of W. P. Carey Inc. (“WPC”). The Former Advisor managed our overall portfolio, including providing oversight and strategic guidance to the independent hotel operators that managed our hotels. CWA, LLC (the “CWI 1 Subadvisor”), a subsidiary of Watermark Capital, provided services to the Former Advisor, primarily relating to acquiring, managing, financing and disposing of our hotels and overseeing the independent operators that managed the day-to-day operations of our hotels. In addition, the CWI 1 Subadvisor provided us with the services of our Chief Executive Officer, subject to the approval of our independent directors. Prior to the Merger and internalization of management discussed below, we had no employees. As of December 31, 2020, we had 29 employees. 
Merger of CWI 1 and CWI 2
On April 13, 2020, the Merger was completed in an all-stock transaction to create WLT. The Merger was effected pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 22, 2019 (as amended, the “Merger Agreement”), by and among CWI 2, CWI 1 and Merger Sub. 
In accordance with the Merger Agreement, at the effective time of the Merger (the “effective time”) each issued and outstanding share of CWI 1’s common stock (or fraction thereof), $0.001 par value per share (“CWI 1 common stock”), was converted into the right to receive 0.9106 shares (the “exchange ratio”) of WLT Class A common stock, $0.001 par value per share (“WLT Class A common stock”). Also at the effective time, all restricted stock units (“RSUs”) of CWI 1 outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the effective time were converted into an RSU of WLT with respect to a whole number of shares of WLT Class A common stock equal to (i) the number of shares of CWI 1 common stock subject to such unvested RSU of CWI 1, multiplied by (ii) the exchange ratio.
Immediately following the effective time of the Merger, the internalization of the management of the Company (the “Internalization”) was consummated pursuant to the Internalization Agreement, dated as of October 22, 2019 (as amended, the “Internalization Agreement”), by and among CWI 1, CWI OP, LP, the Operating Partnership, WPC, Carey Watermark Holdings, LLC, CLA Holdings, LLC, Carey REIT II, Inc., WPC Holdco LLC, Carey Watermark Holdings 2, LLC, the Former Advisor, Watermark Capital, the CWI 1 Subadvisor and CWA2, LLC (the “CWI 2 Subadvisor” and together with CWI 1 Subadvisor, the “Subadvisors”).
In accordance with the Internalization Agreement, CWI OP, LP and the Operating Partnership redeemed the special general partnership interests held by Carey Watermark Holdings, LLC and Carey Watermark Holdings 2, LLC in CWI OP, LP and the Operating Partnership, respectively (the “Redemption”). As consideration for the Redemption and the other transactions contemplated by the Internalization Agreement, WLT or the Operating Partnership (as applicable) issued equity consisting of (x) 2,840,549 shares of WLT Class A common stock, to affiliates of WPC, (y) 1,300,000 shares of WLT Series A preferred

stock, $0.001 par value per share, to affiliates of WPC, with a liquidation preference of $50.00 per share ($65,000,000 in the aggregate) (Note 15), and (z) 2,417,996 limited partnership units in the Operating Partnership, to affiliates of Watermark Capital. Following the Redemption, Carey Watermark Holdings, LLC and Carey Watermark Holdings 2, LLC have no further liability or obligation pursuant to the limited partnership agreements of CWI OP, LP or the Operating Partnership, respectively.
Immediately following the Redemption, the existing advisory agreements, as amended, between CWI 1 or CWI 2 (as applicable) and the Former Advisor, and the existing sub‑advisory agreements, as amended, between the Former Advisor and the Subadvisors (as applicable), were automatically terminated. The secured credit facilities entered into by CWI OP, LP or the Operating Partnership (as applicable) as borrower, and CWI 1 or CWI 2 (as applicable) as guarantor, with WPC as lender, each matured at the time of the expiration of such existing advisory agreements and the applicable loan agreements and loan documents were terminated. Neither CWI 1 nor CWI 2 had any outstanding obligations under the respective facilities.
COVID-19
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of COVID-19 to be a global pandemic and COVID-19 has continued to spread throughout the United States and the world. As a result of this pandemic and subsequent government mandates and health official recommendations, hotel demand was dramatically reduced. See further discussion in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
July 2020 Capital Raise
On July 21, 2020, we entered into a securities purchase agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) with ACP Watermark Investment LLC (the “Purchaser”) and, solely with respect to a guaranty, certain other parties thereto. Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company issued and sold to the Purchaser 200,000 shares of 12% Series B Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, liquidation preference $1,000.00 per share (the “Series B Preferred Stock”), and warrants (the “Warrants”) to purchase 16,778,446 units of limited partnership interest of the Operating Partnership (“OP Units”) (“Warrant Units”), for an aggregate purchase price of $200.0 million (the “July Capital Raise”). See Note 15 for additional information on the Series B Preferred Stock and Warrants.
The Purchaser has also committed to provide, upon satisfaction of certain conditions, up to an additional $250.0 million to purchase additional shares of the Series B Preferred Stock during the 18 months following the consummation of the July Capital Raise, of which $150.0 million is allocated to working capital needs and other general corporate purposes and $100.0 million is allocated to approved acquisitions. The July Capital Raise closed on July 24, 2020. The Series B Preferred Stock generally prohibits the Company from paying distributions on common stock or redeeming common stock unless the Company has first paid all accrued dividends (and dividends thereon) on the Series B Preferred Stock in cash for all past dividend periods and the current dividend period. There are certain exceptions for the payment of dividends on common stock required for the Company to maintain its REIT qualification, special circumstances redemptions of common stock and redemptions of common stock that are funded with proceeds from issuances of common stock under the Company's distribution reinvestment plan. The Warrants are entitled to participate in all distributions paid in respect of our common stock on an as-exercised basis. Additionally, the Company appointed two designees of the Purchaser as members of the Board of Directors at the closing of the July Capital Raise.
The Series B Preferred Stock ranks, with respect to rights to the payment of dividends and the distribution of assets upon liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Company, senior to our common stock and on parity with our Series A Cumulative Redeemable Preferred Stock, $0.001 par value per share (the “Series A Preferred Stock”). The holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock will be entitled to receive, when, as and if authorized by the Board and declared by the Company, out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends, cumulative dividends per each share of Series B Preferred Stock at the rate of 12% per annum of the liquidation preference per share of Series B Preferred Stock. Dividends will be paid in cash or in the form of additional shares of Series B Preferred Stock (“PIK Shares”) with the value thereof equal to the liquidation preference of such shares, at the option of the Company. Dividends on each share of Series B Preferred Stock (including any PIK Shares) will accrue on the then-applicable liquidation preference thereof and on all accrued and unpaid dividends on a daily basis and compound quarterly at a rate equal to the dividend rate. The initial 12% dividend rate is subject to increase by an additional 4% per annum upon certain events of default by the Company, as provided in the Articles Supplementary governing the Series B Preferred Stock which is filed as an exhibit to this Report.
If at any time any PIK Shares are outstanding or there are any accrued and unpaid dividends, the Company may not pay or set aside dividends with respect to our Common Stock, or redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire Common Stock, in each case, subject to certain exceptions.
WLT 2020 10-K – 


On the fifth anniversary of the closing of the July 2020 Capital Raise, the Company is required to redeem all shares of Series B Preferred Stock at a redemption price, payable in cash, equal to the then applicable liquidation preference plus all accrued and unpaid dividends (including dividends on PIK shares). The Company, at its option, may redeem for cash, in whole or in part from time to time, any or all of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock upon giving the notice described in the Articles Supplementary at a price determined in the Articles Supplementary. If the Company undergoes a Fundamental Change (as defined in the Articles Supplementary), holders of shares of Series B Preferred Stock may require the Company to repurchase any or all of such shares of Series B Preferred Stock for a cash purchase price equal to the then-applicable optional redemption price. If the Company fails to redeem in full, in cash, all the shares of Series B Preferred Stock required or sought by holders to be redeemed pursuant to the Articles Supplementary by the applicable deadline (i) the dividend rate will immediately be increased by 4% (unless an increase rate is already then in effect), (ii) no further dividends or distributions on, and no purchases of, Junior Stock will be permitted, subject to certain exceptions, and (iii) the initial purchaser of the Series B Preferred Stock and its affiliates and permitted transferees will have the right to require the Company to sell certain assets and properties of the Company for net proceeds in an amount sufficient to pay all unpaid redemption amounts due, subject to the conditions specified in the Articles Supplementary.
Except for the rights expressly conferred by the Articles Supplementary or as required by the Maryland General Corporation Law, the holders of the outstanding shares of Series B Preferred Stock will not be entitled to (i) vote on any matter, or (ii) receive notice of, or to participate in, any meeting of stockholders at which they are not entitled to vote. The vote or consent of the majority holders of the Series B Preferred Stock is required for certain corporate actions of the Company, including with respect to certain amendments to the governing documents of the Company and the Operating Partnership, the authorization or creation of additional preferred stock or more senior stock, certain incurrences of corporate indebtedness and certain sales of assets of the Company, as more fully described in the Articles Supplementary.
Estimated Net Asset Value
In November 2020, we announced that our estimated net asset value (“NAV”) as of September 30, 2020 has been determined to be $5.51 per share of Class A common stock and $5.45 per share of Class T common stock, based on shares outstanding at September 30, 2020. 
Narrative Description of Business
General
We are a publicly owned, non-traded REIT that strives to create value in the lodging industry with a focus on building and enhancing the value of a portfolio of interests in lodging and lodging related investments. We employ value-added strategies, such as re-branding, renovating, expanding or changing hotel operators, when we believe such strategies will increase the operating results and values of the hotels we acquire. We regularly review the hotels in our portfolio to ensure that they continue to meet our investment criteria. If we were to conclude that a hotel’s value has been maximized, or that it no longer fits within our financial or strategic criteria, we may seek to sell the hotel and use the net proceeds for investments in our existing or new hotels, or to reduce our overall leverage. While we do not operate our hotel properties, both our asset management team and our executive management team monitor and work cooperatively with our hotel operators in all aspects of our hotels' operations, including advising and making recommendations regarding property positioning and repositioning, revenue and expense management, operations analysis, physical design, renovation and capital improvements, guest experience and overall strategic direction. We believe that we can add significant value to our portfolio through our intensive asset management strategies. Our executive and asset management teams have significant experience in hotels, as well as in creating and implementing innovative asset management initiatives.
Our business was significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and the material reduction in demand experienced by our hotels and the lodging industry generally. See “Risk Factors - Risk Related to our Business and Operations - The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to materially and adversely affect us and they are expected to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.”
As a REIT, we are allowed to own lodging properties, but are prohibited from operating these properties. In order to comply with applicable REIT qualification rules, we enter into leases with certain of our subsidiaries organized as TRSs. The TRS lessees in turn contract with independent property operators that manage the day-to-day operations of our properties.
WLT 2020 10-K – 


The lodging properties we have acquired include full-service branded hotels located in urban settings, resort properties and select-service hotels. Full-service hotels generally provide a full complement of guest amenities, including food and beverage services, meeting and conference facilities, concierge and room service and valet parking, among others. Select-service hotels typically have limited food and beverage outlets and do not offer comprehensive business or banquet facilities. Resort properties may include smaller boutique hotels and large-scale integrated resorts. All of our investments to date have been in the United States, however, we may consider, and are not prohibited under our organizational documents from making, investments outside the United States.
Our Portfolio
As of December 31, 2020, our portfolio was comprised of our full or partial ownership in 31 hotels with 9,615 guest rooms, all located in the United States. See Item 2. Properties.
Holding Period
We generally intend to hold our investments in real property for an extended period depending on the type of investment. The determination of whether a particular asset should be sold or otherwise disposed of will be made after consideration of relevant factors, including prevailing economic conditions, with a view to achieving maximum capital appreciation for our stockholders while avoiding increases in risk. No assurance can be given that this objective will be realized.
Financing Strategies
As of December 31, 2020, our hotel portfolio, including both the hotels that we consolidate in our financial statements (“Consolidated Hotels”) (as further discussed in Note 5) and the hotels that we record as equity investments in our financial statements (“Unconsolidated Hotels”) (as further discussed in Note 6), was 63% leveraged. Our organizational documents permit us to incur leverage of up to 75% of the total costs of our investments or 300% of our net assets (whichever is less), or a higher amount with the approval of a majority of our independent directors.
Competition
The hotel industry is highly competitive. Hotels we acquire compete with other hotels for guests in our markets. Competitive factors include location, convenience, brand affiliation, room rates, range and the quality of services, facilities and guest amenities or accommodations offered. Competition in the markets in which our hotels operate include competition from existing, newly renovated and newly developed hotels in the relevant segments. Competition can adversely affect the occupancy, average daily rates (“ADR”), and revenue per available room (“RevPAR”) of our hotels, and thus our financial results, and may require us to provide additional amenities, incur additional costs or make capital improvements that we otherwise might not choose to make, which may adversely affect our profitability.
Seasonality
Certain lodging properties are seasonal in nature. Generally, occupancy rates and revenues are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters. As a result of the seasonality of certain lodging properties, there may be quarterly fluctuations in results of operations of our properties. Quarterly financial results may be adversely affected by factors outside our control, including weather conditions and poor economic factors. 
Certain Environmental and Regulatory Matters
Our hotel properties are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. In connection with our current or prior ownership or operation of hotels, we may potentially be liable for various environmental costs or liabilities (including investigation, clean-up and disposal of hazardous materials released at, on, under, in or from the property). Environmental laws and regulations typically impose responsibility without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or was responsible for the presence of hazardous materials or contamination, and liability is often joint and several. As part of our efforts to mitigate these risks, we typically engage third parties to perform assessments of potential environmental risks when evaluating new acquisitions or if required to do so by a lender. Such environmental surveys are limited in scope, however, and we remain exposed to contaminates (e.g., such as asbestos and mold) and hazardous or regulated substances used during the routine operations of our hotels (e.g., swimming pool or dry cleaning chemicals). Our hotel properties incur costs to comply with environmental and health and safety laws and regulations and could be subject to fines and penalties for non-compliance. 
WLT 2020 10-K – 


We have not received written notice from any governmental authority of any material noncompliance, liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances or other environmental matters in connection with any of our properties. And although we are not currently aware of any material environmental or health and safety claims pending or threatened against us, a claim may be asserted against us in the future that could have a material adverse effect on us. 
Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (the “ADA”) to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA. We believe that our properties are substantially in compliance with the ADA, however, the obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate.
In addition, our hotel properties are subject to state and local health and safety laws, regulations and mandates relating to their operations in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Human Capital Resources
We had no employees prior to the Internalization in April 2020. As part of the Internalization, we hired substantially all of the former employees of Watermark Capital and a number of the former employees of WPC that had performed services for us. Due to the significant business disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented reductions in our workforce and certain of our senior executives and members of our board of directors deferred or waived portions of the cash compensation to which they were otherwise entitled in 2020. We made awards of restricted stock to key employees as means of incentivizing and retaining them. As of December 31, 2020, we had 29 employees.
The third party operators that manage our hotels are generally responsible for hiring and maintaining the labor force at the hotels. The operators implemented significant furloughs of hotel personnel in 2020 due to governmental shutdowns and lack of demand attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.
