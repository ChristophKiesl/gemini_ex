Current Operations Following Acquisition of Sapphire
 
Oncology
 
AXIM acquired Sapphire in order to develop and commercialize a unique therapeutic approach designed to disrupt cancer growth and block metastatic spread. Prior to our acquisition of Sapphire, it acquired an exclusive license to the technology around SBI-183, an anti-metastatic compound developed by Dr. Douglas Lake at Mayo Clinic and Arizona State University to inhibit QSOX1. Dr. Douglas Lake is a co-founder of Sapphire. 
Oncology Strategy
 
We continue to advance our mission of improving global cancer care through the development of novel therapeutics for controlling metastatic cancer spread, and diagnostics for early cancer detection, response to treatment, and for monitoring post-treatment recurrence. We aspire to be the leader in QSOX1-targeted metastatic cancer therapies, and have undertaken the development of a potent QSOX1 inhibitor to be used as a platform drug for a variety of indications.
 
We have been investigating the enzyme Quiescin Sulfhydryl Oxidase 1 (“QSOX1”), a master regulator of extracellular matrix remodeling, and its overexpression by tumor cells. QSOX1 is a tumor-derived enzyme that is important for cancer growth, invasion and metastasis. Overexpression of QSOX1 has been unambiguously linked to promoting tumor invasion and metastasis. One of the Company’s co-founders, Dr. Douglas Lake, has discovered that a small molecule SBI-183 inhibited the enzymatic activity of QSOX1, and as a result, suppressed tumor cell invasion in vitro and metastasis of breast tumor cells in vivo. Through our medicinal chemistry efforts, we synthesized multiple structural analogs of SBI-183 and unveiled SPX-1009 as a lead compound that demonstrated ten-fold improvement in suppressing invasion and metastasis in several cancer models.
 
Through our medicinal chemistry efforts, we have synthesized multiple structural analogs of SBI-183, and we unveiled SPX-1009 as a lead compound that demonstrated ten-fold improvement in suppressing invasion and metastasis in several cancer models. 
 
We believe that our therapeutic drug development strategy targeting the metastatic spread is a unique, novel and pioneering approach to saving lives. Our near-term objective is to demonstrate the ability of our lead anti-QSOX1 drug candidates to suppress tumor growth and metastasis and to advance them into pre-clinical studies.
 
Additionally, we believe that QSOX1 has a significant potential to be developed into an important biomarker for a cancer test. We currently anticipate that ongoing diagnostic product development in 2021 will result in a commercial prototype in early 2022 of a universal companion diagnostic to measure the efficacy of any ongoing cancer treatments based on measuring QSOX1 levels. Ultimately, we aim to develop a rapid lateral flow blood test that makes possible the early detection of cancer. 
 
We believe that Sapphire is the first to discover the over-expression of QSOX1 as a biomarker for cancer in blood. We have filed a patent application claiming many discoveries related to QSOX1, including a rapid diagnostic test, which we have developed into a lateral flow device capable of measuring levels of QSOX1. Our equivalent of a liquid biopsy test is a non-invasive, rapid blood test that will measure QSOX1 over-expression. Liquid biopsy refers to the process of testing the blood for the presence of a disease biomarker. Most so-called “liquid biopsy” companies test blood for circulating tumor cells (“CTCs”) and DNA sequences. The disease biomarker we test for is an enzyme. We seek to prove that measuring QSOX1 over-expression, even before the tumor is formed, will enable detection of cancer at an earlier stage than liquid biopsy companies whose tests detect the CTC’s and DNA, usually after the tumor is formed and is shedding cells.
 
On January 13, 2020, Sapphire entered into an agreement with Skysong Innovations, LLC (“Skysong”) for an exclusive license to technology relating to SBI-183, an anti-metastatic compound suppressing tumor cell growth and blocking metastasis. As consideration for the license agreement, the Company agreed to grant Skysong (as licensing agent for Mayo Clinic Ventures and Arizona State University) 80,000 shares of Sapphire, which converted into 4,800,000 shares of Axim Biotechnologies, Inc., upon the merger.

Effective February 7, 2020, Sapphire entered into an Industry Sponsored Research Agreement (“SRA”) to test and confirm the inhibitory activity of SBI-183 and SBI-183 analogs, including those synthesized by the Company. The testing will include cell-based in vitro assays, NMR binding studies and testing to determine if SBI-183 enhances the activity of cytotoxic drugs in vitro. Animal studies will also be conducted under the SRA. Specifically SBI-183 analogs will be evaluated in a mouse model of triple negative breast cancer using human tumor xenografts. The work will be performed over a period of one year with the total cost of the SRA totaling $150,468 paid prior to our acquisition of Sapphire. 
 
On August 11, 2020, Sapphire was awarded a $395,880 phase I Small Business Innovation Research (“SBIR”) grant by the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”). The 12-month grant supports the continued development of novel small molecules that inhibit the enzymatic activity of QSOX1 based on our lead compound SPX-1009. 
 
Covid-19
 
As Sapphire is a pioneer in the research and development of diagnostic tools for the early screening of cancer cells, our researchers have been able to quickly adapt our existing research and technology currently under development to create diagnostic tools that screen for COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies. The current need for such an instrument is great, as the pandemic continues to plague the worldwide healthcare landscape.
 
SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic has spread at an alarming rate since the first cases were identified in late 2019 in Wuhan, China. The virus can be transmitted from person-to-person in respiratory secretions from symptomatic or asymptomatic individuals. Since the virus was new to the human population and death rates are 10 to 50-fold higher than other respiratory viruses, the pandemic has placed excessive demands on the global healthcare network. Because initially there were no vaccines or effective antiviral therapies that existed for SARS-CoV-2, efforts to combat this pandemic have been challenging.
 
Polymerase chain reaction (“PCR”) tests that detect active SARS-CoV-2 infection are playing an important role in tracking disease spread, while serological tests that detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are now being used to measure past rates of infection and identify individuals that could be immune to COVID-19. However, not all antibodies are created equal and tests that specifically measure antibodies that neutralize SARS-CoV-2 have not been generally available to healthcare providers or patients.
 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies block binding and entry of the virus into host cells. It is desirable to have high levels of neutralizing antibodies in convalescent plasma used to treat patients fighting COVID-19 so that those antibodies can block the virus from further infecting the host. However, despite convalescing from the disease, not all individuals make high levels of neutralizing antibodies. Therefore, there is a clinical need to measure levels of neutralizing antibodies in COVID-19 convalescent plasma.
 

3



The most widely used antibody tests on the market today do not specifically identify neutralizing antibodies. Instead, they measure a large family of antibodies that bind to various parts of the virus, but that do not necessarily neutralize it. To address this shortcoming, we developed a patent-pending rapid diagnostic test called ImmunoPass, which is specifically focused on measuring the levels of functional neutralizing antibodies that prevent SARS-CoV-2 from attaching to human cells. The test is based on blocking the interaction between human cell receptors and the viral spike protein that mimics the virus neutralization process in the body.
 
Why ImmunoPass
 
ImmunoPass is a rapid (10-minute) serological diagnostic test that measures SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, or Nabs. ImmunoPass SARS-Cov-2 Neutralizing Antibody (“Nab”) Rapid Test is the first of its kind, and is a rapid lateral flow chromatographic immunoassay intended for the semi-quantitative measurement of neutralizing antibody in human serum or plasma (sodium heparin, potassium and acid dextrose citrate). The ImmunoPass™ SARS-Cov-2 Neutralizing Antibody (NAb) Rapid Test measures NAbs within 10 minutes, unlike traditional tests, which require days. The ImmunoPass™ test kit does not utilize live biological materials and does not require the strict biosafety protocol associated with live virus samples.
 
Specifically, we envision that our ImmunoPass test may be used for the following:
 
(i)
Measurement of neutralizing antibodies in individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 and/or received a vaccine and to provide an “Immunity Passport” so that they can go back to work and school or participate in social gatherings without risk of infecting others. The primary goal of any vaccine is to induce neutralizing antibody responses that protect vaccine recipients from infection and subsequent disease. As COVID-19 vaccines have now begun rolling out to the general public, we believe immunity monitoring is starting to play a critical role in determining whether the vaccine is effective, for how long, and when it is time for recipients of the vaccine to get a booster shot. Since immunity to the virus is not anticipated to last forever, the immunity monitoring could continue for many years, even after widespread vaccination throughout the world. 
 
Additionally, we believe that measuring neutralizing antibodies in vaccine recipients after vaccination may provide greater insight into how vaccine responses hold up over time. That way, when levels of neutralizing antibodies eventually decrease, vaccine recipients will have a sense of when their neutralizing antibodies are unacceptably low and a revaccination is necessary to continue their protection from COVID-19.
 
(ii)
Screening plasma collected from individuals recovered from COVID-19 so that patients fighting COVID-19 can be treated with plasma containing high levels of Nabs. Additionally, Nabs need to be monitored in patients receiving convalescent plasma so that we learn what is an effective therapeutic dose. 
 
Our test is different from neutralizing antibody tests currently available because:
 
·

It specifically tests for neutralizing antibodies, which are those needed to fight COVID-19 within the body; 
 
·

It can quantitatively measure the amount of neutralizing antibodies a person has; 
 
·

 Patients get their results in just a few minutes; and 
 
·

It is portable. 
 
In preclinical research, ImmunoPass has already been proven to work with 97.8% accurately in plasma and serum and can easily be modified to work on any specific strains of COVID-19; accordingly, we believe that newly-discovered strains will not affect its efficacy. ImmunoPass has shown a significantly better statistical correlation with SARS-CoV-2 neutralization assays than the currently available antibody tests. Since the rapid test lends well to conducting live virus-based assays, we believe that it could serve as an effective low-cost alternative to lab-based assays for monitoring large numbers of vaccine recipients for neutralizing antibodies.
 
As our scientific team was hard at work developing our COVID-19 rapid diagnostic tests we were frustrated by the delays and costs caused by lack of supply of a recombinant virus binding protein (“VBP”) for SARS-CoV-2 were essential to our testing. To continue our projects as planned and decrease overall costs, we decided to make our own VBP, which is even more potent than current outsourced options. Our laboratory tests have proven that SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (“RBD”) spike protein binds with our novel VBP. Initial tests also show that our novel VBP is approximately ten times more potent and stable than other VBP options currently on the market. We now develop these core ingredients needed to manufacture test strips in-house, and believe that moving such production in-house provides us with the potential to derive additional revenue and also allows us to control our supply chain. We have already manufactured enough VBP for millions of rapid diagnostic tests.

In August 2020, we signed an exclusive licensing, manufacturing and distribution agreement with Empowered Diagnostics, LLC (“Empowered”) to execute the high-volume production of our rapid point-of-care diagnostic test. Together with Empowered, we have completed the technology transfer, and Empowered has built out their production facility to enable them to manufacture millions of our tests per month. To date, ImmunoPass has completed two human point-of-care clinical trials and the Company, through its manufacturing partner Empowered Diagnotics, filed for FDA emergency use approval of the device on March 24, 2021. We hope that our test will be the first FDA-approved rapid point-of-care test for neutralizing antibodies. 
 
About Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs)
 
The Emergency Use Authorization (“EUA”) authority allows FDA to help strengthen the nation’s public health protections against chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear threats including infectious diseases, by facilitating the availability and use of medical countermeasures needed during public health emergencies.
 
Under section 564 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, when the Secretary of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) declares that an emergency use authorization is appropriate, FDA may authorize unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by CBRN threat agents when certain criteria are met, including there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. The HHS declaration to support such use must be based on one of four types of determinations of threats or potential threats by the Secretary of HHS, Homeland Security, or Defense.
 
On February 4, 2020, the HHS Secretary determined that there is a public health emergency that has a significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of United States citizens living abroad, and that involves the virus that causes COVID-19.
 
COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorizations for Medical Devices
 
In vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) devices are tests performed on samples taken from the human body, such as swabs of mucus from inside the nose or back of the throat, or blood taken from a vein or fingerstick. IVDs can detect diseases or other conditions and can be used to monitor a person’s overall health to help cure, treat, or prevent diseases.
 
There are several types of SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 related IVDs:
 
·
Diagnostic Tests: Tests that detect parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus and can be used to diagnose infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These include molecular tests and antigen tests. 
 
·
Serology/Antibody and Other Adaptive Immune Response Tests: Tests that detect antibodies (for example, IgM, IgG) to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or that measure a different adaptive immune response (such as, T cell immune response) to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. These types of tests cannot be used to diagnose a current infection. 
 
·
Tests for Management of COVID-19 Patients: Beyond tests that diagnose or detect SARS-CoV-2 virus or antibodies, there are also tests that are authorized for use in the management of patients with COVID-19, such as to detect biomarkers related to inflammation. Once patients are diagnosed with COVID-19 disease, these additional tests can be used to inform patient management decisions. 
 
On September 16, 2020, we filed an EUA application with the FDA for measuring COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies in plasma and serum through our first-in-class rapid diagnostic test. The Company amended the EUA to include positive results from a Biosafety Level 3 (BSL-3) live virus test that positively correlates the rapid 10-minute lateral flow assay test that accurately detects and measures levels of functional COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies in plasma which the FDA demanded.
 
On March 24, 2020, our manufacturing partner, Empowered Diagnostics, filed an EUA application with the FDA for measuring COVID-19 neutralizing antibodies in whole blood for a Point-of-Care application of our rapid diagnostic test.
 
Our COVID-19 related product candidates, including Immunopass, our lateral flow diagnostic test for measuring SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibodies, are subject to uncertainties relating to product development, regulatory approval and commercialization, and further risks based on the constantly evolving situation affecting the United States and the international community. Even if we are able to commercialize our product candidates, there is no assurance that these candidates would generate revenues or that any revenues generated would be sufficient for us to become profitable or thereafter maintain profitability. Additionally, due to the COVID-19 pandemic the FDA is over-run with EUA applications from thousands of biotech and pharmaceutical companies and could significantly impact the ability of the FDA to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.

QSOX1-RELATED INVENTIONS. 

QSOX1 (Quiescin Sulfhydryl Oxidase 1) is an enzyme that is over-expressed in multiple tumor types. Genetically silencing QSOX1 in tumors slows their growth, migration, invasion and metastasis. Based on these findings, the inventors of the inventions described below tested libraries of chemical compounds for the ability to inhibit QSOX1. Several inhibitors of the QSOX1 enzyme were identified. Initially, SBI-183 was identified and animal studies confirmed its ability to suppress tumor growth. The inventors subsequently developed an entire library of analogs of the parent compound, SBI-183, detailed in several inventions below to identify compounds with greater inhibitory activity. These compounds have the potential to be developed into therapeutic treatments for metastasis and to be used in conjunction with other neoplastic treatments, such as chemotherapy. 
 
Included in the group of QSOX1-related inventions below is the identification of a specific splice variant of QSOX1, identified as QSOX1-L, as a unique Biomarker for the detection of certain tumors overexpressing QSOX1. This biomarker formed the basis for the invention relating to a Rapid Diagnostic Test for certain cancers.

The invention refers to a Rapid Test to measure levels of Neutralizing Antibodies to SARS-CoV2. Unlike currently available serological COVID-19 tests that detect an antibody response to the virus, the rapid 10-minute test measures a specific subpopulation of antibodies that block binding of the virus to host cell receptors. In contrast to current tests using live viruses which are time-consuming, expensive and require trained personnel in a tightly controlled laboratory setting to measure neutralizing antibodies, the rapid test is a portable, low cost, rapid point- of-care test that measures levels of neutralizing antibodies in 10 minutes.

TRADEMARK APPLICATIONS

We have two (2) trademark applications some of which are registered trademarks, received Notices of Allowance, or are pending in front of the United States Patent and Trademark Office: Axim, Axim Biotech, Immunity Passport. 
Market, Customers and Distribution Methods
 
Our focus is on the development of innovative pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and cosmetic products focusing on diseases and conditions for which currently there are no known efficient therapeutic ingredients or delivery systems for known active pharmaceutical ingredients. We plan to be an active player in this field of biosciences with our extensive R&D and pipeline of innovative products.
Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. 
 
We face competition from many different sources, including commercial pharmaceutical and biotechnology enterprises, academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions. Our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than any products that we or our collaborators may develop based on the use of our technologies.
 
While we believe that the potential advantages of our new technologies will enable us to compete effectively against other providers of technology for Covid-19 Nab product development and manufacturing, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through arrangements with large and established companies, and this may reduce the value of our technologies. In addition, these third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.

Source and Availability of Raw Materials
 
We currently manufacture the majority of our preclinical and Covid-19 testing materials in-house, and use contract manufacturers for the manufacture of some of our product candidates. We may or may not manufacture the products we develop, if any. Our internal manufacturing and contract manufacturers are subject to extensive governmental regulation.
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the U.S. (including federal, state and local authorities) and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the manufacturing, research and clinical development, marketing, labeling and packaging, storage, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, advertising and promotion, export and import of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Moreover, failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, clinical holds, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, injunction, disbarment, partial or total suspension of production or withdrawal of the product from the market. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
U.S. Government Regulation
 
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process required by the FDA before product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
 
·
completion of extensive preclinical laboratory tests and preclinical animal studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations. Preclinical testing generally includes evaluation of our product candidates in the laboratory or in animals to characterize the product and determine safety and efficacy; 
 ·
submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually; 
 ·
performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for each proposed indication; 
 ·
submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”) or an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials; 
 ·
a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA or an NDA to file the BLA or NDA for review; 
 ·
satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP regulations; 
 ·
satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of one or more of the clinical sites at which the clinical trials were conducted; 
 ·
at the discretion of the FDA, a public Advisory Committee Meeting where the data is reviewed by experts who discuss the data and give their opinion (which the FDA is not obliged to follow) of the adequacy of the data to support an approval; and 
 ·
FDA review and approval of a BLA or an NDA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the U.S. 
 
We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production, distribution, shipping and storage of clinical and commercial quantities of our product candidates. Future FDA and state inspections may identify compliance issues at our facilities or at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA or NDA, including withdrawal or recall of the product from the market or other voluntary, FDA-initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further marketing. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product’s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. Also, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development.
 
Europe/Rest of World Government Regulations
 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales and distribution of our products.

11



Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials. In Europe, for example, a clinical trial application (“CTA”) must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical trial development may proceed.
 
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational drug under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application. The application used to file the NDA in the U.S. is similar to that required in Europe, with the exception of, among other things, country-specific document requirements. For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical trials are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 
Environmental Matters
 
No significant pollution or other types of hazardous emission result from our current operations, and we do not anticipate that our operations will be materially affected by federal, state or local provisions concerning environmental controls. Our costs of complying with environmental, health and safety requirements have not been material. Furthermore, compliance with federal, state and local requirements regulating the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment, have not had, nor are they expected to have, any material effect on the capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position of the Company. However, we will continue to monitor emerging developments in this area.
Employees
 
As of March 31, 2021, we have five full-time employees and three part-time employees. We also allow and utilize the services of independent contractors. We will be considering the conversion of some of our part-time employees to full-time positions.. Management believes that we have a good relationships with our employees.
