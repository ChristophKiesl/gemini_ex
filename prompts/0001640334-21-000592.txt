General Overview
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on January 30, 2007 under the name “Utalk Communications Inc.”. At inception, we were a development stage corporation engaged in the business of developing and marketing a call-back service using a call-back platform. Because we were not successful in implementing our business plan, we considered various alternatives to ensure the viability and solvency of our company.
 
On August 31, 2009, we entered into a letter of intent with Nevada Lithium regarding a business combination which may be effected in one of several different ways, including an asset acquisition, merger of our company and Nevada Lithium, or a share exchange whereby we would purchase the shares of Nevada Lithium from its shareholders in exchange for restricted shares of our common stock.
 
Effective September 30, 2009, we effected a 1 old for 60 new forward stock split of our issued and outstanding common stock. As a result, our authorized capital increased from 50,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 to 3,000,000,000 shares of common stock with a par value of $0.001 and our issued and outstanding shares increased from 4,470,000 shares of common stock to 268,200,000 shares of common stock.
 
Also effective September 30, 2009, we changed our name from “Utalk Communications, Inc.” to “Lithium Corporation”, by way of a merger with our wholly owned subsidiary Lithium Corporation, which was formed solely for the change of name. The name change and forward stock split became effective with the Over-the-Counter Bulletin Board at the opening for trading on October 1, 2009 under the stock symbol “LTUM”. Our CUSIP number is 536804 107.
 
On October 9, 2009, we entered into a share exchange agreement with Nevada Lithium and the shareholders of Nevada Lithium. The closing of the transactions contemplated in the share exchange agreement and the acquisition of all of the issued and outstanding common stock in the capital of Nevada Lithium occurred on October 19, 2009. In accordance with the closing of the share exchange agreement, we issued 12,350,000 shares of our common stock to the former shareholders of Nevada Lithium in exchange for the acquisition, by our company, of all of the 12,350,000 issued and outstanding shares of Nevada Lithium. Also, pursuant to the terms of the share exchange agreement, a director of our company cancelled 220,000,000 restricted shares of our common stock. Nevada Lithium’s corporate status was allowed to lapse and the company’s status with the Nevada Secretary of State has been revoked.

In June 2013, we purchased a claim in the Cherryville, BC area for 250,000 shares of our common stock. The claim area is known as the BC Sugar Property, and since this time we expanded the claim block considerably, and then have allowed a number of the less prospective claims to lapse. The company’s holdings here are currently 203 acres (82 hectares). In January, 2014, we agreed to buy back the shares issued pursuant to the June agreement for $2,500. 
 
Effective April 23, 2014, we entered into an operating agreement with All American Resources, L.L.C and TY & Sons Investments Inc. with respect to Summa, LLC, a Nevada limited liability company incorporated on December 12, 2013, wherein we hold a 25% membership. Our company’s capital contribution to Summa, LLC was $125,000, of which $100,000 was in cash and the balance in services. To date we have contributed an additional $16,700 in cash, and also over the years an indeterminate amount of casual geological expertise to Summa, LLC. In recognition, Summa transferred five urban lots in Tonopah of indeterminate value in 2020, and issued a check to the company for $6,000 in late December of that year.
 
In April of 2016, our Company established a wholly owned subsidiary called Lithium Royalty Corp. The subsidiary was a Nevada Corporation and was the entity through which we had planned to build a portfolio of lithium mineral properties. Also that April Lithium Royalty Corp. acquired through staking the North Big Smoky Prospect, a block of placer mineral claims in Nye County Nevada. On May 13, 2016 our wholly owned subsidiary sold 100% of the interest in the North Big Smoky Property through a Property Acquisition Agreement with 1069934 Nevada Ltd. (“Purchaser”) a private company. Consideration paid to Lithium Royalty Corp. consisted of $10,000.00, reimbursement of staking and filing fees, 300,000 shares in the “Purchaser Parent”, 1069934 B.C. Ltd. Lithium Royalty Corp. retained a 2.5% Net Smelter Royalty (“Vendor NSR”) on the North Big Smoky Property and the Purchaser had the right to purchase up to one-half (50%) of the Vendor NSR for $1,000,000 to reduce the Vendor NSR to 1.25%. By agreement dated September 13, 2017 Lithium Corporation agreed to sell back the shares of 1069934 Nevada Ltd. to San Antone Minerals Corp. (successor of 1069934) for $3,000, which was to be paid to Lithium Corporation upon completion of a $500,000 financing, or by October 27, 2017 whichever occured the earliest. The Company received the compensation under the agreement on November 2, 2017. The North Big Smoky claims were abandoned by the Purchaser in 2017 and as a result the Company’s NSR interest in the property was extinguished.
 
On February 16, 2017, we issued a news release announcing that we had signed a letter of intent with Nevada Sunrise Gold Corp., (“NEV” (TSX-V - NEV, OTC - NVSGF)) with respect to our Salt Wells lithium-in-brine prospect located in Churchill County Nevada. Under the terms of the agreement NEV was to earn a 100% interest in the property subject to a 2% Net Smelter Royalty (NSR), and by making staged payments of cash and shares over the next two years. Issues arose with respect to the claim block and Nevada Sunrise’s understanding of the placement of the block, and ultimately it was determined that the Company would be best served by cancelling the agreement and refunding the money (minus bank fees) that Nevada Sunrise had sent. An informal letter agreement releasing the parties of all obligations save for the Area of Mutual Interest clause was executed by both parties on May 5, 2017 and funds in the amount of $24,950 were returned to NEV.
 
Our Current Business
 
We are an exploration stage mining company engaged in the identification, acquisition, and exploration of metals and minerals with a focus on lithium mineralization on properties located in Nevada, and Graphite and other energy metals properties in British Columbia.
 
Our current operational focus is to conduct exploration activities on our San Emidio lithium-brine property in Nevada, and our titanium/ree/tantalum-niobium property, in British Columbia.

On March 2, 2017 we issued a news release announcing that we had signed a letter of intent with Bormal Resources Inc. with respect to three Tantalum-Niobium (Ta-Nb) properties (Michael, Yeehaw, and Three Valley Gap) located in British Columbia, Canada. 
 
The Michael property in the Trail Creek Mining Division was originally staked to cover one of the most compelling tantalum in stream sediment anomalies as seen in the government RGS database in British Columbia. Bormal conducted a stream sediment sampling program in 2014, and determined that the tantalum-niobium in stream sediment anomaly here is bona fide, and in the order of 6 kilometers in length. In November of 2016 Lithium Corporation conducted a short soil geochemistry orientation program on the property as part of its due diligence, and determined that there are elevated levels of tantalum-niobium in soils here.
 
Also in the general area of the Michael property, the Yeehaw property had been staked over a similar but lower amplitude tantalum/total rare earth elements (TREE’s) in stream sediment anomaly. Both properties are situated in the Eocene Coryell Batholith, and at the time it was thought that these anomalies may arise from either carbonatite or pegmatite type deposits. The Company conducted a helicopter borne bio-geochemical survey on these two properties in June 2017, which did return anomalous results. This was followed up by a geological and geochemical examination of the Yeehaw property in early July 2017, and additional work of a similar nature later in July, and again in early October 2017. These examinations uncovered a zone roughly 30 meters wide which included an interval that is mineralized with approximately 0.75% TREE’s. While markedly anomalous it is not exceedingly enriched in TREE’s. However this zone may not be the “main event” in the area but a harbinger of bigger and better things, and also it is enriched in titanium (Ti), which could possibly be in the form of Perovskite, a mineral of considerable interest for the next generation of photo-voltaic cells. Preliminary geological and geochemical work were performed on the Michael property in October of 2016, followed by a brief airborne biogeochemical survey in June of 2017, and additional ground geological and geochemical assessment work in early October, 2017. The third property – Three Valley Gap, is in the Revelstoke Mining Division and is situated in a locale where several Nb-Ta enriched carbonatites have been noted to occur. A brief field program by Bormal in 2015 located one of these carbonatites, and concurrent soil sampling determined that the soils here are enriched with Nb-Ta over the known carbonatite, and indicated that there are other geochemical anomalies locally that may indicate that more carbonatites exist here and are shallowly buried.
 
On February 23, 2018 we issued a news release announcing that we had dropped any interest in the Michael and Three Valley Gap properties, and had renegotiated the final share payment as required in the agreement from 750,000 to 400,000 shares. The final consideration shares have been issued and the Yeehaw property has been transferred by Bormal. During 2017 the Company conducted initial stream, rock and magnetometer surveys on the property, and discovered a 30 meter wide lamprophyric dyke (Horseshoe Bend showing) that exhibits anomalous Titanium/REE mineralization. The company staked an additional 5227 acre (2115.51 hectares) mineral claim and conducted a brief exploration program in Spring 2018 of geological mapping and rock and soil sampling on the property. This program discovered a slightly stronger zone of similar mineralization approximately 660 feet (200 meters) to the northwest of the Horseshoe Bend, and similar float mineralization another 0.75 miles (1.2 kms) further to the northwest. Additional work was performed on the property in 2019 and 2020 which extended the known strike of the Horseshoe Bend showing approximately 50 meters to the west, and mineralized float was found that possibly indicates it could continue to the east for another several hundred meters.
 
On February 16, 2016, we issued a news release announcing that our company has entered into a letter of intent with 1032701 B.C. Ltd. with respect to our Fish Lake Valley lithium brine property in Esmeralda County, Nevada. On March 10, 2016 we issued a news release announcing the signing of the Fish Lake Valley Earn-In Agreement. The terms of the Earn-In Agreement allowed 1032701 to earn an 80% interest in Fish Lake Valley for payments over three years totaling $300,000 and issuance of 400,000 common shares of the publicly traded company anticipated to result from a Going Public Transaction, and work performed on the property over three years in the amount of $1,100,000. 1032701 then had a Subsequent Earn-In option to purchase Lithium Corporation’s remaining 20% working interest within one year of earning the 80% by paying the Company a further $1,000,000, at that point the Company would retain a 2.5% Net Smelter Royalty, half of which could have been purchased by 1032701 for an additional $1,000,000. Menika Mining, a publicly traded company on the TSX Venture Exchange trading under the symbol MML announced on March 8, 2016 that it intended to acquire 1032701 B.C. Ltd and the right to acquire the Fish Lake Valley Property. Menika Mining completed the acquisition of 1032701 B.C. and fulfilled the initial obligations of the Fish Lake Valley Earn-In-Agreement in April of 2016. Meninka later changed their name to American Lithium. While the Purchaser did comply with all terms of the agreement with respect to cash and share payments it did not meet the expenditure level necessary with respect to its work commitment on the property, and the Company received formal notice of the relinquishment of the Purchasers right to earn an interest in the property on April 30th 2019. As this was the termination of the option agreement $443,308 was taken into income. During the year-ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $159,859 allowance for the properties and has a net book value of $Nil.

Effective May 3, 2016, our company entered in to an Exploration Earn-In Agreement with 1067323 B.C. Ltd. with respect to our San Emidio property. The terms of the formal agreement were; payment of $100,000, issuance of 300,000 common shares of 1067323 B.C. Ltd., or of the publicly traded company anticipated to result from a Going Public Transaction, and work performed on the property by the Optionee in the amount of $600,000 over the following three years to earn an 80% interest in the property. 1067323 then had a subsequent Earn-In option to purchase Lithium Corporation’s remaining 20% working interest within three years of earning the 80% by paying our company a further $1,000,000, at which point our company would retain a 2.5% Net Smelter Royalty, half of which could have been purchased by 1067323 for an additional $1,000,000. 1067323 B.C. Ltd. merged with American Lithium Corp., and the first tranche of cash and shares were issued in June of 2016. The Company waived the work requirement for the first year and received extra shares of American Lithium Corp as consideration for the amendment to the Agreement. In June 2018, the Company received notification that the purchaser was relinquishing any right to earn an interest in the property and, as such, $202,901 was taken into income. During the year-ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded a $217,668 allowance for the property which then had a net book value of $Nil.
 
The Company revised its trenching permit at BC Sugar in 2017 and conducted a program of 12 mechanized test pits in May 2018. This work was done in an area ranging from 1 to 1.5 kilometers to the east of the Weather Station Zone in a zone of numerous discrete conductors detected during the 2015 FDEM geophysical survey. Three of these pits intercepted weathered weak to moderately mineralized graphitic material with the best assay being 2.62% graphitic, carbon, and six test pits bottomed in non-mineralized bedrock. The remaining three did not reach bedrock or intercept graphitic material prior to reaching the maximum digging capability of the excavating equipment used. The Company has reduced its acreage holdings here to approximately 203 acres (82 hectares) to facilitate applying 5 years assessment credit to the property, and is effectively looking to place it on the “back burner” in favor of developing other prospects that are presently of greater commercial interest.
 
Competition
 
The mining industry is intensely competitive. We compete with numerous individuals and companies, including many major mining companies, which have substantially greater technical, financial and operational resources and staffs. Accordingly, there is a high degree of competition for access to funds. There are other competitors that have operations in the area and the presence of these competitors could adversely affect our ability to compete for financing and obtain the service providers, staff or equipment necessary for the exploration and exploitation of our properties.
Compliance with Government Regulation
 
Mining operations and exploration activities are subject to various national, state, provincial and local laws and regulations in United States and Canada, as well as other jurisdictions, which govern prospecting, development, mining, production, exports, taxes, labor standards, occupational health, waste disposal, protection of the environment, mine safety, hazardous substances and other matters.
 
We believe that we are and will continue to be in compliance in all material respects with applicable statutes and the regulations passed in the United States and Canada. There are no current orders or directions relating to our company with respect to the foregoing laws and regulations.
 
Research and Development
 
We have not incurred any research and development expenditures over the last two fiscal years.
