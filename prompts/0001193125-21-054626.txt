Upstream 
Disclosure of reserves 
Summary of oil and gas reserves at year-end
The table below summarizes the net proved reserves for the company, as at December 31, 2020, as detailed in the “Supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and production activities” part of the “Financial section”, starting on page 41 of this report. 
All of the company’s reported reserves are located in Canada. The company has reported proved reserves based on the average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month during the last 12-month period ending December 31. Natural gas is converted to an oil-equivalent basis at six million cubic feet per one thousand barrels. No major discovery or other favourable or adverse event has occurred since December 31, 2020 that would cause a significant change in the estimated proved reserves as of that date.

(a) | Liquids include crude oil, condensate and natural gas liquids (NGLs). NGL proved reserves are not material and are therefore included under liquids.
----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The estimation of proved reserve volumes, which is based on the requirement of reasonable certainty, is an ongoing process based on rigorous technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, detailed analysis of well information such as flow rates and reservoir pressures, and development and production costs, among other factors. Furthermore, the company only records proved reserves for projects which have received significant funding commitments by management made toward the development of the reserves. Although the company is reasonably certain that proved reserves will be produced, the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors, including completion and optimization of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, royalty frameworks and significant changes in oil and gas price levels. In addition, proved reserves could be affected by an extended period of low prices which could reduce the level of the company’s capital spending and also impact its partners’ capacity to fund their share of joint projects. 
As a result of low prices during 2020, under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission definition of proved reserves, certain quantities of bitumen that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2020. Amounts no longer qualifying as proved reserves include 2.2 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl and 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake. Among the factors that could result in portions of these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in the SEC price basis, a further decline in costs, and / or operating efficiencies. 
Under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributed to Imperial. The company does not expect its operations to be affected by the downward revision of reported proved reserves as disclosed under the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) definition.

Technologies used in establishing proved reserves estimates 
Imperial’s proved reserves in 2020 were based on estimates generated through the integration of available and appropriate geological, engineering and production data, utilizing well established technologies that have been demonstrated in the field to yield repeatable and consistent results. 
Data used in these integrated assessments included information obtained directly from the subsurface via wellbores, such as well logs, reservoir core samples, fluid samples, static and dynamic pressure information, production test data, and surveillance and performance information. The data utilized also included subsurface information obtained through indirect measurements, including seismic data, calibrated with available well control information. The tools used to interpret the data included proprietary seismic processing software, proprietary reservoir modeling and simulation software, and commercially available data analysis packages. 
In some circumstances, where appropriate analog reservoirs were available, reservoir parameters from these analogs were used to increase the quality of and confidence in the reserves estimates. 
Preparation of reserves estimates 
Imperial has a dedicated reserves management group that is separate from the base operating organization. Primary responsibilities of this group include oversight of the reserves estimation process for compliance with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations, review of annual changes in reserves estimates and the reporting of Imperial’s proved reserves. This group also maintains the official reserves estimates for Imperial’s proved reserves. In addition, this group provides training to personnel involved in the reserve estimation and reporting processes within Imperial. 
The reserves management group maintains a central database containing the company’s official reserves estimates. Appropriate controls, including limitations on database access and update capabilities, are in place to ensure data integrity within this central database. An annual review of the system’s controls is performed by internal audit. Key components of the reserves estimation process include technical evaluations, commercial and market assessments, analysis of well and field performance, and long standing approval guidelines. No changes may be made to reserves estimates in the central database, including the addition of any new initial reserves estimates or subsequent revisions, unless those changes have been thoroughly reviewed and evaluated by duly authorized personnel within the base operating organization. In addition, changes to reserves estimates that exceed certain thresholds require further review and endorsement by the operating organization and the reserves management group, culminating in reviews with and approval by senior management and the company’s board of directors. 
The internal qualified reserves evaluator is a professional geoscientist registered in Alberta, Canada and has 22 years of petroleum industry experience, including 16 years of reserves related experience. The position provides leadership to the internal reserves management group and is responsible for filing a reserves report with the Canadian securities regulatory authorities. The company’s internal reserves evaluation staff consists of 31 persons with an average of 11 years of relevant technical experience in evaluating reserves, of whom 26 persons are qualified reserves evaluators for purposes of Canadian securities regulatory requirements. The company’s internal reserves evaluation management team is made up of 17 persons with an average of 11 years of relevant experience in evaluating and managing the evaluation of reserves.

   Proved undeveloped reserves 
 As at December 31, 2020, approximately 25 percent of the company’s proved reserves were proved undeveloped reflecting volumes of 138 million oil-equivalent barrels. Proved undeveloped reserves are associated with Syncrude and Cold Lake. This compared to 397 million oil-equivalent barrels of proved undeveloped reserves reported at the end of 2019. The decrease of 259 million oil-equivalent barrels of proved undeveloped reserves includes a decrease of 335 million oil-equivalent barrels at Cold Lake and a decrease of 57 million oil-equivalent barrels at the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets, partially offset by an increase of 133 million oil-equivalent barrels at Syncrude. Conversion of proved undeveloped reserves into proved developed was 6 million oil-equivalent barrels in 2020, associated with Cold Lake and the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets. 
 Proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more represent about 4 percent (5 million oil-equivalent barrels) of proved undeveloped reserves and are associated with ongoing development programs at Cold Lake. These undeveloped reserves are planned to be developed in a staged approach to align with operational capacity and efficient capital spending commitment over the life of the asset. The company is reasonably certain that these proved reserves will be produced; however the timing and amount recovered can be affected by a number of factors including completion and optimization of development projects, reservoir performance, regulatory approvals, government policies, consumer preferences, changes in the amount and timing of capital investments, royalty frameworks and significant changes in oil and gas price levels. 
 One of the company’s requirements to report resources as proved reserves is that management has made significant funding commitments towards the development of the reserves. The company has a disciplined investment strategy and many major fields require a long lead-time in order to be developed. The company made investments of about $209 million during the year to progress the development of proved undeveloped reserves at Cold Lake, the Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets and at Syncrude. These investments represented about 37 percent of the $561 million in total reported Upstream capital and exploration expenditures. Investments made by the company to develop quantities which no longer meet the SEC definition of proved reserves as a result of low prices during 2020 are included in these capital and exploration expenditures.

Average unit sales price 
 The company’s average unit sales price and average unit production costs by product type for the three years ended December 31, 2020 were as follows. 
 

Canadian dollars per barrel | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Bitumen | | 25.69 | | 50.02 | | 37.56
Synthetic oil | | 49.76 | | 74.47 | | 70.66
Liquids (a) | | 27.40 | | 42.91 | | 40.20
Canadian dollars per thousand cubic feet | | | | | | 
Natural gas | | 1.90 | | 2.05 | | 2.43 


(a) | Liquids include crude oil, condensate and NGLs.
----+------------------------------------------------


In 2020, Imperial’s average Canadian dollar realizations for bitumen decreased primarily due to a decrease in Western Canada Select. The company’s average Canadian dollar realizations for synthetic crude decreased generally in line with West Texas Intermediate, adjusted for changes in exchange rates and transportation costs. 
 In 2019, Imperial’s average Canadian dollar realizations for bitumen increased, supported primarily by an increase in Western Canada Select and lower diluent costs. The company’s average Canadian dollar realizations for synthetic crude increased relative to West Texas Intermediate, primarily due to the narrowing of the western Canadian light crude differential. 
 Average unit production costs 
 

Canadian dollars per barrel | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Bitumen | | 25.73 | | 31.53 | | 29.39
Synthetic oil | | 45.51 | | 54.44 | | 60.34
Total oil-equivalent basis (a) | | 28.73 | | 34.82 | | 35.28


(a) | Includes liquids, bitumen, synthetic oil and natural gas.
----+----------------------------------------------------------


In 2020, bitumen unit production costs were lower, primarily driven by higher Kearl production due to improved reliability and reduced downtime related to the addition of supplemental crushing facilities in 2020, and cost saving activities in response to market conditions. 
 In 2020, synthetic oil unit production costs were lower, primarily driven by cost saving activities in response to market conditions. 
 In 2019, bitumen unit production costs were higher, primarily driven by Kearl costs associated with improving reliability and mine performance, and increased mine material movement. 
 In 2019, synthetic oil unit production costs were lower, primarily driven by higher production due to the absence of the site-wide power disruption at Syncrude in 2018 and lower maintenance costs.

Exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas resources 
 Cold Lake 
 To maintain production at Cold Lake, capital expenditures for additional production wells and associated facilities are required periodically. In 2020, additional wells were drilled on existing phases. In 2021, a development drilling program is planned within the approved development area to add productive capacity. 
 The company also conducts experimental pilot operations to improve recovery of bitumen from wells by means of new drilling, production or recovery techniques. 
 Aspen, Cold Lake expansion and other oil sands activities 
 The company filed a regulatory application for a new in-situ oil sands project at Aspen in December 2013, using steam-assisted gravity drainage (SAGD) technology to develop the project in three phases producing about 45,000 barrels per day before royalties, per phase. In 2015, the company amended the regulatory application to develop the Aspen project using solvent-assisted, steam-assisted gravity drainage (SA-SAGD) technology. The technology significantly improves capital efficiency and lowers greenhouse gas intensity versus the existing SAGD technologies. The project is proposed to be executed in two phases producing about 75,000 barrels per day before royalties, per phase. 
 
11 

  In October 2018, regulatory approval for the Aspen in-situ project was received from the Alberta Energy Regulator. The first phase of the project was approved by the company’s board and appropriated for $2.6 billion. Construction began late in the fourth quarter of 2018. In March 2019, the company slowed the pace of development given market uncertainty stemming from the Government of Alberta’s temporary mandatory production curtailment regulations and other industry competitiveness challenges. Aspen’s project pace will be continuously evaluated, although major investment remains on hold. Aspen remains an important development project for Imperial. 
 In March 2016, Imperial filed a regulatory application for an expansion project at Cold Lake to develop the Grand Rapids interval using SA-SAGD technology. The project is proposed to produce 50,000 barrels per day, before royalties. In August 2018, regulatory approval for the expansion project at Cold Lake was received from the Alberta Energy Regulator. The company continues to progress the project with a slower pace. 
 Work progresses on technical evaluations to support potential Clarke Creek, Corner, Clyden and Chard in-situ development regulatory applications. 
 The company also has interests in other oil sands leases in the Athabasca region of northern Alberta. Evaluation wells completed on these leased areas established the presence of bitumen. The company continues to evaluate these leases to determine their potential for future development. 
 Montney and Duvernay 
 The company has ramped down development drilling in its Montney and Duvernay unconventional assets in the western provinces. Imperial has re-assessed the long-term development plans of its unconventional portfolio in Alberta and no longer plans to further develop a significant portion of this portfolio. The assets that will not be developed are non-core, non-producing, undeveloped assets. This decision is consistent with Imperial’s strategy of focusing its upstream resources and efforts on its key oil sands assets as well as on only the most attractive portions of its unconventional portfolio. The decision resulted in a non-cash, after-tax impairment charge of $1,171 million in 2020, thereby reducing the carrying value of those assets to fair value. The company retains its interest in these resources. Imperial continues to produce from its developed acreage. 
Beaufort Sea 
 In 2007, the company acquired a 50 percent interest in an exploration licence in the Beaufort Sea. As part of the evaluation, a 3-D seismic survey was conducted in 2008 and the company has since carried out data collection programs to support environmental studies and safe exploration drilling operations. In 2010, the company executed an agreement to cross-convey interests with another company to acquire a 25 percent interest in an additional Beaufort Sea exploration licence. As a result of that agreement, the company operates both licences and its interest in the original licence was reduced to 25 percent. In 2013, the company and its joint venture partners filed a project description, initiating the formal regulatory review of the project. In 2016, the Federal Government of Canada declared Arctic waters off limits to new offshore oil and gas licences for five years subject to review at the end of that period. Existing licences were not impacted. 
 In June 2019, the Federal Government approved selective changes to the Canada Petroleum Resources Act to provide an indefinite prohibition and freeze of the existing licences through the completion of the Beaufort Sea Regional Environmental Assessment (BR-SEA) review. The Federal Government continues to consult with stakeholders as part of the BR-SEA to address regional social, environmental, economic and spill response impacts of natural resource development in the Arctic. The company continues to hold the licences while maintaining community engagement and participation in the BR-SEA process. 
 Exploratory and development activities regarding oil and gas resources extracted by mining methods 
 The company continues to evaluate other undeveloped, mineable oil sands acreage in the Athabasca region.

  Present activities 
 Review of principal ongoing activities 
 Kearl 
 Kearl is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract the crude bitumen, which is processed through extraction and froth treatment trains. The company holds a 70.96 percent participating interest in the joint venture and ExxonMobil Canada Properties holds the other 29.04 percent. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is typically shipped to the company’s refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. Diluent is natural gas condensate or other light hydrocarbons added to the crude bitumen to facilitate transportation by pipeline and rail. 
 During 2020, the company’s share of Kearl’s net bitumen production was about 155,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 158,000 barrels per day. 
 Kearl’s supplemental crushing facilities started operations in late 2019, with ramp-up of all units through early 2020. These facilities have further improved reliability, reduced planned downtime, lowered unit costs and enabled the asset to achieve higher volumes. As disclosed in the company’s 2019 Form 10-K, the original production target in 2020 for Kearl was 240,000 barrels per day (about 170,000 barrels Imperial’s share). As a result of market conditions, the company adjusted planned maintenance and turnaround activity, and revised its full-year guidance for Kearl total gross production to 220,000 barrels per day (about 156,000 barrels Imperial’s share). In 2020, Kearl achieved record annual total gross production of 222,000 barrels per day (158,000 barrels Imperial’s share). Imperial continues to progress initiatives to enable the asset to achieve 255,000 barrels per day of total gross production in 2021 (about 181,000 barrels Imperial’s share). 
 As a result of low prices during 2020, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, certain quantities of bitumen that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2020. Amounts no longer qualifying as proved reserves include 2.2 billion barrels of bitumen at Kearl. Among the factors that could result in portions of these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in the SEC price basis, a further decline in costs, and / or operating efficiencies. Under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributed to Imperial. The company does not expect its operations to be affected by the downward revision of reported proved reserves as disclosed under the U.S. SEC definition. 
 Cold Lake 
 Cold Lake is an in-situ heavy oil bitumen operation. The product, a blend of bitumen and diluent, is typically shipped to the company’s refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. 
 During 2020, net bitumen production at Cold Lake was about 124,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 132,000 barrels per day. 
 As a result of low prices during 2020, under the SEC definition of proved reserves, certain quantities of bitumen that qualified as proved reserves in prior years did not qualify as proved reserves at year-end 2020. Amounts no longer qualifying as proved reserves include 0.6 billion barrels of bitumen at Cold Lake. Among the factors that could result in portions of these amounts being recognized again as proved reserves at some point in the future are a recovery in the SEC price basis, a further decline in costs, and / or operating efficiencies. Under the terms of certain contractual arrangements or government royalty regimes, lower prices can also increase proved reserves attributed to Imperial. The company does not expect its operations to be affected by the downward revision of reported proved reserves as disclosed under the U.S. SEC definition.

  Syncrude 
 Syncrude is a joint venture established to recover shallow deposits of oil sands using open-pit mining methods to extract crude bitumen, and then upgrade it to produce a high-quality, light (32 degrees API), sweet, synthetic crude oil. The company holds a 25 percent participating interest in the joint venture. The produced synthetic crude oil is typically shipped to the company’s refineries, Exxon Mobil Corporation refineries and to other third parties. 
 In 2020, the company’s share of Syncrude’s net production of synthetic crude oil was about 68,000 barrels per day and gross production was about 69,000 barrels per day. 
 The Province of Alberta, in its capacity as lessor of Kearl, Cold Lake, and Syncrude oil sands leases, is entitled to a royalty on production. Royalties are subject to the oil sands royalty regulations which are based upon a sliding scale determined largely by the price of crude oil. 
 Delivery commitments 
 The company has no material commitments to provide a fixed and determinable quantity of oil or gas under existing contracts and agreements.

  Western provinces 
 The company’s bitumen leases include about 171,000 net acres of oil sands leases near Cold Lake and an area of about 34,000 net acres at Kearl. The company also has about 68,000 net acres of undeveloped, mineable oil sands acreage in the Athabasca region. In addition, the company has interests in other bitumen oil sands leases in the Athabasca areas totalling about 174,000 net acres, which include about 62,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Clyden area, about 34,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Aspen area, about 30,000 net acres of oil sands leases in the Corner area, about 18,000 net acres in the Chard area and about 29,000 net acres in the Clarke Creek area. The 174,000 net acres are suitable for in-situ recovery techniques. 
 The company’s share of Syncrude joint venture leases covering about 55,000 net acres accounts for the entire synthetic oil acreage. Oil sands leases have an exploration period of 15 years and are continued beyond that point by payment of escalating rentals or by production. The majority of the acreage in Cold Lake, Kearl and Syncrude is continued by production. 
 The company holds interests in an additional 898,000 net acres of developed and undeveloped land in the western provinces related to crude oil and natural gas, including about 387,000 net acres associated with the company’s unconventional portfolio in Alberta. Imperial has re-assessed the long-term development of its unconventional portfolio and no longer plans to further develop a significant portion of this portfolio. 
 Crude oil and natural gas leases and licences from the western provinces have exploration periods ranging from two to 15 years and are continued beyond that point by proven production capability. 
 Canada lands 
 Land holdings in Canada lands primarily include exploration licence (EL) acreage in the Beaufort Sea of about 252,000 net acres and significant discovery licence (SDL) acreage in the Mackenzie Delta and 
 Beaufort Sea areas of about 183,000 net acres. 
 Exploration licences on Canada lands have a finite term. If a significant discovery is made, a SDL may be granted that holds the acreage under the SDL indefinitely, subject to certain conditions. 
 The company’s net acreage in Canada lands is either continued by production or held through ELs and SDLs. 
 Atlantic offshore 
 Exploration licences on Atlantic offshore have a finite term. The Atlantic offshore acreage is continued by production licences or held by SDLs.

  Downstream 
 Supply 
 The company supplements its own production of crude oil, condensate and petroleum products with substantial purchases from a number of other sources at negotiated market prices. Purchases are made under both spot and term contracts from domestic and foreign sources, including ExxonMobil. 
Transportation 
 Imperial currently transports the company’s crude oil production and third-party crude oil required to supply refineries by contracted pipelines, common carrier pipelines and rail. To mitigate uncertainty associated with the timing of industry pipeline projects and pipeline capacity constraints, the company has developed rail infrastructure. The Edmonton rail terminal has total capacity to ship up to 210,000 barrels per day of crude oil. 
Refining 
 The company owns and operates three refineries, which process predominantly Canadian crude oil. The company purchases finished products to supplement its refinery production. 
 The approximate average daily volumes of refinery throughput during the three years ended December 31, 2020, and the daily rated capacities of the refineries as at December 31, 2020, were as follows. 

 | Refinery throughput (a) | | Rated capacities (b)
 | Year ended December 31 | | at December 31 
thousands of barrels per day | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018 | 2020
Strathcona, Alberta | | 170 | | 183 | | 173 | 196
Sarnia, Ontario | | 86 | | 86 | | 109 | 119
Nanticoke, Ontario | | 84 | | 84 | | 110 | 113
Total | | 340 | | 353 | | 392 | 428


(a) | Refinery throughput is the volume of crude oil and feedstocks that is processed in the refinery atmospheric distillation units.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(b) | Rated capacities are based on definite specifications as to types of crude oil and feedstocks that are processed in the refinery atmospheric distillation units, the products to be obtained and the refinery process, adjusted to include an estimated allowance for normal maintenance shutdowns. Accordingly, actual capacities may be higher or lower than rated capacities due to changes in refinery operation and the type of crude oil available for processing.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Refinery throughput averaged 340,000 barrels per day in 2020, compared to 353,000 barrels per day in 2019. Capacity utilization was 80 percent, compared to 83 percent in 2019. Lower throughput was driven by reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by lower refinery turnaround activity and reliability events, including impacts from the Sarnia fractionation tower incident which occurred in April 2019. 
 Refinery throughput averaged 353,000 barrels per day in 2019, compared to 392,000 barrels per day in 2018. Capacity utilization was 83 percent, compared to 93 percent in 2018. Reduced throughput was mainly due to higher planned turnaround activities and impacts from the Sarnia fractionation tower incident which occurred in April 2019. 
 Distribution 
 The company maintains a nationwide distribution system, to move petroleum products to market by pipeline, tanker, rail and road transport. The company owns and operates fuel terminals across the country, as well as natural gas liquids and products pipelines in Alberta, Manitoba and Ontario and has interests in the capital stock of two products pipeline companies.

  Marketing 
 The company markets petroleum products throughout Canada under well-known brand names, most notably Esso and Mobil, to all types of customers. 
 Imperial supplies petroleum products to the motoring public through Esso and Mobil-branded sites and independent marketers. At the end of 2020, there were about 2,400 sites operating under a branded wholesaler model whereby Imperial supplies fuel to independent third parties who own and operate sites in alignment with Esso and Mobil brand standards. 
 Imperial also sells petroleum products, including fuel, asphalt and lubricants, to large industrial and transportation customers, independent marketers, resellers, as well as other refiners. The company serves agriculture, residential heating and commercial markets through branded fuel and lubricant resellers. 
 The approximate daily volumes of net petroleum products (excluding purchases / sales contracts with the same counterparty) sold during the three years ended December 31, 2020, are set out in the following table. 
 

thousands of barrels per day | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Gasolines | | 215 | | 249 | | 255
Heating, diesel and jet fuels | | 146 | | 167 | | 183
Heavy fuel oils | | 20 | | 21 | | 26 
Lube oils and other products | | 40 | | 38 | | 40 
Net petroleum product sales | | 421 | | 475 | | 504


In 2020, lower sales were primarily driven by reduced demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 In 2019, lower sales volumes were mainly due to lower refinery throughput. 
 Chemical 
 The company’s Chemical operations manufacture and market benzene, aromatic and aliphatic solvents, plasticizer intermediates and polyethylene resin. Its petrochemical and polyethylene manufacturing operations are located in Sarnia, Ontario, adjacent to the company’s petroleum refinery. 
 The company’s total petrochemical sales volumes during the three years ended December 31, 2020, were as follows. 
 

thousands of tonnes | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Total petrochemical sales | | 749 | | 732 | | 807


In 2020, sales volumes increased primarily due to higher sales of intermediates. 
 In 2019, sales volumes decreased primarily due to lower aromatics and intermediates sales.

  Human capital resources 
 Imperial operates in a complex, competitive and changing business environment where decisions and risks play out over time horizons that are often decades in length. This long-term orientation underpins the company’s philosophy on talent development. 
 Talent development begins with recruiting exceptional candidates and continues with individually planned experiences and training designed to facilitate broad development and a deep understanding of our business across the business cycle. The company’s compensation is market competitive, long-term oriented, and highly differentiated by individual performance. In addition, benefits and workplace programs support the company’s talent management approach, and are designed to attract and retain employees for a long-term career. Overall, this multifaceted approach has resulted in strong employee retention. 
 Imperial views diversity as an opportunity. The company encourages and respects diversity of thought, ideas, and perspective in its workforce. The company considers diversity though all stages of employment including recruitment, training and development of its employees. Imperial’s goal is to reflect the mix and diversity of the communities where it operates, and it continues to focus on diverse representation at all levels of the organization. 
 The number of regular employees was about 5,800 at the end of 2020 (2019 - 6,000, 2018 - 5,700). Regular employees are defined as executive, management, professional, technical and wage employees who work full-time or part-time for the company and are covered by the company’s benefit plans and programs. 
 Competition 
 The Canadian energy and petrochemical industries are highly competitive. Competition exists in the search for and development of new sources of supply, the construction and operation of crude oil, natural gas and refined products pipelines and facilities and the refining, distribution and marketing of petroleum products and chemicals. The energy and petrochemical industries also compete with other industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of both industrial and individual consumers.

  Government regulations 
 Petroleum, natural gas and oil sands rights 
 Most of the company’s petroleum, natural gas and oil sands rights were acquired from governments, either federal or provincial. These rights, in the form of leases or licences, are generally acquired for cash or work commitments. A lease or licence entitles the holder to explore for petroleum, natural gas and / or oil sands on the leased lands for a specified period. 
 In western provinces, the lease holder can produce the petroleum or natural gas discovered on the leased lands and retains the rights based on continued production. Oil sands leases are retained by meeting the minimum level of evaluation, payment of rentals, or by production. 
 The holder of a licence relating to Canada lands and the Atlantic offshore can apply for a SDL if a discovery is made. If granted, the SDL holds the lands indefinitely subject to certain conditions. The holder may then apply for a production licence in order to produce petroleum or natural gas from the licenced land. 
 Project approval 
 Approvals and licences from relevant provincial or federal governmental or regulatory bodies are required for the company to carry out, or make modifications to, its oil and gas activities. The project approval process for major projects can involve, among other things, environmental assessments (including relevant mitigation measures), stakeholder and Indigenous consultation and input regarding project concerns, and public hearings. Approval may be subject to various conditions and commitments arising through these processes. 
 In 2019, the Canadian government implemented a new environmental assessment framework in Canada under the Impact Assessment Act, which may impact the manner in which large energy projects are approved. Changes from the previous environmental assessment legislation include broader consideration for social, health, and gender-based impacts, the impact on Canada’s climate change commitments, reliance on strategic and regional assessments and adjusted regulatory review timelines. 
 Environmental protection 
 The company regards protecting the environment in connection with its various operations as a priority. The company is subject to extensive environmental regulations in Canada that apply to all phases of exploration, development, operation, and final closure. These requirements cover the management and monitoring of potential environmental impacts during active operations, including practices for land disturbance, wildlife protection, specifications for equipment operation and material storage and limitations on discharges to the environment. It also includes conducting environmental surveys and collecting continuous operational measurements and sampling to confirm that environmental practices are adequately protecting the environment. These regulations also specify the actions and requirements for final reclamation, abandonment and closure of facilities. The company works in cooperation with government agencies, industry associations and communities to address existing, and to anticipate potential, environmental protection issues. The company also maintains extensive operating procedures, processes and emergency response plans to address environmental risks at its operations. 
 As discussed in Item 1A. Risk factors in this report, compliance with existing and potential future government regulations, including environmental regulations, may have material effects on the capital expenditures, earnings, and competitive position of the company. Imperial takes new and ongoing measures throughout its operations each year to prevent and minimize the impact of its operations on air, land and water. These include significant investments in refining infrastructure and technology to manufacture clean fuels, continued evaluation and implementation of new technologies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, adherence to federal and provincial greenhouse gas emissions reduction and reporting programs, enhanced water and land management, and expenditures for asset retirement obligations. In the past five years, the company has made capital and operating expenditures of about $3.3 billion on environmental protection and facilities. In 2020, the company’s environmental capital and operating expenditures totalled approximately $0.6 billion, which was spent primarily on activities to protect the air, land and water, including remediation projects. Capital and operating expenditures relating to environmental protection are expected to be about $1.1 billion in 2021.

  Crude oil 
 Production 
 The maximum allowable gross production of crude oil from wells in Canada is subject to limitations by various regulatory authorities on the basis of engineering and conservation principles. 
 Additionally, in December 2018, the Government of Alberta introduced temporary mandatory production curtailment regulations, which took effect on January 1, 2019. These regulations enable the government to impose production limits on large producers in Alberta. Mandatory production curtailments were eliminated effective December 2020, but the regulatory authority to impose curtailments remains in place. The duration of these regulations is uncertain. 
 Exports 
 Export contracts of more than one year for light crude oil and petroleum products and two years for heavy crude oil (including bitumen) require the prior approval of the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) and the Government of Canada. Export contracts of less than one year for light crude oil and petroleum products and two years for heavy crude oil (including bitumen) require an order from the CER. 
 Natural gas 
 Production 
 The maximum allowable gross production of natural gas from wells in Canada is subject to limitations by various regulatory authorities. These limitations are to ensure oil recovery is not adversely impacted by accelerated gas production practices. These limitations do not impact gas reserves, only the timing of production of the reserves and did not have a significant impact on Imperial’s 2020 gas production rates. 
Exports 
 The Government of Canada has the authority to regulate the export price for natural gas. Exports of natural gas from Canada require approval by the CER and the Government of Canada. The Government of Canada allows the export of natural gas by CER order without volume limitation for terms not exceeding 24 months. 
Royalties 
 The Government of Canada and the provinces in which the company produces crude oil and natural gas, impose royalties on production from lands where they own the mineral rights. Some producing provinces also receive revenue by imposing taxes on production from lands where they do not own the mineral rights. 
 Different royalties are imposed by the Government of Canada and each of the producing provinces. Royalties imposed on crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids vary depending on a number of parameters, including well production volumes, selling prices and recovery methods. For information with respect to royalties for Kearl, Cold Lake and Syncrude, see “Upstream” section entitled “Present activities” under Item 1 on page 13.

  Investment Canada Act 
 The Investment Canada Act requires Government of Canada approval, in certain cases, of the acquisition of control of a Canadian business by an entity that is not controlled by Canadians. The acquisition of natural resource properties may, in certain circumstances, be considered a transaction that constitutes an acquisition of control of a Canadian business requiring Government of Canada approval. 
 The Act also requires notification of the establishment of new unrelated businesses in Canada by entities not controlled by Canadians, but does not require Government of Canada approval except when the new business is related to Canada’s cultural heritage or national identity. The Government of Canada is also authorized to take any measures that it considers advisable to protect national security, including the outright prohibition of a foreign investment in Canada. 
 By virtue of the majority stock ownership of the company by ExxonMobil, the company is considered to be an entity which is not controlled by Canadians. 
 Competition Act 
 The Competition Bureau seeks to ensure that Canadian businesses and consumers prosper in a competitive and innovative marketplace. The Competition Bureau is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Competition Act (the Act). A merger transaction, whether or not notifiable, is subject to examination by the Commissioner of the Competition Bureau to determine whether the merger will have, or is likely to have, the effect of preventing or lessening substantially competition in a definable market. The assessment of the competitive effects of a merger is made with reference to the factors identified under the Act. 
 An Advance Ruling Certificate (ARC) may be issued by the Commissioner to a party or parties to a proposed merger transaction who want to be assured that the transaction will not give rise to proceedings under section 92 of the Act. Section 102 of the Act provides that an ARC may be issued when the Commissioner is satisfied that there would not be sufficient grounds on which to apply to the Competition Tribunal for an order against a proposed merger. The issuance of an ARC is discretionary. An ARC cannot be issued for a transaction that has been completed, nor does an ARC ensure approval of the transaction by any agency other than the Competition Bureau.
