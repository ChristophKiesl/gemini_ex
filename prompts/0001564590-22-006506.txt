Company Overview 
 R.R. Donnelley & Sons Company (“RRD,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” and “our”), a Delaware corporation, helps organizations communicate more effectively by working to create, manage, produce, distribute and process content on behalf of our clients. We assist clients in developing and executing multichannel communication strategies that engage audiences, reduce costs, drive revenues and enhance compliance. Our innovative content management offering, production platform, supply chain management, outsourcing capabilities and customized consultative expertise assists our clients in the delivery of integrated messages across multiple media to highly targeted audiences at optimal times to their customers in virtually every private and public sector. We have strategically located operations that provide local service and responsiveness while leveraging the economic, geographic and technological advantages of a global organization.
 On December 14, 2021, we entered into a definitive merger agreement under which we agreed to be acquired by affiliates of Chatham Asset Management, LLC (“Chatham”), a leading private investment firm. Under the terms of the merger agreement, an affiliate of Chatham will acquire all of the outstanding shares of RRD common stock not already owned by Chatham, and RRD stockholders will receive $10.85 per share in cash for each share of RRD common stock. All regulatory approvals have been obtained and at a special meeting on February 23, 2022, RRD’s stockholders approved the proposed merger. The merger with Chatham is expected to close on February 25, 2022. Upon completion of the transaction, RRD’s shares will no longer trade on the New York Stock Exchange and RRD will become a private company.

Corporate 
 Our Corporate segment consists of unallocated general and administrative activities and associated expenses including, in part, executive, legal, finance, communications, certain facility costs and last-in-first-out inventory provisions. In addition, certain costs and earnings of employee benefit plans, such as pension and other postretirement benefits (“OPEB”) plan expense (income) and share-based compensation, are included in Corporate and not allocated to the operating segments. Corporate also manages our cash pooling structures, which enables participating international locations to draw on our international cash resources to meet local liquidity needs. 
 Business Dispositions 
 In 2020, to focus on our core product and service offerings, we completed our plan to exit our Logistics Business. This business included Print Logistics, which was disposed of on July 2, 2018; Courier Logistics, which was disposed of on March 2, 2020; DLS Worldwide, which was disposed of November 2, 2020; and International Logistics which was disposed of on November 3, 2020. These businesses were included in the Business Services segment and primarily provided logistics services to a broad range of clients in the United States and globally. The financial results of these businesses have been excluded from continuing operations and segment results for all periods presented unless otherwise noted. Refer to Note 2 –Discontinued Operations to our Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.
 On October 25, 2019, we completed the sale of substantially all of the Global Document Solutions (“GDS”) business within the Business Services segment. GDS primarily provided statements and print management services in Europe. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold the R&D business and our subsidiary, RR Donnelley Editora e Grafica Ltda. (“RRD Brazil”), filed for bankruptcy liquidation in bankruptcy court in Brazil. The operations of these three businesses were included in the Business Services segment. 
 Markets
 The print and related services industry, in general, continues to have excess capacity and remains highly competitive and fragmented. Our clients operate in an evolving and ever-changing market. While the market is large and fragmented, there are tremendous changes occurring in how organizations need to create, manage, deliver and measure their communications. Some of the key factors facing our clients include regulatory changes, sensitivity to economic conditions, raw material pricing volatility and United States Postal Service (“USPS”) actions. In addition, technological changes, including the electronic distribution of documents and data, online distribution and hosting of media content, and advances in digital printing, print-on-demand and internet technologies, continue to impact the market for many of our products and services. 
 We believe that, across our range of products and services, competition is based primarily on quality and the ability to service the special needs of clients at a competitive price. Therefore, we believe we need to continue to differentiate our product and service offerings and aggressively manage our cost structure to remain competitive. Our business is differentiated by the wide array of quality communications products and services, including print and content management, we provide for our clients. We work with our clients to create, manage, deliver and optimize their multichannel communications strategies by providing innovative solutions to meet increasing customer demands in light of the large and evolving marketplace. We also continue to develop our creative and design, content management, digital and print production, supply chain management and distribution services to address our clients’ evolving needs while supporting the strategic objective of becoming a leading global provider of integrated communication products and services.
 Refer to Part I Item 1A “Risk Factors” and Part II Item 7 ‑Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business.
 Seasonality 
 Advertising and consumer spending trends affect demand in several of the end-markets we serve. As such, we have some seasonality in our business, mostly in the second half of the year, despite the breadth of our product and service offerings.
Resources 
 The primary raw materials we use in our print businesses are paper and ink. We negotiate with leading suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies. Some of the paper we use is supplied directly by clients. During 2021, we have seen price increases from nearly all of our material suppliers in all categories.  Notably, paper products have seen significant price increases primarily caused by supply shortages from key suppliers. The supply shortages have been caused in part by manufacturing capacity reductions, labor shortages and other supply chain disruptions. We, and our suppliers, have also experienced labor shortages and increased wage pressure for manufacturing workers due to current market conditions. Further, we experienced supply chain disruptions and shipping delays caused by container shortages in key domestic and international ports, including China. We expect these factors to continue for the foreseeable future. 
 5


To mitigate the effect of raw material shortages, inflationary pressures and other supply chain disruptions, we have offered our clients product alternatives, new formats, and in some cases secured new suppliers. We have also implemented price increases to pass inflationary costs along to our clients. Generally, clients directly absorb the impact of changing prices on client-supplied paper. With respect to paper we purchase, we have historically passed most changes in price through to our clients although in many cases there is a delay based on terms within individual client contracts. We believe contractual arrangements and industry practice will support our continued ability to pass on any future paper price increases, but there is no assurance that market conditions will continue to enable us to successfully do so.
In addition, we are working closely with transportation suppliers and increasing inventory levels to help ensure product availability, and we continue to aggressively pursue cost reductions across the Company to offset inflationary pressures. However, variations in the cost and supply of raw materials used in the manufacturing process and rising labor costs, may affect our consolidated financial results.
 We continue to monitor the impact of changes in the price of crude oil and other energy costs, which impact our ink suppliers and manufacturing costs. Crude oil, energy prices and market cost of transportation continue to be volatile. We generally cannot pass on to clients the impact of higher energy prices on our manufacturing costs. We cannot predict sudden changes in energy prices and the impact that possible future changes in energy prices might have upon either future operating costs or client demand or the related impact either will have on our consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
 We do not believe that our business is dependent upon any single patent or group of patents. We actively monitor the registrations of our trademark and patent portfolio to ensure that our intellectual property is appropriately protected and maintained.
 Distribution 
 Our products are distributed to end-users through U.S. and foreign postal services, through retail channels, electronically or by direct shipment to client facilities. In cooperation with trusted logistics vendors, we manage the distribution of most client products we print in the U.S. and Canada to maximize efficiency and reduce costs for clients.
 As a leading mail-service-provider of both First-Class Mail and USPS Marketing mail, we are ranked by the USPS as one of the largest preparers of mailings in the U.S. We work closely with our clients and the USPS to offer innovative products and mail preparation services to minimize postage costs. While we do not directly absorb the impact of higher postage rates on our clients’ mailings, demand for products distributed through the U.S. or foreign postal services has been negatively impacted by increases in postage rates, as postal costs are a significant component of many clients’ cost structures.
 In accordance with the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (“PAEA”), the Postal Regulatory Commission (“PRC”) adjusted and approved USPS filings for a CPI based average price increase of 1.5% to 1.8% depending on the major class of mail. The new prices took effect on January 24, 2021.
 Additionally, as required on the 10-year anniversary of PAEA, the PRC initiated a comprehensive review of its regulations on December 20, 2016, to determine if the current system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products is still achieving the original objectives of the law. After multiple years of deliberation the PRC concluded that the current system was not meeting all of PAEA’s original objectives and issued its final ruling on November 30, 2020, The ruling expanded USPS pricing authority to consider: 1) the higher cost implications caused by the declining average of the number of mail pieces delivered per delivery point, and 2) the congressionally mandated contributions by the Postal Service to fund future employee retirement benefits, respectively referred to as the “Density Adder”, and the “Retirement Adder ”. These additional price adders plus CPI percentage increases will in total determine the overall price increase allowed for the market dominant mail classes. The Postal Service then used and applied its expanded pricing authority and imposed a second increase during 2021 ranging from 6.8 to 8.8%, which became effective on August 29, 2021.
 Clients
 We have approximately 25,000 clients worldwide, including 92% of the Fortune 100, 79% of the Fortune 500 and 67% of the Fortune 1000. Our products and services enable some of the world’s largest companies to create, manage and deliver comprehensive and cost-effective multi-channel communications around the world. For each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, no single client accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales.
 Cybersecurity 
 Our cybersecurity program is designed for needs and expectations of our clients who entrust us with highly sensitive information. Furthermore, our healthcare and insurance printing businesses are subject to industry-specific data regulations, including the Health Care Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which could subject us and our clients to liability should sensitive client or patient information be publicly disclosed. Our infrastructure and technology, highly-trained global workforce and comprehensive security and compliance program enable us to safely process, store and protect client information in compliance with relevant regulations.

Our infrastructure and technology security capabilities are bolstered by our relationship with a leading data center services provider. Furthermore, we employ a highly skilled IT workforce to implement our cybersecurity programs and to handle specific security responsibilities. As a result of annual mandatory security awareness training, our IT workforce is trained to address security and compliance-related issues as they arise. Additionally, our IT employees are carefully screened, undergo a thorough background check and are bound by a nondisclosure agreement that details such employee’s security and legal responsibilities with regard to information handling. 
 In December 2021, we identified a systems intrusion in our technical environment. In response, we promptly implemented a series of containment measures to address the situation, including activating our incident response protocols, shutting down servers and systems and commencing a forensic investigation. We also engaged cybersecurity experts to examine the incident and oversee the implementation of appropriate remedial actions. However, we became aware in mid-January 2022 that certain of our corporate data, the nature of which is continuing to be actively examined, was accessed and exfiltrated. To the extent any confidential client data is found in this data, the Company has and will continue to inform impacted clients within a reasonable time. We also notified and continue to work with appropriate law enforcement authorities. As a precautionary measure, we isolated a portion of our technical environment in an effort to contain the intrusion.
 
At this time, we have restored the affected systems and returned to normal levels of operations, and believe that the steps taken to isolate and remediate the identified threat have been effective. While we do not currently believe that this security event has or will result in a material adverse impact to the Company, data review and assessment related to this event remain ongoing, and we may determine in the future that such event had or will have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
 Government Regulations 
 Our policy is to conduct our global operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the impact of potential failures regarding our compliance with these laws and regulations, including environmental matters and resulting remediation and other compliance efforts that we may undertake in the future. However, in our opinion, compliance with present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
 Human Capital
RRD’s approximately 32,000 employees worldwide represent our most important asset.  We are committed to prioritizing a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace, which allows us to attract and, importantly, retain high quality talent.  Our laser focus on the health, safety and well-being of our employees helps us to maintain our qualified workforce and develop leaders for the future.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 
We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion from the membership of the Board of Directors through all layers of our employee ranks.  Women represent 50% of our independent directors on the Board of Directors and 25% of our executive leadership team. Our priorities and the signing of the Parity Pledge in 2017 reflect our commitment to increasing the percentage of women in leadership roles across our company.
 
We are also focused on representation by historically underrepresented groups including, racial minorities and LGBTQ employees in our U.S. businesses.  We are committed to diversifying our workforce and increasing representation of all underrepresented groups in our Board and leadership teams.  
 
In 2020, we launched a new committee, the purpose of which is to focus on and formalize diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives for the Company, communicate broadly, and ensure that every employee feels respected and appreciated and can contribute to their fullest potential.  
 
To ensure RRD’s continued focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, executive team members are expected to consider at least one woman and one racial/ethnic minority in hiring for open positions on their teams.  The Board receives ongoing updates on these priorities as well as on the hiring by the executive leadership team.  In 2021, our CEO and CHRO were given a goal that all new hires or promotions into Director or higher levels at the Company must be at least 50% women or racially diverse candidates.  The Company met that goal in 2021 despite a challenging labor market.
 
In January 2022, we announced that we received a score of 95 out of 100 on the Human Rights Campaign Foundations 2022 Corporate Equality Index, the nation’s foremost benchmarking survey and report measuring corporate policies and procedures related to LGBTQ+ workplace equality.

Pay Equity
 
We are committed to paying employees equally for like work, at like levels, in like geographical areas, with similar years of experience, regardless of an employee’s gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics.  We have reviewed a variety of positions to ensure pay equity and made adjustments where needed. We regularly review our compensation process and, at this time, we have not identified any specific, significant systemic issues in our compensation process.
Employee Engagement
 
In 2020 and 2021, we were diligent in surveying our employees throughout the impact of COVID-19 to ensure that employees understood what resources were available to them, how to request assistance (including through our Employee Assistance Program), and how to navigate novel work environments in an unprecedented time. On the whole, the organization pivoted and adapted efficiently and without significant issues in a rapidly changing landscape. Essentially all of our manufacturing facilities were deemed to be essential by applicable government agencies, and as a result our employees have continued to work throughout the pandemic.  As such, when COVID-19 hit our facilities in the U.S. and abroad, we immediately implemented rigorous cleaning procedures, mandated the wearing of masks, and required physical distancing where possible. If an employee disclosed a positive COVID-19 test, we deep cleaned areas the employee had visited and engaged in contact tracing.
 
Because of our successful performance and the extraordinary engagement of our essential employees, in December 2020, we were able to pay a year-end bonus to employees not otherwise eligible for a bonus. This employee group included full-time hourly workers, managers, supervisors, facility workers and other non-sales employees who are not eligible for the annual incentive plan or commissions that are available to certain managers, directors, vice presidents and other executives.  Throughout 2021, we were able to increase hourly wages at a number of our facilities based on the continued extraordinary efforts of our employees.
 
We also maintain a robust open door process to capture, investigate and timely respond to employee concerns.  Throughout 2020 and 2021, we listened carefully as employees raised new issues during these unprecedented times and responded with due speed.
 
Finally, we provided our workforce with engagement opportunities, including through our Global Women’s Business Resource Group, inclusion councils, and dialogues hosted by our diversity, equity and inclusion leadership team.
 
Training and Development
 
A critical component of our investment in our employees is the provision of virtual and self-directed learning and development.  This training covers topics from sexual harassment prevention, ADA awareness, IT security and a wide variety of anti-corruption and compliance programs.  In 2021, 99.7% of employees timely completed their required training.
 
In addition to compliance related training, we also offer leadership and job skills training in order to continue to grow and develop our diverse workforce.
 
In 2021, the Company engaged a vendor to train the Executive Leadership Team ("ELT") in diversity in hiring and retention at the Company.  Since the Company prioritizes diversity in its hiring at all levels and understands that diversity in leadership will lead to more diversity throughout the Company, it has made continued education and heightened awareness of these issues a top priority for the ELT and for all leaders at the Company, including those on the Human Resources Team.
 
Health and Safety
 
As a manufacturing company, operations in our facilities continue to represent our greatest safety and health risks for our employees.  Managing and mitigating risks at our facilities is the top priority for the executive team and every employee around the world.  Safety has routinely been a part of our performance metrics for leadership in our facilities and one indicator of success in this area is our recordable case rate, which is at the lowest level since becoming a stand-alone company in 2016.   
 
We are continually evolving our policies and procedures to adhere to the latest best practices being provided by the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) and World Health Organization (“WHO”). Our cross-functional COVID Task Force created at the onset of the pandemic has developed safety measures, policies, and procedures for our workplace. We have implemented flexible working policies, including telecommuting and staggered shifts, while allowing for voluntary leaves of absence. We have encouraged vaccinations and have begun to welcome employees back into our offices on a voluntary basis using a cautious approach. We continue to enforce social distancing policies within all of our facilities, follow local and state guidelines concerning face coverings, and provide training for adherence to personal hygiene best practices in line with CDC and WHO guidelines.
