ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Founded in 1965, with more than 225,000 graduates in its history, Universal Technical Institute, Inc. (“we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading provider of transportation and technical training programs. As of September 30, 2021, we offered certificate, diploma or degree programs at 12 campuses across the United States under the banner of several well-known brands, including Universal Technical Institute (“UTI”), Motorcycle Mechanics Institute and Marine Mechanics Institute (collectively, “MMI”) and NASCAR Technical Institute (“NASCAR Tech”). Additionally, we offer manufacturer specific advanced training (“MSAT”) programs, including student-paid electives, at our campuses and manufacturer or dealer sponsored training at certain campuses and dedicated training centers. 
All of our campuses are nationally accredited and are eligible for federal student financial assistance funds under the Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended (“HEA”), commonly referred to as Title IV Programs, which are administered by the U.S. Department of Education (“ED”). Our programs are also eligible for financial aid from federal sources other than Title IV Programs, such as the programs administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) and under the Workforce Investment Act. 
Business Model and Industry Partnerships
We serve students, partners and communities by providing quality education and training for in-demand careers. We continue to evolve our business model to provide our students with accessible, affordable training with a focus on bringing education to the students at convenient locations. The market for qualified service technicians is large and growing. The United States Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics (“U.S. DOL BLS”) estimates that an average of approximately 112,300 new job openings, due to growth and net replacements, will exist annually for newly trained technicians in the automotive, diesel, and collision fields through 2030. Additionally, the U.S. DOL BLS estimates that an average of 49,200 new job openings for welders, 16,500 new job openings for computer-controlled machine tool operators, and 4,500 new job openings for marine and motorcycle technicians will exist annually for new entrants through 2030 in these fields. 
Our student recruitment efforts begin with our commitment to positive outcomes, both for our students and our industry relationships. We use a multi-touch media approach for our three primary admissions channels (high school, adult, and military) to enroll and start students, which involves national and local outreach to generate a high quality and quantity of prospective students. To maximize the likelihood of student retention and graduation, our admissions process is intended to identify students who have the desire and ability to succeed in their chosen program. In addition, we have established processes to identify students who may be in need of assistance to succeed in and complete their chosen program. To assist these students in graduating, we employ student service professionals that provide tutoring, and academic, financial, personal, and employment advisement. Additionally, as our campus locations do not offer housing for students, we have service professionals who leverage third-party relationships and assist our students in finding affordable housing near our campuses. 
To ensure our programs provide students with the necessary hard and soft skills needed upon graduation, we have relationships with over 35 original equipment manufacturers (“OEMs”) and industry brand partners across the country to understand their needs for qualified service professionals. Through our industry relationships, we are able to continuously refine and expand our programs and curricula. We believe our industry-focused educational model and national presence have enabled us to develop valuable industry relationships, which provide us with significant competitive advantages and supports our market leadership, along with enabling us to provide highly specialized education to our students, resulting in enhanced employment opportunities and the potential for higher wages for our graduates. 
Our industry relationships also extend to thousands of local employers, after-market retailers, fleet service providers and enthusiast organizations. Other target groups for relationship-building, such as parts and tools suppliers, provide us with a variety of strategic and financial benefits that include equipment sponsorship, new product support, licensing and branding opportunities and financial sponsorship for our campuses and students.
We offer the majority of our programs in a blended learning model that combines instructor-facilitated online teaching and demonstrations with hands-on labs. This blended learning format has allowed us to continue to offer our programs to our students during the COVID-19 pandemic and aligns with an increasing trend of online education now being offered as 

individuals seek life-long learning opportunities. On-campus labs are designed to meet or exceed the current national guidelines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control (“CDC”) as well as state and local mandates, while still meeting our accreditation and curriculum requirements. 
Business Strategy
Our core business strategies are aligned with our mission to serve students, partners and communities by providing quality education and training for in-demand careers. Additionally, as we evolve our business model, we are focused on growth and diversification achieved through acquisitions, opening new campus locations, expanding program offerings, and new funding and business operating models. 
Recruit, Train and Identify Employment Opportunities for More Students
Our student recruitment efforts begin with our commitment to positive outcomes for our students and our industry relationships. Our responsibility to present job-ready graduates to employers requires that we recruit, enroll and train prospective students who have the drive and potential to successfully pursue a career in their field of training.
Our student recruitment efforts for prospective students are conducted through three admissions channels: 
•High School: Field-based representatives develop and maintain relationships with high school guidance counselors, teachers and administrators as well as local employers. These representatives generate student interest in pursuing a professional technician career path and our training programs through career presentations and workshops at high schools and career fairs and inviting students and their influencers on field trips and tours of our campuses and local employers’ businesses. 
•Adult: Campus-based representatives serve adult career-seeking or career changing students who typically inquire with our schools as a result of our advertising campaigns. 
•Military: Our military representatives are strategically located throughout the country. These representatives focus on building relationships with military installations in order to serve the needs of those transitioning from military service. 
We collaborate with employers to help prospective students and their families understand the potential career opportunities that may be available during and after completing one of our programs. As competition for the graduates we train grows, employers are increasingly partnering with us to raise awareness of the benefits of a technician career path for prospective students. 
Return on Education
We provide an excellent return on our students’ education investment by working with our industry partners to offer manufacturer-specific training that is tailored to industry standards and requirements, that improves students’ opportunities to find employment and maximizes their earnings potential. We actively engage transportation industry partners in defining our core curriculum and improving and expanding our MSAT courses. We regularly evaluate program offerings, schedules and locations that are most appealing to students and aligned with employer expectations. We also update and expand our core and MSAT courses to align our training programs with current industry standards and requirements. 
These unique industry-aligned course offerings make our students more valuable to employers by giving them training that is consistent with industry needs and rapidly changing technology and the opportunity to earn a variety of industry-recognized certifications and credentials. As a result, we believe we are well positioned to better meet the industry’s demand for skilled technicians.
We provide relevant services to assist students with possible tuition financing options, educational and career counseling, opportunities for part-time work while attending school, and ultimately, graduate employment. Our national employment services team develops job opportunities and outreach, while our local employment services teams advise active students on employment search and interviewing skills, facilitate employer visits to campuses, provide access to reference materials and assist with the composition of resumes.
Strengthen Industry Relationships
Our relationships with leading manufacturer brand partners and other strategic partners are important to our business. We deliver value to these partners and employers by functioning as an efficient hiring source and low cost training option for new and existing technicians. These relationships give us direct input on the latest needs and requirements of employers, which not only guides our prospective student recruitment, but also strengthens our curricula and our students’ opportunities for employment and higher earnings after graduation. In addition, our manufacturer brand partners support our students through manufacturer-paid courses, scholarships, tuition reimbursement programs and early employment initiatives. 
Growth and Diversification 
Our growth strategy is predicated on adding new campuses and expanding program offerings in the transportation and skilled trades fields.  We also have the opportunity to pursue our growth strategy through acquisitions. With a national higher-education market in transition, we are exploring potential acquisition opportunities that would allow us to enter new markets, expand our presence in existing markets, broaden our program offerings, enter into adjacent markets such as other skilled trades or high demand energy, or that could drive significant cost and operational synergies.
Our diversification strategy is focused on program diversification by adding new disciplines; evolving our instructional and delivery model to leverage enabling technologies resulting in better usage of campus facilities and instructional costs per student; executing on new instructional strategies that drive student outcomes and allow the business to more effectively scale; and identifying and adding new ways for programs to be funded by and for students.
During the year ended September 30, 2021, we executed the following as part of our growth and diversification strategy: 
•We entered into a definitive agreement to acquire MIAT College of Technology (“MIAT”) from HCP & Company. MIAT served approximately 1,200 students as of September 30, 2021 through its campuses in Canton, Michigan and Houston, Texas. The company offers vocational and technical certificates as well as associates degrees in fields with robust and growing demand for skilled technical workers, including aviation maintenance, energy technology, wind power, robotics and automation, non-destructive testing, HVACR, and welding. The acquisition will enable us to further expand our program offerings into growing industry sectors and rapidly expanding fields likely to be bolstered by technological innovation and the country’s focus on sustainable energy. The transaction closed on November 1, 2021.
•Announced and began execution on our plans to open two additional campus locations during fiscal 2022 in Austin, Texas and Miramar, Florida. 
•Announced the expansion of our welding technology program to our Bloomfield, New Jersey campus (launched in July 2021), to our Mooresville, North Carolina campus (in January 2022), and plans to launch a ninth welding program later in fiscal 2022.
•Launched or expanded the following MSAT programs:
◦The Fendt® Technician Academy, a new program with AGCO Corporation, a global leader in the design, manufacture and distribution of agricultural machinery and solutions, at our Lisle, Illinois campus.
◦The Daimler Trucks North America (“DTNA”) Finish First program to our Orlando, Florida campus.
◦Transition of BMW to the Fast Track program our Avondale, Arizona and Orlando, Florida campuses, with Long Beach, California launching in May 2022 and three additional locations launching by the end of fiscal 2022.

•Purchased our Avondale, Arizona campus at the end of December 2020, for approximately $45.2 million, including closing costs and other fees, with the intention of consolidating our MMI Phoenix, Arizona campus into the same location by the end of fiscal 2022. During May 2021, we completed the financing of our Avondale, Arizona campus which replenished approximately $31.2 million of the funds used to purchase the campus.

•Announced the future consolidation and reconfiguration of the UTI and MMI Orlando, Florida campus facilities into one site which is currently scheduled for completion by the end of the second quarter of 2022. 
Schools and Programs 
We offer certificate, diploma or degree programs at campuses across the United States under the banner of several well-known brands. The majority of our programs are designed to be completed in 36 to 90 weeks and culminate in a certificate, diploma or associate of occupational studies degree, depending on the program and campus. Tuition rates vary by type and length of our programs and the program level, such as core or advanced training.

Graduates may also secure positions outside of the Target Job Placement, including, for example, parts associate, service writer, fabricator, paint and preparation, and shop owner or operator, among others. 
Manufacturer Specific Advanced Training (“MSAT”) Programs
In addition to the program offerings noted above, we also offer advanced training programs in the form of manufacturer-paid post-graduate MSAT programs and in the form of student-paid MSAT courses, which may be added as electives to a student’s core automotive, diesel or motorcycle program. 

Manufacturer-Paid MSATs
A select number of students are offered manufacturer-paid MSATs, which are paid for by the manufacturer and/or its dealers in return for a commitment by the student to work for a dealer of that manufacturer for a certain period of time upon completion of the program. Students who are high performing graduates of an automotive or diesel program may apply to be selected for these programs. The programs range from 12 to 23 weeks in duration. Our manufacturer-paid MSATs are intended to offer in-depth instruction on specific manufacturers’ products, qualifying a graduate for employment with a dealer seeking highly specialized, entry-level technicians with brand-specific skills. 
We currently offer the following manufacturer-paid MSAT programs using vehicles, equipment, specialty tools and curricula provided by our manufacturer brand partners:

Manufacturer-Paid MSAT Programs Offered | Location 
BMW Service Technician Education Program (STEP)(1) | Avondale, Orlando 
Fendt Technician Academy by AGCO(2) | Lisle

Military Base Programs
In addition to the MSATs noted above, in partnership with the military and select industry partners, we have been developing and implementing advanced training programs at select military base locations. Military base programs differ from our traditional MSATs in that the students do not complete our traditional core programs at a UTI campus before entering these advanced training programs. These programs range from 12 to 16 weeks and are available to all men and women transitioning out of the military. Candidates are interviewed and selected for these programs. Additionally, to be considered, candidates must be within six months of their separation dates from the military. There is no tuition cost to the participating service members. 
We currently offer the following military base programs using vehicles, equipment, specialty tools and curricula provided by and/or developed in collaboration with certain manufacturer brand partners: 

Military Base Programs Offered | Location 
BMW Military Service Technician Education Program | Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton in California, U.S. Army Base Fort Bragg in North Carolina
Penske Premier Truck Group Technician Skills Program | Fort Bliss in El Paso, Texas 

Affordability and Accessibility
During the year ended September 30, 2021, tuition ranged from approximately $20,000 for our CNC program (lasting 36 weeks) to $60,000 for our Automotive and Diesel program with one specialized elective program (lasting 90 weeks). During the year ended September 30, 2021, the average annual revenue per student was approximately $29,200, net of scholarships or grants funded by us. We are focused on making our training more affordable and accessible through financing options, proprietary loans, institutional and relocation grants, scholarships based on need and merit, and employer sponsored training and tuition reimbursement. During the year ended September 30, 2021, approximately 42% of our active students received a UTI-funded scholarship or grant and approximately 23% of active students received funding from our proprietary loan program. 
To maximize student affordability and speed to completion, we are working with high schools across the nation to increase our Technical Education Institutional Grant (“TEIG”) agreements. The TEIG agreements allow students who have completed course(s) related to their selected program of study to receive a corresponding tuition credit for up to six courses. Our students may opt out of the courses provided they pass an Advanced Placement Opportunities Test for each selected course. We have approximately 4,000 curriculum-specific TEIG agreements in place across the country. This represents approximately 2% of the high schools covered by our admissions teams. We continue to identify new opportunities to expand the volume of these curriculum-specific TEIG agreements.
In response to growing demand for trained technicians, our industry partners and employers are increasingly willing to participate in our students’ cost of education by providing them with scholarship money and relocation assistance to attend school and by offering our graduates tuition reimbursement plans and competitive compensation and benefit packages, including signing bonuses, relocation grants and tool incentives. There are over 4,800 employer location incentive 

opportunities, which when made available make our training programs more affordable for students and may provide them with valuable relationships or employment opportunities following graduation.
Student Enrollment 
We enroll students throughout the year, and courses start every three to six weeks. For the year ended September 30, 2021, our average number of undergraduate full-time active students was 11,489, representing an increase of approximately 9.8% as compared to 10,462 for the year ended September 30, 2020. At September 30, 2021, our end of period number of undergraduate full-time active students was 13,682, an increase of 9.2% from our ending full-time enrollment of 12,524 at September 30, 2020.
Currently, our student body is geographically diverse. While our campus locations attract local students that live within 50 miles, we estimate that approximately 50% of our students elect to relocate to attend our programs. Due to the seasonality of our business and normal fluctuations in student populations, we expect variability in our quarterly results. See "Seasonality" within Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of seasonal fluctuations in our revenues and operating results.
Graduate Employment
Identifying employment opportunities and preparing our graduates for their future careers is critical to our ability to deliver value to our graduates from their education.  Accordingly, we dedicate significant resources to maintaining an effective employment team. Our campus-based staff facilitates several career development processes, including instruction and coaching for interview skills, interview etiquette and professionalism. Additionally, the employment team provides students with reference materials and assistance with the composition of resumes. Finally, we place emphasis on and devote significant time to assisting students with part-time and graduate job searches. 
We also have a centralized department whose focus is to build and maintain relationships with potential and existing national employers and develop graduate job opportunities and, where possible, relocation assistance, sign-on bonuses, tool packages and tuition reimbursement plans with our manufacturer brand partners and other industry employers. Together, the campuses and centralized department coordinate and host career fairs, industry awareness presentations, interview days and employer visits to our campus locations. We believe that our graduate employment services provide our students with a compelling value proposition and enhance the employment opportunities for our graduates and are a competitive differentiator from other education institutions. 
Our employment rate for 2020 and 2019 graduates who were employed within one year of graduation was 80% and 84%, respectively. The employment calculation is based on all graduates, including those that completed MSAT programs, from October 1, 2019 to September 30, 2020 and October 1, 2018 to September 30, 2019, respectively, excluding graduates not available for employment because of continuing education, military service, medical reasons, incarceration, death or international student status. We count a graduate as employed based on a verified understanding of the graduate’s job duties to assess and confirm that the graduate’s primary job responsibilities are in his or her field of study. We verify employment by sending written verification requests to the graduate and/or the employer or collecting written information with all required elements. Verifications must include employer name, job duties, job title, hire date and employer contact information. Once we receive written verification from either source, the graduate is classified as employed in field as long as all verification requirements are met. If any information provided in a written format requires clarification, a call is made to clarify certain elements with notes documented in our student database. In instances where we are unable to obtain written verification, we also classify graduates as employed in field if we are able to obtain verbal verification, collecting the same information as noted above, from both the graduate and the employer. We periodically review a sample of employment verifications to ensure accuracy. 

The table below summarizes the graduate employment rate data: 

 | Year Ended September 30,
 | 2020 | | 2019
Graduate employment rate(1) | 80 | % | | 84 | %
Graduates | 6,832 | | | 8,482 | 
Graduates available for employment | 6,476 | | | 8,065 | 
Graduates employed | 5,176 | | | 6,763 | 

(1)    The decrease in the graduate employment rate from fiscal 2019 to fiscal 2020 was due primarily to the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our student population and the employer community. 
Competition 
The for-profit, postsecondary education industry is highly competitive and highly fragmented, with no one provider controlling significant market share. We compete with other institutions that are eligible to receive Title IV funding, including not-for-profit public and private schools, community colleges and for-profit institutions which offer automotive, diesel, collision repair, motorcycle, marine, welding, CNC machining and closely related skilled trades training programs. Our competition differs in each market depending on the curriculum we offer and the availability of other choices, including job prospects. Other competitive factors that influence our ability to attract new students include the employment market, community colleges, other career-oriented and technical schools, and the military. 
Prospective students may choose to forego additional education and enter the workforce directly, especially during periods when the unemployment rate declines or remains stable as it has in recent years. This may include employment with our industry partners or with other manufacturers and employers of our graduates. 
We compete with local community colleges for students seeking programs that are similar to ours, mainly due to local accessibility, low tuition rates and in certain cases free tuition. Public institutions are generally able to charge lower tuition than our schools, due in part to government subsidies and other financial sources not available to for-profit schools. No single community college is a significant competitor; rather, the sector as a whole provides competition. 
Within the for-profit career-oriented and technical school sector, some of our national and regional competitors are Lincoln Technical Institute and Tulsa Welding School. We also consider other single location institutions with a larger local presence near one of our campuses to be competitors. Competition is generally based on location, tuition rates, the type of programs offered, the quality of instruction and instructional facilities, graduate employment rates, reputation and recruiting. Additionally, the military often recruits or retains potential students when branches of the military offer enlistment or re-enlistment bonuses. 
Human Capital Management 
As of September 30, 2021, we had approximately 1,660 full-time employees, including approximately 540 instructors, 320 admissions representatives, and 475 student support employees.
Each of our employees plays a key role in our mission to serve students, partners and communities by providing quality education and training for in-demand careers. We believe that diversity and inclusion (“D&I”) among our employees is essential in this process, as a truly innovative educational institution relies on a wealth of backgrounds and experiences to enhance student outcomes. During fiscal 2021 we hired a Director of Diversity and Inclusion who is responsible for setting the D&I strategy and roadmap to ensure that we meet our objectives both internally, of creating a company where everyone feels they belong, and externally, by working closely with our marketing and talent acquisition function to attract diverse talent. To attract a truly diverse workforce, we strive to instill a culture where employees are encouraged to draw upon their own unique skills and perspectives when engaging with our growing and diverse student population. 
Faculty members are hired nationally in accordance with established criteria, applicable accreditation standards and applicable state regulations. Members of our faculty are primarily industry professionals and are hired based on their prior work and educational experience. We require a specific level of industry experience in order to enhance the quality of the programs we offer and to address current and industry-specific issues in our course content. We provide intensive 

instructional training and continuing education to our faculty members to maintain the quality of instruction in all fields of study. A majority of our existing instructors have a minimum of five years’ experience in the industry and an average of eight years of experience teaching at UTI. 
We employ field, military and campus-based admissions representatives who work directly with prospective students to facilitate the enrollment process. Additionally, each school has a support team that typically includes a campus president, an education director, a financial aid director, a student services director, and an employment services director. 
We believe our management team has the experience necessary to effectively implement our growth and diversification strategy and continue to drive positive educational and employment outcomes for our students. For discussion of the risks relating to the attraction and retention of management and executive management employees, see Item 1A. “ Risk Factors.”
Environmental Matters
We use hazardous materials at our training facilities and campuses and generate small quantities of regulated waste, including, but not limited to, used oil, antifreeze, transmission fluid, paint, solvents and car batteries. As a result, our facilities and operations are subject to a variety of environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, the use, storage and disposal of solid and hazardous substances and waste, and the clean-up of contamination at our facilities or off-site locations to which we send or have sent waste for disposal. Certain of our campuses are required to obtain permits for our air emissions. In the event we do not maintain compliance with any of these laws and regulations, or if we are responsible for a spill or release of hazardous materials, we could incur significant costs for clean-up, damages, and fines or penalties.
Regulatory Environment 
Our institutions are subject to extensive regulatory requirements imposed by a wide range of federal and state agencies, as well as by institutional and programmatic accreditors. These regulatory requirements cover the vast majority of our operations, including our educational programs, facilities, instructional and administrative staff, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, financial operations and financial condition. These regulatory requirements also affect our ability to acquire, expand or open additional institutions or campuses, add new, or expand our existing educational programs and change our corporate structure and ownership. 
The approvals granted by these entities permit our schools to operate and to participate in a variety of government-sponsored financial aid programs that assist students in paying for their education. This includes the federal programs of student financial assistance under Title IV of the HEA, commonly referred to as Title IV Programs. We also are subject to oversight by other federal agencies including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), the SEC, the Federal Trade Commission, the Internal Revenue Service and the Departments of Veterans Affairs, Defense, Treasury, Labor and Justice. Below, we discuss certain elements of this regulatory environment.
State Authorization
To operate and offer postsecondary programs, and to be certified to participate in Title IV Programs, each of our institutions must obtain and maintain authorization from the state in which it is physically located (“Home State”). To engage in recruiting activities outside of its Home State, each institution also may be required to obtain and maintain authorization from the states in which it is recruiting students. UTI is authorized to participate in the State Authorization Reciprocity Agreement (“SARA”). SARA is an agreement among member states, districts and territories that establishes comparable national standards for interstate offering of post-secondary distance education courses and programs. SARA is overseen by a national council (NC-SARA) and administered by four regional education compacts. As of September 1, 2021, all states other than California are members of SARA. Each of our institutions holds the state and/or SARA authorizations required to operate and offer postsecondary education programs in its Home State, and to recruit in the states in which it engages in recruiting activities.
The level of regulatory oversight varies substantially from state to state and is extensive in some states. State laws may establish standards for instruction, qualifications of faculty, location and nature of facilities and equipment, administrative procedures, marketing, recruiting, student outcomes reporting, disclosure obligations to students, limitations on mandatory arbitration clauses in enrollment agreements, financial operations, and other operational matters. Some states prescribe standards of financial responsibility and mandate that institutions post surety bonds. Many states have requirements for 

institutions to disclose institutional data to current and prospective students, as well as to the public, and some states require that our schools meet prescribed performance standards as a condition of continued approval. States can and often do revisit, revise, and expand their regulations governing postsecondary education and recruiting.
Accreditation
Accreditation is a non-governmental process through which an institution voluntarily submits to ongoing qualitative reviews by an organization of peer institutions. Institutional accreditation by an ED-recognized accreditor is required for an institution to be certified to participate in Title IV Programs. All of our institutions are accredited by the ACCSC, which is an accrediting agency recognized by ED. 
ACCSC reviews the academic quality of each institution’s instructional programs, as well as the administrative and financial operations of the institution to ensure that it has the resources necessary to perform its educational mission, implement continuous improvement processes, and support student success. Our institutions must submit annual reports, and at times, supplemental reports, to demonstrate ongoing compliance and improvement. ACCSC requires institutions to disclose certain institutional information to current and prospective students, as well as to the public, and requires that our schools and programs meet various performance standards as a condition of continued accreditation. ACCSC often revisits, revises, and expands its standards and policies. Institutions must periodically renew their accreditation by completing a comprehensive renewal of accreditation process. 
We strive to maintain the highest standards. Currently 11 of our campuses are classified as a School of Excellence or Distinction. Six of our campuses have achieved this award twice in their history, and one campus has received this award three times in its history. 
The table below sets out the renewal cycle for each of our schools.

Title IV Programs
The federal government provides a substantial part of its support for postsecondary education through Title IV Programs in the form of grants and loans to students who can use those funds at any institution that has been certified as eligible to participate by ED. All of our institutions are certified to participate in Title IV Programs. The HEA, which authorizes Title 

IV Programs, has not been comprehensively reauthorized since 2008. Despite repeated attempts, Congress has not completed a full reauthorization since then. In addition to HEA reauthorization, policies directly related to Title IV Programs and funding for those programs may be impacted by the annual budget and appropriations process as well as by other legislation. At this time, UTI cannot predict any or all of the changes that Congress may ultimately make, and any of those changes could potentially have a material adverse effect on UTI’s business and operations. 
In fiscal 2021, we derived approximately 68% of our revenues, on a cash basis as defined by ED, from Title IV Programs. We derived approximately 49% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from the Direct Loan program, pursuant to which ED makes loans to students or their parents. We derived approximately 18% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from the Pell program, pursuant to which ED makes grants to students who demonstrate financial need. And we derived less than 1% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (“FSEOG”) program. FSEOG grants are designed to supplement Pell grants for students with the greatest financial need. Institutions must provide matching funding equal to 25% of all awards made under this program. 
The Title IV Program statutes and regulations are applied primarily on an institutional basis. The HEA defines an “institution” as a main campus and its additional locations. Pursuant to this definition, ED recognizes us as operating three institutions (“OPEIDs”), organized as follows:

Institution: | Universal Technical Institute of Arizona 
Main campus: | Universal Technical Institute, Avondale, Arizona 
Additional campuses: | Universal Technical Institute, Lisle, Illinois 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Long Beach, California 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Rancho Cucamonga, California 
 | NASCAR Technical Institute, Mooresville, North Carolina 
Institution: | Universal Technical Institute of Phoenix 
Main campus: | Universal Technical Institute DBA Motorcycle Mechanics Institute, Motorcycle & Marine Mechanics Institute, Phoenix, Arizona
Additional campuses: | Universal Technical Institute, Sacramento, California 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Orlando, Florida for the following divisions: 
 | Motorcycle Mechanics Institute, Orlando, Florida 
 | Marine Mechanics Institute, Orlando, Florida 
 | Automotive, Orlando, Florida 
Institution: | Universal Technical Institute of Texas 
Main campus: | Universal Technical Institute, Houston, Texas 
Additional campuses: | Universal Technical Institute, Exton, Pennsylvania 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Dallas/Ft. Worth, Texas 
 | Universal Technical Institute, Bloomfield, New Jersey 

To participate in Title IV Programs, an institution must be authorized by the relevant state, accredited by an ED-recognized accreditor, and certified by ED. To obtain and maintain certification, institutions also must demonstrate ongoing compliance with the HEA and its extensive and complex implementing regulations; regulations that ED frequently revisits, revises, and expands. Because all of our institutions are certified to participate in Title IV Programs, they all must comply with this complex framework of statutes, regulations, and guidance, and undergo detailed oversight and review. Below, we discuss the core components of the Title IV Programs’ regulatory framework. 
Eligibility and Recertification
All institutions participating in the Title IV Programs must first establish their eligibility to do so. The Program Participation Agreement (“PPA”) document serves as ED’s formal recognition that an institution and its associated additional locations have satisfied this requirement, and are authorized to participate in Title IV Programs for a specified period of time. An 

institution seeking to expand its activities in certain ways, such as opening an additional location or raising the highest academic credential it offers, must obtain approval from ED. Every institution also is required to periodically renew its certification by applying for continued certification before its current term of certification expires. Terms of certification are typically six years, but can be three years or shorter. We received a fully recertified PPA for Universal Technical Institute of Texas in April 2018, which will expire March 31, 2022. In November 2018, we received a fully recertified PPA for Universal Technical Institute of Arizona and for Universal Technical Institute of Phoenix. Both of the PPA’s will expire on March 31, 2022. 
The 90/10 Rule
As a condition of participation in Title IV Programs, proprietary institutions must agree when they sign their PPA to comply with the 90/10 rule. Under the current 90/10 rule, a proprietary institution is subject to sanctions if it derives more than 90% of its revenue from Title IV Program funds for a single year and loses its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs if it derives more than 90% of its revenue from Title IV Program funds for two consecutive fiscal years. We regularly monitor compliance with this requirement to minimize the risk that any of our institutions would derive more than the allowable maximum percentage of its revenue from Title IV Programs for any fiscal year. As of September 30, 2021, our institutions’ annual Title IV percentages as calculated under the 90/10 rule ranged from approximately 65% to 69% between our institution’s three OPEIDs. 
Under the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (“ARPA”), a proprietary institution must derive at least 10% of its revenue from sources other than “Federal education assistance funds,” instead of from sources other than “Title IV Program funds.” The phrase “Federal education assistance funds” is broadly defined as “[f]ederal funds that are disbursed or delivered to or on behalf of a student to be used to attend such institution.” While ARPA,is current law, by the statute’s own terms, the earliest this revision to the 90/10 rule may take effect is for institutional fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023.
We are currently reviewing the potential impact of this change and will be monitoring the proposed and final regulations promulgated by ED to carry out this change, which are anticipated in 2022. Based on currently available information and reasonable expectations regarding the scope of the phrase “Federal education assistance funds” we do not believe this change will materially impact our ability to comply with the 90/10 rule. 
Administrative Capability
To continue its participation in Title IV Programs, an institution must demonstrate that it remains administratively capable of providing the education it promises and of properly managing the Title IV Programs. ED assesses the administrative capability of each institution that participates in Title IV Programs under a series of standards listed in the regulations, which cover a wide range of operational and administrative topics, including the designation of capable and qualified individuals, the quality and scope of written procedures, the adequacy of institutional communication and processes, the timely resolution of issues, the sufficiency of recordkeeping, and the frequency of findings of noncompliance, to name a few. ED’s administrative capability standards also include thresholds and expectations for federal student loan cohort default rates (discussed below), satisfactory academic progress, and loan counseling. Failure to satisfy any of the standards may lead ED to find the institution ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs, require the institution to repay Title IV Program funds, change the method of payment of Title IV Program funds, place the institution on provisional certification as a condition of its continued participation or take other actions against the institution. 
Three-Year Student Loan Default Rates
To remain eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, institutions also must maintain federal student loan cohort default rates below specified levels. ED calculates an institution’s cohort default rate on an annual basis. Under the current calculation, the cohort default rate is derived from student borrowers who first enter loan repayment during a federal fiscal year (“FFY”) ending September 30 and subsequently default on those loans within the two following years; parent borrowers are excluded from the calculation. This represents a three-year measuring period. 

The following tables set forth the most recent three-year cohort default rates for our institutions: 

 | Three-Year Cohort Default Rates for 
 | Cohort Years Ended September 30, (1)
Institution: | 2018 | 2017 | 2016 
Universal Technical Institute of Arizona | 11.9% | 13.8% | 14.8%
Universal Technical Institute of Phoenix | 11.9% | 14.0% | 14.4%
Universal Technical Institute of Texas | 12.1% | 16.1% | 15.0%
All proprietary postsecondary institutions (2) | 11.2% | 14.7% | 15.2%

(1) Based on information published by ED.
(2)    Includes other proprietary institutions beyond Universal Technical Institute. 
An institution whose cohort default rate exceeds 30% in consecutive fiscal years may be subject to conditions and restrictions, and will lose eligibility if the rate remains above 30% three years in a row. An institution also will lose eligibility if its rate exceeds 40% for any fiscal year. As demonstrated in the table above, none of our institutions had a three-year cohort default rate of 30% or greater for 2018, 2017 or 2016, for the three most recent FFYs with published rates. An institution whose three-year cohort default rate is 15% or greater for any one of the three preceding years is subject to a 30-day delay in receiving the first disbursement on federal student loans for first-time borrowers. As of September 30, 2021, only Universal Technical Institute of Texas was subject to a 30-day delay in receiving the first disbursement on federal student loans for first-time borrowers due to a three-year cohort default rate that was 15% or greater for one of the three most recent years. 
Financial Responsibility
All institutions participating in Title IV Programs also must satisfy specific ED standards of financial responsibility. Among other things, an institution must meet all of its financial obligations, including required refunds to students and any Title IV Program liabilities and debts, be current in its debt payments, comply with certain past performance requirements, not receive an adverse, qualified, or disclaimed opinion by its accountants in its audited financial statements. Each year, ED also evaluates institutions’ financial responsibility by calculating a “composite score,” which utilizes information provided in the institutions’ annual audited financial statements. The composite score is based on three ratios: (1) the equity ratio which measures the institution’s capital resources, ability to borrow and financial viability; (2) the primary reserve ratio which measures the institution’s ability to support current operations from expendable resources; and (3) the net income ratio which measures the institution’s ability to operate at a profit.
ED assigns a strength factor to the results of each of these ratios on a scale from negative 1.0 to positive 3.0, with negative 1.0 reflecting financial weakness and positive 3.0 reflecting financial strength. ED then assigns a weighting percentage to each ratio and adds the weighted scores for the three ratios together to produce a composite score for the institution. If an institution’s composite score is above 1.5, and it meets all other requirements, it is deemed financially responsible. If its composite score is below 1.5, but at least 1.0, the institution is still considered to be financially responsible, but must agree to additional oversight by ED in the form of cash monitoring and other participation requirements. 
If an institution’s composite score is below 1.0, the institution is considered by ED to lack financial responsibility. ED may permit the institution to continue to participate in the Title IV Programs if it agrees to, among other things: (1) post a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 50% of the total Title IV Program funds received by the institution during its most recently completed fiscal year; or (2) post a letter of credit in an amount equal to at least 10% of such prior year’s Title IV Program funds, accept provisional certification for a period of no more than three years, comply with additional ED notification and operating requirements and conditions, and agree to receive Title IV Program funds under an arrangement other than ED’s standard advance funding arrangement. If an institution is unable to establish financial responsibility on an alternative basis, the institution may be subject to financial penalties, restrictions on operations and loss of external financial aid funding. 
ED has historically evaluated the financial condition of our institutions on a consolidated basis based on the financial statements of Universal Technical Institute, Inc. as the parent company. ED’s regulations permit ED to examine the financial 

statements of Universal Technical Institute, Inc., the financial statements of each institution and the financial statements of any related party. ED has not required us currently to post a letter of credit on behalf of any of our schools. ED has required us to provide certain information on a regular basis following our issuance of preferred stock on July 15, 2016, and we continue to provide monthly reports to ED pursuant to such direction. For our year ended September 30, 2021, we calculated our composite score to be 2.6. However, the composite score calculations and resulting requirements imposed on our institutions are subject to determination by ED once it receives and reviews our audited financial statements. 
Between composite score calculations, ED also will reevaluate the financial responsibility of an institution following the occurrence of certain “triggering events,” which must be timely reported to the agency. Specifically, ED may determine that an institution is not able to meet its financial or administrative obligations if one of the following events occurs:
•The institution incurs a liability from a settlement, final judgment or final determination arising from an administrative or judicial action or proceeding initiated by a federal or state entity and, as a result of that liability, the institution’s recalculated composite score is less than 1.0 as determined by ED under procedures described in the regulations;
•For a proprietary institution whose composite score is less than 1.5, there is a withdrawal of owner’s equity from the institution by any means (as defined by the regulations) and, as a result of that withdrawal, the institution’s recalculated composite score is less than 1.0 as determined by ED under procedures described in the regulations; 
•The SEC issues an order suspending or revoking the registration of the institution’s securities or suspends trading of the institution’s securities on any national securities exchange; 
•The national securities exchange on which the institution’s securities are traded notifies the institution that it is not in compliance with the exchange’s listing requirements and, as a result, the institution’s securities are delisted;
•The SEC is not in timely receipt of a required report and did not issue an extension to file the report; or 
•If two or more “discretionary” triggering events (as described below) take place within a certain time period unless a triggering event is resolved before any subsequent event(s) occurs.
ED also may determine that an institution is not able to meet its financial or administrative obligations if one of the following discretionary triggering events occurs and is likely to have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of the institution:
•The accrediting agency for the institution issued an order, such as a show cause order or similar action, that, if not satisfied, could result in the withdrawal, revocation or suspension of institutional accreditation; 
•The institution violated a provision or requirement in a security or loan agreement and a default, delinquency or other event occurs that triggers or enables the creditor to require or impose on the institution an increase in collateral, a change in contractual obligations, an increase in interest rates or payments, or other sanctions, penalties, or fees; 
•The institution’s state licensing agency notifies the institution of an intent to withdraw or terminate the institution’s state licensure if the institution does not take the steps necessary to come into compliance with a state licensing agency requirement; 
•The institution did not receive at least 10 percent of its revenue from non-Title IV sources for its most recently completed fiscal year as calculated by ED; 
•The institution has high annual drop-out rates as calculated by ED; or 
•The institution’s two most recent official cohort default rates are 30 percent or greater, as determined under the regulations and unless the institution has a pending or successful appeal that sufficiently reduces at least one of the rates.
ED regulations give the institution an opportunity to provide information to the agency demonstrating that the triggering event is not material to the institution’s financial position in advance of any final determination regarding the institution’s financially responsibility. 

Substantial Misrepresentation
The regulatory definitions of “misrepresentation” and “substantial misrepresentation” enforced by ED are exceptionally broad and do not require intent by the institution to misrepresent, or actual reliance by the person to whom the alleged misrepresentation was made. Therefore, it is possible that a statement made by the institution or one of its service providers or representatives could be construed by ED to constitute a substantial misrepresentation, even if the statement was made in error, without intent to misrepresent, and the person to whom it was made did not actually rely upon it. 
Incentive Compensation
The “incentive compensation” prohibition forbids institutions from providing any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, on success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV Program funds. We have made adjustments to the compensation practices for our admissions representatives which we believe comply with the current regulations and ED’s guidance. We will continue to evaluate other compensation options under these regulations and guidance. 
Distance Education
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, ED provided broad approval for institutions to use distance education without going through the standard ED approval process. ED also permitted accreditors to waive their distance education review requirements. Taking advantage of these flexibilities, we transitioned our students into blended program formats, which permitted their non-clinical training to be offered online. 
ED’s temporary flexibilities currently remain in place, and will continue through the end of the payment period that begins after the date on which the federally-declared national emergency related to COVID-19 is rescinded. However, having observed that our blended learning programs offer a range of academic, operational, and financial efficiencies, we have determined to seek the permanent approvals that will permit us to continue offering blended learning programming after the noted temporary flexibilities have expired. We also continue to work to ensure that our blended learning programming complies with applicable distance education rules and standards, including ED’s new distance education rules, which became effective July 1, 2021. We intend to offer our Automotive, Diesel, Automotive/Diesel, Motorcycle and Marine programs in a blended learning format on a permanent basis. Additionally, we intend to continue to invest in our blended learning platform and curriculum to further enhance the student experience and student outcomes. 
To date, we have received approval from ACCSC to permanently offer blended format programs that utilize both distance and on-ground education. Additionally, we have received permanent approvals by all state education authorizing agencies to offer blended format programs. Finally, we are working to secure approval from the Florida State veterans agency to classify our MMI non-degree, blended programs as resident training for purposes of VA benefits, to ensure that veterans enrolling in these programs can access their VA benefits after December 21, 2021, when applicable waivers are currently set to expire.
Title IV Program Rulemaking
ED is almost continuously engaged in one or more negotiated rulemakings, which is the process pursuant to which it revisits, revises, and expands the complex and voluminous Title IV Program regulations. On May 26, 2021, ED announced its intention to establish multiple rulemaking committees and for these committees to prepare proposed regulations. These regulations could involve revisiting and potentially revising regulations across 14 different topics areas identified by ED, including the rules governing changes in ownership, standards of administrative capability, borrower defense to repayment, closed school loan discharges, mandatory pre-dispute arbitration clauses, and gainful employment. It is expected that these negotiated rulemakings will occur throughout 2022 and 2023, and that any resulting rules will become effective thereafter. ED has also invited public commentary on other matters around potential gaps in postsecondary outcomes, including retention, completion, loan repayment and student loan default. The potential outcome, if any, from these announced actions is unknown at this time. We devote significant effort to understanding the effects of ED regulations and rulemakings on our business and to developing compliant solutions that also are congruent with our business, culture, and mission to serve our students and industry relationships. 
Borrower Defense to Repayment Rulemaking
The Obama administration carried out a negotiated rulemaking in 2016 to significantly revise and enhance the borrower defense to repayment (“BDTR”) framework, which specifies in regulation which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a defense to repayment of Title IV Program loans. Dissatisfied with the results of the 2016 effort (the “2016 BDTR Rule”), the Trump administration held a second negotiated rulemaking in 2018 to revise the BDTR rule yet again, and published its own final rule on September 23, 2019 (the “2019 BDTR Rule”), which became effective on July 1, 2020.
Litigation and regulatory actions caused considerable confusion regarding the effective date for each version of the BDTR rule, and how and when each will be interpreted and applied. Institutions of higher education are required to comply (and to have complied) with the 2016 BDTR Rule from July 1, 2017 to June 30, 2020, and to comply with the 2019 BDTR Rule from July 1, 2020 forward. Because the 2016 BDTR Rule was not deemed “good law” until October 2018, institutions also are required to follow nuanced guidance from ED regarding compliance during the period prior to the Court’s decisions, but subsequent to July 1, 2017. Finally, when promulgating the 2019 BDTR Rule, ED determined that some elements of the 2016 BDTR Rule would continue to be applied on a go-forward basis, if the underlying events that gave rise to the issue occurred prior to the implementation of the 2019 BDTR Rule. As such, elements of the 2016 BDTR Rule will remain in place, coexisting with the 2019 BDTR Rule and being applied by ED in specified circumstances. 
While the borrower defense claim process was (and is) at the heart of the BDTR rulemaking, the regulatory reforms carried out by the rule are far more extensive. In 2016, and then again in 2018, the BDTR rule included material changes to the regulations governing financial responsibility, closed school discharge, false certification discharge, misrepresentation, student grievance processes, the reporting of litigation and arbitration proceedings, the use of pre-dispute arbitration agreements and class action waivers in agreements with students, and the publication of repayment rates. Additional details regarding certain of these reforms are as follows:
•The Borrower Defense Claim Process. The BDTR rules establish amended procedures and standards for borrowers, either individually or as a group, to assert through an ED-administered process a defense to the borrowers’ obligation to repay certain Title IV Program loans based on certain acts or omissions of the institution. The 2016 BDTR Rule details the types of defenses available for loans first disbursed between July 1, 2017 and June 30, 2020. The 2019 BDTR Rule details the types of defenses available for loans first disbursed on or after July 1, 2020. If ED approves a borrower’s defense to repayment through the applicable administrative process established in the proposed regulations, ED may discharge the borrower’s obligation to repay some or all of the borrower’s student loans and may initiate a separate proceeding to collect from the institution the discharged and returned amounts. 
•Financial Responsibility. The 2016 BDTR Rule significantly revised ED’s financial responsibility framework to specify certain triggering events, and to require that they be timely reported to ED. It was believed that these new requirements would permit ED to identify, as early as possible, events that might impact an institution’s financial health. The 2019 BDTR Rule does not abandon the revised financial responsibility framework established by the 2016 BDTR Rule, both triggering events and reporting timeframes remain. However, the 2019 BDTR Rule meaningfully simplifies the reporting requirements, and affords institutions additional opportunity to dialogue with ED regarding the materiality of a reported event. 
•Pre-Dispute Contractual Provisions.  The 2016 BDTR Rule prohibited the use and reliance upon certain contractual provisions regarding dispute resolution processes, such as pre-dispute arbitration agreements or class action waivers, and required certain notifications, contract provisions, and disclosures by institutions regarding students’ ability to participate in class action lawsuits or to initiate certain lawsuits instead of through arbitration. The rules also required institutions to submit to ED copies of certain records in connection with any claim filed in arbitration by or against the school concerning a borrower defense claim and any claim filed in a lawsuit by the school against the student or by any party against the school concerning a borrower defense claim. The 2019 BDTR Rule, which took effect on July 1, 2020, generally permits the use of arbitration clauses and class action waivers provided institutions make certain disclosures to students. The litigation and regulatory actions that impacted the effective date for each version of the BDTR rule have made it extremely difficult to predict when and how the ban on these pre-dispute contractual provisions will be interpreted and applied by courts, particularly to litigation that precedes or spans the effective dates of the BDTR rules.

•Closed School Loan Discharge. ED regulations have long provided that ED may discharge a borrower’s obligation to repay certain Title IV Program loans if the borrower (or the student on whose behalf a parent borrowed) did not complete the program of study for which the loan was made because the campus at which the borrower (or student) was enrolled closed. If ED discharges the loans, the agency may seek to recover from the school or other related parties the amount of loans discharged and to impose other liabilities and penalties. Consequently, if we close a campus, ED could discharge borrower obligations to repay certain Title IV Program loans. We may be able to mitigate these losses by conducting or arranging for an orderly teach-out of students at a closed campus, but these efforts could be unsuccessful if students decline to participate in the teach-out or transfer their credits to another school or if they fail to complete their programs. The 2019 BDTR Rule revised the closed school loan discharge regulations to allows students to obtain a discharge if, among other requirements, they were enrolled not more than 180 days before the campus closed. ED has the authority to extend the 180-day period for extenuating circumstances. ED also has the authority to discharge on its own initiative the loans of qualified borrowers without a borrower application if the borrower did not subsequently re-enroll in any Title IV eligible institution within three years from the date the school closed. The 2019 BDTR Rule limits this authority to schools that closed between November 1, 2013 and July 1, 2020. If we were to close a campus, we would intend to teach-out all of the currently enrolled students at the campus. However, certain students may elect to withdraw before graduation. We cannot predict the number of students who might withdraw prior to the closure of a campus and potentially qualify for a loan discharge. 
As noted above, ED has announced its intent to establish multiple rulemaking committees to revisit a wide range of existing Title IV Program regulations. One such committee, which began deliberations in October 2021, is considering revisions to the BDTR rules outlined above. We are monitoring this process and will carefully review any proposed or final regulations promulgated by ED.
Accreditation and Innovation Rulemaking
On October 15, 2018, ED announced its intent to establish a negotiated rulemaking to develop regulations related to several matters, including, but not limited to, requirements for accrediting agencies in their oversight of member institutions and programs; criteria used by ED to recognize accrediting agencies; simplification of ED’s recognition and review of accrediting agencies; clarification of the core oversight responsibilities amongst accrediting agencies, states and ED; clarification of the permissible arrangements between an institution of higher education and another organization to provide a portion of an educational program; roles and responsibilities of institutions and accrediting agencies in the teach-out process; regulatory changes required to ensure equitable treatment of brick-and-mortar and distance education programs; regulatory changes required to enable expansion of direct assessment programs, distance education, and competency-based education; regulatory changes required to clarify disclosure and other requirements of state authorization; emphasizing the importance of institutional mission in evaluating its policies, programs and outcomes; simplification of state authorization requirements related to distance education; defining “regular and substantive interaction” as it relates to distance education and correspondence courses; defining the term “credit hour;” defining the requirements related to the length of educational programs and entry level requirements for the occupation; and other matters. 
In early 2019, ED hosted multiple rounds of negotiated rulemaking. The committee and subcommittees completed their meetings in April 2019 and reached consensus on draft proposed regulations. On November 1, 2019, ED published its final rule covering accreditation and state authorization matters, with a general effective date of July 1, 2020. 
Gainful Employment Rulemaking
ED’s gainful employment regulations that took effect July 1, 2015, included debt-to-earning metrics and disclosure requirements that applied to all programs offered by proprietary institutions. Programs with debt-to-earnings that failed to satisfy certain thresholds could lose Title IV Program eligibility. On July 1, 2019, following a contentious negotiated rulemaking, ED issued final regulations that rescinded the existing gainful employment regulations, effective July 1, 2020. However, ED has announced its intent to establish a rulemaking committee to revisit the gainful employment rule. We are monitoring this process and will carefully review any proposed or final regulations promulgated by ED.
Other Federal and State Student Aid Programs
Some of our students also receive financial aid from federal sources other than Title IV Programs, such as the programs administered by the VA, the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) and under the Workforce Investment Act. Additionally, 

some states provide financial aid to our students in the form of grants, loans or scholarships. Our Long Beach, Rancho Cucamonga and Sacramento, California campuses, for example, are currently eligible to participate in the Cal Grant program. All of our institutions must comply with the eligibility and participation requirements applicable to each of these funding programs, which vary by funding agency and program.
In 2021 we derived approximately 14% of our revenues, on a cash basis, from veterans’ benefits programs, which include the Post-9/11 GI Bill, the Montgomery GI Bill, the Reserve Education Assistance Program (“REAP”) and VA Vocational Rehabilitation. To continue participation in veterans’ benefits programs, an institution must comply with certain requirements established by the VA, including that the institution report on the enrollment status of eligible students; maintain student records and make such records available for inspection; follow rules applicable to the individual benefits programs; and comply with applicable limits on the percentage of students receiving certain veterans’ benefits on a program and campus basis.
The VA shares responsibility for VA benefit approval and oversight with designated State Approving Agencies (“SAAs”). SAAs play a critical role in evaluating institutions and their programs to determine if they meet VA benefit eligibility requirements. Processes and approval criteria, as well as interpretation of applicable requirements, can vary from state to state. Therefore, approval in one state does not necessarily result in approval in all states. 
The VA imposes limitations on the percentage of students per program receiving benefits under certain veterans’ benefits programs, unless the program qualifies for certain exemptions. If the VA determines that a program is out of compliance with these limitations, the VA will continue to provide benefits to current students, but new students will not be eligible to use their veterans’ benefits for an affected program until we demonstrate compliance. Additionally, the VA requires a campus be in operation for two years before it can apply to participate in VA benefit programs. With the exception of our newest campus in Bloomfield, New Jersey, which opened in August 2018, all of our campuses are eligible to participate in VA education benefit programs.
During 2012, President Obama signed an Executive Order directing the DOD, Veterans Affairs and Education to establish “Principles of Excellence” (“Principles”), based on certain guidelines set forth in the Executive Order, to apply to educational institutions receiving federal funding for service members, veterans and family members. As requested, we provided written confirmation of our intent to comply with the Principles to the VA in June 2012. We are required to comply with the Principles to continue recruitment activities on military installations. Additionally, there is a requirement to possess a memorandum of understanding (“MOU”) with the DOD as well as with certain individual installations. Our access to bases for student recruitment has become more limited due to recent changes in the Transition Assistance Program (Transition Goals, Plans, Success) and increased enforcement of the MOU requirement. Each of our institutions has an MOU with the DOD. We have MOUs with certain key individual installations and are pursuing MOUs at additional locations; however, some installations will not provide MOUs to institutions that do not teach at the installation. We continue to strengthen and develop relationships with our existing contacts and with new contacts in order to maintain and rebuild our access to military installations.
