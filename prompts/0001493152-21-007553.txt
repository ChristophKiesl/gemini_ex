ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
 
We are a real estate development company involved in all aspects of the residential real estate industry including land acquisition, entitlements, construction of project infrastructure, home building, marketing, and sales of various single and multifamily projects in the states of Washington, California, and Texas. We have constructed single-family communities and homes in Gig Harbor, Bremerton, Silverdale, Bainbridge Island, Belfair, Allyn, and Port Orchard, Washington, and have single-family homes in various early stages of plan development in California and Texas. Our business strategy is focused on the acquisition of land to develop property for the construction and sale of residential lots, home communities, and multi-family properties within a 30 to 60-minute commute to major metropolitan employment corridors.

Our portfolio of offered lots, home plans, and finishing options, coupled with a historic low inventory of residential and multi-family housing in our principal geographic areas, currently provide a diverse product portfolio and an opportunity to increase revenue and overall market share. In addition to our single-family residential projects, we plan to build and sell townhomes and anticipate commencement of land development for two condominium sites in 2021. In an effort to strategically control the expanding needs of our corporate team, we have committed to purchase the office building that we currently lease for our corporate headquarters. We expect to make a 25% down payment using cash from operations or financing and finance the remaining 75% with a standard bank loan (mortgage).
 
Since 2015, we have grown quickly with increasing revenues each year of operation. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, our total revenues were $50,397,000 and $30,953,500, respectively. On December 31, 2020, our backlogs of fully executed contracts for the sale of developed residential lots and single-family homes were $7,000,000 and $2,052,576, respectively.
 
With $8,022,800 in heavy equipment, our infrastructure development division efficiently constructs a diverse range of residential communities and improved lots in a cost-effective manner. We utilize heavy equipment to develop raw land and through this process create residential subdivisions and multi-family communities. The equipment is primarily used for land clearing, site development, public and private road improvements, installation of wet utilities such as sewer, water, and storm sewer lines, in addition to construction of dry utilities lines for power, gas, telephone, and cable service providers.
 
Recently completed projects include New Brooklyn (Q3 2019); Saylor View Estates (Q1 2020); Valley View Estates (Q4 2020); and Lakeland Village (Q1 2021).
 
Home and Finished Lot Sales
 
In 2019, we sold 46 homes and 61 finished building lots. Our 2019 single-family home selling prices ranged from $410,000 for first-time buyers to $950,000 in the luxury home market. The 61 building lot sales represented 24% of total revenue in 2019.
 
In 2020, we sold 76 homes and 104 finished building lots. Our 2020 single-family home selling prices ranged from $413,400 to $779,000. The 104 building lot sales represented 25% of total revenue in 2020.
 
We are a general contractor and construct single-family homes utilizing a base of employees in conjunction with third-party subcontractors. All subcontractors are licensed and bonded.
 
Strategy 
 
Our strategy is driven by the following:
 
Provide Superior Quality and Homeowner Experience and Service
 
Our core operating philosophy is to provide a positive and memorable experience to our homeowners through active engagement in the building process, to provide our customers with customization options to suit their lifestyle needs, and enhancing communication, knowledge, and satisfaction. We engineer our homes for energy-efficiency which is aimed at reducing the homeowner’s environmental impact and energy costs.

We seek to maximize customer satisfaction by offering affordable homes that are built with quality materials and craftsmanship, exhibit distinctive design and floor plans, emphasize energy efficiency, and are situated in premium locations. Our competitive edge in the selling process focuses on the home’s features, design, and available options. Our goal is not just to build houses, but rather to create desirable communities through superior design and execution.
 
New home buyers’ needs are met across multiple communities and price points by maintaining a substantial inventory of ready to build lots and designer home plans. Further, our business model enables buyers to overcome the significant inventory and pricing challenges present in high growth metropolitan markets. We provide new home buyers the opportunity to purchase high quality personalized homes at competitive pricing and in a desirable timeframe.
 
Focus on Efficient Operations
 
We strive to control costs through a disciplined planning process. Detailed budgets are prepared for all cost categories. Budgets are closely monitored throughout the building process, as we continue to revisit and update the budget on an ongoing basis. Many components are provided by subcontractors and significant effort is expended to assure that scopes of work are complete and inclusive. Contract variances and change orders are closely scrutinized for appropriateness. At the sale and closing of each home in a project, the estimated and final margins are compared, and variances are identified and investigated to better control costs on future homes in the project. We believe our disciplined process of setting realistic budgets and expectations, monitoring, and evaluating them and making any necessary adjustments to correct deviations going forward enables us to prudently control our costs.
Strategic Partnerships/Cost Control 
 
Our business model is flexible and facilitates partnering with companies that specialize in their local markets, including residential builders, general contractors, and land developers. By partnering with these specialists, our cost structure can be closely managed. Further, all internal shared services are centralized at our corporate office in Washington state. Centralized functions include purchasing, accounting, finance, legal, transaction coordination, and permitting. Centralizing these important functions keeps our infrastructure costs under tight control.
Our Markets
 
Our business strategy is focused on the acquisition of land for development purposes and the design, construction, and sale of residential lots, single-family homes, townhomes, and condominiums in the rapidly growing Puget Sound region of Western Washington, with further expansion underway into other similar markets in California and Texas.
Our Products
 
We offer a wide range of finished single-family lots and high-quality homes in the markets we serve, while striving to maintain appropriate consumer product and price level diversification. We focus on underserved consumer groups for each of our locations while attempting to diversify so that our land portfolio is not overly concentrated in any one area. The ability to build at multiple price points enables us to easily adjust to changing consumer and market demands. Buyer profiles are developed for each market and neighborhoods and homes are designed with the specific needs of those buyers in mind.

Land Acquisition and Development Process
 
We execute an integrated business model to monetize land during three distinct stages of the development cycle. As a result, risks may be mitigated by providing multiple exit points for our real estate assets.

● | Sale of Entitled Land – Property sold following the controlling jurisdiction’s approval of a permitted residential or other use. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Sale of Finished Lots - Property sold after infrastructure completed including all roads, sidewalks, and utilities. 
● | Sale of Completed Building Product – Property sold following construction of a single-family home or condominium. 

 
Our acquisition process generally includes the following steps to reduce development and market cycle risk:
 

● | review of the status of entitlements and other governmental processing, including title reviews; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | complete due diligence on the land parcel prior to committing to the acquisition; 
● | prepare detailed budgets for all cost categories; 
● | complete environmental reviews and third-party market studies; and 
● | utilize options, when necessary. 

 
Before purchasing large land tracts, we also engage outside engineers and consultants to help review the proposed acquisition and assist with community and home design.
 
Homebuilding, Marketing, and Sales Process
 
Our philosophy is to provide a positive, memorable experience to homeowners by actively engaging them in the building process and by enhancing communication, knowledge, and satisfaction. Options are available to suit individual and family lifestyle needs. Home designs include features such as outdoor living spaces, one-story living, and first floor master bedroom suites to appeal to universal design needs. Our homes are engineered for energy-efficiency which is aimed at reducing impact on the environment and lowering energy costs to our homebuyers.
 
We sell our homes through independent real estate brokers. Sales representatives and independent brokers assist potential buyers by providing them with basic floor plans, price information, development and construction timetables, tours of model homes, and the selection of options. We, along with our design consultants, strive for superior design choices that coincide with the lifestyles of targeted homebuyers.
 
Our selling agents and brokers advertise directly to potential homebuyers through the internet and in newspapers and trade publications, as well as through marketing brochures and newsletters.
 
Construction may start when a customer has selected a lot, chosen a floor plan, and received preliminary mortgage approval. However, construction often begins prior to that point in order to satisfy market demand for completed homes and to facilitate construction scheduling and/or cost savings. Homebuilding revenues are recognized when home sales are finished and closed and title and possession are transferred to the buyer.

Our sales contracts typically require an earnest money deposit. Buyers are generally required to pay an additional deposit when they select options or upgrades for their homes. The amount of earnest money required varies between markets and communities, but typically averages 2.5% of the total purchase price of the home. Most of our sales contracts stipulate that when homebuyers cancel their contracts with us, following a stipulated period of time, we have the right to retain their earnest money and option deposits. Our sales contracts may also include contingencies that permit homebuyers to cancel and receive a partial refund of their deposits if they cannot obtain mortgage financing at prevailing or specified interest rates within a specified time period or if they cannot sell an existing home. The length of time between the signing of a sales contract for a home and delivery of the home to the buyer varies depending on customer preferences, permit approval, and construction cycles.
 
Customer Relations, Quality Control, and Warranty Programs
 
We pay particular attention to the product design process and carefully consider quality and choice of materials in order to reduce building deficiencies. The quality and workmanship of the subcontractors we employ are monitored with regular inspections and evaluations, seeking to ensure that all standards are met.
 
We maintain quality control and customer service staff whose role includes providing a positive experience for each customer throughout the pre-sale, sale, building, closing, and post-closing periods. These employees are also responsible for providing post-sale customer support. Our quality and service initiatives include providing customers with a comprehensive walk-through of their home prior to closing.
 
Warranty Programs
 
We provide each homeowner with product warranties covering workmanship and materials for one year from the time of closing and warranties covering structural systems for six years from the time of closing in connection with our general liability insurance policy. We believe our warranty program meets or exceeds terms customarily offered in the homebuilding industry. The subcontractors who perform most of the actual construction also provide us with customary warranties on their workmanship.
Materials
 
When constructing residential housing, we use various materials and components. The typical build time for our single-family homes is four to six months, during which time materials are subject to price fluctuations. Such price fluctuations are caused by several factors, among them seasonal variations in availability, international trade disputes and resulting tariffs, and increased demand for materials as a result of the improved housing market. The current trade dispute with China has the potential to increase our cost on certain materials such as quartz slabs for countertops, finished hardware, lighting fixtures, and engineered hardwood used in residential flooring. While it has had a minimal effect on our sourcing of materials and supplier components thus far, the continuing COVID-19 pandemic could impact our sourcing needs in the future.
 
Our material suppliers are subcontractors that are licensed, bonded, and insured. Each subcontractor provides a bid for the work required and is awarded a contract based on price, reputation, and ability to meet our time frames.
 
Our material suppliers provide us with credit terms for materials used in the construction of our homes. Credit terms range from a 30 to 60-day payment cycle following their delivery or installation of a product or service.

COVID-19
 
On March 25, 2020, the Governor of Washington imposed a complete moratorium on construction of single-family low-risk construction in the State (the “Moratorium”). We had to cease construction operations on that date. The Moratorium was lifted on April 24, 2020, provided that safety measures were implemented, including the creation of a COVID-19 safety plan, exposure response procedure plan, and mandatory construction site safety meetings. We implemented the safety measures and re-started housing construction activities. The possibility remains that the Governor could impose new or additional requirements or restrict or completely halt construction again depending on the development of the COVID-19 infection rate.
 
We have not, at this time, experienced any cancelled sales contracts. We have experienced some supply-chain issues with both cabinetry and appliances related to COVID-19. As of the date of this Annual Report, our projects are on-schedule and operations are not being materially impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.
 
Seasonality
 
We experience seasonal variations in our quarterly operating results and capital requirements. Historically, new order activity is highest during the spring and summer months. As a result, most home closings, and resulting revenue occur in the third and fourth quarters of a given fiscal year. Historical results are not necessarily indicative of current or future homebuilding activities.
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters
 
We are subject to numerous local, state, federal, and other statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning zoning, development, building design, construction, and similar matters which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Projects that are not entitled may be subject to periodic delays, changes in use, less intensive development, or elimination of development in certain specific areas due to government regulations. We may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing in certain communities due to building moratoriums or “slow-growth” or “no-growth” initiatives that could be implemented in the future. Local and state governments also have broad discretion regarding the imposition of development fees for projects in their jurisdiction. Projects for which we have received land use and development entitlements or approvals may still require a variety of other governmental approvals and permits during the development process and can also be impacted adversely by unforeseen health, safety, and welfare issues, which can further delay these projects or prevent their development.
 
We are also subject to a variety of local, state, federal, and other statutes, ordinances, rules, and regulations concerning the environment. The particular environmental laws which apply to any given construction site vary according to the site’s location, its environmental conditions, and the present and former uses of the site, as well as adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, and can prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in environmentally sensitive regions or areas. From time to time, the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and similar federal or state agencies review homebuilders’ compliance with environmental laws and may levy fines and penalties for failure to strictly comply with applicable environmental laws or impose additional requirements for future compliance as a result of past failures. Any such actions imposed on us may increase our costs. Environmental regulations can also have an adverse impact on the availability and price of certain raw materials such as lumber.

Under various environmental laws, current or former owners of real estate, as well as certain other categories of parties, may be required to investigate and remediate hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases and may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage and for investigation and remediation costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination. In addition, in those cases where an endangered species is involved, environmental rules and regulations can result in the elimination of development in identified environmentally sensitive areas. To date, we have never experienced a significant environmental issue.
 
Competition and Market Factors
 
We face competition in the homebuilding industry, which is characterized by relatively low barriers to entry. Homebuilders compete for, among other things, home buying customers, desirable land parcels, financing, raw materials, and skilled labor. Increased competition may prevent us from acquiring attractive land parcels on which to build homes or make such acquisitions more expensive, hinder our market share expansion, or lead to pricing pressures on existing homes that may adversely impact our margins and revenues. Competitors may independently develop land and construct housing units that are superior or substantially similar to our products and because they are or may be significantly larger, have a longer operating history, and have greater resources or lower cost of capital than us, may be able to compete more effectively in one or more of the markets in which we operate or plan to operate. We also compete with other homebuilders that have longer standing relationships with subcontractors and suppliers in the markets in which we operate or plan to operate.
Human Capital
 
As of the date of this Annual Report, we had 40 full-time employees. None of our employees are members of any organized labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. One of our independent contractors employs union members.
 
We have been taking guidance from the State of Washington regarding COVID-19 protocols in the workplace. Some employees that are able to perform their job functions remotely are working remotely. However, this may change if there are any other developments in state or local law, and on a case-by-case basis. The safety and well-being of our employees are important to us and several higher-risk employees work from home for periods of time.
 
Pursuant to recent amendments to the Washington Business Corporation Act (WBCA), effective June 11, 2020, public corporations are required to have a “gender-diverse board” or otherwise provide a “board diversity discussion and analysis” to its shareholders. Currently, our board of directors is not gender diverse and is comprised entirely of men. However, we have taken steps to comply with the requirements of the WCBA at the applicable time by identifying candidates for our board of directors who meet the board diversity requirement and plan to nominate them at our next annual shareholders meeting.
