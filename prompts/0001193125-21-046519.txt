Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

GENERAL 
 Founded in 1980, we are a premier global nutrition company that provides consumers with nutrition solutions in the areas of weight management, sports nutrition, and health and wellness. We use a direct-selling business model to distribute and market our nutrition products to and through a network of independent members, or Members. We believe that direct selling is ideally suited for our business because the distribution and sales of nutrition products are reinforced by the personal support, coaching, education, and understanding community of like-minded people that our entrepreneurial Members have to offer. 
 We sell high-quality, science-backed products in the categories of weight management; targeted nutrition; energy, sports, and fitness; outer nutrition; and literature, promotional, and other in 95 markets globally as of December 31, 2020. In addition to the effectiveness of personalized selling through a direct-selling business model, we believe the primary drivers for our success throughout our 41-year operating history have been enhanced consumer awareness and demand for our products due to global trends such as the obesity epidemic, increasing interest in a fit and active lifestyle, living healthier, and the rise of entrepreneurship. 
PRODUCT SALES 
 Our Members use high-quality and science-backed products to help other Members and their customers manage their weight, improve their overall health, enhance their fitness and sport goals, and experience life-changing results. As of December 31, 2020 we marketed and sold approximately 120 product types. Our products are often sold as part of a program and therefore our portfolio is comprised of a series of related products designed to simplify weight management and nutrition for our Members and their customers. Our Formula 1 Nutritional Shake Mix, our best-selling product line, approximated 28% of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
 The following table summarizes our products by product category: 
 

 | Percentage of Net Sales | | | | 
 | 2020 | | | 2019 | | 2018 | Description | | Representative Products
Weight Management | | 59.8 | % | | 61.8 | % | 63.5 | % | | Meal replacement, protein shakes, drink mixes, weight loss enhancers and healthy snacks | Formula 1 Healthy Meal, Herbal Tea Concentrate, Protein Drink Mix, Personalized Protein Powder, Total Control®, Formula 2 Multivitamin Complex, Prolessa™ Duo, and Protein Bars

  Product returns and buyback policies 
 In substantially all markets, our products include a customer satisfaction guarantee. Under this guarantee, any customer or preferred member who is not satisfied with an Herbalife product for any reason may return it or any unused portion of it within 30 days from the time of receipt for a full refund or credit toward the exchange of another Herbalife product. In addition, in substantially all jurisdictions, we maintain a buyback program pursuant to which we will repurchase products sold to a Member who has decided to leave the business. The buyback program has certain terms and conditions that may vary by market, but it generally permits the return of unopened and marketable condition products or sales materials purchased within the prior twelve month period in exchange for a refund of the net price paid for the product and, in most markets, the cost of returning the products and materials to us. Together, product returns and buybacks were approximately 0.1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018. 
 Product development 
 To help our consumers achieve a healthy active lifestyle, we are committed to providing the highest-quality, science-backed products in the areas of weight management; targeted nutrition (including everyday wellness and healthy aging); energy, sports, and fitness; and outer nutrition. We believe our focus on nutrition and botanical science and the combination of our internal efforts with the scientific expertise of outside resources, including our ingredient suppliers, major universities, and our Nutrition Advisory Board, have resulted in product differentiation that has given our Members and consumers increased confidence in our products. 
 We continue to invest in scientific and technical functions, including research and development associated with creating new or enhancing current product formulations and the advancement of personalized nutrition solutions; clinical studies of existing products or products in development; technical operations to improve current product formulations; quality assurance and quality control to establish the appropriate quality systems, controls, and standards; and rigorous ingredient and product testing to ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, as well as in the areas of regulatory and scientific affairs. Our personalized nutrition solutions include tools which aid in the development of optimal product packages specific to our customers’ individual nutritional needs, based on their expected wellness goals. 
 Our product development strategy is twofold: (1) to increase the value of existing customers by investing in products to fill perceived gaps in our portfolios, adding flavors, increasing convenience by investing in snacks and bars, and expanding afternoon and evening consumption with products like savory shakes or soups; and (2) to attract new customers by entering into new categories, offering more choices, increasing individualization, and expanding our current sports line. We have a keen focus on product innovation and aim to launch new products and variations on existing products on a regular basis. Once a particular market opportunity has been identified, our scientists, along with our operations, marketing, and sales teams, work closely with Member leadership to introduce new products and variations on existing products. 
 Our Nutrition Advisory Board and Dieticians Advisory Board are comprised of leading experts around the world in the fields of nutrition and health who educate our Members on the principles of nutrition, physical activity, diet, and healthy lifestyle. We rely on the scientific contributions from members of our Nutrition Advisory Board and our in-house scientific team to continually upgrade existing products or introduce new products as new scientific studies become available and are accepted by regulatory authorities around the world. 
 MARKETS 
 Competition 
 The categories of weight management; targeted nutrition; energy, sports, and fitness; and outer nutrition products are highly competitive. We compete against products sold in a number of distribution channels, including direct selling, online retailers, specialty retailers, and the discounted channels of food, drug and mass 
 
6 

  merchandise. In particular, our direct-selling competitors include Nu Skin, Tupperware, and USANA and our other competitors include Conagra Brands, Hain Celestial, and Post. We have differentiated ourselves from our competitors through our Members’ focus on the consultative sales process through product education and the frequent contact and support that many Members have with their customers through a community-based approach to help customers achieve nutrition goals. Some methods include Nutrition Clubs, Weight Loss Challenges, Wellness Evaluations, and Fit Camps. 
 We are also subject to competition for the recruitment of Members from other network marketing organizations, including those that market nutrition products, and other types of products which are sold through direct selling, along with other entrepreneurial opportunities. Our ability to remain competitive depends on factors including having relevant products that meet consumer needs, a rewarding compensation plan, enhanced education and tools, innovation in our products and services, and a financially viable company. 
 For additional information regarding competition, see the risk factors titled “Our failure to establish and maintain Member and sales leader relationships could negatively impact sales of our products and materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results” and “Our failure to compete successfully could materially harm our business, financial condition, and operating results” in Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
 OUR NETWORK MARKETING PROGRAM 
 General 
 Our products are sold and distributed through a global direct selling business model which individuals may join to become a Member of our network marketing program. As a global nutrition company, we believe that the one-on-one personalized service inherent in the direct-selling business model is ideally suited to marketing and selling our nutrition products. Sales of nutrition products are reinforced by the ongoing personal contact, coaching, behavior motivation, education, and the creation of supportive communities. These are the services that are offered by our Members to their customers. This frequent, personal contact can enhance consumers’ nutritional and health education as well as motivate healthy behavioral changes in consumers to begin and maintain an active lifestyle through wellness and weight management programs. In addition, our Members consume our products themselves, and, therefore, can provide first-hand testimonials of the use and effectiveness of our products and programs to their customers. The personalized experience of our Members has served as a very powerful sales tool for our products. 
 In certain geographic markets such as the United States, Brazil, India, Russia, and Italy, we have introduced segmentation of our Member base into two categories: “preferred members” – who are simply consumers who wish to purchase product for their own household use, and “distributors” – who are Members who also wish to resell products or build a sales organization. One of the key outcomes of this new member segmentation is to provide clear differentiation between those interested in retailing our products or building a sales organization, and those simply consuming our products as discount customers. This distinction allows us to both better communicate and market to each group, while also providing us with better information regarding our Members within the context of their stated intent and goals. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 6.2 million Members, including 1.7 million preferred members and 1.5 million distributors in these markets where we have established these two categories and 0.4 million sales representatives and independent service providers in China. Future increases in the number of preferred members, as conversions take place or as we introduce segmentation into other markets, does not in and of itself represent an increase in the total number of Members, nor is it necessarily indicative of our future expected financial performance. 
 Our objective is sustainable growth in the sales of our products to our Members and their customers by increasing the productivity, retention and recruitment of our Member base through the structure of our Network Marketing Program. 
 On July 18, 2002, we entered into an agreement with our Members that provides that we will continue to distribute Herbalife products exclusively to and through our Members and that, other than changes required by 
 
7 

  applicable law or necessary in our reasonable business judgment to account for specific local market or currency conditions to achieve a reasonable profit on operations, we will not make any material changes to certain aspects of our Marketing Plan that are adverse to our Members without the support of our Member leadership. Specifically, any such changes would require the approval of at least 51% of our Members then at the level of President’s Team earning at the production bonus level of 6% who vote, provided that at least 50% of those Members entitled to vote do in fact vote. We initiate these types of changes based on the assessment of what will be best for us and our Members and then submit such changes for the requisite vote. We believe that this agreement has strengthened our relationship with our existing Members, improved our ability to recruit new Members and generally increased the long-term stability of our business. 
 Our Members 
 We believe our Members are the most important differentiator as we go to market with our nutrition products, because of the one-on-one direct contact they have with their customers, along with the education, training and community support services that we believe help improve the nutrition habits of consumers. People become Herbalife Members for a number of reasons. Many first start out as consumers of our products who want to lose weight or improve their nutrition, and are customers of our Members. Some later join Herbalife and become Members themselves, which makes them eligible to purchase products directly from us, simply to receive a discounted price on products for them and their families. Some Members are interested in the entrepreneurial opportunity to earn compensation based on their own skills and hard work and join Herbalife to earn part-time or full-time income. 
 We work closely with our entrepreneurial Members to improve the sustainability of their businesses and to reach consumers As a leading direct seller, we require our Members to fairly and honestly market both our products and the Herbalife business opportunity. Our relationship with our Members is key to our continued success as they allow us direct access to the voice of consumers. 
 Many of our entrepreneurial Members identify and test new marketing efforts and programs developed by other Members and disseminate successful techniques to their sales organizations. For example, Members in Mexico developed businesses that became known as “Nutrition Clubs,” marketing techniques that improved the productivity and efficiency of our Members as well as the affordability of our weight loss products for their customers. Rather than buying several retail products, these businesses allow consumers to purchase and consume our products each day (a Member marketing technique we refer to as “daily consumption”), while continuing to benefit from the support and interaction with the Member as well as socializing with other customers in a designated location. Other programs to drive daily consumption, whether for weight management or for improved physical fitness, include Member-conducted weight loss contests, or Weight Loss Challenges, Member-led fitness programs, or Fit Camps, and Member-led Wellness Evaluations. We refer to successful Member marketing techniques that we disseminate throughout our Member network, such as Nutrition Clubs, Weight Loss Challenges, and Fit Camps, as Daily Methods of Operations, or DMOs. 
 We believe that personal and professional development is key to our Members’ success and, therefore, we and our sales leader Members have meetings and events to support this important objective. We and our Member leadership conduct in-person and virtual training sessions on local, regional, and global levels attended by thousands of Members to provide updates on product education, sales and marketing training, and instruction on available tools. These events are opportunities to showcase and disseminate our Members’ evolving best marketing practices and DMOs from around the world and to introduce new or upgraded products. A variety of training and development tools are also available through online and mobile platforms. 
 In 2010, we launched the Herbalife Nutrition Institute. The Institute is an informational resource available to Members dedicated to promoting excellence in the field of nutrition. The Institute’s website is an important communication vehicle to further our leadership in the field, and an educational resource for the general public, government agencies, the scientific community, and our Members, about good nutrition and basic health. Its 
 
8 

  mission is to encourage and support research and education on the relationship between good health, balanced nutrition and a healthy active lifestyle. In addition to providing research and education on the website and through sponsored conferences and symposia, the Institute has associations with major nutrition science organizations. 
 Member Compensation and Sales Leader Retention and Requalification 
 In addition to benefiting from discounted prices, Members interested in the entrepreneurial opportunity can earn profit from several sources. First, Members may earn profits by purchasing our products at wholesale prices, discounted depending on the Member’s level within our Marketing Plan, and reselling those products at prices they establish for themselves to generate retail profit. Second, Members who sponsor other Members and establish, maintain, coach, and train their own sales organizations may earn commissions on the sales of their organization. Members earning such compensation have generally attained the level of sales leader as described below. There are also many Members, which include distributors, who have not sponsored another Member. Members who have not sponsored another Member are generally considered discount buyers or small retailers and a number of these Members have also attained the sales leader level. 
 We assign point values, known as Volume Points, to each of our products to determine a Member’s sales achievement level. See Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Operating Results, for a further description of Volume Points. To become a sales leader, or qualify for a higher level, Members must achieve specified Volume Point thresholds of product sales or earn certain amounts of royalty overrides during specified time periods and generally must re-qualify once each year. Qualification criteria can vary somewhat by market. We have qualification methods of up to 12 months to encourage a more gradual qualification. We believe a gradual qualification approach is important to the success and retention of new sales leaders and benefits the business in the long term as it allows new Members to obtain product and customer experience as well as additional training and education on Herbalife products, daily consumption based DMOs, and the business opportunity prior to becoming a sales leader. 
 The basis for calculating Marketing Plan payouts varies depending on product and market and for 2020 utilized on a weighted-average basis approximately 90% of suggested retail price, to which we applied discounts of up to 50% for distributor allowances and payout rates of up to 15% for royalty overrides, up to 7% for production bonuses, and approximately 1% for the Mark Hughes bonus. We believe that the opportunity for Members to earn royalty overrides and production bonuses contributes significantly to our ability to retain our most active and productive Members. 
 Our compensation system requires each sales leader to re-qualify for such status each year, prior to February, in order to maintain their 50% discount on products and be eligible to receive royalty payments. In February of each year, we demote from the rank of sales leader those Members who did not satisfy the re-qualification requirements during the preceding twelve months. The re-qualification requirement does not apply to new sales leaders (i.e. those who became sales leaders subsequent to the January re-qualification of the prior year). Volume Points are the basis for sales leader qualification. Typically, a Member accumulates Volume Points for a given sale at the time the Member pays for the product. However, effective beginning in May 2017, a Member does not receive Volume Point credit for a transaction in the United States until that product is sold to a customer at a profit and it is documented in compliance with the Consent Order entered into with the Federal Trade Commission. 
 As of December 31, 2020, prior to our February re-qualification process, approximately 783,000 of our Members have attained the level of Sales Leader, of which approximately 676,000 have attained this level in the 94 markets globally where we use our worldwide Marketing Plan and 107,000 independent service providers operating under our China Marketing Plan.

  The table below reflects the number of sales leaders as of the end of February of the year indicated (subsequent to the annual re-qualification process) and sales leader retention rate by year and by region: 
 

 | Number of Sales Leaders | | Sales Leader Retention Rate
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018 | 2020 | 2019 | | | 2018
North America | | 71,202 | | 66,264 | | 49,379 | | 65.4 | % | | 73.2 | % | 65.9 | %
Mexico | | 72,866 | | 75,475 | | 71,719 | | 66.6 | % | | 69.9 | % | 66.3 | %
South and Central America | | 61,535 | | 64,929 | | 66,325 | | 60.7 | % | | 62.2 | % | 59.0 | %
EMEA | | 130,438 | | 121,297 | | 107,528 | | 70.6 | % | | 71.3 | % | 68.7 | %
Asia Pacific | | 158,815 | | 133,817 | | 114,818 | | 65.7 | % | | 64.4 | % | 59.0 | %
Total sales leaders | | 494,856 | | 461,782 | | 409,769 | | 66.5 | % | | 67.9 | % | 63.6 | %
China | | 70,701 | | 89,077 | | 76,600 | | | | | | | | 
Worldwide total sales leaders | | 565,557 | | 550,859 | | 486,369 | | | | | | | | 


The number of sales leaders as of December 31 will exceed the number immediately subsequent to the preceding re-qualification period because sales leaders qualify throughout the year but sales leaders who do not re-qualify are removed from the rank of sales leader the following February. 
 For the latest twelve-month re-qualification period ending January 2021, approximately 67.9% of our sales leaders, excluding China, re-qualified, versus 66.5% for the twelve-month period ended January 2020. For each of these years, certain markets have utilized a lower re-qualification threshold, and these figures include the effect of the lower threshold. Excluding the impact of the lower re-qualification thresholds, the retention rates for 2021 and 2020 would have been 62.9% and 62.3%, respectively. Separately, with revised business requirements in place for U.S. and U.S. Territories, as described in Network Marketing Program below, we now utilize a re-qualification equalization factor for U.S. Members to better align their re-qualification thresholds with Members in other countries, and retention results for each of the years presented include the effect of the equalization factor. We believe this factor preserves retention rate comparability across markets. Also, for each of the years presented, the retention results exclude certain markets for which, due to local operating conditions, sales leaders were not required to requalify; such exclusions are not material to our retention results. 
 We believe the sales leader retention rate of 67.9% for the year ended January 2021 is the result of efforts we have made to improve the sustainability of sales leaders’ businesses, such as encouraging Members to obtain experience retailing Herbalife products before becoming a sales leader. As our business operations evolve, including the segmentation of our Member base in certain markets and changes in sales leader re-qualification thresholds for other markets, management continues to evaluate the importance of sales leader retention rate information. 
 Member Technology 
 Many Members today also rely on the use of technology to support their businesses. With the increasing use of technology in our everyday lives and the increased Member activity on our online and mobile tools, we have also enhanced our product access and distribution network to support higher volumes of online or mobile orders. Placing orders through these media also allows Members and their customers to select home or business delivery options. We continue to adapt our access points to accommodate the increase in online or mobile ordering activity. We have also implemented information technology systems to support Members and their increasing demand to be more connected to Herbalife, their business, and their consumers. These systems include our Internet-based marketing and Member services platform with tools such as HN MyClub, Engage, HNconnect, BizWorks, MyHerbalife, GoHerbalife, and Herbalife.com. Additionally, we support a growing suite of point-of-sale tools to assist our Members with the ordering, tracking and their customer relationship management. These tools allow our Members to manage their business and communicate with their customers more efficiently and effectively.

  Business in China 
 Our business model in China includes unique features as compared to our traditional business model in order to ensure compliance with Chinese regulations. As a result, our business model in China differs from that used in other countries. Members in China are categorized differently than those in other countries. In China, we sell our products to and through independent service providers and sales representatives to customers and preferred customers, as well as through Company-operated retail platforms when necessary. 
 In China, while multi-level marketing is not permitted, direct selling is permitted. Chinese citizens who apply and become Members are referred to as sales representatives. These sales representatives are permitted to sell away from fixed retail locations in the provinces where we have direct selling licenses, including in the provinces of Jiangsu, Guangdong, Shandong, Zhejiang, Guizhou, Beijing, Fujian, Sichuan, Hubei, Shanxi, Shanghai, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Henan, Chongqing, Hebei, Shaanxi, Tianjin, Heilongjiang, Hunan, Guangxi, Hainan, Anhui, Yunnan, Gansu, Ningxia, and Inner Mongolia. In Xinjiang province, where we do not have a direct selling license, we have a Company-operated retail store that can directly serve customers and preferred customers. With online orderings throughout China, there has been a declining demand in Company-operated retail stores. 
 Sales representatives receive scaled rebates based on the volume of products they purchase. Sales representatives who reach certain volume thresholds and meet certain performance criteria are eligible to apply to provide marketing, sales and support services. Once their application is accepted, they are referred to as independent service providers. Independent service providers are independent business entities that are eligible to receive compensation from Herbalife for the marketing, sales and support services they provide so long as they satisfy certain conditions, including procuring the requisite business licenses, having a physical business location, and complying with all applicable Chinese laws and Herbalife rules. 
 In China, our independent service providers are compensated for marketing, sales support, and other services, instead of the Member allowances and royalty overrides utilized in our global Marketing Plan. The service hours and related fees eligible to be earned by the independent service providers are based on a number of factors, including the sales generated through them and through others to whom they may provide marketing, sales support and other services, the quality of their service, and other factors. Total compensation available to our independent service providers in China can generally be comparable to the total compensation available to other sales leaders globally. The Company does this by performing an analysis in our worldwide system to estimate the potential compensation available to the service providers, which can generally be comparable to that of sales leaders in other countries. After adjusting such amounts for other factors and dividing by each service provider’s hourly rate, we then notify each independent service provider the maximum hours of work for which they are eligible to be compensated in the given month. In order for a service provider to be paid, the Company requires each service provider to invoice the Company for their services. 
 RESOURCES 
 We seek to provide the highest quality products to our Members and their customers through our “seed to feed” strategy, which includes significant investments in quality ingredients from traceable sources, scientific personnel, product testing, and increasing the amount of self-manufacturing of our top products. 
Ingredients 
 Our seed to feed strategy is rooted in using quality ingredients from traceable sources. Our procurement process for many of our botanical products now stretches back to the farms and includes self-processing of teas and herbal ingredients into finished raw materials at our own facilities. Our Changsha, China facility provides high quality tea and herbal raw materials to all our manufacturing plants as well as our third-party contract manufacturers around the world. We source the ingredients that we do not self-process from companies that we 
 
11 

  believe are well-established and reputable suppliers in their respective field. Our suppliers also utilize similar quality processes, equipment, expertise, and traceability as we do with our own modern quality processes. As part of ensuring high quality ingredients, we also test our incoming raw materials for compliance to potency, identity, and adherence to strict specifications. 
 Manufacturing 
 The next key component of our seed to feed strategy involves the high-quality manufacturing of these ingredients into finished products, which are produced at both third-party manufacturers and our own manufacturing facilities. We continue to execute on our long-term strategy of expanding and increasing our self-manufacturing. Our manufacturing facilities, known as Herbalife Innovation and Manufacturing Facilities, or HIMs, include HIM Lake Forest, HIM Winston-Salem, HIM Suzhou, and HIM Nanjing. HIM Winston-Salem, currently our largest manufacturing facility at approximately 800,000 square feet, and HIM Nanjing both have significant space for future expansion. Together, our HIM manufacturing facilities produce approximately 60% to 65% of our inner nutrition products sold worldwide. 
 We analyze our finished products for label claims and microbiological purity, thereby verifying product safety and shelf life. For our self-manufactured products, we do substantially all of our testing in-house at our modern quality control laboratories in the U.S. and China. We have major quality control labs in Southern California; Winston-Salem, North Carolina; Suzhou, China; Nanjing, China; and our Worldwide Quality Center of Excellence in Changsha, China. All HIM quality control labs contain modern analytical equipment and are backed by the expertise in testing and methods development of our scientists. In our U.S. HIM facilities, which produce products for the U.S. and most of our international markets, we operate and test to the regulations established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and strict Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations, or CGMPs, for food, acidified food, and dietary supplements. 
 We work closely with our third-party manufacturers to ensure high quality products are produced and tested through a vigorous quality control process at audited contract manufacturer labs or third-party labs. For these products manufactured at other facilities, we combine four elements to ensure quality products: (1) the same selectivity and assurance in ingredients as noted above; (2) use of reputable, CGMP-compliant, quality-minded manufacturing partners; (3) a significant supplier qualification and annual audit program; and (4) significant product quality testing. During 2020, we purchased approximately 20% of our products from our top three third-party manufacturers. 
 Intellectual property and branding 
 Marketing foods and supplement products on the basis of sound science means using ingredients in the exact composition and quantity as demonstrated to be effective in the relevant scientific literature. Use of these ingredients for their well-established purposes is by definition not novel, and for that reason, most food uses of these ingredients are not subject to patent protection. Notwithstanding the absence of patent protection, we do own proprietary formulations for substantially all of our weight management products and dietary and nutritional supplements. We take care in protecting the intellectual property rights of our proprietary formulas by restricting access to our formulas within the Company to those persons or departments that require access to them to perform their functions, and by requiring our finished goods suppliers and consultants to execute supply and non-disclosure agreements that contractually protect our intellectual property rights. Disclosure of these formulas, in redacted form, is also necessary to obtain product registrations in many countries. We also make efforts to protect certain unique formulations under patent law. We strive to protect all new product developments as the confidential trade secrets of the Company and its inventor employees. 
 We use the umbrella trademarks Herbalife®, Herbalife Nutrition®, and the Tri-Leaf design worldwide, and protect several other trademarks and trade names related to our products and operations, such as Niteworks® and Liftoff®. Our trademark registrations are issued through the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or 
 
12 

  USPTO, and comparable agencies in the foreign countries. We believe our trademarks and trade names contribute to our brand awareness. 
 To increase our brand awareness, we and our Members use a variety of tools and marketing channels. These can include anything from traditional media to social media and alliances with partners who can promote our goal of better living through nutrition. Herbalife Nutrition sponsorships of and partnerships with featured athletes, teams, and events promote brand awareness and the use of Herbalife products. We continue to build brand awareness with a goal towards becoming the most trusted brand in nutrition. We also work to leverage the power of our Member base as a marketing and brand-building tool. We maintain a brand style guide and brand asset library so that our Members have access to the Herbalife Nutrition brand logo and marketing materials for use in their marketing efforts. 
 Infrastructure 
 Our direct-selling business model enables us to grow our business with moderate investment in infrastructure and fixed costs. We incur no direct incremental cost to add a new Member in our existing markets, and our Member compensation varies directly with product sales. In addition, our Members also bear a portion of our consumer marketing expenses, and our sales leaders sponsor and coordinate Member recruiting and most meeting and training initiatives. Additionally, our infrastructure features scalable production and distribution of our products as a result of having our own manufacturing facilities and numerous third-party manufacturing relationships, as well as our global footprint of in-house and third-party distribution centers. 
 An important part of our seed to feed strategy is having an efficient infrastructure to deliver products to our Members and their customers. As the shift in consumption patterns continues to reflect an increasing daily consumption focus, one focus of this strategy is to provide more product access points closer to our Members and their customers. We have both Company-operated and outsourced distribution points ranging from our “hub” distribution centers in Los Angeles, Memphis, and Venray, Netherlands, to mid-size distribution centers in major countries, to small pickup locations spread throughout the world. We also expect to continue to improve our distribution channels relating to home delivery as we expect to see continued increased demands for our products being shipped to our Members in certain of our larger markets. In addition to these distribution points, we partner with certain retail locations to provide Member pickup points in areas which are not well serviced by our distribution points. We have also identified a number of methods and approaches that better support Members by providing access points closer to where they do business and by improving product delivery efficiency through our distribution channels. Specific methods vary by markets and consider local Member needs and available resources. In aggregate, we have over 1,700 distribution points and partner retail locations around the world. In addition to our distribution points, we contract third party-run drop-off locations where we can ship to and Members can pick up ordered products. 
 We leverage our technology infrastructure in order to maintain, protect, and enhance existing systems and develop new systems to keep pace with continuing changes in technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, emerging data security risks, and changing user patterns and preferences. We also continue to invest in our manufacturing and operational infrastructure to accelerate new products to market and accommodate planned business growth. We invest in business intelligence tools to enable better analysis of our business and to identify opportunities for growth. We will continue to build on these platforms to take advantage of the rapid development of technology around the globe to support a more robust Member and customer experience. In addition, we leverage an Oracle business suite platform, which was upgraded in 2017, to support our business operations, improve productivity and support our strategic initiatives. Our investment in technology infrastructure helps support our capacity to grow.

  REGULATION 
 General 
 In both our United States and foreign markets, we are affected by extensive laws, governmental regulations, administrative determinations and guidance, court decisions and similar constraints that regulate the conduct of our business. Such laws, regulations and other constraints exist at the federal, state or local levels in the United States and at all levels of government in foreign jurisdictions, and include regulations pertaining to: (1) the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, distribution, importation, sale, and storage of our products; (2) product claims and advertising, including direct claims and advertising by us, as well as claims and advertising by Members, for which we may be held responsible; (3) our network marketing program; (4) transfer pricing and similar regulations that affect the level of U.S. and foreign taxable income and customs duties; (5) taxation of our Members (which in some instances may impose an obligation on us to collect the taxes and maintain appropriate records); (6) our international operations, such as import/export, currency exchange, repatriation and anti-bribery regulations; (7) antitrust issues; and (8) privacy and data protection. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Products 
 In the United States, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, holding, labeling, promotion, advertising, distribution, and sale of our products are subject to regulation by various federal governmental agencies, including (1) the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, (2) the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, (3) the Consumer Product Safety Commission, or CPSC, (4) the United States Department of Agriculture, or USDA, (5) the Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, (6) the United States Postal Service, (7) United States Customs and Border Patrol, and (8) the Drug Enforcement Administration. Our activities also are regulated by various agencies of the states, localities, and foreign countries in which our products are manufactured, distributed, or sold. The FDA, in particular, regulates the formulation, manufacture, and labeling of over-the-counter, or OTC, drugs, conventional foods, dietary supplements, and cosmetics such as those distributed by us. The majority of the products marketed by us in the United States are classified as conventional foods or dietary supplements under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FFDCA. Internationally, the majority of products marketed by us are classified as foods, health supplements, or food supplements. 
 FDA regulations govern the preparation, packaging, labeling, holding, and distribution of foods, OTC drugs, cosmetics, and dietary supplements. Among other obligations, they require us and our contract manufacturers to meet relevant CGMP regulations for the preparation, packaging, holding, and distribution of OTC drugs and dietary supplements. The FDA also requires identity testing of all incoming dietary ingredients used in dietary supplements, unless a company successfully petitions for an exemption from this testing requirement in accordance with the regulations. The CGMPs are designed to ensure that OTC drugs and dietary supplements are not adulterated with contaminants or impurities, and are labeled to accurately reflect the active ingredients and other ingredients in the products. We have implemented a comprehensive quality assurance program that is designed to maintain compliance with the CGMPs for products manufactured by us or on our behalf for distribution in the United States. As part of this program, we have regularly implemented enhancements, modifications and improvements to our manufacturing and corporate quality processes. We believe that we and our contract manufacturers are compliant with the FDA’s CGMP and other applicable manufacturing regulations in the United States. 
 The U.S. Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994, or DSHEA, revised the provisions of FFDCA concerning the composition and labeling of dietary supplements. Under DSHEA, dietary supplement labeling may display structure/function claims that the manufacturer can substantiate, which are claims that the products affect the structure or function of the body, without prior FDA approval, but with notification to the FDA. They may not bear any claim that they can prevent, treat, cure, mitigate or diagnose disease (a drug claim). Apart from DSHEA, the agency permits companies to use FDA-approved full and qualified health claims for food and supplement products containing specific ingredients that meet stated requirements. 
 
14 

  U.S. law also requires that all serious adverse events occurring within the United States involving dietary supplements or OTC drugs be reported to the FDA. We believe that we are in compliance with this law having implemented a worldwide procedure governing adverse event identification, investigation and reporting. As a result of reported adverse events, we may from time to time elect, or be required, to remove a product from a market, either temporarily or permanently. 
 Some of the products marketed by us are considered conventional foods and are currently labeled as such. Within the United States, this category of products is subject to the federal Nutrition, Labeling and Education Act, or NLEA, and regulations promulgated under the NLEA. The NLEA regulates health claims, ingredient labeling and nutrient content claims characterizing the level of a nutrient in the product. The ingredients in conventional foods must either be generally recognized as safe by experts for the purposes to which they are put in foods, or be approved as food additives under FDA regulations. 
 The federal Food Safety Modernization Act, or FSMA, is also applicable to some of our business. We follow a food safety plan and have implemented preventive measures required by the FSMA. Foreign suppliers of our raw materials are also subject to FSMA requirements, and we have implemented a verification program to comply with the FSMA. Dietary supplements manufactured in accordance with CGMPs and foods manufactured in accordance with the low acid food regulations are exempt. 
 In foreign markets, prior to commencing operations and prior to making or permitting sales of our products in the market, we may be required to obtain an approval, license or certification from the relevant country’s ministry of health or comparable agency. Prior to entering a new market in which a formal approval, license or certificate is required, we work with local authorities in order to obtain the requisite approvals. The approval process generally requires us to present each product and product ingredient to appropriate regulators and, in some instances, arrange for testing of products by local technicians for ingredient analysis. The approvals may be conditioned on reformulation of our products, or may be unavailable with respect to some products or some ingredients. 
 The FTC, which exercises jurisdiction over the advertising of all of our products in the United States, has in the past several years instituted enforcement actions against several dietary supplement and food companies and against manufacturers of weight loss products generally for false and misleading advertising of some of their products. In addition, the FTC has increased its scrutiny of the use of testimonials, which we also utilize, as well as the role of expert endorsers and product clinical studies. We cannot be sure that the FTC, or comparable foreign agencies, will not question our advertising or other operations in the future. 
 In Europe, where an EU Health Claim regulation is in effect, the European Food Safety Authority, or EFSA, issued opinions following its review of a number of proposed claims documents. ESFA’s opinions, which have been accepted by the European Commission, have limited the use of certain nutrition-specific claims made for foods and food supplements. Accordingly, we revised affected product labels to ensure regulatory compliance. 
 We are subject to a permanent injunction issued in October 1986 pursuant to the settlement of an action instituted by the California Attorney General, the State Health Director and the Santa Cruz County District Attorney. We consented to the entry of this injunction without in any way admitting the allegations of the complaint. The injunction prevents us from making specified claims in advertising of our products, but does not prevent us from continuing to make specified claims concerning our products, provided that we have a reasonable basis for making the claims. The injunction also prohibits certain recruiting-related investments from Members and mandates that payments to Members be premised on retail value (as defined); the injunction provides that we may establish a system to verify or document such compliance. 
 Network Marketing Program 
 Our network marketing program is subject to a number of federal and state regulations administered by the FTC and various state regulators as well as regulations in foreign markets administered by foreign regulators. 
 
15 

  Regulations applicable to network marketing organizations generally are directed at ensuring that product sales ultimately are made to consumers and that advancement within the organization is based on sales of the organization’s products rather than investments in the organization or other non-retail sales related criteria. When required by law, we obtain regulatory approval of our network marketing program or, when this approval is not required, the favorable opinion of local counsel as to regulatory compliance. 
 On July 15, 2016, we reached a settlement with the FTC and entered into a proposed Stipulation to Entry of Order for Permanent Injunction and Monetary Judgment, or the Consent Order, which resolved the FTC’s multi-year investigation of us. The Consent Order became effective on July 25, 2016, or the Effective Date, upon final approval by the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. Pursuant to the Consent Order, we implemented and continue to enhance certain procedures in the U.S. and agreed to be subject to certain audits by an independent compliance auditor (Affiliated Monitors, Inc.) for a period of seven years. Among other requirements, the Consent Order requires us to categorize all existing and future Members in the U.S. as either “preferred members” – who are simply consumers who only wish to purchase product for their own household use – or “distributors” – who are Members who wish to resell some products or build a sales organization. We also agreed to compensate distributors on U.S. eligible sales within their downline organizations, which include purchases by preferred members, purchases by a distributor for his or her personal consumption within allowable limits and sales of product by a distributor to his or her customers. The Consent Order also requires distributors to meet certain conditions before opening Nutrition Clubs and/or entering into leases for their Herbalife business in the United States. 
 The Consent Order also prohibits us from making expressly or by implication, any misrepresentation regarding certain lifestyles or amount or level of income, including full-time or part-time income that a participant can reasonably expect to earn in our network marketing program. The Consent Order also prohibits us and other persons who act in active concert with us from misrepresenting that participation in the network marketing program will result in a lavish lifestyle and from using images or descriptions to represent or imply that participation in the program is likely to result in a lavish lifestyle. In addition, the Consent Order prohibits specified misrepresentations in connection with marketing the program, including misrepresentations regarding any fact material to participation such as the cost to participate or the amount of income likely to be earned. The Consent Order also requires us to clearly and conspicuously disclose information related to our refund and buyback policy on certain company materials and websites. 
 The terms of the Consent Order do not change our going to market through direct selling by independent distributors, and compensating those distributors based upon the product they and their sales organization sell. We have implemented new and enhanced procedures required by the terms of the Consent Order and will continue to do so. We continue to monitor the impact of the Consent Order and our board of directors established the Implementation Oversight Committee in connection with the Consent Order, and more recently, our Audit Committee assumed oversight of continued compliance with the Consent Order. The Implementation Oversight Committee had met regularly with management to oversee our compliance with the terms of the Consent Order. While we currently do not expect the Consent Order to have a long-term and material adverse impact on our business and our Member base, our business and our Member base, particularly in the U.S., have been in the past, and may in the future, be negatively impacted as we and they adjust to the changes. However, the terms of the Consent Order and the ongoing costs of compliance may adversely affect our business operations, our results of operations and our financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion of risks related to the settlement with the FTC. 
 On January 4, 2018, the FTC released its nonbinding Business Guidance Concerning Multi-Level Marketing, or MLM Guidance. The MLM Guidance explains, among other things, lawful and unlawful compensation structures, the treatment of personal consumption by participants in determining if an MLM’s compensation structure is unfair or deceptive, and how an MLM should approach representations to current and prospective participants. We believe our current business practices, which include new and enhanced procedures implemented in connection with the Consent Order, are in compliance with the MLM Guidance. 
 
16 

  Additionally, the FTC has promulgated nonbinding Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising, or Guides, which explain how the FTC interprets Section 5 of the FTC Act’s prohibition on unfair or deceptive acts or practices. Consequently, the FTC could bring a Section 5 enforcement action based on practices that are inconsistent with the Guides. Under the Guides, advertisements that feature a consumer and convey his or her atypical experience with a product or service are required to clearly disclose the typical results that consumers can generally expect. The revised Guides also require advertisers to disclose connections between the advertiser and any endorsers that consumers might not expect, known as “material connections.” We have adapted our practices and rules regarding the practices of its Members to comply with the Guides and to comply with the Consent Order. 
 We also are subject to the risk of private party challenges to the legality of our network marketing program both in the United States and internationally. For example, in Webster v. Omnitrition International, Inc., 79 F.3d 776 (9th Cir. 1996), the network marketing program of Omnitrition International, Inc., or Omnitrition, was challenged in a class action by Omnitrition distributors who alleged that it was operating an illegal “pyramid scheme” in violation of federal and state laws. We believe that our network marketing program satisfies federal and other applicable state statutes and case law. 
 In some countries, regulations applicable to the activities of our Members also may affect our business because in some countries we are, or regulators may assert that we are, responsible for our Members’ conduct. In these countries, regulators may request or require that we take steps to ensure that our Members comply with local regulations. The types of regulated conduct include: (1) representations concerning our products; (2) income representations made by us and/or Members; (3) public media advertisements, which in foreign markets may require prior approval by regulators; (4) sales of products in markets in which the products have not been approved, licensed or certified for sale; and (5) classification by government agencies of our Members as employees of the Company. 
 In some markets, it is possible that improper product claims by Members could result in our products being reviewed by regulatory authorities and, as a result, being classified or placed into another category as to which stricter regulations are applicable. In addition, we might be required to make labeling changes. 
 We also are subject to regulations in various foreign markets pertaining to social security assessments and employment and severance pay requirements. As an example, in some markets, we are substantially restricted in the amount and types of rules and termination criteria that we can impose on Members without having to pay social security assessments on behalf of the Members and without incurring severance obligations to terminated Members. In some countries, we may be subject to these obligations in any event. 
 It is an ongoing part of our business to monitor and respond to regulatory and legal developments, including those that may affect our network marketing program. However, the regulatory requirements concerning network marketing programs do not include bright line rules and are inherently fact-based. An adverse judicial or regulatory determination with respect to our network marketing program could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and operating results and may also result in negative publicity, requirements to modify our network marketing plan, or a negative impact on Member morale. In addition, adverse rulings by courts in any proceedings challenging the legality of network marketing systems, even in those not involving us directly, could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 Although questions regarding the legality of our network marketing program have come up in the past and may come up from time to time in the future, we believe, based in part upon guidance to the general public from the FTC, that our network marketing program is compliant with applicable law. 
 Transfer Pricing and Similar Regulations 
 In many countries, including the United States, we are subject to transfer pricing and other tax regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of income are reported as earned by our U.S. and local entities and are 
 
17 

  taxed accordingly. In addition, our operations are subject to regulations designed to ensure that appropriate levels of customs duties are assessed on the importation of our products. 
 Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable regulations and restrictions, we are subject to the risk that governmental authorities could assert that additional taxes are owed based on findings of their audit of our transfer pricing and related practices. For example, we are currently subject to pending or proposed audits that are at various levels of review, assessment or appeal in a number of jurisdictions involving transfer pricing issues, income taxes, duties, value added taxes, withholding taxes and related interest and penalties in material amounts. In some circumstances, additional taxes, interest and penalties have been assessed, and we will be required to appeal or litigate to reverse the assessments. We have taken advice from our tax advisors and believe that there are substantial defenses to the allegations that additional taxes are owed, and we are vigorously defending against the imposition of additional proposed taxes. The ultimate resolution of these matters may take several years, and the outcome is uncertain. 
 In the event that the audits or assessments are concluded adversely to us, we may or may not be able to offset or mitigate the consolidated effect of foreign income tax assessments through the use of U.S. foreign tax credits. The laws and regulations governing U.S. foreign tax credits are complex and subject to periodic legislative amendment and are not available with respect to all of the Company’s foreign income taxes. Additionally, U.S. Tax Reform creates additional restrictions on the utilization of U.S. foreign tax credits. Therefore, we cannot be sure that we would in fact be able to take advantage of any foreign tax credits in the future. 
 Compliance Procedures 
 As indicated above, Herbalife, our products and our network marketing program are subject, both directly and indirectly through Members’ conduct, to numerous federal, state and local regulations, both in the United States and foreign markets. Beginning in 1985, we began to institute formal regulatory compliance measures by developing a system to identify specific complaints against Members and to remedy any violations of Herbalife’s rules by Members through appropriate sanctions, including warnings, fines, suspensions and, when necessary, terminations. We prohibit Members from making therapeutic claims for our products, including in our manuals, seminars, and other training programs and materials. 
 Our general policy is to reject Member applications from individuals who do not reside in one of our approved markets. 
 In order to comply with regulations that apply to both us and our Members, we research the applicable regulatory framework prior to entering any new market to identify necessary licenses and approvals and applicable limitations relating to our operations in that market and then work to bring our operations into compliance with the applicable limitations and to maintain such licenses. Typically, we conduct this research with the assistance of local legal counsel and other representatives. We also research laws applicable to Member operations and revise or alter our Member applications, rules, and other training materials and programs to provide Members with guidelines for operating their independent business, marketing and distributing our products and similar matters, as required by applicable regulations in each market. While we have rules and guidelines for our Members and monitor their market conduct, we are, however, unable to ensure that our Members will not distribute our products in countries where we have not commenced operations. 
 In addition, regulations in existing and new markets often are ambiguous and subject to considerable interpretive and enforcement discretion by the responsible regulators. Moreover, even when we believe that we and our Members are in compliance with all applicable regulations, new regulations are being added regularly and the interpretation of existing regulations is subject to change. Further, the content and impact of regulations to which we are subject may be influenced by public attention directed at us, our products, or our network marketing program, so that extensive adverse publicity about us, our products, or our network marketing program may increase the likelihood regulatory scrutiny or action.

  HUMAN CAPITAL 
 We believe in promoting a diverse, equitable, and inclusive work environment. We believe these practices are important to recruiting and retaining the talent to allow our organization to achieve its goals and objectives. We monitor the appropriate human capital needs of our departments and functions with particular focus on the areas where human capital resources are important to daily operations to ensure we can timely manufacture, distribute, and sell products to our Members. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 9,900 employees, of which approximately 3,000 were located in the United States. In certain countries, we have employees who are subject to labor union agreements. 
 We have operations globally, requiring investment to assess local labor market conditions and recruit and retain the appropriate human capital. Having a business presence in multiple jurisdictions also requires us to monitor local labor and employment laws for which we often engage third-party advisors. We offer our employees wages and benefits packages that are in line with respective local labor markets and laws. 
 The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the resources required to keep our employees safe and healthy and we are making what we believe are the necessary investments to achieve this goal. In response to the pandemic, we have taken several actions, including supporting our employees to work from home when possible, implementing safety measures in all our facilities, and offering incremental compensation to certain of our employees. We believe our proactive efforts have been successful in supporting our business growth despite the obstacles and challenges presented by COVID-19.
We are dependent on our third-party independent distributors to sell and promote our products to consumers. We frequently interact and work directly with our sales leader distributors to explore ways to support our mission and our third-party independent members’ businesses, and their customers’ personal goals of living a healthier and more active lifestyle. See the Network Marketing Program – Member Compensation and Sales Leader Retention and Requalification section above for sales leader and requalification metrics and further discussion on our sales leaders.
