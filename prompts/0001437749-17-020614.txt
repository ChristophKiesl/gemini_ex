Overview

LRAD Corporation is a leading innovator and manufacturer of directed acoustic communication systems that focus sound from 30° - 360° over short and long distances. By broadcasting audible voice messages and tones with exceptional clarity and only where needed, we offer novel sound applications that conventional bullhorns, loudspeakers, public address and emergency warning systems cannot achieve. We have developed two LRAD® product lines using our proprietary technologies:
 

• | Acoustic Hailing Devices ("AHDs"), which project audible broadcasts with exceptional intelligibility in a 30° beam from close range out to 5,500 meters, and;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ONE VOICE® Mass Notification Systems, which project 60° - 360° audible broadcasts with industry-leading vocal intelligibility from close range to over 14 square kilometers from a single installation.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Having been sold into over 70 countries, our Long Range Acoustic Device® (“LRAD”) pioneered a new worldwide market for AHDs and advanced mass notification systems. We continue to develop new acoustic innovations and believe we have established a significant competitive advantage in our principal markets. 
 
Technology and Products

Our LRAD systems are a technological breakthrough in broadcasting audible, highly intelligible voice messages and tones over long distances and high ambient noise using minimal power. Our LRAD products were initially developed for the U.S. Navy to fill a capability gap identified after the October 2000 attack on the USS Cole. LRAD systems are deployed by the U.S. Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps and Coast Guard, as well as international military services, maritime, public safety and commercial security organizations around the globe. Over the last several years, we have redesigned and enhanced our LRAD systems, including improving voice intelligibility, output and durability. The rugged construction of our systems enable us to meet stringent military requirements. Our LRAD systems broadcast warning tones and live or prerecorded voice communications with superior intelligibility in any language to hail, warn and notify, allowing operators more time and distance to determine the intent, influence the behavior, and gain the compliance of approaching vessels, vehicles or personnel.
Our AHD product line provides a complete range of solutions from handheld portable devices to permanently installed, remotely operated systems. We continue to add new models to meet specific customer requirements and to enable the expansion of our technology into new markets. We have also added features such as wireless capability, record on-the-fly microphones, integrated and remote electronics packages, and various amplifier configurations. 
Utilizing our advanced speaker technology, we designed and developed our ONE VOICE line of advanced mass notification systems. Unlike most siren-based mass notification systems on the market, our ONE VOICE systems broadcast both emergency warning sirens and highly intelligible voice messages with uniform 60° - 360° coverage over small and large areas. Our ONE VOICE product line includes various configurations to meet the needs of the mass notification market. We believe our ability to shape the broadcast coverage area, our industry-leading speech intelligibility, and our multiple system activation and control options, make us more competitive in the large and growing mass notification market.

We continue to develop additional ONE VOICE systems and expand our product offerings to meet the needs of the growing global mass notification market.
 
Strategy

LRAD has been instrumental in developing a market and increasing demand for AHDs in a number of business segments and markets around the world. We have a strong brand in these markets and a reputation for producing quality products. We are building on our leadership position in the field of directed acoustic systems, which feature industry-leading broadcast range and vocal intelligibility. Our overall strategy is to offer an increasing variety of directional and omnidirectional acoustic systems and accessories for an expanding range of applications. In executing our strategy, we use direct sales to governments, militaries, large end-users, system integrators and defense-related companies, and we have built a worldwide distribution channel consisting of partners and resellers that have significant expertise and experience selling integrated communication solutions into our various target markets. As our primary sales opportunities are with domestic and international military and government departments and agencies, we are subject to each customer’s unique budget cycle, which leads to very long selling cycles and uneven revenue flow, complicating our product planning.

In fiscal 2018, we plan to continue pursuing global market opportunities with the support of additional business development consultants added from fiscal 2015 to fiscal 2017. Our plan is to grow revenue through increased direct sales to domestic and international militaries, and large commercial and defense-related companies, who desire to use our directed acoustic technology in their integrated product offerings. This includes continuing our pursuit of U.S. military opportunities and building on our improved fiscal 2017 domestic defense sales. We plan to continue focusing on government, military, law enforcement, fire rescue, homeland and international security, private and commercial security, border security, maritime security, and wildlife preservation and control markets. Our fiscal 2017 sales efforts were successful in growing revenues in all of our targeted geographic sales regions – the Americas, Asia Pacific, Europe, CIS/Middle East/Africa. 
 
We plan to continue expanding our presence and increasing our market share in the global mass notification market. We added several systems to our ONE VOICE product line in fiscal 2017 to increase our presence in this global market. We intend to obtain qualifying certifications to allow access to more markets around the world. While this is a more mature marketplace with established manufacturers and suppliers, we believe that our superior technology and system offerings give us an opportunity to penetrate and succeed in this large, expanding market. We also plan to continue expanding and strengthening domestic and international sales channels by adding key channel partners, distributors and dealers that focus on the mass notification market.
 
Our research and development strategy is to continue developing innovative directed acoustic solutions to meet the needs of our target markets, as well as to continue expanding our mass notification system offerings to include more comprehensive, integrated solutions. Our mass notification product line expansion includes new speakers in different sizes, as well as various configurations of amplifiers, mounts, power sources and software. We developed and patented our XL driver technology, which generates higher audio output in smaller, lighter form factors. Since its 2014 introduction, we have incorporated our XL driver technology into many of our AHD and ONE VOICE systems, including the LRAD DS-60XL, LRAD 360XL, LRAD 360XL-MID, LRAD 450XL, LRAD 1950XL, and LRAD 950RXL. Our plan is to continue incorporating our XL driver technology into our AHD and ONE VOICE product lines. We continue to enhance our system design and manufacturing capabilities to improve the durability and performance of our products. We continue to pursue certain certifications, which are often required when bidding on government and mass notification opportunities. We are also configuring alternative solutions to achieve lower price points to meet the needs of certain customers or applications. We also engage in ongoing value engineering to reduce the cost and simplify the manufacturing of our products. Our mass notification systems represent a much more complex, integrated offering. We plan to continue investing engineering resources and capital to develop products and software to further expand and enhance our mass notification product offerings. 
 
We intend to continue operating with financial discipline in order to create value for our shareholders. We are focused on growing our top line revenue, which we believe will translate into increased net profit growth by successfully entering into new markets and expanding our market share in the global mass notification market.
 
Manufacturing and Suppliers

Manufacturing. We believe maintaining quality manufacturing capacity is essential to the performance of our products and the growth of our business. Our technologies are different from mass produced designs, and our manufacturing and assembly involves unique processes and materials. We contract with third party suppliers to produce various components and sub-assemblies. At our San Diego, California facility, we complete the final assembly and test and ship our products. We have refined our internal processes to improve how we design, test and qualify products. We continue to implement rigorous manufacturing and quality processes to track production and field failures. We also perform third party testing and certification of our products to ensure that they meet rigorous military and commercial specifications. We have developed custom manufacturing equipment used to automate the production of key sub-assemblies, reducing the labor component and permitting higher volume production. We implement design and component changes periodically to reduce our product costs and improve product reliability and manufacturability. 
 
Suppliers. Our products have a large number of components and sub-assemblies produced by outside suppliers mostly located within 50 miles of our facility to take advantage of flexible turnaround, minimize inventories and to maximize the efficiency of our supply chain. We purchase a number of key components and sub-assemblies from foreign suppliers. Consequently, we are subject to the impact economic conditions can have on such suppliers and the fluctuations of foreign currency exchange rates, which could impact our lead times and product costs. We have developed strong relationships with a number of our key suppliers. If these suppliers should experience quality problems or part shortages, our production schedules could be significantly delayed or our costs significantly increased.

Sales and Marketing

We market and sell products and services through our sales force based in California, Colorado, Minnesota, Tennessee, Texas and Wisconsin, as well as through full-time business consultants in Germany, Sweden and Thailand. Our corporate and administrative offices are located in San Diego, California. 
 
We sell directly to governments, militaries, large end-users and defense-related companies. We use independent representatives on a commission basis to assist us in our direct sales efforts. We also use a channel distribution model in which we sell our products directly to independent resellers and system integrators around the world, who then sell our products (or our products integrated with other systems) to end-user customers. We are focusing our internal business development resources on building relationships with defense integrators and other large direct customers. In addition, we utilize part-time consultants with expertise in various areas of the U.S. government and defense to advise us on procedures and budget processes in an effort to be successful in these areas.

We have established a global reputation for providing high quality, innovative acoustic solutions that has made LRAD an internationally recognized product brand. We actively promote our brands and products through our website, trade shows and advertising. We intend to continue increasing the use of our trademarks throughout our product distribution chain and believe growing brand awareness will assist in expanding our business. We believe our reputation for technological expertise, experienced personnel, and strong service and support will also keep us competitive.
 
Customer Concentration

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, we had one customer accounting for 15% of revenues, with no other single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016, we did not have any single customer accounting for more than 10% of revenues.
 
Our revenues to date have relied on a few major customers. The loss of any customer could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have made progress diversifying our revenues and expect to continue to do so in future periods. 
 
Backlog

Our order backlog for products that are deliverable in the next 12 months was approximately $11,943,259 at September 30, 2017, compared to $3,065,597 at September 30, 2016. The amount of backlog at any point in time is dependent upon scheduled delivery dates to our customers and product lead times. Our backlog orders are supported by firm purchase orders. 
Warranties

We generally warrant our products to be free from material and workmanship defects for a period up to one year from the date of purchase. The warranty is generally a limited warranty, and in some instances imposes certain shipping costs on the customer. We generally provide direct warranty service, but at times we may establish warranty service through third parties. Our international warranties are generally similar to the warranties we offer in the U.S.

We also provide repair and maintenance agreements and extended warranty contracts at market rates, with terms ranging from one year to several years, as an additional source of revenue and to provide increased customer satisfaction.

Competition

Our technologies and products compete with those of other companies. The commercial and government audio industry markets are fragmented and include numerous manufacturers with audio products that vary widely in price, quality and distribution channels. Present and potential competitors have, or may have, substantially greater resources to devote to product development. We believe we compete primarily on the originality of our products, the uniqueness of our technology and designs, our responsiveness to customers and our ability to meet their needs and, most importantly, the quality, durability and superior performance of our products, which have been developed by incorporating feedback from our customers, and our desire to provide the highest quality products. 
 
Our AHD product line features the leading acoustic hailing devices for military and commercial applications. Other AHD providers include competitors such as Ultra Electronics/USSI, IML Sound Commander, and others. We do not believe these competitors have achieved significant global market penetration in the AHD market to date. We believe our AHD product line has demonstrated acceptance, has performed extremely well in harsh environments, and can continue to compete on the basis of technical features, performance, ease of use, quality and cost. As we continue to grow this market, future competitors with greater resources may enter with new technologies and capabilities which could impact our competitiveness.

With the 2012 launch of our ONE VOICE product line, we entered the more mature and established mass notification market, which has a number of large competitors including: Federal Signal Corporation, Whelen Engineering Company Inc., Hoermann, Acoustic Technology, Inc., and others. In addition to powerful warning tones and sirens, our ONE VOICE systems provide the same vocal clarity, intelligibility and quality as our AHD products. We believe our ability to shape the broadcast coverage area, our industry-leading speech intelligibility, and our multiple system activation and control options, give us competitive advantages against these established organizations. We believe the domestic and international markets for mass notification systems are substantial and growing. 
 
Seasonality

Government business tends to be seasonal due to government procurement and budget cycles, with the quarter ending September 30, which coincides with the U.S. government budget year, usually producing relatively higher sales, and the quarter ending December 31, usually producing relatively lower sales. International budget years vary by country. Since our sales are primarily to government departments or agencies, our selling cycles tend to be long and difficult to forecast. We have not experienced any significant seasonality trends to date, but we may experience increased seasonality in the future. 
Government Regulation

We are subject to a variety of government laws and regulations that apply to companies engaged in international operations, including, among others, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.S. Department of Commerce export controls, local government regulations and procurement policies and practices (including regulations relating to import-export control, investments, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings). We maintain controls and procedures to comply with laws and regulations associated with our international operations. If we are unable to remain compliant with such laws and regulations, our business may be adversely affected.

Our products are produced to comply with standard product safety requirements for sale in the U.S. and similar requirements for sale in Europe and Canada. We expect to meet the electrical and other regulatory requirements for electronic systems or components we sell throughout the world.

Financial Information about Segments and Geographic Areas

Financial information regarding our segments and the geographic areas in which we operate is contained in Note 15, Major Customers, Suppliers, Segment and Related Information, to our consolidated financial statements.Intellectual Property Rights and Proprietary Information

We operate in an industry where innovation, investment in new ideas and protection of resulting intellectual property rights are important drivers of success. We rely on a variety of intellectual property protections for our products and technologies, including patent, trademark and trade secret laws and contractual obligations, and we pursue a policy of vigorously enforcing such rights.
