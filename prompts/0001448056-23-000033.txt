Item 1. Business
Overview
New Relic is a leading “all-in-one” observability platform that enables our customers to plan, build, deploy, and operate their critical digital infrastructure by harnessing the power of data. Our observability platform combines metrics, events, logs, traces, and other telemetry data with our proprietary stack of analytical tools to rapidly generate actionable, fact-based insights. As of March 31, 2023, our platform collects more than 3.0 exabytes of data annually, responds to over 330 billion web requests daily, and executes more than 4,000 queries each second. Our customers use our platform to improve uptime, reliability, and operational efficiency, in order to optimize the digital experience for their customers and within their organizations. We serve more than 16,000 paid customers including some of the world’s largest corporations and leading brands, such as Verizon, Adobe, Paramount, Domino’s, Mercado Libre, adidas Runtastic, American Red Cross, Ryanair, H&R Block, TopGolf, and World Fuel Services.
Our goal is to enable our customers to leverage the power of data-driven analytics to monitor, debug, and improve the performance and security of all their digital infrastructure. In order to achieve this goal: 
•We serve all engineers. We believe today’s organizations need to make observability a continuous practice for all of their engineers in order to achieve their goals. Our platform is not only geared toward IT operations professionals, but it also serves the full spectrum of application developers, mobile developers, site reliability engineers, and network and other engineers. 
•We support the entire software lifecycle. Engineers can use our platform to plan, build, and test software before it goes into production and throughout the software lifecycle. Our ability to ship features and capabilities for the entire software lifecycle increases customer engagement with our platform and differentiates our solutions from other tools in the marketplace that are focused solely on production troubleshooting. 
•We deliver comprehensive observability in a unified way. Unlike other products, the New Relic platform is not a simple bundle of products with disjointed experiences and disparate pricing models clumsily aggregated into a user interface. Our platform ingests significant amounts of telemetry data from a wide array of sources and modalities - including metrics, events, logs, and traces - and seamlessly delivers them to our users through an intuitive and unified, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-enabled interface.
We have a longstanding history of innovation within our industry. We began cloud based Application Performance Monitoring, or APM, for application developers in 2008. Since then we have expanded far beyond APM to include dozens of other product capabilities. Over the last few years we have reimagined observability by re-architecting our technology to consolidate the capabilities that have historically been served by siloed products or tools, into a single, comprehensive interoperable platform, which we call our “all-in-one” observability platform. The advent of our all-in-one platform has been a critical catalyst for our growth and development, enabling nine major product launches and enhancements in the last fiscal year alone, including SAP monitoring, change tracking, vulnerability management, and our Azure service.
While most observability software is targeted toward a small subset of developers that focuses on the “operate” phase, we believe that telemetry data is also critical to the rest of the software lifecycle including the planning, building, and deployment phases. We target the broader software developer productivity market, helping them realize the value of telemetry data that is wasted if unharnessed. Our all-in-one observability platform helps remove data, tool, and team silos that plague organizations, empowering them to better understand their entire digital infrastructures in order to improve their speed of innovation, operational excellence, system reliability, and cost management. We primarily utilize a consumption-based model that directly links the value our customers receive from utilizing our platform with what they pay for it, in a manner that is transparent and intuitive for them. 
We have been named a leader in the Gartner APM and Observability Magic Quadrant for each of the last ten years. During the fiscal year 2023, Gartner ranked us among the top 3 vendors (of 19) based on completeness of vision and ability to execute, and in fiscal year 2022 we won the Customers’ Choice in the Gartner Peer Insights ‘Voice of the Customer’ for Application Performance Monitoring. In March 2023, we were also recognized as the innovation leader in GigaOm’s Radar for Cloud Observability report of the 21 vendors they evaluated.
The New Relic Platform
The New Relic solution is comprised of:
•Hyper-scalable data platform. At the core of our solution is a secure, hyper-scalable, cloud-based data platform, which serves as the single source of truth for all of the operational data our customers make available. The platform rapidly ingests large volumes of telemetry data at scale from a wide array of sources and methodically and cohesively analyzes this data. 
•Full-stack monitoring. Once the data is ingested into our platform, our customers can query the platform nearly instantaneously, build, customize, and share dashboards, and create alerts based on the signals that matter most to them. Our curated, connected platform helps users make sense of their data by connecting and correlating it across their full tech stack—from the client-side and the applications to the underlying infrastructure and network, all with logs and distributed traces in context—so they can analyze, debug, and troubleshoot efficiently and effectively. 
•Cross-platform observability. We have enabled cross-platform observability to provide a fully integrated solution for our customers. For example:
•We utilize AI and machine learning across our platform, enabling AI-assisted incident response and the ability to solve new use cases beyond the problems that traditional monitoring solutions address.
•New Relic CodeStream is a developer collaboration platform that enables development teams to discuss and review code in a natural and contextual way.
•Our Errors Inbox aggregates error data from across the tech stack so developers can detect, triage, and resolve errors faster and with persistent context.
•Our platform enables developers to deploy new software quickly and confidently by integrating full-stack observability and change tracking into their continuous integration and delivery pipelines.
With the New Relic platform our customers can manage their entire digital infrastructure stacks, including the front end, back end, infrastructure layer, vulnerabilities, and logs, as follows:
Our customers use our platform to identify issues, understand their root cause, and simplify the engineering process. The key benefits of our platform for our customers include:
•End-to-End Observability and Enhanced Agility. All telemetry data, regardless of its source (whether from proprietary or open source agents, interfaces, or exporters) is aggregated in one place and available to query, alert, 
visualize, and navigate with insightful analytics. Engineering teams can easily monitor a decentralized ecosystem running on thousands of servers and web applications in every phase from concept to post-release.
•Reducing Mean Time to Resolution. By deploying distributed tracing, service maps, external services, errors inbox, and anomaly detection, our customers gain visibility into patterns and workflows across the entire incident lifecycle. With our AI-assisted incident response, customers can detect issues proactively, reduce alert noise, identify root causes, and take action using two-way integration with third party incident management systems.
•Improving Application Performance and Reducing Major Incidents. Using critical insights from our platform, engineering teams gain the power to query across all applications to quickly identify issues. By leveraging the tools on our platform, our customers can improve application performance and reduce major incidents.
•Cloud Migration and Adoption. Through the strength of our platform and our strategic partnerships, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud, we help engineers minimize cloud migration risk while accelerating migration timelines so they can observe systems, measure efficacy, and optimize costs before, during, and after a migration.
•Dynamic and On-Demand Scalability. Our multi-tenant SaaS platform scales dynamically and on-demand to some of the largest environments without penalty or pre-reservation requirements. This means our customers can meet the demands of peak business days confidently. This dynamic scalability feature is available at a straightforward and predictable cost, regardless of the architecture or environment, and without punitive pricing for data granularity. 
•Rapid Time to Value. We make it easy for all engineers to get started quickly with observability best practices. In fiscal 2022, we launched New Relic Instant Observability (New Relic I/O), one of the largest open source ecosystems for observability providing pre-built integrations designed to help every engineer embrace observability as a daily practice. With New Relic I/O and quickstarts for more than 500 cloud services, technologies and frameworks for instant observability across the stack, engineers do not need to spend hours manually instrumenting data and building dashboards and can start receiving and analyzing insights in minutes.
•Open Source Commitment. New Relic is making it easier for everyone to instrument everything through our commitment to open standards, open source instrumentation, and the open communities that support them. We allow customers to standardize and use OpenTelemetry for all collections and most of our agents are open source. We have joined the governing board of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and contributed Pixie, a Kubernetes-native in-cluster observability platform, as an open source project. We are also a founding member of Eclipse Adoptium, a leading provider of Java runtimes.
•Platform Extensibility. In addition to the UIs and workflows provided natively in our platform, our customers can use the data they ingest into the platform to build custom applications. Our platform supports custom application development via common open source frameworks, a library of existing applications, and a rich development environment. 
•Enterprise-grade Security. We have developed robust security measures to try to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data, including personal data, such as by conducting regular third-party audits using industry-recognized standards, including SOC 2, ISO 27001, TISAX, and HITRUST, and we have achieved FedRAMP authorization at a moderate impact level.
As a result of these key benefits, our platform enables our customers to:
•Fuel innovation and growth. We empower engineers with data and visibility to support faster software delivery and greater experimentation to increase customer satisfaction, revenue and market share. Powered by the insights and visibility from our platform, our customers can reduce time to market by building and deploying software faster, improving development efficiency and improving alignment and collaboration across business and technical teams.
•Deliver exceptional customer experiences. We enable engineers and organizations to deliver digital customer experiences that drive engagement, conversion and brand affinity. With our platform, our customers can view what their customers are experiencing on their digital platforms to avoid churn, lost revenue and reputational harm. 
•Optimize system performance. We help engineers proactively identify and resolve issues before they impact customers. Our customers have a common platform to adopt and implement DevOps and site reliability engineer (“SRE”) principles so they can improve incident resolution times, reduce the number of customer-reported incidents, and reduce the downtime of the systems they manage.
•Drive operational efficiency. Our platform helps engineering teams build at scale to realize the benefits of cloud investments and optimize resource consumption. Engineering teams are able to leverage the power of observability to improve the pace of cloud adoption, digital transformation, budget predictability, and overall employee productivity. Our customers can reduce their tooling and engineering costs by consolidating on our unified platform.
Our Growth Strategy
We intend to achieve our goal of becoming the source of truth for all engineers across the software lifecycle by leveraging our “land-and-expand” strategy and our consumption-based model. Our core growth strategies include:
•Continue to innovate and advance our product roadmap. We have a proven track record of innovation in our industry, and we intend to build upon that reputation by continuing to broaden the capabilities and features of our platform so more engineers can use it more often. In the last fiscal year, we had nine new major product launches and enhancements, including SAP monitoring, change tracking, vulnerability management, and our Azure service. We also launched offerings that are HIPAA-compliant and HITRUST certified to continue to enhance our offerings.
•Drive customer acquisition through product-led growth. We believe we have the most intuitive and powerful observability platform in the industry. We intend to drive significant product awareness, demand, adoption, and growth in new accounts by accelerating our self-service product marketing and sales initiatives. Our free tier of service encourages users to try our platform, and our product-led self-service model enables customers to increase the value they receive from the platform by adding additional data, users, and use cases. The easy-to-use, intuitive nature of our platform allows us to engage with these potential new customers cost effectively, which significantly reduces our customer acquisition costs.
•Expand our customer base globally by expanding our partner ecosystem. International markets present a significant opportunity for us to land new customers for our platform. We believe that leveraging commercial partnerships is a highly effective way to acquire new customers at low acquisition costs, while enabling these customers to realize value from our observability platform more rapidly. We intend to develop new relationships and leverage our existing relationships with distributors, resellers, service partners, hyperscalers, and global system integrators to grow our sales pipeline and drive new use cases as more businesses around the world accelerate their cloud native journey.
•Accelerate consumption within our customer base. As a customer increases use of our platform, we transition to a more traditional direct sales, or sales-led, model to expand the use of our platform within the customer. Our existing customer base consists of more than 16,000 paid customers across industry verticals and regions, which provides us with a large market opportunity to grow our revenue by facilitating greater platform engagement and addressing new use cases. We currently have more than 1,200 large customers, which we define as customers spending over $100,000 with us annually, and we have over 150 customers spending over $1 million with us annually. We have also identified a number of large customers currently on our self-serve platform as targets for our sales-led approach in order to deliver new contracts and expand the uptake of our solutions.
•Leverage our consumption-based model to drive value for our customers. Since introducing our consumption-based model in fiscal year 2021, our customers have responded favorably to this cost-following model. We have lowered the total cost of ownership for many of our customers by reducing multiple vendor relationships and the support costs for multiple tools. As the power of our platform continues to grow and we help our customers solve their problems, we believe our customers will increase the number of users and the amount of data ingested into our system. With our consumption-based model, our customers are charged based on actual usage, and we price all telemetry sources at the same rate without overage penalties. This removes barriers to adoption as it easily allows our customers to plan usage and forecast spend. We also offer varying commitment plans to best meet the needs of our customers of all sizes and maturity levels.
•Expand our margins through cloud optimization and other efficiency initiatives. We have identified several key opportunities for expanding our operating leverage and we have begun implementing these initiatives. For example, we have been optimizing our hyperscaler infrastructure by migrating from our own data centers to a significantly more efficient public cloud model to better match our growing demand and our operating costs. We have also begun leveraging the strengths of multiple cloud providers to gain efficiencies for our platform and our cost structure. And finally, as we have continued to develop and expand our consumption-based model, we have gained critical insights into the varying components of the cost of the data, which has enabled us to better align and optimize our pricing to follow our costs. 
Operations
We host our applications and serve all our customers through a combination of cloud service providers and to a lesser extent our data centers whose infrastructure is managed by third parties. We continue to build out services and functionality in the public cloud with a goal to migrate our entire platform to the public cloud by the end of fiscal year 2024. This strategy provides us flexibility to service customers in new and emerging regions and scale our deployment capabilities. We maintain a formal and comprehensive security program designed to ensure the security and integrity of our data, protect against security threats or data breaches, and prevent unauthorized access to the data of our customers. Our technology uses multi-tenant architecture, enabling all our customers to share the same version of our products and platform capabilities while securely partitioning their data.
Sustainability and Social Impact
We are committed to creating a sustainable future by reducing our environmental footprint. In 2022, we implemented a carbon accounting software and undertook a greenhouse gas (“GhG”) emissions review in order to benchmark Scope 1, 2, and 3 emissions from fiscal year 2020 to fiscal year 2022. Through this process, we aim to better understand operational impacts and create a strategy to measure carbon emissions. In March 2023, we announced our goal to achieve net-zero GhG emissions by 2030 and a commitment to set near-term science-based GhG emission targets.
We also promote community engagement through volunteering and giving programs. We encourage employee contributions to charities of their choice, which we match up to a certain amount and directly donate to nonprofits in our communities supporting our aim of creating more equitable access to technology. We provide up to sixteen hours of Volunteer Time Off for eligible employees to spend time giving back in addition to an annual day of service where our employees are encouraged to participate in volunteer events. Additionally, we continue to offer our New Relic for Students and Observability for Good programs that provide expanded free tier access to the New Relic platform to students and nonprofits.
Human Capital Management
As of March 31, 2023, we had a total of 2,663 employees, including temporary employees, operating across 16 countries, including 919 employees located outside of the U.S. None of our U.S. employees are represented by a labor union with respect to their employment. Employees in certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries have the benefits of collective bargaining arrangements at the national level. We consider our relations with our employees to be good and have not experienced interruptions of operations or work stoppages due to labor disagreements.
Culture and Engagement
Our “accountable, bold, authentic, passionate, and connected” core values inform and guide our human capital initiatives and objectives. We screen new hires and measure employee performance against these company values, and regularly measure employee engagement against these values through our surveys and all-hands meetings and AMA (“ask me anything”) sessions. We also use these surveys, meetings, and sessions to collect employee feedback and assess the effectiveness of our culture, our strategy, and various health and well-being programs. We believe our values-driven culture has contributed to our recognition as a great place to work by our employees. 
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We strive to build a diverse workforce, promote equity in our practices, and create inclusive communities for all our employees to thrive. Internally, we offer training for employees around unconscious bias, and other diversity and inclusion-related topics designed to create a culture of belonging. In addition, our Diversity, Equity & Inclusion team works closely with division leaders to review current diversity and inclusion data, identify themes, and create action plans with measurable objectives and key results for their divisions, with the goal of increasing diversity and growing every employee’s sense of belonging.
We work hard to maintain and enhance our diverse and inclusive environment, creating a workplace where people are highly valued and are empowered to do their best work. Our employee resource groups offer our employees support, mentoring, and networking opportunities and help to foster a friendly and diverse workplace.
Compensation and Benefits
New Relic is committed to delivering a comprehensive compensation and benefits program that provides support for all of our employees’ well-being. We provide competitive compensation and benefits to attract and retain talented employees, including offering market-competitive salary, bonuses or sales commissions, and equity. We generally offer full-time employees equity at the time of hire and through annual equity grants, as well as provide an employee stock purchase plan, to 
foster a strong sense of ownership and engage our employees in being committed to our long-term success. We ensure that our compensation is fair for all employees, regardless of classifications, such as race and gender. We routinely run a rigorous statistical analysis to ensure compensation is fair, taking into account factors that should impact pay, such as role, level, location and performance.
Our full-time employees are eligible to receive, subject to the satisfaction of certain eligibility requirements, our comprehensive benefits package including our medical, dental, and vision insurance and life and disability insurance plans. In addition, we provide flexible time off, as well as maintain a tax-qualified 401(k) retirement plan that provides eligible U.S employees with an opportunity to save for retirement on a tax-advantaged basis, including providing a match for employee contributions. In structuring these benefit plans, we seek to provide an aggregate level of benefits that are comparable to those provided by similar companies. While the philosophy around our benefits is the same worldwide, specific benefits vary regionally due to local regulations and preferences.
Training and Development
Ensuring our employees have access to development opportunities and understand how to grow their career at New Relic is a critical part of our talent and engagement practices. As part of our efforts, we invest in a robust training portal for employees, complete with online courses and live training on a variety of topics. To recognize and promote outstanding employees, we perform a comprehensive annual talent review process, through which we empower employees to drive their professional development in a way that also aligns with company objectives and our company values.
Flex-First Model
To support employee well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic, we established a number of programs that allowed our employees to work remotely or come into the offices as permitted under any applicable federal, state or local regulations and guidelines. We have since transitioned to a flexibility-first, or “flex-first,” model where we allow our employees to continue to work remotely if they prefer. We will continue to evaluate our workforce strategies as our top priority has been and will continue to provide our employees with the resources and flexibility they need to care for themselves and their families while remaining productive.
Research and Development
Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, development, and testing of all aspects of the New Relic suite of products and platform capabilities. We invest heavily in these efforts to continuously improve, innovate, and add new features to our solutions.
We deploy new features, functionality, and technologies through daily and weekly software releases or updates in order to minimize disruption and provide for constant improvement. Our product managers regularly engage with customers, partners, and industry analysts, as well as other stakeholders, in functions such as sales, customer success, marketing, and business development to understand customer needs as well as general trends in our industry. Once product improvements are identified, the development organization works closely together to design, develop, test, and launch a solution.
As of March 31, 2023, we had 991 employees in our research and development organization. 
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing organizations work together closely to drive market awareness, create and manage user and customer leads, provide qualified leads to our sales pipeline, and build customer relationships to drive revenue growth. As of March 31, 2023, we had 1,036 employees in our sales and marketing organization.
Sales
Under our “land-and-expand” business model, our sales strategy is to rely on two primary distribution channels, self-serve and sales-led growth. For customers from whom we generate trailing 12-month revenue below a certain threshold, self-serve tactics allow these customers to adopt platform features via marketing and product-led sales. As a customer starts to exceed that threshold in trailing 12-month revenue or shows the potential to exceed it, we typically transition the customer to a more traditional direct sales model, or sales-led growth, under which our direct sales organization engages with our larger accounts. Our direct sales organization is organized by geography and size of customer and is focused on growing the number of accounts and usage within accounts (i.e., providing our customers with a broader set of our product solutions).
Marketing
Our marketing strategy focuses on meaningful interactions with practitioners and buyers by targeting software developers, operations professionals, IT leaders, and technology executives across many industries and regions. Additionally, our digital engagement strategy, demand generation, customer programs, events, corporate communications, and product marketing teams focus on building brand, engagement, and demand with our target markets. We utilize both online and offline marketing initiatives, including search engine and email marketing, online banner and video advertising, our website, product demonstrations and trials, blogs, corporate communications, whitepapers, case studies, user events, sponsorships, and webinars. We believe an effective method to market our platform is for users to actively use and explore its capabilities. We encourage free trials of one or more of our products in order to successfully convert those accounts to paid subscriptions.
Seasonality
We have experienced seasonality in our sales and operating results in the past and will continue to experience seasonality in the future. Historically, we have received a higher volume of orders in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, and to a lesser extent our third fiscal quarter of each year. As a result, we have historically seen higher cash collections in the first and fourth fiscal quarters of each year, and our sequential growth in remaining performance obligations has historically been highest in the fourth fiscal quarter of each year, and to a lesser extent our third fiscal quarter of each year. With our shift to a consumption-based model, we expect over time that our revenue will more closely approximate our customer usage of our products and services, and thereby our revenue may experience seasonal fluctuations based upon our customer consumption patterns. For example, in recent years, we have seen a seasonal decline in consumption usage on an aggregate basis around the Christmas holiday season in mid-December that begins to recover in the following fiscal quarter. For customers under consumption-based models that exhibit this seasonal pattern, we would have a corresponding revenue decrease for the impacted period of seasonally reduced usage.
Customer Support
Our products and platform capabilities are designed to minimize the need for customer support, as users can easily download, install, and deploy agents and other technology to ingest data into our platform without needing support. We offer a range of customer support options with multiple levels of support. These include free community support, email support, and phone support, up to our customer support organization, which provides dedicated customer success representatives, onsite support, with global capabilities and is available at all hours of the day. Through our training platform, we offer courses to help our customers quickly learn how to effectively use our products as well as implement best practices. Courses are available online, in-person at events, and, as requested by certain customers, on-site. Our training sessions are typically targeted at specific levels of employee seniority and product experience, such as agent essentials or administrator experts, to more effectively tailor training to intended audiences.
Partnerships and Strategic Relationships
We have built marketing relationships with a number of technology companies to help promote and grow our user base and footprint. We also have developed relationships with several cloud providers including Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, IBM Cloud, Pivotal Cloud Foundry, and others, through which we collaborate to ensure our products and platform capabilities work well on applications running on their clouds. These providers offer access to our products and platform capabilities through links on their websites, refer developers and other potential users to us, and expand our marketing reach. Additionally, a number of system integrators, consultants, and value-added resellers are using the New Relic platform to help their customers make the resourcing and prioritization decisions necessary for successful cloud migrations and transformation projects.
Competition
We operate in a highly competitive industry that is characterized by constant change and innovation. With respect to our unified Observability platform, we compete with vendors such as Datadog, Inc. and Dynatrace, Inc. Since our platform combines functionality from more than 30 traditional product categories, we compete in each of these categories with home-grown and open source technologies, as well as a number of different commercial vendors. For example, for APM, we compete with providers such as Cisco Systems, Inc. With respect to log management, we compete with Elastic NV and Splunk, Inc. With respect to infrastructure monitoring, we compete with diversified technology vendors such as International Business Machines Corporation, BMC Software, Inc. and CA, Inc. (a subsidiary of Broadcom, Inc.), and with native solutions from cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services, Inc., Microsoft Corporation, and Google LLC.
The principal competitive factors in our market include:
•product and platform features, architecture, reliability, security, performance, effectiveness, and supported environments;
•reliability, security, and performance;
•product extensibility and ability to integrate with other technology infrastructures;
•digital operations expertise;
•ease of use of products and platform capabilities;
•price and total cost of ownership;
•adherence to industry standards and certifications;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts;
•brand awareness and reputation; and
•focus on customer success.
We believe we generally compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, broader distribution, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios. Even so, we believe that our customers have chosen us despite our competitors’ business advantages, primarily due to the value of our all-in-one observability platform and our low TCO pricing model.
Intellectual Property
We rely on federal, state, common law, and international rights, as well as contractual restrictions, to protect our intellectual property. We control access to our proprietary technology and algorithms by entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and confidentiality agreements with third parties.
In addition to these contractual arrangements, we also rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, and domain names to protect our intellectual property. As of March 31, 2023, we had 51 issued patents in the United States and abroad, and 26 patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We are also the registered holder of a variety of United States and international domain names that include the term New Relic. Our products utilize our “New Relic” trademark as well as our logo and images.
Circumstances outside our control could pose a threat to our intellectual property rights. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in the United States or other countries in which we operate. Also, the efforts we have taken to protect our proprietary rights may not be sufficient or effective. Any significant impairment of our intellectual property rights could harm our business or our ability to compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights is costly and time-consuming. Any unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property could make it more expensive to do business and harm our operating results.
Companies in Internet-related industries may own large numbers of patents, copyrights, and trademarks and may frequently request license agreements, threaten litigation, or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We have been subject to, and expect to face in the future, allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including our competitors and non-practicing entities. As we face increasing competition and as our business grows, we will likely face more claims of infringement.
Government Regulation
Our worldwide business activities are subject to various laws, rules, and regulations of the United States as well as of foreign governments. Compliance with these laws, rules, and regulations has not had, and is not expected to have, a material effect upon our capital expenditures, results of operations, or competitive position. Nevertheless, compliance with existing or future governmental regulations, including, but not limited to, those pertaining to global trade, business acquisitions, consumer and data protection, and taxes, could have a material impact on our business in subsequent periods. Refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for a discussion of these potential impacts.
