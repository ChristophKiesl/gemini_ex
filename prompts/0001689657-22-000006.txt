Overview 
To achieve our mission of finding the biology that cures disease, we have created a platform for accessing and understanding live primary biology with unprecedented speed and scale. Our capabilities represent a step change in high throughput screening technology and can be used to unlock new insights in functional biology research and therapeutics discovery. Our value proposition is to provide a streamlined functional screening platform capable of observing rare interactions, underpinned by a unique combination of high throughput screening and live biology and, specifically, primary biology where applicable/valuable. Prior to Berkeley Lights, the platforms available to perform live biology assays typically consume or destroy cell models being tested. But with the Berkeley Lights Platform, customers can access primary tissue samples, including those that only live for short time periods ex vivo. They can also isolate, expand, manipulate, assay, and export unperturbed cells of interest for downstream analysis enabling significantly greater insight and flexibility. Not only do our customers gain both higher throughput and higher resolution, they do so while reducing time and cost. This is achieved on our OptoSelect chips, some of which can enable ten thousand plus individual cells on a single chip to be functionally characterized across multiple measurements. Processes that used to take weeks or months can now be completed in hours or days with an increased probability of success. In our Antibody Therapeutics application, certain customers have shown that with the Berkeley Lights Platform, they can find >10x the therapeutic candidates, in 1/10th the time, and with a 20-fold reduction in costs. We currently focus on enabling the large and rapidly growing markets of antibody therapeutics, cell therapy and synthetic biology with our platform and have also recently expanded into the gene therapy and agricultural biology markets. Our goal is to establish the Berkeley Lights Platform as the standard throughout the cell-based product value chain by increasing the probability of successful product development for our customers. 
Cells have tremendous capabilities and are an effective means to discover, develop and manufacture a wide range of products, including therapies for diseases, new and sustainable foods and industrial materials. Harnessing these capabilities requires finding and using the best cells and ensuring the function of the cells performed as intended, which can result in finding the next blockbuster drug or product. Biology is highly complex and not deterministic. Cells are microscopic factories that make minute amounts of a variety of valuable proteins, such as antibodies, and therefore require a high degree of precision when analyzed individually. Finding the best cells can require searching

through millions of cells, or often even more challenging, starting with a limited sample of precious cells such as primary human cells from a recovering patient. Finding the best cells requires more than just capturing a cell’s genetic code, it requires the deep understanding generated by functional characterization across many parameters, a process we call Deep Opto Profiling. Many existing methods used to perform functional characterization of single cells are manual and fragmented processes that we believe do not scale to meet the significant challenges of measuring biological complexity nor do they provide the functional validation of that cell. Successful cell-based product development requires living, functionally validated cells. We believe today’s methods to functionally characterize cells do so insufficiently and too late in the process. We believe that harnessing the cell’s true capability, to develop biotherapeutics and other cell-based products, requires functional characterization of living single cells at large scale, cost effectively and in an integrated manner, early in the value chain. 
The Berkeley Lights Platform can not only be used to characterize the performance of cells relevant to the desired cell-based product early in the discovery process but can also connect this phenotypic data to the genetic code for each cell. In contrast, current genomic technologies find sequences first and fail to deliver the functional information early in the process. Performing functional validation early reduces research and development expense by letting poorly performing cells fail early. We repeat this process of fail and advance many times throughout the process, identifying the best biology and delivering the best cells for what we believe will deliver the best product. We believe our platform rapidly provides the deepest information and largest relevant data cube, with linked phenotypic and genotypic data, on tens of thousands of live single cells relevant to the customers’ end product specifications. We believe we are the only company exclusively focused on this approach to Digital Cell Biology, and we believe this level of scale and precision is not attainable with other approaches. This allows us and our customers and partners, either directly or through an engagement for our service offerings, to find the best cells by: 
•Performing rapid functional characterization of tens of thousands of single cells in parallel; 
•Precisely controlling the environment around each cell, and maintaining cells in a healthy state for further use; 
•Accessing a high degree of cell biodiversity including primary cell samples; 
•Engaging the Deep Opto Profiling process to identify of the relevant phenotypic characteristics, at single-cell resolution over time and connecting this to the genotypic information for each cell; 
•Performing a broad range of workflows, including single-cell assays, on an integrated platform; and 
•Digitally aggregating, accessing and analyzing a rich data library for each single cell. 
Using our platform, customers can perform functional characterization of single cells at scale, effectively, more often and early in the product development process. We believe this enables them to: 
•Accelerate their product development cycles; 
•Improve process yield and lower costs throughout the value chain; 
•Enable a broad range of complex therapeutic modalities in biopharmaceuticals; 
•Increase the probability of successfully developing cell-based products; 
•Achieve revenue from their cell-based products sooner and potentially extend the product lifetime on the market prior to patent expiration; and 
•Increase return on investment for their cell-based products. 
Digital Cell Biology enabled by the Berkeley Lights Platform 
Digital Cell Biology 
Digital Cell Biology is a new way to capture and interpret the qualitative language of biology, both phenotypic and genotypic information, from a highly biodiverse cell population, and translate it into a single-cell specific digital deep profile. The Berkeley Lights Platform combines bioscience, information and technology to deliver deep phenotypic and functional information linked to genotypes across thousands of living cells in parallel at the single-

cell level. Using our platform, customers can leverage the power of Digital Cell Biology to rapidly engage in the process of Deep Opto Profiling of cells they wish to understand, characterize and use in their cell-based product development processes. 
The Berkeley Lights Platform 
We developed the Berkeley Lights Platform to create the most advanced environment for functional testing of single cells and provide customers local access to Digital Cell Biology for developing cell-based products on a global scale. Our platform can deliver live biology, in the form of the best cells for the desired cell-based product. Using our platform, customers perform integrated workflows specific to a field of use to profile and capture relevant single-cell data, throughout the duration of the workflow, on tens of thousands of cells individually, in parallel and within a contained and precisely controlled environment. 
Our platform is a fully integrated, end-to-end solution, comprised of proprietary consumables, including our OptoSelect chips and reagent kits, advanced automation systems and advanced application and workflow software. Our platform leverages our proprietary OptoElectro Positioning (OEP) technology, which provides deterministic positioning of living single cells and other micro-objects using light. We believe our platform delivers a high level of control over, and preservation of, living single cells or other micro-objects throughout the functional characterization process. We also have workflows that can lyse, capture and barcode genetic information from select cells on a single OptoSelect chip, conduct reverse transcription, create cDNA libraries for sequencing and link sequencing results back to the unique cell identifiers.
Our platform also uses our proprietary NanoPen technology. NanoPens are small, roughly 1 nanoliter (or 1/50,000th of a drop of water) sized chambers, with proprietary surface coatings that provide precise and deterministic control of the environment around the cells. Through biomimetic design, our platform provides nutrients to, and removes waste from, each NanoPen to keep the cells in a healthy state while outside of their native environment. These mechanisms enable performance of a large variety of single-cell assays on live biology, including single-cell real-time imaging at high resolution. 
OptoSelect chips 
Using our OEP technology, we select and move cells and other micro-objects in parallel into NanoPens on our proprietary OptoSelect chips. Within the NanoPen chambers, our platform can precisely control the cell environment, perform a large variety of single-cell assays and real-time image each single cell, providing a

predictable analytical window into live single-cell biology. We currently offer six types of OptoSelect chips, with different designs and numbers of NanoPens for various workflows. Our largest commercially available chip has 20,000 pens, and is primarily used for our antibody discovery workflow with plasma cells. OptoSelect chips are single-use consumables and replaced after each workflow. 
Reagent kits 
We have commercialized a broad range of reagent kits that have been validated in the workflows using our platform. These reagent kits support the on-chip analysis on our advanced automation systems as well as many other upstream and downstream processes. 
Our reagent kits have been optimized to support multiple species and cell types including mammalian cells such as B cells, T cells and dendritic cells, and non-mammalian cells including yeast and bacteria. 
Advanced automation systems and instruments
We currently offer three advanced automation systems and instruments, Beacon and Lightning, which are designed to run our proprietary workflows, and Culture Station, which allows our customers to execute workflows requiring high volume, multi-day cell culture without breaking the continuity and control provisions of a single program run. 
Table of Contents

Beacon 
Launched in December of 2016, our Beacon system is a fully automated, high throughput system that enables workflows on four OptoSelect chips in parallel, utilizing up to 80,000 NanoPens. Beacon captures brightfield and fluorescence images to track and assay individual cells across multiple points in time to allow Deep Opto Profiling of phenotypic and genotypic information on single cells. Beacon is used by our customers for high throughput applications, including antibody discovery and cell line development. Since its launch, we have focused on continuous improvement efforts in the form of activating additional system-level capabilities and enhancements, in turn, enhancing the value of the system for our customers. We will continue to evolve Beacon to further facilitate distributed decentralized biological processing globally. 
Lightning 
Launched in June of 2019, our Lightning desktop system supports workflows on a single chip. Lightning captures brightfield and fluorescence images to track and assay individual cells across multiple points in time and allows Deep Opto Profiling of phenotypic and genotypic information on single cells. 
Table of Contents

Culture Station
Launched in January of 2020, Culture Station instrument enables the on-chip culture of cells outside of Beacon and Lightning, where workflows require an extended cell culture period. Culture Station consists of independent media, fluidics and software and can be seamlessly integrated into Beacon and Lightning workflows. Rather than occupy those systems during the Culture module, customers can transfer up to eight of our OptoSelect chips from Beacon or Lightning onto Culture Station. Once culture is completed, the chips can be moved back to Beacon or Lightning for further analysis. This seamless interface between systems and instruments increases throughput when cell culture becomes a constraint. Parallel processing of culture while simultaneously running assays on Beacon or Lightning reduces the product development cycle time and lowers cost, maximizing benefits to our customers. 
Advanced application and workflow software 
Our software suite includes tailored software packages that enable customers to design, automate and scale reproducible workflows and collect, aggregate, analyze and report data on each cell in each NanoPen, far beyond what we believe is possible with current manual workflows. 
Business model and platform access
Our business model is focused on driving the adoption of the Berkeley Lights Platform, including our Beacon system, consumables, reagent kits, and software, and maximizing its use across our customers’ value chains. This is achieved by enabling more functional testing of single cells throughout our customers’ value chains and by finding opportunities for customers to perform single-cell functional testing earlier in their product development process to advance better product candidates. We engage with potential customers to identify a significant challenge they are facing and then evaluate which of our workflows and underlying assays can address their problem. Customers can gain access to our platform via direct purchase, subscription, or through a strategic partnership or service relationship. In many cases we can address customers’ needs with existing or variants of existing workflows. Alternately, we may form strategic partnerships or collaborations to develop substantially new workflows with our customers to address their needs.

Our growth strategy 
Our goal is to establish the Berkeley Lights Platform as the standard throughout the cell-based product value chain and drive substantial conversion of current cell biology workflows onto our platform. Our growth strategy is comprised of the following elements: 
Drive new customer adoption of the Berkeley Lights Platform 
Since the commercial launch of our platform through December 31, 2021, 80 customers had leveraged our platform to perform a variety of workflows. We drive customer adoption globally within our initial target markets of antibody therapeutics, cell therapy and synthetic biology through business development efforts, a direct sales and marketing organization in the United States, parts of Europe and China; and third-party distributors and dealers in Asia. In 2021 we increased our focus on strategic partnerships and services, allowing our partners to utilize our service offerings performed in our BioFoundry.
Expand the utilization of workflows across our customers’ value chains 
We are driving the adoption of workflows using our platform across our existing customers’ value chains. We are doing so by developing new workflows for use at multiple points within the discovery, development and production phases of our customers’ value chains. 
Table of Contents

Increase the value of our workflows to our customers 
We are increasing the value of our workflows by building additional assays that can be used with a given workflow and by further integrating the workflows into our customers’ existing processes. We are also expanding the upstream and downstream reach of our workflows. This increases the workflow value to our customers and enables us to share in that cost of ownership benefit. For example, we developed our Opto Plasma B Discovery 2.0 and 3.0 workflows to improve the features of Opto Plasma B Discovery 1.0. This was achieved by increasing scale and adding sequence library preparation into our workflow, making the process easier and more efficient for our customers and enabling them to more broadly screen the antibody diversity of animals. In 2021 we introduced our Opto™ Plasma B Discovery (OPBD) 4.0 workflow, which enables recovery of 1000s of hits by screening up to 100,000 plasma B cells and the down-selection of lead candidates with functional assays, which can then be sequenced to realize the re-expression of functionally characterized antibodies in just one week. We believe that by maximizing the diversity through direct functional profiling of plasma B cells, our OPBD 4.0 workflow allows users to accelerate discovery against even the most challenging targets. We have multiple generations of workflows for antibody discovery and cell line development, and are developing new generations of workflows, including for cell therapy development, incorporating additional capabilities that have value for our customers. 
Drive utilization of our workflows and adoption of our platform across multiple customer sites 
We increase usage of our platform with existing customers by driving adoption of multiple advanced automation systems either to support multiple locations or drive increased usage of our workflows in any given location. There is an opportunity to increase utilization of our platform throughout our customers’ organizations. We accomplish this through a combination of sales and business development efforts as well as through our customer success organization to help customers to standardize their processes globally at multiple sites using our platform. 
Develop and monetize proprietary biological assets from our BioFoundry 
Within our Berkeley Lights BioFoundry, we develop, practice and validate workflows. In certain cases, we may use our own biology as part of this validation process. This enables us to commercialize new workflows and may also generate proprietary valuable biological assets we could sell outright or license to customers, such as functionally validated antibodies or new organisms applicable to synthetic biology. We also use our Innovation Lab, including in cooperation with third parties, to develop workflows to generate proprietary biological assets for new and adjacent markets. These early third-party research collaborations may take various forms, including service or capacity subscription arrangements.
Expand adoption of the Berkeley Lights Platform into new markets 
Our market entry strategy involves identifying markets that have significant constraints which can be addressed by our platform. This can be specific to certain diseases or pathogens and/or involve new therapeutic modalities and/or cell types. We drive our expansion into new markets by developing workflows for those markets, either by adapting existing workflows or by partnering with leaders in those markets to develop workflows that address their significant unmet needs but also have general value for other customers in that market. In 2021 we announced new engagements in the gene therapy and agricultural markets. These strategic partnerships can result in joint development of specific workflows and assays involving upfront and milestone arrangements, as well as capacity subscription arrangements. Depending on the agreement, we could also negotiate end product revenue participation through royalties.

Our workflow and assay library 
As of December 31, 2021, we offered ten commercial workflows, incorporating multiple assays that address different phases of our customers’ cell-based product value chains in our target markets. In each of these markets we are developing additional workflows that can extend use of our platform across our customers’ value chains and perform single-cell functional testing at critical yield steps as early as possible in their respective processes. We are also developing workflows to enter new cell-based product markets. Workflow development and market expansion are a function of incorporating additional cell types, product specific assays or adapting the four basic workflow modules. 
We use our Berkeley Lights BioFoundry, which we believe represents the largest single location platform capacity globally for functionally characterizing cells, to drive new workflow development and functionally characterize cells. In our BioFoundry, we practice and develop workflows and functional assays that are applicable throughout the value chain of our target markets. Leveraging our BioFoundry’s capacity, we can also look deep into the immune repertoire to discover difficult-to-find proprietary biological assets, such as antibodies and TCRs, that may offer commercialization opportunities.
Through our platform, customers can now link the Deep Opto Profiling data to each cell’s genomic expression. For example, some customers are using our platform to recover paired heavy and light chain antibody sequences and others are using our platform to capture mRNA from target cells for gene expression profiling. Customers can characterize the transcriptome of the highest producing clones. We expect that customers will be able to use this linked data to improve cellular models which may enable better organism design. We envision Deep Opto Profiling data will be aggregated and made accessible via the cloud to existing and new customers, which over time could become a part of our distributed biology strategy and our product offering. 
Antibody therapeutics workflows 
In the antibody therapeutics market, as of December 31, 2021, we offered seven commercial workflows, five targeting the discovery phase and two targeting the development phase of this market. 
Table of Contents

Opto Plasma B Discovery workflows versions 1.0, 2.0, 3.0 and 4.0 – These workflows enable customers to functionally characterize single B cells to discover antibody therapeutic candidates. We designed our Opto Plasma B Discovery workflows to provide access to the highest level of biodiversity and to discover rare functional antibodies that cannot be easily or cost-effectively found with other common methods, such as hybridoma, or methods that involve sequencing B cells first and performing functional testing later. Our Opto Plasma B Discovery workflows can deliver functional monoclonal antibody sequences in as little as three days, which compares to weeks or months using common methods.
Opto Viral Neutralization 1.0—We commercialized Opto Viral Neutralization 1.0 in September 2020. We adapted the modules and assays from our Opto Plasma B Discovery workflow 1.0 to enable recovery of antibodies from both immunized animals and human patients exposed to emerging and dangerous pathogens, like SARS-CoV-2. We developed reagent kits to process blood from patients surviving viral infection in order to find antibodies from both plasma and memory B cells against the virus. Using our platform, GenScript made an early discovery of binding antibodies in China against SARS-CoV-2. As part of our direct work on COVID-19, we collaborated with Vanderbilt University Medical Center to discover therapeutic antibody candidates. This work resulted in the discovery of hundreds of antibody sequences from a single recovering patient targeting SARS-CoV-2, two of those antibodies are in Phase 3 trials being conducted by AstraZeneca and in one study, this two antibody cocktail has shown to be effective against the dominant strain of COVID-19. In December 2021, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for AstraZeneca’s Evusheld (tixagevimab co-packaged with cilgavimab and administered together) for the pre-exposure prophylaxis (prevention) of COVID-19 in certain adults and pediatric individuals. 
While our recent efforts have been focused on SARS-CoV-2, we believe that Opto Viral Neutralization 1.0 can be leveraged to discover potential therapies for many viruses and other emerging pathogens. The ability to process human patient samples provides access to the immune repertoire and antibodies that may represent therapeutic candidates for other infections suffered in the past. Previously, tapping directly into the human immune repertoire was not economically feasible because of the high costs associated with sequencing, re-expression and functional testing of thousands of cells. Our platform and Opto Viral Neutralization 1.0 allow for upfront functional screening which makes accessing the repertoire economically feasible. 
Opto Cell Line Development versions 1.0 and 2.0—Following antibody discovery and antibody engineering, our Opto Cell Line Development workflows enable finding the highest productivity cell line by repeating the Culture and Assay modules on a small clone of 4 to 60 cells derived and grown from a single cell isolated on our chip. These workflows shorten the time to find the best production cell lines from 8 to 12 weeks for well plate-based approaches down to 1 week using our platform. Operation of a single large-scale bioreactor can cost approximately $50 million annually. The potential annual cost savings for finding a clone with just 20% higher titer could be on the order of $10 million per year per large-scale bioreactor. In certain cases, some customers have demonstrated even greater increases in titer. Our workflows also enable >99% monoclonality assurance, a quality metric important for regulatory approval, in the same workflow. By contrast, limiting dilution, a common method to provide monoclonality assurance, takes approximately four weeks and only achieves approximately 96% monoclonality assurance. In 2020, one of our customers received the first Investigational New Drug, or IND, approval by the FDA for an Antibody Therapeutic developed using our Opto Cell Line Development 1.0 workflow on the Beacon system, and we believe the Beacon system has been used to discover, define, and/or develop materials for other IND filings. This means that our highly replicable, standardized, automated cell line development workflow with the associated automated data capture, including our industry leading monoclonality, is an accepted workflow for the creation of monoclonal cell lines.
Cell therapy workflows 
As of December 31, 2021, we offered three commercial workflows for cell therapy development. We are also developing our platform to serve as an integrated solution to develop and manufacture T cell therapies, as well as monitor a patient’s immune response to such therapies. 
Table of Contents

Opto Cell Therapy Development workflow version 1.0—We announced version 1.0 in April of 2020, which enables customers to isolate, define and identify poly-functional T cells by precisely assembling T cell-target cell interactions in NanoPen chambers. Our platform can selectively import phenotype specific T cells, cancer cells and cytokine capture beads into the NanoPens and co-culture them to determine what percentage of the T cell population demonstrates antigen-specific activation through multiple cytokine secretion measurements. Using this workflow, customers can also perform a time-lapse cytotoxicity assay in the NanoPens with T cells that have the ideal poly-functional cytokine phenotype to provide functional measurement of the T cell’s effectiveness in killing single or multiple tumor cells over time. It can be used to select specific T cells for TCR recovery and sequencing to accelerate the development of potential new cell therapies. With Opto Cell Therapy Development 1.0, which includes the use of dendritic cells, our customers can evaluate thousands of individual T cells in parallel in a single day and on a single platform, and quickly derive actionable information on T cell function and then select and export the desired live cells for further downstream processing. 
Opto Cell Therapy Development workflow version 2.0—We have also released Opto Cell Therapy Development 2.0, which upgrades 1.0 to include upstream off-chip activation and expansion of T cells prior to on-chip selection, using multi-cytokine and cytotoxicity assays. Opto Cell Therapy Development 2.0 will eliminate the need for dendritic cells, which will reduce overall process variation, time and cost. 
OptoSeq mRNA Library Kit – For many researchers, it is important to understand the genomic changes that correspond to the functional phenotypes that are characterized during our workflows. With this kit, a unique barcoded bead is loaded into each NanoPen chamber. The cells are lysed on chip and the mRNA is released and captured on the beads and reverse transcribed into cDNA. The barcodes are read using fluorescence in the NanoPen and the beads are exported in unique groups of 80 or more at a time. The capture cDNA is then converted into sequencing libraries. During sequencing, the cDNA is read along with the corresponding bead barcode. Our proprietary software allows the customer to deconvolute the sequencing information enabling a direct linkage of single cell phenotype to single cell genotype across thousands of interrogated NanoPens.
Fully integrated cell therapy solution—We are developing workflows and a new advanced automation system to enable our platform to be deployed as a fully integrated solution for manufacture and therapy monitoring of cell therapies. In the first quarter of 2021, we announced that we had completed an alpha version of a fully integrated, closed loop, cell therapy manufacturing system, or CTMS. As part of the announcement we also stated that our CTMS is still early in the development cycle and any actual commercial use of the CTMS is likely several years away. Our CTMS development efforts are continuing. We believe that these additions to our platform can address critical challenges and could enable the production of cell therapies on an integrated platform in a decentralized setting, close to the patient. 
Synthetic biology workflows 
In September of 2019, we signed a collaboration agreement with Ginkgo, a leader in the synthetic biology market, or the Ginkgo Agreement. Under the Ginkgo Agreement, Ginkgo has agreed to incorporate the Berkeley Lights Platform into its automated genetic engineering foundries. The collaboration will, among other things, drive jointly developed workflows that will help provide continued growth in output and efficiency of Ginkgo’s foundries and will establish our commercial workflow offering in the synthetic biology market. We are currently developing multiple workflows encompassing a variety of organisms with Ginkgo. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we exercised a buy-down right on two different collaboration workflows, which allows us to avoid a waiting period before commercializing the workflows for third parties.
Market opportunity 
While our platform is currently utilized primarily in the discovery and development stages of the value chain and marketed as research use only, or RUO, we believe that the capabilities of our platform will enable us to capture an increasingly greater share of our addressable market opportunity and the value chain across cell-based product industries, including being incorporated into the commercial manufacturing process. Our current workflows target customers in the antibody therapeutics, cell therapy, synthetic biology, gene therapy, and agriculture markets. We 
Table of Contents

estimate that end market sales of cell-based products in antibody therapeutics, cell therapy and synthetic biology were approximately $148 billion in 2019 and are expected to grow to $255 billion by 2024 at an 11% CAGR. We believe there are approximately 1,600 companies, academic institutions, and governmental and other organizations currently focused on developing cell-based products and we estimate our total addressable market to be approximately $23 billion, which includes addressable markets of approximately $6 billion in antibody therapeutics, approximately $15 billion in cell therapy and approximately $2 billion in synthetic biology. Our estimates of our total addressable markets are based on potential customer research and development spending, addressable aspects of potential customers’ end product development process, and potential platform usage. We also utilize estimated penetration and placement rates for our platform with potential customers in our target markets and historical patterns for consumables usage. 
In addition to markets where our platform is already commercially available, we continue to look for new markets to enter, such as cell therapy. While a commercial version of our Cell Therapy Manufacturing Solution (CTMS) is still several years away, in the first quarter of 2021 we announced that we had developed an alpha version of our CTMS. In 2021 we also announced engagements in agricultural biology and gene therapy. Specifically, in July of 2021, we announced a strategic collaboration with Thermo Fisher Scientific aimed at addressing challenges in commercial-scale viral vector manufacturing. The strategic partnership, which began in December of 2020, is focused on developing a next-generation workflow on our platform to accelerate and improve the development of stable AAV (Adeno-Associated Viral) and LV (Lentiviral) vector producer cell lines. We believe we will be able to leverage some of the collaboration efforts for other customer and partner AAV and LV vector producer cell lines. In August of 2021, we announced a multi-year agreement with Bayer to develop and perform high-throughput functional screening workflows aimed at accelerating and expanding the discovery of novel traits. We are leveraging our platform to screen individual variants of bioactives for Bayer in a massively high-throughput manner. We believe the outcome will be a significant acceleration of Bayer’s pipeline for discovery and development of novel traits.
Commercial 
As of December 31, 2021, our customer base was comprised of 80 customers and included several of the largest biopharmaceutical companies in the world, as well as biotechnology companies, leading contract research organizations, synthetic biology companies and academic research institutions. 
As of December 31, 2021, we employed a commercial team of 100 employees, including 30 with Ph.D. degrees and many with significant industry experience. Of the 100 commercial employees, 35 were in business development, sales and marketing, while 65 were employed within our customer success organization, which is focused primarily on customer service and support efforts. As of December 31, 2021, our business development and sales teams included 25 employees, of which 17 were quota carrying sales representatives. We follow a direct sales model in North America, certain regions in Europe and China, while also selling primarily through third party distributors and dealers in Asia. 
Our business model is focused on driving the adoption of the Berkeley Lights Platform and maximizing its use across our customers’ value chains. This is achieved by enabling more functional testing of single cells throughout our customers’ value chains and by finding opportunities for customers to perform single-cell functional testing earlier in their product development process. We engage with potential customers to identify a significant challenge they are facing and then evaluate which workflows and underlying assays can address their problem. Customers can gain access to our platform via direct purchase, subscription, our service business, or strategic partnership. In many cases we can address customer needs with existing or variants of existing workflows. 
Alternatively, we may form strategic partnerships to develop substantially new workflows with our customers to address their needs.

Competition 
We face significant competition in the life sciences technology market. We currently compete with both established and early stage life sciences technology companies that design, manufacture and market systems, consumables, reagent kits and software for, among other applications, genomics, single-cell analysis, spatial analysis and immunology, and/or provide services related to the same. Growing understanding of the importance of single-cell information is leading to more companies offering services related to collecting such information. Our target customers may also elect to develop their workflows on legacy systems, or using traditional methods, or engage a third party that provides a discovery service, rather than implementing our platform, and they may also decide to stop using our platform. Companies providing point solutions in this space include 10x Genomics, HiFiBio Therapeutics, Solentim, Molecular Devices, Cytena, NanoCellect Biomedical, Danaher, Menarini Silicon Biosystems, Miltenyi Biotec and Sphere Fluidics Ltd., among others. In addition, there are many large established players in the life science technology market that we do not currently compete with but that could develop systems, tools or other products that will compete with us in the future. These large established companies have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, including larger research and development staff or more established marketing and sales forces. 
For further discussion of the risks we face relating to competition, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks related to our business and strategy—The life sciences technology market is highly competitive, and if we cannot compete successfully with our competitors, we may be unable to increase or sustain our revenue, or achieve and sustain profitability.” 
Manufacturing and supply 
We developed the Berkeley Lights Platform to create the most advanced environment for functional testing of single cells and provide customers local access to Digital Cell Biology for developing cell-based products on a global scale. Our platform is a fully integrated, end-to-end solution, comprised of our OptoSelect chips and reagent kits, advanced automation systems and advanced application and workflow software. Our platform leverages our OEP technology, which provides deterministic positioning of live single cells and other micro-objects using light. We believe our platform delivers a high level of control over, and preservation of, live single cells or other micro-objects throughout the functional characterization process. 
Our manufacturing strategy relies heavily on third parties. Manufacturing of our systems, certain of our reagent kits and OptoSelect chip components is contracted out to third party contract manufacturers and suppliers located in the United States, Europe and Asia. We perform final assembly of our OptoSelect chips in-house. Our outsourced production strategy is intended to drive cost leverage and scale and avoid the high capital outlays and fixed costs related to constructing and operating a manufacturing facility. Certain suppliers of our components and materials are single source suppliers. For further discussion of the risks relating to our third party suppliers, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks related to manufacturing and supply.” 
Consumables—OptoSelect chips and reagent kits 
We obtain all components of our OptoSelect chips from third party suppliers. While some components are sourced from a single supplier, we have qualified, or are qualifying, second sources for several of our critical chip requirements, as well as our reagent kits, and proprietary chip surface coatings. We believe that having dual sources for certain of our components helps reduce the risk of a potential production delay caused by a disruption in the supply of a critical component. We perform final manufacturing and assembly of our OptoSelect chips at our facilities in Emeryville, California. We outsource the manufacturing of many of our commercially released reagent kits to third party contract manufacturers.

Advanced automation systems and instruments 
We rely heavily on third party contract manufacturers for production and manufacturing of Beacon, Lightning and Culture Station. Design work, prototyping and pilot manufacturing of our advanced automation systems are performed in-house before outsourcing to the third party contract manufacturers. We currently rely on Korvis LLC for the manufacturing of Beacon and Culture Station. For additional information on our supply arrangement with Korvis, see below under “Korvis supply agreement.” 
Korvis supply agreement 
In February of 2015, we entered into a supply agreement with Korvis LLC, or Korvis, which was subsequently amended in April of 2019  (collectively, the “Korvis Agreement”). The Korvis Agreement governs the terms and conditions of any purchase orders that we submit to Korvis for the manufacture of Beacon and Culture Station. Under the terms of the Korvis Agreement, Korvis will manufacture our products according to agreed-upon specifications. Korvis is required to maintain minimum manufacturing capacity of a specified number of Beacon systems per month. In addition, we may issue purchase orders in such volumes that require Korvis to maintain at least a specified minimum number of Beacon systems in its finished goods inventory. We are not otherwise obligated to issue a purchase order, and Korvis is only obligated to accept purchase orders for any specified number of products if the purchase order is consistent with a forecast and aligns with Korvis’s then-current lead times. The initial term of the Korvis Agreement was 24 months, after which the agreement automatically renews for successive 12-month terms unless we or Korvis provide written notice of intent not to renew at least 90 days’ prior to the end of the then-current term. 
The Korvis Agreement also includes negotiated provisions relating to, among others, delivery, inspection procedures, warranties, intellectual property rights, indemnification, and confidentiality.
Intellectual property 
Protection of our intellectual property is fundamental to the long-term success of our business. We seek to ensure that investments made into the development of our technology are protected by relying on a combination of patent rights, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, know-how, license agreements, confidentiality agreements and procedures, non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employee disclosure and invention assignment agreements and other contractual rights. 
Our patent strategy is focused on seeking coverage for various elements of our Berkeley Lights Platform, including our OptoSelect chips and reagent kits, advanced automation systems and instruments, including Beacon, Lightning, and Culture Station and advanced workflow software. In addition, we file for patent protection on the certain therapeutic and diagnostic products and processes discovered using or derived from the Berkeley Lights Platform. 
As of December 31, 2021, our owned patent assets included approximately 50 U.S. patents, 69 pending U.S. patent applications, 9 pending patent cooperation treaty, or PCT, applications, 286 foreign patents and 323 pending foreign patent applications in various foreign jurisdictions, including Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan. Our owned patent assets include 17 patents and applications that are jointly owned by us and by the UC Regents, including 2 U.S. patents, 2 pending U.S. patent applications, 8 foreign patents and 5 foreign patent applications, of which the 2 U.S. patents and the 8 foreign patents are included within the scope of our exclusive licensing arrangement with the UC Regents. As of December 31, 2021, our in-licensed patent assets included 9 U.S. patents, 6 foreign patents, and 1 pending U.S. patent application. Excluding any patent term extension, the currently issued BLI-owned patents are expected to expire between 2033 to 2038. The currently issued in-licensed patents are expected to expire from 2022 to 2033. We do not expect that the expiration of any patent in 2022 will materially impact our business, future operations or financial position.

Various of our owned patents and patent applications relate to our advanced automation systems, including our Beacon, Lightning and/or Culture Station systems and our OEP technology, other of our patents and patent applications relate to our advanced application and workflow software, including our CAS software, our Workflow Runner/Builder software, our Image Analyzer software, and/or our Assay Analyzer software, still other of our owned patents and patent applications relate to our OptoSelect chips, and still other of our owned patents and patent applications relate to our reagent kits and/or our workflows. Certain of our owned patents and patent applications relate to more than one product group or technology. Our in-licensed patents and patent applications generally relate to micro opto-fluidics. We also have patents related to products or technology that are under development or are on our development roadmap. 
We also rely on copyrights, trade secrets, including know-how, unpatented technology and other proprietary information, to strengthen our competitive position. We have determined that certain technologies, such as certain processes, methods and surface coatings, are better kept as trade secrets. To mitigate the chance of trade secret misappropriation, it is our policy to enter into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to trade secrets, such as our employees, collaborators, consultants, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into invention or patent assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions they have developed while working for us. 
We also seek to protect our brand through procurement of trademark rights. As of December 31, 2021, we owned ten registered trademarks in the U.S. and 110 registered trademarks internationally, inclusive of Madrid Protocol applications, as well as five U.S. and 52 international pending trademark applications. Such international jurisdictions in which we own registered trademarks or pending trademark applications include Australia, Canada, China, the European Union, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Singapore. Our registered trademarks and pending trademark applications include trademarks for Berkeley Lights, BLI, NanoPen, OptoSelect, Beacon, Lightning, Deep Opto Profiling, OEP, CAS, Opto, OptoSeq, and our Berkeley Lights logo. In order to supplement protection of our brand, we have also registered several internet domain names. For further discussion of the risks relating to intellectual property, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks related to litigation and our intellectual property.”
Licenses
UC Regents license agreement
In October of 2011, we entered into a license agreement, which was subsequently amended in March 2016, or the UC Agreement, with The Regents of the University of California, or the UC Regents, pursuant to which UC Regents granted us an exclusive (subject to certain non-commercial rights reserved by UC Regents and certain rights retained by the U.S. government, including so-called march-in rights), sublicensable, worldwide license under certain patent rights owned by UC Regents related to optoelectronic tweezer technology to develop, manufacture, use and commercialize products, services and methods that are covered by such patent rights, or the Licensed Products.
We paid UC Regents upfront payments totaling $15,000 in connection with executing the UC Agreement. In addition, we issued an aggregate of 250,992 shares of our common stock, which had an aggregate fair value at the time of issuance of approximately $30,000, to certain persons associated with UC Regents upon the occurrence of a qualifying financing event. Additionally, we must pay UC Regents a sub-single digit percentage royalty on our net sales of Licensed Products that are covered by a valid claim of the licensed patents, subject to an annual minimum royalty payment owed to UC Regents of $10,000. We are also obligated to pay UC Regents a percentage of certain royalty income received from our sublicensees ranging from the low- to mid-teens.
We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, manufacture and commercialize the Licensed Products.

The UC Agreement will continue until the expiration of the last to expire patent or last to be abandoned patent application that is licensed to us, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the UC Agreement. We may terminate the UC Agreement by providing advance written notice as specified in the UC Agreement. UC Regents may terminate the UC Agreement if we violate or fail to perform any term of the UC Agreement and we fail to cure such violation or failure within 90 days of notice thereof from UC Regents. Additionally, if we challenge the validity or enforceability of any of the licensed patents, UC Regents may remove such patents from the scope of our license.
Government regulations
Our products and operations may be subject to extensive and rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, or local authorities, as well as foreign regulatory authorities. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacturing, clearance, approval, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, advertising, promotion, marketing, distribution, post-market monitoring and reporting, and import and export of medical devices. Our products are currently marketed as research use only, or RUO. 
RUO products cannot make any claims related to safety, effectiveness or diagnostic utility and they cannot be intended for human clinical diagnostic use. In November 2013, the FDA issued a final guidance on products labeled RUO, which, among other things, reaffirmed that a company may not make any clinical or diagnostic claims about an RUO product. The FDA will also evaluate the totality of the circumstances to determine if the product is intended for diagnostic purposes. If the FDA were to determine, based on the totality of circumstances, that our products labeled and marketed for RUO are intended for diagnostic purposes, they would be considered medical devices that will require clearance or approval prior to commercialization. 
Regulatory framework for medical devices in the United States 
Pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, the FDA has jurisdiction over medical devices, which are defined to include, among other things, in vitro diagnostic devices, or IVDs. IVDs that are marketed for RUO are not intended for use in a clinical investigation or for clinical diagnostic use outside an investigation and must be labeled “For Research Use Only. Not for use in diagnostic procedures.” Products that are intended for RUO and are properly labeled as RUO are exempt from compliance with the FDA’s requirements applicable to medical devices more generally, including the requirements for clearance or approval and compliance with manufacturing requirements known as the Quality System Regulation, or QSR. A product labeled RUO but intended to be used diagnostically may be viewed by the FDA as adulterated and misbranded under the FDCA and is subject to FDA enforcement activities. The FDA may consider the totality of the circumstances surrounding distribution and use of an RUO product, including how the product is marketed, when determining its intended use. 
Although we currently market our products as RUO, we may in the future intend for them to be used for clinical or diagnostic purposes, or may develop other different products intended for clinical or diagnostic purposes, such as our in-development CTMS, which would result in the application of a more onerous set of regulatory requirements. Specifically, unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of an application for premarket approval, or PMA. Both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be resource intensive, expensive and lengthy, and require payment of significant user fees. 
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes—Class I, Class II or Class III—depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness. 
Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of FDA regulations, referred to as the General Controls for Medical 
Table of Contents

Devices, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the QSR facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements. 
Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, patient registries, FDA guidance documents and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. 
Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed novel and not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time-consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, pre-clinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use. 
After a device enters commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include: 
•the FDA’s QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process; 
•labeling regulations, unique device identification requirements and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label uses; 
•advertising and promotion requirements; 
•restrictions on sale, distribution or use of a device; 
•PMA annual reporting requirements; 
•PMA approval of product modifications, or the potential for new 510(k) clearances for certain modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices; 
•medical device reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur; 
•medical device correction and removal reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 
•recall requirements, including a mandatory recall if there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death; 
•an order of repair, replacement or refund; 
•device tracking requirements; and 
Table of Contents

•post-market surveillance regulations, which apply when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 
The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory enforcement powers. Medical device manufacturers are subject to unannounced inspections by the FDA and other state, local and foreign regulatory authorities to assess compliance with the QSR and other applicable regulations, and these inspections may include the manufacturing facilities of any suppliers. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include sanctions such as: warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; unanticipated expenditures, repair, replacement, refunds, recall or seizure of our products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; the FDA’s refusal of our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products, new intended uses or modifications to existing products; the FDA’s refusal to issue certificates to foreign governments needed to export products for sale in other countries; and withdrawing 510(k) clearance or premarket approvals that have already been granted and criminal prosecution. 
It is also possible that in the future we develop a therapeutic that would be subject to different but also comprehensive FDA regulatory requirements. 
Human capital resources 
As of December 31, 2021 we employed a total of 293 individuals, of whom 267 were employed in the United States, 12 of whom were employed in Asia Pacific and 14 of whom were employed in Europe. As of December 31, 2021, our 293 full-time employees included 111 in research and development, 100 in business development, sales, marketing and support, 35 in manufacturing and operations and 47 in general and administrative functions, of which many hold PhDs in their respective disciplines.
