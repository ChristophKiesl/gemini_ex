Non-core operations comprise our Sugar and Bioenergy segment, which primarily comprises our 50% interest in the BP Bunge Bioenergia joint venture.
History and Corporate Information
Bunge Limited is an exempted company limited by shares incorporated under the laws of Bermuda. We are registered with the Registrar of Companies in Bermuda under registration number EC20791. We trace our history back to 1818 when we were founded as a trading company in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. We are a holding company and substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. Our principal executive offices and corporate headquarters are located at 1391 Timberlake Manor Parkway, Chesterfield, Missouri, 63017, United States of America, and our telephone number is (314) 292-2000. Our registered office is located at 2 Church Street, Hamilton, HM 11, Bermuda.
Redomestication
On December 8, 2022, we announced our intention to change the place of incorporation of our ultimate parent company from Bermuda to Switzerland (the "Redomestication"). Over the past few years, we have undertaken an extensive review of our 
Table of Contents

business operations and the emerging trends in the global tax environment. As part of this review, we performed a substantial analysis of alternative jurisdictions to which we might redomesticate. Following completion of this analysis, we determined that Switzerland was the best jurisdiction in which to redomesticate because it allows us to better align our corporate legal structure with our commercial operations. Switzerland is also a jurisdiction that is well-suited for global companies like Bunge and offers a well-developed corporate, legal, and regulatory environment. Additionally, Bunge has conducted substantial business operations in Switzerland for decades. 
If the Redomestication is approved, the place of incorporation and principal executive office of our ultimate parent company will be in Geneva, Switzerland. The corporate headquarters of the Bunge Group will remain in Chesterfield, Missouri. We would continue to be subject to the ongoing reporting requirements of a public company under U.S. securities laws and our shares would continue to be listed exclusively on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") under the symbol “BG.” The Redomestication is subject to various approvals and conditions, including shareholder approval. The Redomestication involves a number of risks and uncertainties, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors - Risks Relating to the Redomestication” for more information.
We expect to call a special meeting of shareholders in 2023 to seek approval for the Redomestication. On December 21, 2022, we filed a proxy statement in preliminary form with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in connection with this special meeting and intend to file a proxy statement in definitive form. The preliminary proxy statement and the proxy statement in definitive form, when available, contain important information about the Redomestication and Bunge and you are encouraged to review these documents. 
Core Segments
Agribusiness Segment
Overview—Our Agribusiness segment is an integrated, global business involved in purchasing, storing, transporting, processing, and selling agricultural commodities and commodity products while managing risk across various value chains. The principal agricultural commodities that we handle in this segment are oilseeds, primarily soybeans, rapeseed, canola, and sunflower seed, and grains, primarily wheat and corn. We process oilseeds into vegetable oils and protein meals, principally for the food, animal feed and biofuel industries, through a global network of facilities. Our footprint is well balanced, with approximately 36% of our processing capacity located in South America, 26% in North America, 23% in Europe and 15% in Asia-Pacific.
Customers—We sell agricultural commodities and processed commodity products to customers throughout the world. The principal purchasers of our oilseeds, grains and oilseed meal are animal feed manufacturers, livestock producers, wheat and corn millers, and other oilseed processors. As a result, our agribusiness operations generally benefit from global demand for protein, primarily poultry and pork products. The principal purchasers of the unrefined vegetable oils produced in this segment are our own refined and specialty oils businesses, third-party edible oil processors, which use these oils as raw materials in the production of edible oil products for the food service, and the food processor and retail markets, as well as biofuel companies, which use the oil as feedstock for biofuel production.
Distribution and Logistics—We have developed an extensive global logistics network to transport our products, including trucks, railcars, river barges and ocean freight vessels. Typically, we either lease the transportation assets or contract with third parties for these services. To better serve our customer base and develop our global distribution and logistics capabilities, we own or operate either directly or through joint venture arrangements, various port terminal facilities, including in Brazil, Argentina, the United States, Canada, Latvia, Ukraine, Poland, Vietnam, and Australia.
Financial Services and Activities—We also offer various financial services, principally trade structured finance and financial risk management services, to customers and other third parties. Our trade structured finance operations primarily leverage our international trade flows to generate trade finance derived liquidity in emerging markets for third parties. Our financial risk management services include structuring and marketing risk management products to enable agricultural producers and end users of commodities to manage commodity price risk exposures. We also engage in foreign exchange and other financial instrument trading via our financial services business. Additionally, we provide financing services to farmers, primarily in Brazil, from whom we purchase soybeans and other agricultural commodities. Our farmer financing activities are an integral part of our grain and oilseed origination activities as they help assure the annual supply of raw materials for our Brazilian agribusiness operations.
Biodiesel—We own and operate conventional biodiesel facilities in Europe and Brazil and have equity method investments in conventional biodiesel producers in Europe and Argentina. This business is complementary to our core 
Table of Contents

Agribusiness operations as in each case we supply some of the raw materials (refined or partially refined vegetable oil) used in their production processes. 
Raw Materials—We purchase oilseeds and grains either directly from farmers or indirectly through intermediaries. Although the availability and price of agricultural commodities may, in any given year, be affected by unpredictable factors such as weather, government programs and policies, and farmer planting and selling decisions, our operations in major crop growing regions have enabled us to source adequate raw materials for our operational needs.
Competition—Due to their commodity nature, markets for our products are highly competitive and subject to product substitution. Competition is principally based on price, quality, product and service offerings, and geographic location. Major competitors include but are not limited to: The Archer Daniels Midland Co. ("ADM"), Cargill Incorporated ("Cargill"), Louis Dreyfus Group ("Louis Dreyfus"), Glencore International PLC ("Glencore"), Wilmar International Limited ("Wilmar"), and COFCO International ("COFCO").
Refined and Specialty Oils Segment
Overview—We primarily sell our refined and specialty oil products to food processors, food service companies, and retail outlets, as well as for feedstock to renewable diesel producers. The principal raw materials used in our Refined and Specialty Oils segment are various crude and further processed vegetable oils and fats. These raw materials are mostly agricultural commodities that we either produce or purchase from third parties. We believe that our global integrated business model enables us to realize synergies among our Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, and Milling segments through raw material procurement, logistics, risk management and the co-location of industrial facilities, enabling us to supply customers with reliable, high-quality products on a global basis. As many of the products we sell in our Refined and Specialty Oils segment are staple foods or ingredients, these businesses generally benefit from global population and income growth rates.
Products—Our refined and specialty oil products include packaged and bulk oils and fats, including cooking oils, shortenings, margarines, mayonnaise, renewable diesel feedstocks, and other products derived from the vegetable oil refining process. We primarily use soybean, sunflower, rapeseed and canola oil that we produce in our Agribusiness segment processing operations as raw materials in this business. We also refine and fractionate palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, and shea butter, and blend and refine olive oil. Additionally, we produce specialty ingredients derived from vegetable oils, such as lecithin, which is used as an emulsifier in a broad range of food products. We are a leading seller of packaged vegetable oils worldwide, based on sales. We have refined and specialty oils refining and packaging facilities in North America, South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Africa. Our refined and specialty oils business comprises our wholly-owned refined oils business in North America, other business to business ("B2B") and business to consumer ("B2C") specialty oils offerings in South America, Europe and Asia-Pacific, as well as Bunge Loders Croklaan ("Loders"), which itself is represented by our 80% ownership interest in the Bunge Loders Croklaan joint venture with IOI Corporation Berhad.
In Brazil, our retail edible oil brands include Soya, the leading consumer packaged vegetable oil brand, as well as Primor, Leve, and Salada. Further, we are a leading supplier of shortenings to the food processor market and also produce staple food products. 
In the United States and Canada, we offer food manufacturers, bakeries, confectionary, and food service operators high-quality solutions to fit their goals, such as delivering desired tastes and textures, or reducing saturated fats in their products. Our products include trans-fat free high-oleic canola oil, which is low in saturated fats, and high-oleic soybean oil, which is highly stable and trans-fat free. We have also developed proprietary fiber addition processes that allow bakery and food processor customers to achieve significant saturated fat reductions in shortenings. We also produce margarines and buttery spreads, including our leading Country Premium brand, for food service, food processor and retail private label customers. Additionally, we sell refined vegetable oils as feedstock to the growing renewable diesel sector.
In Europe, we are a leader in consumer packaged vegetable oils, which are sold in various geographies under brand names including Venusz, Floriol, Kujawski, Unisol, Kaliakra, Oleina, Oliwier, Komili and Kirlangic. We are also a leader in margarines, under brand names including Smakowita, Slynne, Maslo Rosline, Masmix, Optima, Finuu, Deli Reform, Keiju, Venusz, Evesol, Carlshamn and Voimix. Additionally, we produce a variety of products for the confectionery and bakery industries. We are also an oils supplier through Loders in the Western European food service channel.
In Asia, we offer a range of consumer products and offerings through Loders, including bakery, culinary, confectionary and infant nutrition products. In India, our consumer brands include Dalda, Ginni and Chambal edible oils; Dalda and Gagan vanaspatis; and Masterline professional bakery fats. In China, we offer consumer edible oils products under the Dou Wei Jia brand.

Milling Segment
Overview—We primarily sell our milling products to three customer types or market channels: food processors, food service companies, and retail outlets. The principal raw materials used in our milling businesses are wheat, corn, and other agricultural commodities sourced from our Agribusiness segment or directly from third parties. Similar to our refined and specialty oils business, we realize synergies among our other segments in areas such as raw material procurement, logistics, risk management and the co-location of industrial facilities, enabling us to supply customers with reliable, high quality products on a global basis. As many of the products we sell in our Milling segment are staple foods or ingredients, these businesses generally benefit from macro population and income growth rates. Additionally, our Milling segment is focused on capitalizing on growing global consumer food trends, including a desire for less processed, healthier foods, interest in new flavors, and increases in snacking and eating outside the home. 
Products—Our Milling segment activities include the production and sale of a variety of wheat flours and bakery mixes in Brazil, as well as corn-based products derived from both the dry and wet corn milling processes in the United States and Mexico. During 2021, we announced the sale of our wheat milling business in Mexico, which closed during the third quarter of 2022.
Our brands in Brazil include Suprema, Soberana, Primor and Predileta wheat flours, Gradina and Pre-Mescla bakery premixes and Ricca confectioner cream. Our corn milling products primarily consist of dry-milled corn meals and flours, flaking and brewers' grits, soy-fortified corn meal, corn-soy blends, and other similar products.

Non-core Segment
Sugar and Bioenergy Segment
Our Sugar and Bioenergy segment primarily comprises our 50% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia, our joint venture with BP, as well as minor ethanol distribution sales activity. BP Bunge Bioenergia operates on a stand-alone basis with a total of 11 mills located across the Southeast, North, and Midwest regions of Brazil. BP Bunge Bioenergia is the second largest operator by effective crushing capacity in the Brazilian sugarcane ethanol biofuel industry. We account for our interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting. Accordingly, our reported Sugar and Bioenergy results include our share of the net earnings in BP Bunge Bioenergia. While we are committed to supporting the growth and development of BP Bunge Bioenergia, our long-term goal is to seek strategic opportunities for our investment in the joint venture, hence the designation of such operations as Non-core.
The formation of BP Bunge Bioenergia combined our eight mills, the plantations we owned and managed, and related assets, together with BP’s sugar and bioenergy business in Brazil, which included three mills and related assets. BP Bunge Bioenergia's combined mills are supplied with sugarcane grown on approximately 460,000 hectares of land. In 2022, approximately 77% of the joint venture's total milled sugarcane came from plantations owned or managed by BP Bunge Bioenergia and 23% was purchased from third-party suppliers. These mills allow BP Bunge Bioenergia to produce sugar, ethanol and electricity, as further described below.
•Sugar-BP Bunge Bioenergia produces two types of sugar: very high polarity ("VHP") raw sugar and crystal sugar. VHP sugar is similar to the raw sugar traded on major commodities exchanges, including the standard NY11 contract, and is sold almost exclusively for export. Crystal sugar is a non-refined white sugar and is principally sold domestically in Brazil.
•Ethanol-BP Bunge Bioenergia produces and sells two types of ethanol: hydrous and anhydrous. Hydrous ethanol is consumed directly as a transport fuel, while anhydrous ethanol is blended with gasoline in transport fuels.
•Electricity-BP Bunge Bioenergia generates electricity from burning sugarcane bagasse in its mills.
The sugar produced at BP Bunge Bioenergia’s mills is sold in both the Brazilian domestic market, primarily in the confectionary and food processing industries, and export markets. The ethanol is sold primarily to customers for use in the Brazilian domestic market to meet demand for fuel, with sugar and ethanol also exported in the international market. BP Bunge Bioenergia competes with other sugar and ethanol producers both in Brazil and internationally, along with beet sugar processors and producers of other sweeteners and biofuels in the global market. Major competitors in Brazil include Cosan Limited/Raizen, São Martinho S.A. and Biosev ("Louis Dreyfus"). Major international competitors include British Sugar PLC, Südzucker AG, Cargill, Tereos S.A., Sucden S.A., ED&F Man Limited, and COFCO.
Risk Management
Risk management is a fundamental aspect of our business. We maintain an enterprise risk management program that is designed to support the achievement of our strategic objectives and enhance shareholder value. We regularly review our enterprise level risks, emerging risks and assess our risk tolerance levels and the effectiveness of our risk monitoring and risk management efforts. Our Board of Directors ("the Board") has established the Enterprise Risk Management Committee ("ERMC") to provide greater focus at the Board level on risk oversight of our major risks and each of our other Board committees considers risks within its area of responsibility. The primary risks that our company is subject to are discussed under the heading "Item 1A. Risk Factors" and we also describe our efforts to hedge and actively manage our market risks, including those associated with our positions in physical and derivative markets for agricultural commodities, energy, inland and ocean freight, foreign currency, and interest rates under the heading "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk."
Insurance
In each country in which we conduct business, our operations and assets are subject to varying degrees of risk and uncertainty. We financially insure our businesses and assets in each country in a manner that we deem appropriate for a company of our size and activities, including against certain risks associated with the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war, based on an analysis of the relative risks, costs, and market availability of insurance. We believe that our geographic dispersion of assets helps mitigate the risk to our business from an adverse event affecting a specific facility. However, if we were to incur a significant loss or liability for which we were not insured in full or in part, it could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Table of Contents

Operating Segments and Geographic Areas
We have included financial information about our reportable segments and our operations by geographic area in Note 29- Segment Information to our consolidated financial statements included as part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Research and Development, Innovation, Patents and Licenses
Our research and development activities are focused on developing products and improving processes that will drive growth or otherwise add value to our core business operations. In our refined and specialty oils and milling businesses, we have several research and development centers globally to support product development and enhancement. Additionally, Bunge Ventures, our corporate venture capital unit, invests in start-ups and other early-stage companies that are developing new technologies relevant to our industries. Additionally, we invest capital and human resources in digital innovations, aimed at using technology, data and analytics to improve how we perform our most important functions across our value chains, including origination, production, logistics, and customer experience. 
We own trademarks, patents, and licenses covering certain of our products and manufacturing processes. However, neither our business as a whole nor any segment is dependent on any specific trademark, patent, or license. 
Seasonality
In our Agribusiness segment, while there is a degree of seasonality in the growing season and procurement of our principal raw materials, such as oilseeds and grains, we typically do not experience material fluctuations in volume between the first and second half of the year, since we are geographically diversified between the northern and southern hemispheres, and we sell and distribute products throughout the year. However, the first quarter of the year has generally been our weakest in terms of financial results due to the timing of the North and South American oilseed harvests, as the North American harvest peaks in the third and fourth quarters, and the South American harvest peaks in the second quarter. Our North and South American grain merchandising and oilseed processing activities are, therefore, generally at lower levels during the first quarter.
In our Refined and Specialty Oils and Milling segments, demand for certain of our food items may be influenced by holidays and other annual events.
Government Regulation
In each of the countries in which we operate, we are subject to a variety of laws and regulations governing various aspects of our business, including general business regulations as well as those governing the manufacturing, production, handling, storage, transport, marketing, and sale of our products. These include laws and regulations relating to facility licensing and permitting, food, and feed safety, the handling and production of regulated substances, nutritional and labeling requirements, global trade compliance and other matters. Our operations and those of our suppliers are also subject to restrictions on land use in certain protected areas, forestry reserve requirements, limitations on water use, as well as other environmental regulations. Additionally, from time-to-time, agricultural production shortfalls in certain regions, and growing demand for agricultural commodities for feed, food, and fuel use have caused prices for relevant agricultural commodities to rise. High commodity prices and regional crop shortfalls have led, and in the future may lead, governments to impose price controls, tariffs, export restrictions and other measures designed to ensure adequate domestic supplies and/or mitigate price increases in their domestic markets, as well as increase the scrutiny of competitive conditions in their markets.
Many countries use and produce biofuels as alternatives to traditional fossil fuels. Biofuels convert crops, such as sugarcane, corn, soybeans, palm, rapeseed, canola, and other oilseeds, into ethanol, renewable diesel, or biodiesel to extend, enhance or substitute for fossil fuels. Production of biofuels has increased significantly in the last decade in response to both periods of high fossil fuel prices and to government incentives to produce biofuels offered in many countries, including the United States, Brazil, Argentina and several South-East Asian and European countries. Furthermore, in several countries, governmental authorities are mandating biofuel use in transport fuels at specified levels. As such, the markets for agricultural commodities used in the production of biofuels have become increasingly affected by the growth of the biofuels industry and related legislation.
We are subject to various environmental protection and occupational health and safety laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate, and we incur costs to comply with these requirements. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations relating to environmental matters has not had a material financial or competitive effect on our business. However, due to our extensive operations across multiple industries and jurisdictions globally, we are exposed to the risk of claims and liabilities under these laws and regulations. Violations can result in substantial fines, administrative sanctions, criminal penalties, revocations of operating permits and/or shutdowns of our facilities, litigation, other liabilities, as well as damage to our reputation.
Table of Contents

Our business could also be affected in the future by the regulation or taxation of greenhouse gas ("GHG") emissions or policies related to national emission reduction plans. A number of jurisdictions in which we operate have implemented or are in the process of implementing carbon pricing programs or regulations to reduce GHG emissions including, but not limited to, the Unites States, Canada, Mexico, the European Union and its member states, and China. For example, the Biden Administration has issued a series of executive orders and regulatory initiatives focused on climate change, including rejoining the Paris Climate Agreement, pursuant to which the Administration has announced a goal of reducing U.S. GHG emissions by one-half by 2030. Our operations located in countries with effective and applicable carbon pricing and regulatory programs currently meet related existing obligations with, at this time, no significant impact on our results of operations and competitive position. We regularly assess the potential impacts to our business resulting from regulation or policies aimed at reducing GHG emissions. Potential consequences could include increased energy, transportation and raw material costs, and additional investments to modify our facilities, equipment and processes. Although, at this time, it is not possible to estimate the likelihood of passage or predict the potential impact of any additional legislation, regulations or agreements, the effects of additional climate change regulatory initiatives could have a materially adverse impact on our business and results of operations. The scope of physical effects of climate change, including shifts in agricultural production areas and climatic volatility, is uncertain, but could in the long-term result in increased adverse incidents of weather-related events that cause disruptions to our operations and may ultimately result in stranded physical assets. We currently believe the breadth and diversification of our global asset network, as well as our participation in the global trade of agricultural commodities, will help to mitigate these risks. 
Additionally, in response to the ongoing Ukraine-Russia war, the United States, other North Atlantic Treaty Organization ("NATO") member states, as well as non-NATO member states, have announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia, certain Russian citizens, and Russian enterprises. Any continuation or escalation of the war may trigger a series of additional economic and other sanctions. On September 16, 2022, Bunge signed an agreement to sell its remaining Russian operations, primarily comprising an oilseed crushing and refining facility in Voronezh, southwest Russia, to Karen Vanetsyan. On February 3, 2023, the transaction closed in accordance with the terms of the agreement. We continued to operate our Russian oilseed crushing and refining facility in compliance with all legal requirements until the sale was completed. 
Sustainability
Bunge believes sustainability is critical to our business. While we have consistently incorporated environmental, social and governance ("ESG") factors into Bunge’s strategy and operations, we have intensified our efforts in light of new consumer trends, risks arising from factors such as climate change, and the emerging commercial opportunities in the low carbon market. We integrate ESG factors into nearly every area of our business, from how we evaluate new growth markets, plan and develop our strategic goals, compensate our employees and operate our facilities, to how we engage with our customers, suppliers, employees, communities, shareholders and other stakeholders. We encourage Bunge leadership around the globe to embrace sustainable decision-making across our value chains built on a foundation of ethical leadership, accountability and environmental stewardship. Our key areas of growth, comprising expansion of our oilseed processing and origination capabilities, production of renewable feedstocks, increasing our plant lipids portfolio and development of new plant-based protein ingredients, are not only core to our business strategy but also a testament to the alignment of sustainability with our corporate vision.
A key feature of our sustainability strategy is to leverage Bunge’s position in the value chain and its experience delivering sustainable solutions to stakeholders in order to collaboratively promote industry-wide transformation. Bunge has been a founder and active member of leading industry associations and platforms to find practical solutions to certain sustainability challenges, such as climate change, land use change, human rights and biodiversity. We are committed to eliminating native vegetation conversion associated with agricultural commodity production and trade in 2025 – a commitment that was established in 2015 and serves as a guide for sector alignment. We intend to build on our shared efforts, working with governments, farmers, and other key stakeholders in our supply chains, to identify opportunities for public-private collaboration focused on eliminating commodity-driven deforestation. 
Bunge’s public reporting on ESG conforms with internationally recognized frameworks and standards, the details of which are captured in the annual corporate sustainability reports published in the first half of each year. The 2023 sustainability report will contain further information on Bunge’s ESG strategy, performance, and other disclosures. The sustainability reports are not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report.
Governance
Sustainability considerations, including climate change, deforestation and native vegetation conversion, water use, biodiversity, human rights, social development, stakeholder engagement, and more, are embedded across the functions of multiple committees of Bunge’s Board of Directors.
The Sustainability and Corporate Responsibility Committee ("SCRC") of the Board oversees sustainability strategy at Bunge. The SCRC meets on a regular basis and is tasked with oversight of governance, policies, strategies and programs related to a comprehensive set of sustainability and corporate social responsibility factors that support the sustainable growth of the Company, including, but not limited to, climate change, environmental matters, human rights, social development, risk 
Table of Contents

management, external trends, external stakeholder engagement, philanthropy, and reporting and disclosure. Additionally, the ERMC of the Board periodically evaluates climate related risks and opportunities in connection with its oversight of enterprise risks and risk mitigation strategies. The Audit Committee periodically evaluates applicable trends, risks, and developments in non-financial reporting practices and requirements that may impact the Company’s regulatory filings, including ESG-related disclosures. The Human Resources and Compensation Committee ("HRCC") oversees the establishment of sustainability linked performance goals for our executives and workforce. 
The sustainability function is executed by the Chief Sustainability Officer ("CSO"), who reports to our Chief Executive Officer ("CEO"). The CSO leads a global team operating across multiple geographies and functions that regularly engage business leadership to ensure company-wide alignment with sustainability objectives and opportunities.
Strategy
We leverage our leadership, extensive knowledge of the industry, and our deeply rooted relationships with customers at both ends of the value chain to address the sustainability challenges facing the food, feed, and fuel supply chains in which we operate. We intend to address those challenges by, among other things, connecting farmers and our end customers as they seek to establish common approaches to overcome shared sustainability challenges. For example, Bunge is actively engaged in supplying low carbon feedstock for renewable fuels, sourcing and supplying grains planted under regenerative agricultural practices, and supplying certified and verified deforestation-free grains and by-products, among other initiatives. These business objectives are a natural extension of our sustainability efforts and have been partly developed by applying a “climate lens” to our strategic decision-making.
We report on our sustainability strategy, goals and performance across three core pillars:
•    Action on Climate—We implement innovative solutions designed to minimize our environmental footprint and support projects and activities that strengthen our approach to fighting climate change. This pillar includes publication of Bunge’s progress on meeting its GHG reduction targets, which were validated by the Science Based Targets Initiative ("SBTi") in 2021, as discussed further below.
•    Responsible Supply Chains—We promote sustainable agriculture and implement projects that are designed to protect and improve the environment while supporting the social and economic well-being of growers and local communities. Within this pillar, we publish progress on our commitment to eliminate deforestation and native vegetation conversion in our supply chains in 2025, our compliance with human rights obligations, and our engagement with farmers to promote sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices. 
•    Accountability—We aim to be an accountable leader within our industry, helping to raise the bar on our sector’s performance by regularly tracking and disclosing progress on our commitments and sustainability performance. Our accountability pillar includes Bunge’s review and oversight of human capital management, diversity, equity and inclusion, corporate contributions, volunteerism, and others.
Risk Management
In 2021, Bunge began implementing enhancements to its enterprise risk management ("ERM") framework by incorporating more detailed sustainability risks and opportunities into the ERM process. These include risks emanating from changing climate and weather patterns, water scarcity, deforestation, human rights, farmer productivity, and increasing taxation and regulation on GHG emissions. This process was further enhanced in 2022 by adding risk factors into the ERM framework. The ERM process provides Bunge with greater oversight and management of climate-related risks and the potential financial implications, and will help ensure continued short-, medium- and long-term resilience. 
Climate risks are overseen at the Board of Directors level by the ERMC, which has responsibility for supervising the quality and integrity of our risk management practices. Enterprise risk management is overseen at the executive level by the Chief Risk Officer, who reports to our CEO, with input from relevant teams and functions.
Metrics and Targets
When setting public commitments, particularly quantifiable targets on GHG emissions and related measures, Bunge’s leadership and employees regularly engage with stakeholders, review market and consumer trends, and consider business risks and opportunities. Where feasible, Bunge also engages in sector-wide discussions to align with value chain partners so that metrics and targets are aligned for maximum impact and transformation. 
Bunge established Science Based Targets ("SBTs") in 2021, which were verified by the SBTi and cover absolute reductions in GHG emissions across all three Scopes. From a 2020 baseline to a 2030 deadline, the targets call for:
•Scopes 1 & 2 - Absolute reduction of 25%
•Scope 3 - Absolute reduction of 12.3%

Due to the nature of Bunge’s business and operations, the vast majority of GHG emissions are found within the value chain (Scope 3), particularly upstream sources. Therefore, a substantial portion of Bunge’s emissions reduction will be achieved by meeting the Company’s 2025 non-deforestation commitment. Additional emissions reduction activities to meet the SBTs include enhancements to the Company’s plants, procurement of zero- or low-carbon electricity sources, and the uptake of certified products and regenerative farming practices. 
Additional metrics and targets include intensity reductions by 2026 from a 2016 baseline for water (10% overall and 25% for facilities located in areas of high water stress), waste (10% disposal), and energy (10% consumption).

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1. NATURE OF BUSINESS, BASIS OF PRESENTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Description of Business—Bunge Limited, a Bermuda company, together with its consolidated subsidiaries and variable interest entities ("VIEs") in which it is considered the primary beneficiary, through which its businesses are conducted (collectively "Bunge" or "the Company"), is a leading global agribusiness and food company. Bunge's common shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol "BG." Bunge operates in four reportable segments: Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, Milling, and Sugar and Bioenergy. 
Corporate and Other includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to the Company’s individual reporting segments because the operating performance of such reporting segments is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including Bunge Ventures, the Company's captive insurance program, accounts receivable securitization activities, and certain income tax assets and liabilities.
Agribusiness—Bunge's Agribusiness segment is an integrated, global business involved in the purchase, storage, transport, processing, and sale of agricultural commodities and commodity products. Bunge's agribusiness operations and assets are located in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific with merchandising and distribution offices throughout the world.
Bunge's Agribusiness segment also participates in related financial activities, such as offering trade structured finance, which leverages its international trade flows, providing risk management services to customers by assisting them with managing price exposure to agricultural commodities, foreign exchange, and other financial instruments.
Refined and Specialty Oils —Bunge's Refined and Specialty Oils segment produces and sells edible oil products, such as packaged and bulk oils and fats, shortenings, margarine, mayonnaise, and other products derived from the vegetable oil refining process, including renewable diesel feedstocks, and refines and fractionates palm oil, palm kernel oil, coconut oil, and shea butter. Bunge's refined and specialty oils operations are located in North America, South America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Africa.
Milling —Bunge's Milling segment primarily comprises wheat and corn milling businesses that purchase wheat and corn directly from farmers and dealers and process them into milled products for food processors, bakeries, brewers, snack food producers, and other customers. Due to the completion of the sale of Bunge's Mexican wheat milling business during the third quarter of 2022, Bunge's wheat milling activities are now primarily located in Brazil. Corn milling activities are primarily located in the United States and Mexico. See Note 3- Acquisitions and Dispositions for additional information on the closed sale of Bunge's Mexican wheat milling activities.
Sugar and Bioenergy—Bunge's Sugar and Bioenergy segment primarily consists of the Company's 50% ownership interest in the net earnings of BP Bunge Bioenergia, a joint venture with BP p.l.c. ("BP"). The joint venture is a leading company in the ethanol, biopower, and sugar market in Brazil. BP Bunge Bioenergia operates on a stand-alone basis with a total of 11 mills located across the Southeast, North, and Midwest regions of Brazil. Bunge accounts for its interest in the joint venture under the equity method of accounting.
On November 28, 2022 and September 4, 2022, Argentina’s government published Emergency Decrees 787/2022, Programa de Incremento Exportador and 576/2022, Programa de Incremento Exportador, respectively, (the "Export Programs"), aimed at boosting farmer selling, and in turn soybean exports. The Export Programs introduced a new preferential U.S. dollar to Argentinian peso foreign exchange rate, available exclusively during the period between November 28 and December 30, 2022 and September 5 and September 30, 2022, respectively, payable to Argentinian farmers on qualifying Argentinian peso denominated sales of soybeans. Purchasers of the qualifying soybeans, including Bunge, received the same preferential rate on U.S. dollar funds placed onshore in Argentina and converted to Argentinian peso to fund soybean purchases.
Bunge is both a receiver of the preferential exchange rate for cash converted to Argentinian peso, as well as a payer of the same preferential rate on purchases of soybeans from farmers and related export duties. Transactions and monetary balances related to the Export Programs were accounted for at the preferential rate. The net impact of the Export Programs on Bunge's consolidated statements of income was not material.
On August 1, 2022, Bayer AG (FRA: BAYN) acquired a 65% controlling interest in CoverCress Inc. ("CCI"), a Bunge Ventures portfolio company that has developed a novel low carbon-intensity winter oilseed crop called CoverCress™, by 
F-11


BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

purchasing all equity interests in CCI other than those held by Bunge Ventures and Chevron USA, Inc., a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation ("Chevron", NYSE: CVX).
As a result of the transaction, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded an $18 million unrealized gain on its remaining 21.93% ownership interest in CCI within Other (expense) income – net in the Company’s consolidated statements of income. Additionally, the Company reclassified its $44 million investment in CCI from long-term investments, within Other non-current assets, to Investments in affiliates in the consolidated balance sheet. The above mentioned unrealized gain is recorded within Corporate and Other activities. Upon recognition of CCI in Investments in affiliates in the consolidated balance sheet, CCI is now recorded within the Agribusiness segment. 
 On May 1, 2022, Bunge completed a transaction with Chevron to create a joint venture, Bunge Chevron Ag Renewables LLC (the "Joint Venture"), leveraging Bunge’s expertise in oilseed processing and farmer relationships, and Chevron’s expertise in fuels manufacturing and marketing, to help meet the demand for renewable fuels and to develop lower carbon intensity feedstock. Bunge has a 50% ownership interest in the Joint Venture. Bunge contributed certain property, plant, and equipment related to two of its soybean processing facilities to the Joint Venture, with a fair value totaling approximately $521 million, and Chevron contributed an approximately equal value of cash and working capital. Bunge has also committed to undertake certain capital improvements on the soybean processing facilities contributed to the Joint Venture, up to an estimated $80 million, at which point Chevron will contribute an additional equivalent amount in cash. Under the terms of the Joint Venture's agreements, Bunge will operate the Joint Venture’s facilities, and Chevron will have purchase rights for oil produced by the Joint Venture for use as a renewable feedstock to manufacture low lifecycle carbon intensity transportation fuels. See Note 12- Investments in Affiliates and Variable Interest Entities for further accounting considerations related to this transaction. 
Basis of Presentation—The consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America ("U.S. GAAP"). The accounting policies used to prepare these financial statements are the same as those used to prepare the consolidated financial statements in prior years, except as described in these notes or for the adoption of new standards as outlined below.
Principles of Consolidation—The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Bunge, its subsidiaries and VIEs in which Bunge is considered to be the primary beneficiary and, as a result, include the assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses of all entities over which Bunge exercises control. Equity investments in which Bunge has the ability to exercise significant influence but does not have a controlling financial interest are accounted for by the equity method of accounting. Investments in which Bunge does not exercise significant influence are accounted for at cost, or fair value if readily determinable. Intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated. An enterprise is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it has a controlling financial interest, defined as (a) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the economics of the VIE and (b) the obligation to absorb losses of or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE's operations. Performance of that analysis requires the exercise of judgment. The primary beneficiary analysis must be continually reassessed and requires the exercise of judgement. VIE assessments are revisited upon the occurrence of relevant reconsideration events. 
Noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries related to Bunge's ownership interests of less than 100% are reported as Noncontrolling interests or Redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance sheets. The noncontrolling ownership interests in Bunge's earnings, net of tax, is reported as Net (income) attributable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statements of income.
Reclassifications—Effective July 1, 2021, the Company changed its reporting of certain income tax assets and liabilities to report such assets and liabilities within Corporate and Other rather than within its reportable segments, as further described in Note 29- Segment Information. Corresponding prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
Effective January 1, 2021, the Company changed its segment reporting to align with its new value chain operational structure, as further described in Note 29- Segment Information. Corresponding prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation.
Use of Estimates—The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires Bunge to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.
F-12


BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Offsetting—In the normal course of its operations the Company routinely enters into transactions resulting in the recognition of assets and liabilities stemming from unconditional obligations, for example trade receivables and trade payables, or conditional obligations, for example unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts at fair value, with the same counterparty. The Company generally records all such assets and liabilities on a gross basis, even when they are subject to master netting agreements.
However, the Company also engages in various trade structured finance activities to leverage the value of its global trade flows. These activities include programs under which Bunge generally obtains U.S. dollar-denominated letters of credit ("LCs") from financial institutions, each based on an underlying commodity trade flow, and time deposits denominated in either the local currency of the financial institutions' counterparties or in U.S. dollars, as well as foreign exchange forward contracts and other programs in which trade related payables are set-off against receivables, when all related assets and liabilities are subject to legally enforceable set-off agreements and the criteria of ASC 210-20, Offsetting, has been met. Cash inflows are offset by the related cash outflows resulting from placement of the time deposits and repayment of the LCs. All cash flows related to the programs are included in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Translation of Foreign Currency Financial Statements—Bunge's reporting currency is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency of the majority of Bunge's foreign subsidiaries is their local currency. As such, amounts included in the consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and changes in equity are translated using average exchange rates during each period. Assets and liabilities are translated at period-end exchange rates and resulting foreign currency translation adjustments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. However, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, if a foreign entity's economy is determined to be highly inflationary, then the foreign entity's financial statements are remeasured as if the functional currency were the reporting currency.
Bunge has operations in Turkey, which until March 31, 2022, used the official exchange rate published by the Turkish government to translate the Company's commercial transactions and for financial statement re-measurement purposes. Over the last several years, Turkey has experienced negative economic trends, as evidenced by multiple periods of increasing inflation rates, depreciation of the Turkish lira, and increasing borrowing rates, which have required the Turkish government to take mitigating actions. During the first quarter of 2022, Turkey became a highly inflationary economy as defined under U.S. GAAP. As a result, effective April 1, 2022, the financial statements of Bunge's Turkish subsidiary have been remeasured using the reporting currency, the U.S. dollar, rather than the Turkish lira. This change has not had a material impact on Bunge's consolidated financial statements.
Foreign Currency Transactions—Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are remeasured into their respective functional currencies at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. The resulting exchange gain or loss is included in Bunge's consolidated statements of income as Foreign exchange (losses) gains - net unless the remeasurement gain or loss relates to an intercompany transaction that is of a long-term investment nature and for which settlement is neither planned nor anticipated in the foreseeable future, in which case the remeasurement gain or loss is reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in Bunge's consolidated balance sheets.
Cash, Cash Equivalents, Restricted Cash, and Cash held for sale—Cash and cash equivalents include time deposits and readily marketable securities with original maturity dates of three months or less at the time of acquisition. Restricted cash is included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the consolidated statement of cash flows. The following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, and cash and cash equivalents in Assets held for sale reported within the consolidated balance sheets to the total of the same such amounts shown in the consolidated statements of cash flows.

(US$ in millions) | 2022 | 2021 | 2020
Cash and cash equivalents | $ | 1,104 | | $ | 902 | | $ | 352

Cash and cash equivalents in Assets held for sale | $ | 22 | | — | | — | 
Total | $ | 1,152 | | $ | 905 | | $ | 381

Trade Accounts Receivable—Trade accounts receivable is stated at historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. Bunge establishes allowances for uncollectible trade accounts receivable based on 
F-13


BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

lifetime expected credit losses using an aging schedule for each pool of trade accounts receivable. Pools are determined based on risk characteristics such as the type of customer and geography. A default rate is derived using a provision matrix with data based on Bunge's historical receivables information. The default rate is then applied to the pool to determine the allowance for expected credit losses. Given the short-term nature of the Company's trade accounts receivable, the default rate is only adjusted if significant changes in the credit profile of the portfolio are identified (e.g., poor crop years, credit issues at the country level, systematic risk), resulting in historic loss rates that are not representative of forecasted losses. Uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount that is less than the outstanding historical balance or when the Company has determined that collection of the balance is unlikely.
Specifically, in establishing appropriate default rates as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, the Company took into consideration expected impacts on its customers and other debtors in view of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors, which did not result in a material impact on the financial statements. 
Bunge records and reports accrued interest receivable within the same line item as the related trade accounts receivable. The allowance for expected credit losses is estimated on the amortized cost basis of the trade accounts receivable, including accrued interest receivable. Bunge recognizes credit loss expense when establishing an allowance for accrued interest receivable.
Secured Advances to Suppliers—Secured advances to suppliers are stated at historical carrying amounts net of write-offs and allowances for uncollectible accounts. Secured advances to suppliers are expected to be settled through delivery of non-cash assets and as such, allowances are established when collection is not probable. Bunge establishes an allowance for secured advances to suppliers, generally farmers and resellers of grain, based on historical experience, farming economics and other market conditions, as well as specific supplier collection issues. Uncollectible accounts are written off when a settlement is reached for an amount below the outstanding historical balance or when Bunge has determined that collection is unlikely.
Secured advances to suppliers bear interest at contractual rates that reflect current market interest rates at the time of the transaction. There are no deferred fees or costs associated with these receivables. As a result, there are no imputed interest amounts to be amortized under the interest method. Interest income is calculated based on the terms of the individual agreements and is recognized on an accrual basis.
Bunge follows accounting guidance on the disclosure of the credit quality of financing receivables and the allowance for credit losses, which requires information to be disclosed at disaggregated levels, defined as portfolio segments and classes. Under this guidance, a class of receivables is considered impaired, based on current information and events, if Bunge determines it probable that all amounts due under the original terms of the receivable will not be collected. Recognition of interest income is suspended once the borrower defaults on the originally scheduled delivery of agricultural commodities as the collection of future income is determined not to be probable. No additional interest income is accrued from the point of default until ultimate recovery, at which time amounts collected are credited first against the receivable and then to any unrecognized interest income.
Inventories—Readily marketable inventories ("RMI") are agricultural commodity inventories, including soybeans, soybean meal, soybean oil, corn, and wheat that are readily convertible to cash because of their commodity characteristics, widely available markets, and international pricing mechanisms. All of Bunge's RMI are recorded at fair value. These agricultural commodity inventories have quoted prices in active markets, may be sold without significant further processing, and have predictable and insignificant disposal costs. Changes in the fair values of RMI are recognized in earnings as a component of Cost of goods sold.
Inventories other than RMI are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value by inventory product class. Cost is determined primarily using the weighted-average cost method.
Fair Value Measurements—Bunge determines fair value based on the price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. Bunge determines the fair values of its RMI, derivatives, and certain other assets based on the fair value hierarchy, which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs are inputs based on market data obtained from sources independent of Bunge that reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Unobservable inputs are inputs that are developed based on the best information available in circumstances that reflect Bunge's own assumptions based on market data and on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. The fair value standard describes three levels within its hierarchy that may be used to measure fair value:
F-14


BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)


Level | Description | Financial Instrument (Assets / Liabilities) 
Level 1 | Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. | Exchange traded derivative contracts.Marketable securities in active markets. 
Level 2 | Observable inputs, including adjusted Level 1 quotes, quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are less active than traded exchanges and other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities. | Exchange traded derivative contracts (less liquid market).Readily marketable inventories. Over-the-counter (‘‘OTC’’) commodity purchase and sale contracts. OTC derivatives whose value is determined using pricing models with inputs that are generally based on exchange traded prices, adjusted for location specific inputs that are primarily observable in the market or can be derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data.Marketable securities in less active markets.
Level 3 | Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are a significant component of the fair value of the assets or liabilities. | Assets and liabilities whose value is determined using proprietary pricing models, discounted cash flow methodologies or similar techniques. Assets and liabilities for which the determination of fair value requires significant management judgment or estimation. 

Based on historical experience with Bunge’s suppliers and customers, Bunge’s own credit risk, and knowledge of current market conditions, Bunge does not view nonperformance risk to be a significant input to fair value for the majority of its forward commodity purchase and sale contracts.
In many cases, a valuation technique used to measure fair value includes inputs from multiple levels of the fair value hierarchy. The lowest level of input that is a significant component of the fair value measurement determines the placement of the entire fair value measurement in the hierarchy. Bunge’s assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment and may affect the classification of fair value assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy levels.
Bunge’s policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels, including both transfers into and transfers out of Level 3, is to measure and record the transfers at the end of the reporting period.
The majority of Bunge's exchange-traded agricultural commodity futures are settled daily, generally through its clearing subsidiary, and therefore such futures are not included in the assets and liabilities that are accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis.
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities—Bunge enters into derivative instruments to manage its exposure to movements associated with agricultural commodity prices, transportation costs, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and energy costs. Bunge's use of these instruments is generally intended to mitigate exposure to market variables (see Note 17- Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities). Additionally, commodity contracts relating to forward sales of commodities in the Company’s Agribusiness segment, including soybeans, soybean meal and oil, corn, and wheat, are accounted for as derivatives at fair value under ASC 815 (see Revenue Recognition below).
Generally, derivative instruments are recorded at fair value in Other current assets or Other current liabilities in Bunge's consolidated balance sheets. For derivatives designated as hedges, Bunge assesses at the inception of the hedge whether any such derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the hedged items and, on an ongoing basis, qualitatively monitors whether that assertion is still met. The changes in fair values of derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, along with the gains or losses on the related hedged items are recorded in earnings in the consolidated statements of income in the same caption as the hedged items. The changes in fair values of derivative instruments that are designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and are reclassified to earnings when the hedged cash flows affect earnings or when the hedge is no longer considered to be effective. In addition, Bunge may designate certain derivative instruments and non-derivative instruments as net investment hedges to hedge the exposure associated with its equity investments in foreign operations. When using forward derivative contracts as hedging instruments in a net investment hedge, all changes in the fair value of the derivative are recorded as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Marketable Securities and Other Short-Term Investments—Bunge classifies its marketable debt securities and short-term investments as available-for-sale, held-to-maturity, or held-for-trading. Available-for-sale debt securities are reported at fair value with unrealized gains (losses) included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Held-to-maturity debt investments represent financial assets in which Bunge has the intent and ability to hold to maturity and are reported at amortized cost. Debt trading securities and all equity securities are recorded at fair value and are bought and held principally for selling them in the near term and therefore held for only a short period of time, with all gains (losses) included in Net income. Bunge monitors its held-to-maturity investments for impairment periodically and recognizes an impairment charge when the decline in fair value of an investment is judged to be other than temporary.
Recoverable Taxes—Recoverable taxes include value-added taxes paid upon the acquisition of raw materials and taxable services and other transactional taxes, which can be recovered in cash or as compensation against income taxes or other taxes owed by Bunge, primarily in Brazil and Europe. These recoverable tax payments are included in Other current assets or Other non-current assets based on their expected realization. In cases where Bunge determines that recovery is doubtful, recoverable taxes are reduced by allowances for the estimated unrecoverable amounts.
Property, Plant and Equipment, Net—Property, plant and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Major improvements that extend either the life, capacity, efficiency, or improve the safety of an asset are capitalized, while maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred. Costs related to legal obligations associated with the future retirement of capitalized assets are capitalized as part of the cost of the related asset. Bunge capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred during the application development stage. Interest costs on borrowings during construction/completion periods of major capital projects are also capitalized.
Depreciation is computed based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Estimated useful lives for property, plant and equipment are as follows:

 | Years 
Buildings | 10 - 50
Machinery and equipment | 7 - 25 
Furniture, fixtures and other | 3 - 20 

Goodwill—Goodwill represents the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired in a business acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually for impairment, or between annual tests if events or circumstances indicate potential impairment. Bunge's annual impairment testing is generally performed during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year.
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which has been determined to be the Company's operating segments or one level below the operating segments in certain instances (see Note 9- Goodwill).
Other Intangible Assets—Finite-lived intangible assets primarily include trademarks, customer relationships and lists, port facility usage rights, and patents that are amortized on a straight-line basis over their contractual or legal lives, or their estimated useful lives where such lives are not determined by law or contract (see Note 10- Other Intangible Assets).
Impairment of Property, Plant and Equipment and Finite-Lived Intangible Assets—Bunge reviews its property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Bunge bases its evaluation of recoverability on such indicators as the nature, future economic benefits, and geographic locations of the assets, historical or future profitability measures, and other external market conditions. If these indicators result in the expected non-recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group, Bunge evaluates potential impairment using undiscounted estimated future cash flows. If such undiscounted future cash flows during the asset's remaining useful life are below the asset's carrying value, a loss is recognized for the shortfall, measured by the present value of the estimated future cash flows or by third-party appraisals. Bunge records impairments related to property, plant and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets used in the processing of its products in Cost of goods sold in its consolidated statements of income. Any impairment of marketing or brand assets is recognized in Selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income (see Note 11- Impairments).
Property, plant and equipment and other finite-lived intangible assets to be sold or otherwise disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.

Investments in Affiliates—Bunge has investments in various unconsolidated joint ventures accounted for using the equity method, minus impairment. Bunge reviews its investments annually or when an event or circumstances indicate that a potential decline in value may be other than temporary. Bunge considers various factors in determining whether to recognize an impairment charge, including the length of time the fair value of the investment is expected to be below its carrying value, the financial condition, operating performance and near-term prospects of the affiliate, and Bunge's intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of the fair value (see Note 11- Impairments and Note 12- Investments in Affiliates and Variable Interest Entities).
Revenue Recognition—The Company’s revenue comprises sales from commodity contracts that are accounted for under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (ASC 815), and sales of other products and services that are accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (ASC 606). Additional information about the Company’s revenues can be found in Note 29- Segment Information.
Revenue from commodity contracts (ASC 815)—Revenue from commodity contracts primarily relates to forward sales of commodities such as soybeans, soybean meal and oil, corn, and wheat accounted for as derivatives at fair value under ASC 815, primarily in the Company’s Agribusiness segment. These forward sales meet the definition of a derivative under ASC 815 as they have an underlying (e.g. the price of soybeans), a notional amount (e.g. metric tons), no initial net investment, and can be net settled since the commodity is readily convertible to cash. Bunge generally does not apply the normal purchase and normal sale exception available under ASC 815 to these contracts. Certain of the Company’s sales in its Refined and Specialty Oils and Milling segments also qualify as derivatives, primarily sales of commodities like bulk soybean and canola oil.
Revenue from commodity contracts is recognized in Net sales for the contracted amount when the contracts are settled at a point in time by transferring control of the commodity to the customer, similarly to revenue recognized from contracts with customers under ASC 606. From inception through settlement, these forward sales arrangements are recorded at fair value under ASC 815 with unrealized gains and losses recognized in Cost of goods sold and carried on the consolidated balance sheets as current assets (see Note 7- Other Current Assets) or current liabilities (see Note 14- Other Current Liabilities), respectively. Further information about the fair value of these contracts is presented in Note 16- Fair Value Measurements.   
Revenue from contracts with customers (ASC 606)—Revenue from contracts with customers accounted for under ASC 606 is primarily generated in the Company's Refined and Specialty Oils and Milling segments through the sale of refined edible oil-based products such as packaged vegetable oils, shortenings, margarines, and mayonnaise; milled grain products such as wheat flours, bakery mixes, and corn-based products; and fertilizer products. These sales are accounted for under ASC 606 as these sales arrangements do not meet the criteria to be considered derivatives under ASC 815. These revenues are measured based on consideration specified in a contract with a customer and exclude sales taxes, discounts related to promotional programs, and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. The Company recognizes revenue from these contracts at a point in time when it satisfies a performance obligation by transferring control of a product to a customer, generally when legal title and risks and rewards transfer to the customer. Sales terms provide for transfer of title either at the time and point of shipment or at the time and point of delivery and acceptance of the product being sold. In contracts that do not specify the timing of transfer of legal title or transfer of significant risks and rewards of ownership, judgment is required in determining the timing of transfer of control. In such cases, the Company considers standard business practices and the relevant laws and regulations applicable to the transaction to determine when legal title or the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred. 
The transaction price is generally allocated to performance obligations on a relative standalone selling price basis. Standalone selling prices are estimated based on observable data of the Company’s sales of such products and services to similar customers and in similar circumstances on a standalone basis. In assessing whether to allocate variable consideration to a specific part of the contract, the Company considers the nature of the variable payment and whether it relates specifically to its efforts to satisfy a specific part of the contract. Variable consideration is generally known upon satisfaction of the performance obligation.
Taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue producing transaction, that are collected by the Company from a customer, are excluded from revenue. 
Shipping and handling costs associated with outbound freight after control over a product has transferred to a customer are accounted for as a fulfillment cost and are included in Cost of goods sold.
Warranties provided to customers are primarily assurance-type warranties on the fitness of purpose and merchantability of the Company’s goods and services. The Company does not provide service-type warranties to customers.

BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Payment is generally due at the time of shipment or delivery, or within a specified time frame after shipment or delivery, which is generally 30-60 days. The Company’s contracts generally provide customers the right to reject any products that do not meet agreed quality specifications. Product returns and refunds are not material.
Additionally, the Company recognizes revenue in the Agribusiness segment from ocean freight and port services over time, as the related services are performed. Performance obligations are typically completed within a fiscal quarter and any unearned revenue or accrued revenues are not material.
Share-Based Compensation—Bunge maintains equity incentive plans for its employees and non-employee directors (see Note 27- Share-based Compensation). Bunge accounts for share-based compensation based on the grant date fair value. Share-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
Income Taxes—Income tax expenses and benefits are recognized based on the tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which Bunge's subsidiaries operate. Under Bermuda law, Bunge is not required to pay taxes in Bermuda on either income or capital gains. The provision for income taxes includes income taxes currently payable and deferred income taxes resulting from temporary differences between the carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities in Bunge's consolidated financial statements and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by valuation allowances if current evidence indicates that it is not "more likely than not" that the deferred tax asset will be realized. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in Income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income (see Note 15- Income Taxes).
Research and Development—Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and development expenses were $33 million, $33 million, and $24 million for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
Governmental Assistance—Government grants are accounted for by analogy to International Accounting Standard 20, Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure of Government Assistance, and are recognized at fair value when there is reasonable assurance that the established conditions will be met and the benefit will be received. Benefits are recognized either as a reduction of taxes payable or a credit in earnings.
Bunge qualifies for business incentives from governmental entities at various localities in which the Company operates. These programs primarily consist of tax incentives and cash grants designed to promote regional social and economic development or to incentivize production of clean energy.
Regional social and economic development—Bunge receives tax credits from foreign state governments on the sale of eligible products. The program is valid through 2032 and contains recapture features if Bunge fails to meet program requirements, including job creation and production levels. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Bunge recorded program tax credits of $205 million in Net sales in the consolidated statement of income. At December 31, 2022, Bunge has recognized a $17 million reduction to Other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet related to benefits not yet realized.
Clean energy—Bunge receives cash grants from a governmental agency from the sale of clean energy. The program is valid through 2032 and contains recapture features if the Company does not follow program production efficiency requirements. For the year ended December 31, 2022, Bunge recorded program related cash grants of $19 million in Cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of income. At December 31, 2022, Bunge has recognized a $10 million reduction to Trade accounts payable in the consolidated balance sheet related to benefits not yet realized.
Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements
On January 1, 2022, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update ("ASU") 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 832) - Disclosures by Business Entities About Government Assistance, which requires annual disclosures for transactions with a government authority that are accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy. The guidance is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. This guidance is applied prospectively to all transactions within the scope of the standard that are reflected in financial statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are entered into after the date of initial application. See above for further details related to the adoption of this guidance.

On January 1, 2022, the Company adopted ASU 2020-06, Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40), which simplifies the accounting for convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. The guidance also addresses how convertible instruments are accounted for in the diluted earnings per share calculation and requires enhanced disclosures about the terms of convertible instruments and contracts in an entity’s own equity. This guidance will be applied prospectively to modifications or exchanges occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on Bunge's consolidated financial statements.    
In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848) - Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting, with subsequent updates through ASU 2021-01, which collectively provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the U.S. GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting, to ease the financial reporting burden related to the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. The guidance was effective upon issuance. 
In March 2021, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority ("FCA"), responsible for regulating LIBOR, announced that most LIBOR settings would be discontinued after December 31, 2021, except for certain USD LIBOR settings, which will continue through June 30, 2023. In September 2021, the FCA further announced that it will require the LIBOR benchmark administrator to publish sterling and Japanese yen LIBOR settings under a synthetic methodology based on term risk-free rates for the duration of 2022. These synthetic LIBOR settings will be available only for use in legacy contracts and are not for use in new business.
In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-06, Deferral of the Sunset Date of Topic 848, to ensure the relief in Topic 848 covers the period of time during which a significant number of modifications may take place. The ASU defers the sunset date of Topic 848 from December 31, 2022, to December 31, 2024, after which entities will no longer be permitted to apply the relief in Topic 848. The Company is applying this guidance prospectively to all eligible contract modifications through December 31, 2024. 
Bunge has utilized the relief provided by Topic 848 to ensure financial reporting results reflect the intended continuation of such contracts and arrangements during the period of the market-wide transition to alternative reference rates. The expedients allow an eligible modified contract to be accounted for and presented as a continuation of the existing contract.
The Company has identified its LIBOR-based contracts that have been, or will be, impacted by the cessation of LIBOR. The Company has actively worked with counterparties to incorporate fallback language in negotiated contracts, in addition to incorporating non-LIBOR reference rate and fallback language, when applicable, in new contracts. The modification of contracts is substantially complete. As of December 31, 2022, the adoption of this guidance has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on Bunge's consolidated financial statements.

2.    UKRAINE-RUSSIA WAR
On February 24, 2022, Russia initiated a military invasion of Ukraine (the "war"). Ukraine forms part of a key international grain originating region and is also the world’s largest supplier of sunflower seed and sunflower oil; commodities that cannot be completely replaced from other origins. The scope, intensity, duration and outcome of the ongoing war is uncertain, and any continuation or escalation of the war may have a material adverse effect on Bunge, including its Ukrainian and Russian operations. Further details concerning the impact of the war and its corresponding accounting considerations relating to Bunge's Ukrainian and Russian operations are provided below. 
Ukraine
Bunge's Ukrainian operations comprise two oilseed crushing facilities, located in Mykolaiv and Dnipropetrovsk, a grain export terminal in the Mykolaiv commercial seaport, numerous grain elevators, and an office in Kiev. The Company also operates a corn milling facility in Ukraine via a joint venture. Bunge currently maintains control over all of its material operations and facilities in Ukraine. 
As of the date of this report, no material damage has been noted at any of Bunge's Ukrainian facilities, including its Mykolaiv port facility, which sustained minor shelling damage earlier in the year. However, due to safety concerns, it is not always possible to conduct onsite physical inspections of all of the Company's Ukrainian facilities. 
Immediately after the start of the invasion, Bunge temporarily idled its Ukrainian operations. However, Bunge has subsequently restarted certain commercial and operational activities in Ukraine, including oilseed crushing, refining, and bottling activities at its Dnipropetrovsk facility, as well as certain exports from Ukraine, including via the Black Sea from three Ukrainian ports (Pivdennyi/Yuzhnvi, Odesa, and Chornomorsk; the "POC corridor"), under an agreement between Ukraine and Russia, brokered by the United Nations and Turkey. Although operations in Ukraine have steadily increased during recent months, they remain limited and are subject to Bunge's ability to perform activities safely as well as its access to adequate supplies of energy. Furthermore, Bunge's ability to continue these activities indefinitely is unknown.
The Company’s Ukrainian operations employ approximately 1,000 employees. While, as of the date of this report, some of the Company’s Ukrainian employees have been forced to relocate to other countries or elsewhere within Ukraine, our workforce remains largely intact. The safety of Bunge's employees is its top priority. The Company is actively providing support and resources to employees and their families who have been impacted by these events, and Bunge employees in neighboring countries have mobilized to provide accommodation, food, clothing, toys, and other supplies for displaced colleagues and their families. Bunge is also committed to supporting humanitarian efforts in Ukraine and has provided approximately $5 million in food products and monetary assistance to multiple relief organizations helping the people of Ukraine. 
In accordance with industry standards, Bunge has insured against many types of risks, including against certain of the losses that we have or may experience in the future. However, the Company's level of insurance may not cover all losses the Company could incur.
The condensed consolidated balance sheet and related discussion below provides information on the Company’s major classes of assets and liabilities in Ukraine. As of December 31, 2022, total assets and total liabilities associated with Bunge’s Ukrainian subsidiaries each comprise approximately 1% of Bunge’s consolidated Total assets and Total liabilities, respectively.
Due to the nature of the war and its rapidly shifting areas of active combat, it is currently not possible to obtain all information necessary to determine all financial statement impacts. As such, the various financial statement impacts and related disclosures presented in these financial statements represent management’s best estimates considering available facts and circumstances as of the date of this report.
The functional currency of Bunge’s Ukrainian subsidiaries is the U.S. dollar and the foreign exchange rates used to convert assets and liabilities denominated in Ukrainian hryvnia represent the official exchange rates published by the National Bank of Ukraine. Following the onset of the war, the Ukrainian government-imposed restrictions on companies’ abilities to repatriate or otherwise remit cash from their Ukrainian-based operations to locations outside Ukraine. However, these restrictions are not expected to persist indefinitely and the Ukrainian government has eased certain restrictions surrounding the payment of international purchase invoices during 2022. The restrictions have not adversely impacted the Company's Ukrainian operations. Bunge is able to readily purchase U.S. dollars and other non-Ukrainian currencies onshore in Ukraine to pay for imports of goods and allowed services, where needed. Bunge is also able to sell foreign currency onshore in Ukraine. Bunge continues to exercise control of and consolidates its Ukrainian subsidiaries.

BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

The condensed consolidated balance sheet related to the Company’s Ukrainian operations as of December 31, 2022 consists of the following: 

(US$ in millions) | December 31,2022 | 
Current assets: | | 
Trade accounts receivable (less allowances of zero) | $ | 3 
Inventories | 31 | 
Other current assets | 38 | 
Total current assets | 72 | 
Property, plant and equipment, net | 132 | 
Other non-current assets | 58 | 
Total assets | $ | 262

Total liabilities | $ | 125

 Inventories—Bunge’s Ukrainian inventories generally comprise agricultural commodity inventories, primarily sunflower seeds, sunflower meal, sunflower oil, corn, and wheat. Due to their commodity characteristics, widely available markets, and international pricing mechanisms, such inventories are generally carried at fair value. Following the creation of the POC corridor during the third quarter of 2022 and extended through March 2023, Bunge is able to market and make available for delivery certain of its Ukrainian inventories at internationally-quoted prices. These inventories are carried at fair value as of December 31, 2022. Where the Company's inventories do not qualify to be recorded at fair value, primarily due to their physical location being close to active combat zones or in difficult to access locations with high costs of recovery, they are recorded at the lower of cost or net realizable value, by product category. In such instances, a thorough onsite physical inspection of the inventories is not currently possible due to safety concerns. As such, significant judgments have been made in estimating the net realizable value of the Company’s Ukrainian inventories. 
As of December 31, 2022, the Company evaluated the recoverability of its inventories inside Ukraine considering the latest information available to management regarding: the current status of the war; expectations regarding continued escalation of the conflict and the likelihood and timing of a potential peaceful resolution to the war; the physical location and condition of Bunge's inventories, including expectations regarding the timing of spoilage and the rate at which inventories can be transported from their current location to markets in other parts of Ukraine or exported to adjacent markets. As a result of this analysis, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded reserves of $71 million related to inventories physically located in occupied territories in Ukraine, or in difficult to access locations with high costs of recovery.
The Company also recorded $6 million in corresponding allowances for recoverable tax assets generated on the purchase of such inventories during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. 
Other current assets—Comprises $27 million of marketable securities and other short-term investments and $11 million of various other items, as follows:
•Marketable securities and other short-term investments—Comprise Ukrainian ("on-shore") government debt securities, denominated in Ukrainian hryvnia. Bunge classifies these securities as “trading securities”, carried at fair value in the Company’s consolidated balance sheet, with changes in fair value recorded in the Company’s consolidated statements of income in the period in which they occur.
F-21


BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

In addition to the marketable securities and other short-term investments belonging to Bunge’s Ukrainian subsidiaries, as shown in the above balance sheet, certain of the Company’s non-Ukrainian subsidiaries hold certain U.S. dollar denominated, non-Ukrainian ("off-shore") corporate debt securities of issuers with significant exposure to Ukraine. The values of these off-shore securities are directly impacted by the ongoing war. Such items, also reported within Other current assets as marketable securities and other short-term investments, have been fully reserved with no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2022.
As a result of the war, trading in the Ukrainian and Ukrainian-exposed debt securities has largely ceased. Consequently, at December 31, 2022, the prices of such securities were determined using pricing models with inputs based on similar securities adjusted to reflect management’s best estimate of the specific characteristics of the securities held by the Company. Such inputs represent a significant component of the fair value of the securities held by the Company, resulting in the securities being classified as Level 3 in the Company’s table of assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value on a recurring basis in Note 16- Fair Value Measurements.
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company recorded a combined $85 million loss on its on-shore and off-shore portfolios, within Other (expense) income – net, in the consolidated statement of income, of which $55 million relates to securities still held at December 31, 2022.
•Other—Primarily comprises recoverable taxes, net, prepaid expenses, and advance payments against contracts for future deliveries of specified quantities of agricultural commodities.
Property, plant, and equipment, net—As described above, since the onset of the war, Bunge’s Mykolaiv port facility has sustained immaterial damage. Accordingly, the Company has recorded impairment provisions of $2 million in relation to such damage, within Cost of goods sold, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. The expense was recorded in the Agribusiness segment.
In light of the war, as of December 31, 2022, Bunge evaluated the recoverability of its Ukrainian property, plant and equipment using an income method based on forecasts of expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets under a range of possible outcomes, including those with reduced or no future cash flows, and concluded that the Company's Ukrainian property, plant and equipment, net was recoverable. The recoverability tests depend on a number of significant estimates and assumptions, including the likelihood and timing of a potential peaceful resolution to the war, the likelihood and timing of resuming Bunge's remaining Ukrainian operations, expectations around the size of future harvests in Ukraine and the availability and costs of raw materials commodities and inputs, and market demand levels for products. The Company believes these estimates and assumptions are reasonable, and the reported amounts are not highly sensitive to any individual assumption underlying the recoverability tests. However, future changes in the judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in these recoverability tests could result in different conclusions regarding the recoverability of the Company's Ukrainian property, plant and equipment and may result in the need for the Company to record non-cash impairment charges of its Ukrainian property, plant and equipment at such time.
Other non-current assets—Comprises $35 million of deferred tax assets, $11 million of operating lease right-of-use assets associated with Bunge’s facilities, $5 million of recoverable taxes, net, expected to be realized in periods greater than twelve months from the balance sheet date, and $7 million of various other items. 
Trade accounts payable and accrued liabilities—Comprise amounts owed by the Company’s Ukrainian subsidiaries for goods delivered to or services consumed by such subsidiaries in the ordinary course of business.
Short-term debt—Bunge's short-term debt represents Ukrainian hryvnia denominated debt, primarily used to fund working capital requirements, issued by Ukrainian branches of non-Ukraine-based financial institutions.
Russia
In response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the United States, other North Atlantic Treaty Organization ("NATO") member states, as well as non-member states, have announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia, certain Russian citizens and Russian enterprises. 
On September 16, 2022, Bunge signed an agreement to sell its remaining Russian operations, primarily comprising an oilseed crushing and refining facility in Voronezh, southwest Russia, to Karen Vanetsyan. On February 3, 2023, the transaction closed in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Bunge continued to maintain control over its Russian subsidiary and related operations, and utilize the Russian ruble (RUB) as the functional currency of the Russian subsidiary, through the completion of the transaction. Please refer to Note 3- Acquisitions and Dispositions for further details regarding the transaction.

Assets held for sale
Russian Oilseed Processing and Refining Operations Disposition
On September 16, 2022, Bunge signed an agreement to sell its remaining Russian operations, primarily comprising an oilseed crushing and refining facility in Voronezh, southwest Russia, to Karen Vanetsyan (the "Buyer"), in exchange for a cash price approximately equal to the book value of the disposal group's net assets. On January 9, 2023, Bunge and the Buyer agreed to a purchase price adjustment. The purchase price adjustment and cumulative translation adjustment losses, among other items related to the disposal group, resulted in a corresponding impairment loss on sale of $103 million, recognized in Cost of goods sold for the year ended December 31, 2022. In connection with the transaction, Bunge has agreed to indemnify the Buyer against certain legal claims involving Bunge's Russian subsidiary. Management believes the likelihood of any loss related to the claims underlying the expected indemnity is remote. On February 3, 2023, the transaction closed in accordance with the terms of the agreement with no material impact to the consolidated statement of income in the first quarter of 2023.
The following table presents the disposal group's major classes of assets and liabilities included in Assets held for sale and Liabilities held for sale, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022.

The sale was finalized during the fourth quarter of 2020, and as the sale price, net of applicable transaction costs, substantially equaled net book value, no material gain or loss was recorded on the sale. 
The following table presents the book values of the major classes of assets and liabilities that were included in the disposal group, which were reported under the Milling segment:

4. TRADE STRUCTURED FINANCE PROGRAM
The Company engages in various trade structured finance activities to leverage the value of its global trade flows. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, net returns from these activities were $32 million, $31 million, and $25 million, respectively, and were included as a reduction of Cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. These activities include programs under which Bunge generally obtains U.S. dollar-denominated letters of credit ("LCs") from financial institutions, each based on an underlying commodity trade flow, time deposits denominated in either the local currency of the financial institutions' counterparties or in U.S. dollars, as well as foreign exchange forward contracts, in which trade related payables are set-off against receivables, all of which are subject to legally enforceable set-off agreements.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, time deposits and LCs of $5,901 million and $6,543 million, respectively, were presented net on the consolidated balance sheets as the criteria of ASC 210-20, Offsetting, had been met. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, time deposits, including those presented on a net basis, carried weighted-average interest rates of 3.46% and 1.08%, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, total net proceeds from issuances of LCs were $5,826 million, $6,522 million and $4,654 million, respectively. These cash inflows are offset by the related cash outflows resulting from placement of the time deposits and repayment of the LCs. All cash flows related to the programs are included in operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
As part of the trade structured finance activities, LCs may be sold to financial institutions on a discounted basis. Bunge does not service derecognized LCs. The terms of the sale may require the Company to continue to make periodic interest payments to financial institutions based on changes in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate ("SOFR"), or LIBOR for trades

Trade Receivables Securitization Program
Bunge and certain of its subsidiaries participate in a trade receivables securitization program (the "Program") with a financial institution, as administrative agent, and certain commercial paper conduit purchasers and committed purchasers (collectively, the “Purchasers”). Koninklijke Bunge B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of Bunge, acts as master servicer, responsible for servicing and collecting the accounts receivable for the Program. The Program is designed to enhance Bunge’s financial flexibility by providing an additional source of liquidity for its operations.

BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

On March 31, 2022, Bunge and certain of its subsidiaries renewed and amended the Program. As a result, the aggregate size of the facility that provides funding against receivables sold into the Program increased by $175 million from $925 million to $1.1 billion. Bunge may also, from time to time with the consent of the administrative agent, request one or more of the existing committed purchasers or new committed purchasers to increase the total commitments by an amount not to exceed $250 million pursuant to an accordion provision. The Program was further amended to add sustainability provisions, pursuant to which the applicable margin will be increased or decreased based on Bunge's performance in comparison with certain sustainability targets, including, but not limited to, recently established science-based targets that define Bunge's climate goals within its operations and a commitment to a deforestation-free supply chain in 2025. 
In connection with the Program, certain of Bunge’s U.S. and non-U.S subsidiaries that originate trade receivables may sell eligible receivables in their entirety on a revolving basis to a consolidated bankruptcy remote special purpose entity, Bunge Securitization B.V. (“BSBV”) formed under the laws of the Netherlands. Prior to November 16, 2022, BSBV sold such purchased trade receivables to the Purchasers pursuant to a receivables transfer agreement. In exchange for the sale of the trade receivables, Bunge received a cash payment up to $1.1 billion and an additional amount upon the collection of the trade receivables, referred to as the deferred purchase price (“DPP”). In accordance with the amended guidance of ASC 230, Statement of Cash Flows, Bunge reflects cash flows related to the DPP as investing activities in its consolidated statements of cash flows. All other Program related cash flows are classified as operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
On November 16, 2022, Bunge and certain of its subsidiaries amended the Program from a deferred purchase price structure to a pledge structure. Under the new structure, BSBV transfers certain trade receivables to the Purchasers in exchange for a cash payment up to $1.1 billion and retains ownership of a population of unsold receivables. BSBV agrees to guaranty the collection of sold receivables and grants a lien to the administrative agent on all unsold receivables. Collections on unsold receivables and guarantee payments are classified as operating activities in Bunge’s consolidated statements of cash flows. 
At November 16, 2022, the effective date of the amended Program, $741 million of sold receivables were repurchased through a non-cash investing exchange of DPP. The fair value of the repurchased receivables equaled the fair value of the DPP and there were no other rights or obligations involved in the exchange of the repurchased receivables and DPP. As of December 31, 2022, the Company collected $646 million of repurchased receivables, which are reported as Proceeds from interest in securitized trade receivables under investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. 
The Program will terminate on May 17, 2031; however, each committed purchaser's commitment to purchase trade receivables under the Program will terminate on May 17, 2025, unless extended for an additional period in accordance with the terms of the receivables transfer agreement.

(1)Total funding against receivables sold into the Program was $1.1 billion and $925 million as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively.
Under the Program’s previous structure, Bunge's risk of loss following the sale of the trade receivables was limited to the DPP, included in Other current assets in the consolidated balance sheets (see Note 7- Other Current Assets). The DPP was repaid in cash as receivables were collected, generally within 30 days. Under the amended structure, Bunge’s risk of loss following the sale of the trade receivables is substantially the same and limited to the assets of BSBV, primarily comprised of unsold receivables pledged to the administrative agent. Provisions for delinquencies and credit losses on trade receivables sold under the Program as of December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 were zero, $5 million, and $5 million, respectively.

(1)Prior to November 16, 2022, the Company recognized these proceeds net of the DPP, consisting of a receivable from the Purchasers that entitled the Company to certain collections on the receivable. The Company recognized the collection of the DPP in net cash provided by investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. As a result of the November 16, 2022 amendment, Bunge will report collections on newly originated, unsold receivables held by BSBV as operating cash flows in the consolidated statements of cash flows.
Non-cash activity for the Program in the reporting period is represented by the difference between gross receivables sold and cash collections from customers on receivables previously sold, as well as the non-cash activity noted above resulting from the November 16, 2022 amendment.

Restricted cash | 26 | | | 3 | 
Other | 386 | | | 198 | 
Total | $ | 4,381 | | | $ | 4,751

(1)Prepaid commodity purchase contracts represent advance payments against contracts for future delivery of specified quantities of agricultural commodities.
(2)Bunge provides cash advances to suppliers, primarily Brazilian soybean farmers, to finance a portion of the suppliers' production costs, primarily to secure the origination of soybeans for Bunge's soybean processing facilities in Brazil. Bunge does not bear any of the costs or operational risks associated with growing the related crops. The ability of Bunge's counterparties to repay these amounts is affected by agricultural economic conditions in the relevant geography, which are in turn affected by commodity prices, currency exchange rates, crop input costs, and crop quality and yields. As a result, the advances are largely collateralized by future crops and physical assets of the suppliers, carry a local market interest rate, and settle when the farmers' crops are harvested and sold. 
The secured advances to farmers are reported net of allowances of $7 million and $3 million at December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, respectively. Bunge periodically evaluates the collectability of Bunge’s farmer receivables and records allowances if Bunge determines that collection is doubtful. Bunge bases the Company’s determination of the allowance of analyses of the credit quality of individual accounts, also considering the economic and financial condition of the farming industry and other market conditions, as well as the value of any collateral related to amounts owed. Bunge continuously reviews defaulted farmer receivables for impairment on an individual account basis. Bunge considers all accounts in legal collection processes to be defaulted and past due. For such accounts, Bunge determines the allowance for uncollectible amounts based on the fair value of the associated collateral, net of estimated costs to sell. For all renegotiated accounts (current and past due), Bunge considers changes in farm economic conditions and other market conditions, Bunge’s historical experience related to renegotiated accounts, and the fair value of collateral in determining the allowance for doubtful accounts. 
Interest earned on secured advances to suppliers of $22 million, $26 million, and $31 million, for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively, is included in Net sales in the consolidated statements of income.
(3) Marketable securities and other short-term investments—Bunge invests in foreign government securities, corporate debt securities, deposits, equity securities, and other securities. The following is a summary of amounts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as marketable securities and other short-term investments.

9. GOODWILL
Bunge generally performs its annual goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter. If events or indicators of impairment occur between annual impairment analyses, the Company performs an impairment analysis at that date. These events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, or the sale or disposition of a significant asset. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill, the Company: (1) validates changes, if any, to its reporting units with goodwill balances; (2) allocates goodwill to its reporting units to which acquired goodwill relates; (3) determines the carrying value, or book value, of its reporting units; (4) estimates the fair value of each reporting unit using a discounted cash flow model and/or using market multiples; (5) compares the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value; and (6) if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying

value, the Company recognizes an impairment charge for such amount, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. 
Critical estimates in the determination of fair value under both the income and market approach include, but are not limited to, assumptions about variables such as commodity prices, crop and related throughput and production volumes, profitability, future capital expenditures, other expenses, and discount rates, all of which are subject to a high degree of judgment.
Changes in the carrying value of goodwill by segment for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 are as follows:

Venture"), leveraging Bunge’s expertise in oilseed processing and farmer relationships, and Chevron’s expertise in fuels manufacturing and marketing, to help meet the demand for renewable fuels and to develop lower carbon intensity feedstocks. 
The Joint Venture is a variable interest entity ("VIE") in which Bunge is considered to be the primary beneficiary because it is responsible for the day-to-day operating decisions of the Joint Venture as well as the marketing of the principal products, primarily soybean meal and oil produced and sold by the Joint Venture, among other factors. 
The Joint Venture's assets can only be used to settle the Joint Venture’s own obligations and the Joint Venture’s creditors have no recourse to Bunge’s assets beyond Bunge’s maximum exposure to loss associated with the Joint Venture at any given time. The following table presents the values of the assets and liabilities associated with the Joint Venture, which are included in Bunge’s condensed consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2022. All amounts exclude intercompany balances, which have been eliminated upon consolidation.
For all other VIEs in which Bunge is considered the primary beneficiary, the entities meet the definition of a business, and the VIE's assets can be used other than for the settlement of the VIE’s obligations. As such these VIEs have been excluded from the below table:

Non-Consolidated Variable Interest Entities 
Bunge holds investment interests in various entities, as described above, that are included in Investments in affiliates and Other non-current assets in the consolidated balance sheets. Certain of these investments, which are primarily reported in Bunge's Agribusiness segment and Corporate and Other, have been determined to be variable interest entities for which Bunge has determined it is not the primary beneficiary. Accordingly, these investments are not consolidated by Bunge. Bunge's exposure to loss related to these unconsolidated investments is $472 million and $487 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Bunge's exposure to loss primarily comprises Bunge's investments balance, third party guarantees, and long term loans, assuming full loss of the investment balance and full payment of the guarantees regardless of the probability of such losses actually being incurred in accordance with US GAAP disclosure rules. See Note 22- Commitments and Contingencies. 
On June 10, 2022, Bunge completed its acquisition of a 33% interest in Sinagro in exchange for Brazilian reais ("R$") 277 million (approximately $52 million). As of December 31, 2022, the Company's maximum exposure to loss related to this unconsolidated VIE is limited to the investment balance of approximately $56 million. However, as part of the acquisition cost, Bunge has committed to provide certain future guarantees of Sinagro's approximately R$159 million ($30 million) third-party indebtedness in proportion to Bunge’s 33% equity holding, representing a maximum expected future guarantee of approximately R$53 million ($10 million).

(3)As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, $9 million and $12 million, respectively, of long-term investments were recorded at fair value.
Recoverable taxes, net—Recoverable taxes are reported net of allowances of $14 million and $18 million at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
Judicial deposits—Judicial deposits are funds that Bunge has placed on deposit with the courts in Brazil. These Brazilian funds are held in judicial escrow related to certain legal proceedings pending resolution and bear interest at the Selic rate, which is the benchmark rate of the Brazilian central bank.
Income taxes receivable—Income taxes receivable include overpayments of current income taxes plus accrued interest. These income tax prepayments are expected to be used to settle future income tax obligations. Income taxes receivable in Brazil bear interest at the Selic rate.
Long-term investments—Long-term investments primarily comprise Bunge's noncontrolling equity investments in growth stage agribusiness and food companies held by Bunge Ventures. 
Affiliate loans receivable—Affiliate loans receivable are primarily interest-bearing receivables from unconsolidated affiliates with remaining maturities of more than one year.
Long-term receivables from farmers in Brazil, net—Bunge provides financing to farmers in Brazil, primarily through secured advances against farmer commitments to deliver agricultural commodities (primarily soybeans) upon harvest of the then-current year's crop and through credit sales of fertilizer to farmers. Certain such long-term receivables from farmers are originally recorded in Other current assets as prepaid commodity purchase contracts or secured advances to suppliers (see Note 7- Other Current Assets) and reclassified to Other non-current assets when collection issues with farmers arise and amounts become past due with resolution of matters expected to take more than one year.
The average recorded investment in long-term receivables from farmers in Brazil for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 was $90 million and $92 million, respectively.

15. INCOME TAXES
Bunge operates globally and is subject to the tax laws and regulations of numerous tax jurisdictions and authorities as well as tax agreements and treaties among these jurisdictions. Bunge's income tax provision is impacted by, among other factors, changes in tax laws, regulations, agreements and treaties, currency exchange rates and Bunge's profitability in each tax jurisdiction.
Bunge has elected to use the U.S. federal income tax rate to reconcile the actual provision for income taxes.
The components of Income from continuing operations before income tax are as follows:

The primary components of the deferred tax assets and liabilities and the related valuation allowances are as follows:

Net deferred tax assets (liabilities) | $ | 347 | | | $ | 212

As of December 31, 2022, Bunge has determined it has unremitted earnings that are considered to be indefinitely reinvested of approximately $1.3 billion, and accordingly, no provision for income taxes has been made. If these earnings were distributed in the form of dividends or otherwise, Bunge would be subject to income taxes in the form of withholding taxes to the recipient for an amount of approximately $60 million.
At December 31, 2022, Bunge's pre-tax loss carryforwards totaled $2.4 billion, of which $2.3 billion have no expiration, including loss carryforwards of $1.3 billion in Brazil. While loss carryforwards in Brazil can be carried forward indefinitely, annual utilization is limited to 30% of taxable income calculated on an entity by entity basis as Brazil tax law does not allow consolidated tax filings. At December 31, 2021, Bunge’s pre-tax loss carryforwards totaled $2.2 billion, of which $2.1 billion had no expiration, including loss carryforwards of $1.1 billion in Brazil. The increase in pre-tax loss carryforwards from 2021 to 2022 is primarily attributable to the Company’s generation of losses in certain jurisdictions during the year. 
The remaining tax loss carryforwards expire at various periods beginning in 2023 through the year 2042.
Income Tax Valuation Allowances—Bunge records valuation allowances when current evidence does not suggest that some portion or all of its deferred tax assets will be realized. The ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends primarily on Bunge's ability to generate sufficient timely future income of the appropriate character in the appropriate taxing jurisdiction.
As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, Bunge has recorded valuation allowances of $269 million and $297 million, respectively. The net decrease of $28 million is primarily attributable to releases of valuation allowance during the year in jurisdictions where we now believe realization of deferred tax assets is more likely than not. 
Unrecognized Tax Benefits—ASC Topic 740 requires applying a "more likely than not" threshold to the recognition and de-recognition of tax benefits. Accordingly, Bunge recognizes the amount of tax benefit that has a greater than 50 percent likelihood of being ultimately realized upon settlement. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, Bunge had recorded unrecognized tax benefits of $59 million and $73 million in Other non-current liabilities and zero and $8 million in Other current liabilities in its consolidated balance sheets. During 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively, Bunge recognized $(7) million, $4 million and $2 million of interest and penalty charges in Income tax expense in the consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, Bunge had recorded accrued interest and penalties of $9 million and $14 million in

Bunge believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $7 million of its unrecognized tax benefits may be recognized by the end of 2023 as a result of a lapse of the statute of limitations.
Bunge, through its subsidiaries, files income tax returns in the United States (federal and various states) and non-United States regions. The table below reflects the tax years for which Bunge is subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities in significant tax regions:

 | Open Tax Years
North America | 2013 - 2022 
South America | 2015 - 2022 
Europe | 2015 - 2022 
Asia-Pacific | 2009 - 2022 

As of December 31, 2022, Bunge's Brazilian subsidiaries have received income tax and penalty assessments through 2018 of approximately R$5.5 billion (approximately $1.0 billion) plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount. Bunge has recorded unrecognized tax benefits related to these assessments of R$19 million (approximately $3 million) as of December 31, 2022.
As of December 31, 2022, Bunge’s Argentina subsidiary had received income tax and penalty assessments relating to 2006 through 2016 of approximately 4.1 billion Argentine pesos (approximately $23 million) plus applicable interest on the outstanding amount. 
Management, in consultation with external legal advisors, believes that it is more likely than not that Bunge will prevail on the proposed assessments (with the exception of unrecognized tax benefits discussed above) in Brazil and Argentina and is vigorously defending its position against these assessments.
Bunge made cash income tax payments, net of refunds received, of $570 million, $531 million and $140 million during the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.
In October 2021, the Organization for Economic Co-operations and Development (the "OECD") released an outline that describes the conceptual agreement among 138 countries on fundamental reforms to international tax rules. The outline provides for two primary "Pillars"; however, only Pillar Two, which provides for a global minimum corporate tax rate of 15%, could have a negative impact on Bunge. The OECD outline suggests that these reforms be implemented by 2023, but it is contingent upon the independent actions of participating countries to enact law changes. In 2021, the OECD released the Pillar Two Model Rules as approved by the OECD/G20 Inclusive Framework on BEPS. Additional technical guidance on the Model Rules was published by the OECD in 2022. The Model Rules define the scope and key mechanics for the Pillar Two system of global minimum tax rules, which includes the Income Inclusion Rule (IIR) and the Under Taxed Payments Rule (UTPR), referred collectively as the "GloBE" rules. Local tax enactment is expected in many countries in 2023 with an effective date of January 1, 2024. If enacted into law, in whole or in part, this proposed change to international tax rules could have a negative impact to Bunge’s effective tax rate.

(3)Other primarily includes the fair values of marketable securities and investments in Other current assets and Other non-current assets.
(4)Unrealized losses on derivative contracts are generally included in Other current liabilities. There were $332 million and $49 million included in Other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. There were zero and $1 million included in Liabilities held for sale at December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
    Readily marketable inventories—RMI reported at fair value are valued based on commodity futures exchange quotations, broker or dealer quotations, or market transactions in either listed or OTC markets with appropriate adjustments for differences in local markets where the Company's inventories are located. In such cases, the inventory is classified within Level 2. Certain inventories may utilize significant unobservable data related to local market adjustments to determine fair value. In such cases, the inventory is classified as Level 3.
    If the Company used different methods or factors to determine fair values, amounts reported as unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and RMI at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income could differ. Additionally, if market conditions change subsequent to the reporting date, amounts reported in future periods as unrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts and RMI at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of income could differ.
    Derivatives—The majority of exchange traded futures and options contracts and exchange cleared contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. The majority of the Company’s exchange-traded agricultural commodity futures are cash-settled on a daily basis and, therefore, are not included in these tables. The Company's forward commodity purchase and sales contracts are classified as derivatives along with other OTC derivative instruments relating primarily to freight, energy, foreign exchange and interest rates and are classified within Level 2 or Level 3, as described below. The Company estimates fair values based on exchange quoted prices, adjusted as appropriate for differences in local markets. These differences are generally valued using inputs from broker or dealer quotations or market transactions in either the listed or OTC markets. In such cases, these derivative contracts are classified within Level 2.
    OTC derivative contracts include swaps, options and structured transactions that are generally fair valued using quantitative models that require the use of multiple market inputs including quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not highly active, other observable inputs relevant to the asset or liability, and market inputs corroborated by correlation or other means. These valuation models include inputs such as interest rates, prices and indices to generate continuous yield or pricing curves and volatility factors. Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized in Level 2. Certain OTC derivatives trade in less active markets with less availability of pricing information and certain structured transactions can require internally developed model inputs that might not be observable in or corroborated by the market.
 Marketable securities and investments—Comprise government treasury securities, corporate debt securities and other investments. Bunge analyzes how the prices are derived and determines whether the prices are liquid or less liquid tradable prices. Marketable securities and investments with liquid prices are valued using prices from publicly available sources and classified as Level 1. Marketable securities and investments with less-liquid prices are valued using third-party quotes or internally developed models and classified as Level 2 or Level 3 as described below. 
    Level 3 Measurements
    The following relates to assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level 3 measurements. An instrument may transfer into or out of Level 3 due to inputs becoming either observable or unobservable. 
Level 3 Measurements—Transfers in and/or out of Level 3 represent existing assets or liabilities that were either previously categorized as a higher level for which the inputs to the model became unobservable or assets and liabilities that were previously classified as Level 3 for which the lowest significant input became observable during the period. Bunge's policy regarding the timing of transfers between levels is to record the transfers at the end of the reporting period. 
    Level 3 Readily marketable inventories and other—The significant unobservable inputs resulting in Level 3 classification for RMI, physically settled forward purchase and sales contracts, and trade accounts payable relate to certain management estimations regarding costs of transportation and other local market or location-related adjustments, primarily freight related adjustments in the interior of Brazil, and the lack of market corroborated information in Canada. In both situations, the Company uses proprietary information such as purchase and sales contracts and contracted prices to value

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

freight, premiums and discounts in its contracts. Movements in the price of these unobservable inputs alone would not have a material effect on the Company's financial statements as these contracts do not typically exceed one future crop cycle.
    Level 3 Derivatives—Level 3 derivative instrument fair value measurements utilizes both market observable and unobservable inputs. These inputs include commodity prices, price volatility, interest rates, volumes and locations.
Level 3 Others—Primarily relates to marketable securities and investments valued using third-party quotes or pricing models with inputs based on similar securities adjusted to reflect management’s best estimate of the specific characteristics of the securities held by the Company. Such inputs represent a significant component of the fair value of the securities held by the Company, resulting in the securities being classified as Level 3.
The tables below present reconciliations for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. These instruments were valued using pricing models that management believes reflect the assumptions that would be used by a marketplace participant.

17. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
    The Company uses derivative instruments to manage several market risks, such as interest rate, foreign currency rate, and commodity risk. Some of the hedges the Company enters into qualify for hedge accounting ("Hedge Accounting Derivatives") and some, while intended as economic hedges, do not qualify or are not designated for hedge accounting ("Economic Hedge Derivatives"). As these derivatives impact the financial statements in different ways, they are discussed separately below.
    Hedge Accounting Derivatives - The Company uses derivatives in qualifying hedge accounting relationships to manage certain of its interest rate, foreign currency, and commodity risks. In executing these hedge strategies, the Company primarily relies on the shortcut and critical terms match methods in designing its hedge accounting strategy, which results in little to no net earnings impact for these hedge relationships. The Company monitors these relationships on a quarterly basis and performs a quantitative analysis to validate the assertion that the hedges are highly effective if there are changes to the hedged item or hedging derivative.
    Fair value hedges - These derivatives are used to hedge the effect of interest rate and currency exchange rate changes on certain long-term debt. Under fair value hedge accounting, the derivative is measured at fair value and the carrying value of hedged debt is adjusted for the change in value related to the exposure being hedged, with both adjustments offset to earnings. In other words, the earnings effect of an increase in the fair value of the derivative will be substantially offset by the earnings effect of the increase in the carrying value of the hedged debt. The net impact of fair value hedge accounting for interest rate swaps is recognized in Interest expense. For cross currency swaps, the changes in currency risk on the derivative are recognized in Foreign exchange gains (losses) - net, and the changes in interest rate risk are recognized in Interest expense. Changes in basis risk are held in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until realized through the coupon.
    Cash flow hedges of currency risk - The Company manages currency risk on certain forecasted purchases, sales, and selling, general and administrative expenses with currency forwards. The change in the value of the forward is classified in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the transaction affects earnings, at which time the change in value of the currency forward is reclassified to Net sales, Cost of goods sold, or Selling, general and administrative expenses. These hedges mature at various times through December 2023. Of the amount currently in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, $1 million of deferred losses is expected to be reclassified to earnings in the next twelve months.
Net investment hedges - The Company hedges the currency risk of certain of its foreign subsidiaries with currency forwards for which the currency risk is remeasured through Accumulated other comprehensive loss. For currency forwards, the forward method is used. The change in the value of the forward is classified in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until the transaction affects earnings by way of either sale or substantial liquidation of the foreign subsidiary.
    The table below provides information about the balance sheet values of hedged items and the notional amount of derivatives used in hedging strategies. The notional amount of the derivative is the number of units of the underlying (for example, the notional principal amount of the debt in an interest rate swap). The notional amount is used to compute interest or other payment streams to be made under the contract and is a measure of the Company’s level of activity. The Company discloses derivative notional amounts on a gross basis.

    Economic Hedge Derivatives - In addition to using derivatives in qualifying hedge relationships, the Company enters into derivatives to economically hedge its exposure to a variety of market risks it incurs in the normal course of operations.
    Interest rate derivatives are used to hedge exposures to the Company's financial instrument portfolios and debt issuances. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is primarily presented in Interest expense.
    Currency derivatives are used to hedge the balance sheet and commercial exposures that arise from the Company's global operations. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold when hedging commercial exposures and Foreign exchange (losses) gains - net when hedging monetary exposures.
    Agricultural commodity derivatives are used primarily to manage exposures related to the Company's inventory and forward purchase and sales contracts. Contracts to purchase agricultural commodities generally relate to current or future crop years for delivery periods quoted by regulated commodity exchanges. Contracts for the sale of agricultural commodities generally do not extend beyond one future crop cycle. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.
    The Company uses derivative instruments referred to as forward freight agreements ("FFA") and FFA options to hedge portions of its current and anticipated ocean freight costs. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.
    The Company uses energy derivative instruments to manage its exposure to volatility in energy costs. Hedges may be entered into for natural gas, electricity, coal and fuel oil, including bunker fuel. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.
    The Company may also enter into other derivatives, including credit default swaps and equity derivatives to manage exposure to credit risk and broader macroeconomic risks, respectively. The impact of changes in fair value of these instruments is presented in Cost of goods sold.

18. SHORT-TERM DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES
Bunge's short-term borrowings are typically sourced from various banking institutions and the U.S. commercial paper market. Bunge also borrows from time to time in local currencies in various foreign jurisdictions. Interest expense includes facility commitment fees, amortization of deferred financing costs, the impact of designated interest rate hedges, and charges on certain lending transactions. The weighted-average interest rate on short-term borrowings at December 31, 2022 and 2021 was 15.53% and 19.62%, respectively.

(3)Variable interest rate range on short-term lines of credit as of December 31, 2022.
Bunge's $600 million commercial paper program is supported by an identical amount of committed back-up bank credit lines (the "Liquidity Facility") provided by banks that are rated at least A-1 by Standard & Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s Investor Services. The cost of borrowing under the Liquidity Facility would typically be higher than the cost of issuing under Bunge's commercial paper program. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no borrowings outstanding under the commercial paper program and no borrowings outstanding under the Liquidity Facility. The Liquidity Facility is Bunge's only revolving credit facility that requires lenders to maintain minimum credit ratings. The Liquidity Facility is set to expire on July 16, 2026.
On July 15, 2022, Bunge entered into an unsecured $1.1 billion 364-day Revolving Credit Agreement (the "$1.1 Billion Credit Agreement") with a group of lenders, maturing on July 14, 2023. Bunge may from time to time request one or more of the existing or new lenders to increase the total participations under the $1.1 Billion Credit Agreement by an aggregate amount up to $250 million pursuant to an accordion provision. Borrowings will bear interest at SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment and applicable margin, as defined in the $1.1 Billion Credit Agreement. The $1.1 Billion Credit Agreement replaced the previous unsecured $1 billion 364-day Revolving Credit Agreement (the "$1 Billion Credit Agreement") that matured on July 15, 2022. Bunge had no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2022 under the $1.1 Billion Credit Agreement.

Bunge had no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, under the unsecured committed $1.35 billion 5-year Revolving Credit Agreement (the "$1.35 Billion Credit Agreement") with a group of lenders, maturing July 16, 2026. Bunge may, from time to time, request one or more of the existing or new lenders to increase the total commitments under the $1.35 Billion Credit Agreement by an aggregate amount up to $200 million pursuant to an accordion provision. Borrowings will bear interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin, as defined in the $1.35 Billion Credit Agreement. 
Bunge had no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, under the unsecured $865 million Revolving Credit Facility (the "$865 Million 2026 Facility") with a group of lenders, set to mature on October 29, 2026. Borrowings will bear interest at SOFR plus a credit spread adjustment and applicable margin, as defined in the $865 Million 2026 Facility.
Bunge had no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2022, and December 31, 2021, under the unsecured $1.75 Billion Revolving Credit Facility. ("$1.75 Billion Revolving Credit Facility") set to mature on December 16, 2024. The interest rate under the $1.75 Billion Revolving Credit Facility is tied to certain sustainability criteria, including, but not limited to, recently established science based targets that define Bunge's climate goals within its operations and a commitment to eliminate deforestation in its supply chains in 2025. Bunge may from time to time, with the consent of the administrative agent, request one or more of the existing lenders or new lenders to increase the total commitments by an amount not to exceed $250 million pursuant to an accordion provision set forth in the $1.75 Billion Revolving Credit Facility. Borrowings under the $1.75 Billion Revolving Credit Facility will bear interest at LIBOR plus a margin, which will vary from 0.30% to 1.30%, based on the senior long-term unsecured debt ratings provided by Moody’s Investors Services Inc. and S&P Global Ratings. Bunge will also pay a fee that will vary from 0.10% to 0.40% based on its utilization of the $1.75 Billion Revolving Credit Facility.
At December 31, 2022, Bunge had $6,665 million unused and available committed borrowing capacity comprising committed revolving credit facilities and the commercial paper program, totaling $5,665 million with a number of financial institutions, in addition to $1,000 million in committed unsecured delayed draw term loans (see Note 19- Long-term Debt).

 Plan amendments and pension liability adjustments—On September 19, 2017, Bunge approved changes to certain U.S. defined benefit pension plans. As a result of these future benefit accruals for existing participants ceased effective January 1, 2023, and these plans were closed to new employees hired on or after January 1, 2018. 
Plan Settlements—On February 28, 2022, the Company, together with plan participants and related employee unions, agreed to the transition of one of the Company’s international defined-benefit pension plans to a multi-employer pension plan. Following the transition, the Company accounts for the multi-employer plan similar to a defined contribution plan, resulting in full settlement of the related defined-benefit plan obligations. 
In connection with the settlement, during the first quarter of 2022, the Company recorded a $41 million pretax gain within Other (expense) income - net in its consolidated statements of income, comprising a $4 million settlement of the related defined benefit plan obligations as well as the reclassification of $37 million in unamortized actuarial gains from Accumulated other comprehensive loss. Of this pretax gain, $12 million was attributable to Redeemable non-controlling interests.
On July 17, 2020, the Company approved a one-time lump sum offering to certain participants in Bunge's defined benefit U.S. Pension Plan who had separated from the Company as of December 31, 2019 and whose benefits in the plan had fully vested. The respective payments were completed during the fourth quarter of 2020. The payments, which were paid from plan assets as settlement of respective benefit obligations, resulted in an $88 million decrease in benefit obligations and the reclassification of an unamortized loss of $12 million from other comprehensive income, which was recorded in Other (expense) income - net on the consolidated statement of income. 
In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred a small settlement in respect of one of its international plans, resulting in the reclassification of an unamortized loss of $4 million from other comprehensive income, which was also recorded in Other (expense) income - net on the consolidated statement of income.
On July 24, 2020, the Company made a one-time cash contribution payment to its U.S. defined benefit pension plans of $65 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Plan Transfers In and Out—There were no significant transfers into or out of Bunge's employee benefit plans during the years ended December 31, 2022 or 2021.
Cost of Benefit Plans—Service cost is recognized in a period determined as the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to services rendered by employees during that period. Interest cost is the amount recognized in a period determined as the increase in the projected benefit obligation due to the passage of time. The expected return on plan assets is determined based on the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the market-related value of plan assets. Amortization of net loss represents the recognition in net periodic cost over several periods of amounts previously recognized in Other comprehensive income. Service cost is included in the same income statement line item as other compensation costs arising from services rendered during the period, while the other components of net periodic benefit pension cost are presented separately in Other (expense) income- net.
The components of net periodic benefit costs for defined benefit pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

Assumptions used in Postretirement Benefits Calculations—At December 31, 2022, a 7.7% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2022 postretirement benefit plan measurement purposes, decreasing to 7.1% by 2048, and remaining at that level thereafter. At December 31, 2021, a 7.2% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare benefits was assumed for 2021 postretirement benefit plan measurement purposes, decreasing to 6.6% by 2038, and remaining at that level thereafter.
The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used in determining the benefit obligation under the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

 | Pension BenefitsDecember 31, | | Postretirement BenefitsDecember 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2022 | 2021

Increase in future compensation levels | 2.4 | % | | 3.2 | % | N/A | | N/A

The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used in determining the net periodic benefit cost under the defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans are as follows:

 | Pension BenefitsDecember 31, | | Postretirement BenefitsDecember 31,
 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020

Increase in future compensation levels | 3.2 | % | | 3.2 | % | 3.2 | % | | N/A | | N/A | | N/A

The sponsoring subsidiaries select the expected long-term rate of return on assets in consultation with their investment advisors and actuaries. These rates are intended to reflect the average rates of earnings expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide required plan benefits. The plans are assumed to continue in effect as long as assets are expected to be invested.
In estimating the expected long-term rate of return on assets, appropriate consideration is given to historical performance for the major asset classes held, or anticipated to be held, by the applicable plan trusts and to current forecasts of future rates of return for those asset classes. Cash flows and expenses are taken into consideration to the extent that the expected returns would be affected by them. As assets are generally held in qualified trusts, anticipated returns are not reduced for taxes.
For certain of Bunge’s plans, the discount rate is determined by 1) the yield on a hypothetical bond portfolio for which the cash flow effectively settles the year-by-year projected benefit cash flows or 2) matching either the duration or the expected cash flows for the pension plans to a hypothetical yield curve developed on a region-specific basis using a portfolio of available high quality, non-callable, make-whole corporate bonds.

Pension Benefit Plan Assets—The objective of the plans' trust funds is to sufficiently diversify plan assets to maintain a reasonable level of risk without imprudently sacrificing returns. 
For pension plans in the United States (the "US plans"), Bunge has an outside investment advisory firm to implement a liability-driven investment strategy intended to increase the duration of pension plan assets to better match the duration of pension benefit obligations. This strategy is intended to increase the interest rate and credit spread liability hedge ratios and reduce the funded status volatility of the US plans. For the largest US plan, derivatives are used primarily to manage risk and hedge plan liabilities while maintaining liquidity. As part of this strategy, the plan is required to hold cash collateral associated with certain derivatives. Target asset allocations are based on a glide path approach, which allocates more plan assets to immunizing assets, such as intermediate and long duration fixed income instruments, which are intended to match the duration and amount of the expected liabilities, and less to growth assets, such as public equities, non-core fixed income instruments and real assets, as the funded status of the plans improve. Target asset allocations are generally 70-90% to immunizing assets and 10-30% to growth assets. For pension plans outside of the United States, the plans’ trust funds utilize a target asset allocation of approximately 30% fixed income securities, approximately 40% equities and approximately 30% in real estate and other alternative investment vehicles. 
Bunge implements its investment strategy through a combination of passive and actively managed strategies, including, but not limited to mutual funds, collective trust funds and collective investment trusts. The Company's policy is not to invest plan assets in Bunge Limited shares. Plan investments are stated at fair value or net asset value ("NAV"). For a further definition of fair value and the associated fair value levels, refer to Note 1- Nature of Business, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies.

21. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
    Bunge purchases agricultural commodity products from certain of its unconsolidated investees and other related parties. Such related party purchases comprised approximately 6% or less of total Cost of goods sold for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. Bunge also sells agricultural commodity products to certain of its unconsolidated investees and other related parties. Such related party sales comprised approximately 1% or less of total Net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020. 
    In addition, Bunge receives services from and provides services to its unconsolidated investees, including tolling, port handling, administrative support, and other services. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, such services were not material to the Company's consolidated results. 
    At December 31, 2022 and 2021, receivables related to the above related party transactions comprised approximately 1% or less of total Trade accounts receivable, net. At December 31, 2022 and 2021, payables related to the above related party transactions comprised approximately 5% or less of total Trade accounts payable.
    Bunge believes all transaction values to be similar to those that would be conducted with third parties.
22. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES
Bunge is party to claims and lawsuits, primarily non-income tax and labor claims in South America, arising in the normal course of business. Bunge is also involved from time to time in various contract, antitrust, environmental litigation and remediation, and other litigation, claims, government investigations and legal proceedings. The ability to predict the ultimate outcome of such matters involves judgments, estimates, and inherent uncertainties. Bunge records liabilities related to legal matters when the exposure item becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. Bunge management does not expect these matters to have a material adverse effect on Bunge’s financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. However, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and there exists the remote possibility that a liability arising from these matters could have a material adverse impact in the period the uncertainties are resolved should the liability substantially exceed the amount of provisions included in the consolidated balance sheets. Included in Other non-current liabilities at December 31, 2022 and 2021 are the following amounts related to these matters:

Brazil indirect taxes - non-income tax claims - These tax claims relate to claims against Bunge’s Brazilian subsidiaries, primarily value-added tax claims (ICMS, ISS, IPI and PIS/COFINS). 
As of December 31, 2022, the Brazilian federal and state authorities have concluded examinations of the ICMS and PIS/COFINS tax returns and have issued outstanding claims. The Company continues to evaluate the merits of each of these claims and will recognize them if and when loss is considered probable. The outstanding claims comprise the following:

 | | December 31,
(US$ in millions) | Years Examined | 2022 | 2021
ICMS | 1990 to Present | $ | 215 | $ | 222
PIS/COFINS | 2002 to Present | $ | 347 | $ | 228

Labor claims — The labor claims are principally against Bunge’s Brazilian subsidiaries. The labor claims primarily relate to dismissals, severance, health and safety, salary adjustments and supplementary retirement benefits.
Civil and other claims — The civil and other claims relate to various disputes with third parties, including suppliers and customers.
During the first quarter of 2017, Bunge received a notice from the Brazilian Administrative Council for Economic Defense ("CADE") initiating an administrative proceeding against its Brazilian subsidiary and two of its employees, certain of its former employees, several other companies in the Brazilian wheat milling industry, and others for alleged anticompetitive activities in the north and northeast of Brazil. While a co-defendant obtained an injunction to stay the proceeding in 2019, on October 24, 2022, a Brazilian appellate court reversed that injunction and the proceeding has resumed before the Brazilian CADE. Bunge expects a decision from the CADE on this proceeding in 2023. Bunge cannot at this time reasonably predict the ultimate outcome in the judicial courts of this case or sanctions, if any, that may be imposed. 
Additionally, in the second quarter of 2018, Bunge received a notification from CADE that it had extended the scope of an existing administrative proceeding relating to alleged anticompetitive practices in the Rio Grande port in Brazil to include certain of Bunge's Brazilian subsidiaries and certain former employees of those subsidiaries. The CADE's Tribunal decided that one of Bunge's Brazilian subsidiaries violated certain anticompetitive practices and, as a consequence, imposed a de minimis fine. Bunge has challenged the CADE's decision in the Brazilian judicial court and obtained an injunction against CADE's decision. Bunge does not expect the outcome to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.
Guarantees—Bunge has issued or was a party to the following guarantees at December 31, 2022:

(US$ in millions) | MaximumPotentialFuturePayments
Unconsolidated affiliates guarantee (1) | $ | 107
Residual value guarantee (2) | 337 | 
Other guarantees | 9 | 
Total | $ | 453

(1)Bunge has issued guarantees to certain financial institutions related to debt of certain of its unconsolidated affiliates. The terms of the guarantees are equal to the terms of the related financings, which have maturity dates through 2034. There are no recourse provisions or collateral that would enable Bunge to recover any amounts paid under these guarantees. In addition, certain Bunge subsidiaries have guaranteed the obligations of certain of their unconsolidated affiliates and in connection therewith have secured their guarantee obligations through a pledge to the financial institutions of certain of their unconsolidated affiliates' shares plus loans receivable from the unconsolidated affiliates in the event that the guaranteed obligations are enforced. 
On November 21, 2022, one of Bunge's unconsolidated affiliates refinanced its third-party debt structure resulting in a significant reduction in Bunge's guarantee and potential liabilities to certain financial institutions from $181 million prior to the refinance to $46 million as of December 31, 2022.

BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

Based on the amounts drawn under guaranteed debt facilities of unconsolidated affiliates at December 31, 2022, Bunge's potential liability was $94 million, and it has recorded less than $1 million of obligations related to these guarantees within Other non-current liabilities.
(2)Bunge has issued guarantees to certain financial institutions that are party to certain operating lease arrangements for railcars, barges and buildings. These guarantees provide for a minimum residual value to be received by the lessor at the conclusion of the lease term. These leases expire at various dates from 2024 through 2029. At December 31, 2022, no obligation has been recorded related to these guarantees. Any obligation recorded would be recognized in Current operating lease obligations or Non-current operating lease obligations.
Bunge Limited has provided a guarantee to the Director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture as Trustee for Bunge North America, Inc. ("BNA"), an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary, which guarantees all amounts due and owing by BNA to grain producers and/or depositors in the State of Illinois who have delivered commodities to BNA's Illinois facilities. 
Commitments—At December 31, 2022, Bunge had approximately $387 million of purchase commitments related to inventories, $284 million of freight supply agreements for ocean freight vessels and railroad freight lines not accounted for as leases, $99 million of power supply contracts, $95 million of contractual commitments related to construction in progress, and $183 million of other purchase commitments and obligations, such as take-or-pay contracts, throughput contracts, and debt commitment fees.
Bunge has also entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. Amounts on outstanding standby letter of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated to $1,592 million and $1,405 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

24. REDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS
    In connection with Bunge's initial acquisition of a 70% ownership interest in Loders, the Company entered into a put/call arrangement with the Loders' minority shareholder through which it may be required or elect to purchase the additional 30% ownership interest in Loders within a specified time frame. 
Since the acquisition of the 70% ownership in Loders, the Company classified these redeemable equity securities outside of permanent stockholders’ equity as the equity securities are redeemable at the option of the holder. The carrying amount of Redeemable noncontrolling interest was the greater of: (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interest's share of net income or loss, equity capital contributions and distributions or (ii) the redemption value. Any resulting increases in the redemption amount, in excess of the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interest's share of net income or loss, equity capital contributions and distributions, were affected via a charge against Retained earnings. Additionally, any such charges to Retained earnings would affect Net income available to Bunge common shareholders as part of Bunge's calculation of earnings per common share.

BUNGE LIMITED AND SUBSIDIARIES
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

On August 5, 2022, Bunge and the Loders minority shareholder completed a transaction in which Bunge acquired an additional 10% interest in Loders in exchange for approximately $102 million in cash, and the existing put/call arrangement over Loders' noncontrolling equity interest was terminated. Bunge's ownership interest in Loders following the transaction increased from 70% to 80%. As Loders' remaining noncontrolling interest ceased to be redeemable at the transaction date, it was reclassified from Redeemable noncontrolling interests to Noncontrolling interests within Bunge's consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of changes in equity at a value of $235 million, representing the noncontrolling interest's proportionate share in the carrying value of Loders' net assets.
25. EQUITY
Share Repurchase Program—During October 2021, Bunge's Board of Directors approved a new program for the repurchase of up to $500 million of Bunge's issued and outstanding common shares. The program has no expiration date. Under this program, 2,109,115 common shares were repurchased for $200 million during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022. As of December 31, 2022, $300 million remains outstanding for repurchases under the program. 
During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, Bunge repurchased 1,298,384 common shares for $100 million, thereby completing a previous $500 million share repurchase program, established May 2015. 
Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preference Shares—On March 18, 2022, Bunge announced all issued and outstanding shares of its 4.875% Cumulative Convertible Perpetual Preference Shares ("convertible preference shares") would automatically convert into common shares of the Company, par value $0.01 per share, effective March 23, 2022 (the "Conversion Date"). On March 18, 2022, the closing price of the common shares of the Company on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE") was $104.91, marking the 20th trading day in the previous 30 trading days that the closing price of the common shares of the Company exceeded 130% of the conversion price, triggering the Company's right under the certificate of designation for the convertible preference shares, at its option, to mandatorily convert the convertible preference shares. The conversion price adjusted from $78.1322 at December 31, 2021 to $77.8482 on February 16, 2022.
Each convertible preference share automatically converted into 1.2846 common shares of the Company on the Conversion Date and cash was paid in lieu of fractional common shares of the Company. There were 6,898,268 convertible preference shares issued and outstanding prior to the conversion, which resulted in the issuance of 8,861,515 new common shares of the Company. Additionally, in the first quarter of 2022, prior to the conversion, 1,415 convertible preference shares were voluntarily converted by preference shareholders into 1,816 common shares. As a result of the conversions, no convertible preference shares were issued or outstanding as of December 31, 2022, and all rights of the former holders of the convertible preference shares terminated, as of March 23, 2022. 
Dividends on the convertible preference shares ceased to accrue on the Conversion Date. Accordingly, holders of the convertible preference shares were not entitled to receive the $1.21875 per share dividend declared by the Company in respect of the convertible preference shares on February 23, 2022, and payable to holders of record on May 15, 2022. Following the conversion, holders of the convertible preference shares as of the Conversion Date were entitled to receive the $0.525 per share dividend declared by the Company with respect to the common shares on February 23, 2022, but only to the extent such holder remained a holder of record of common shares of the Company on May 19, 2022. 
The convertible preference shares accrued dividends at an annual rate of 4.875%. Dividends were cumulative from the date of issuance and were payable, quarterly in arrears, on each March 1, June 1, September 1, and December 1, when, and if declared by Bunge's Board of Directors. The dividends may be paid in cash, common shares, or a combination thereof. Accumulated unpaid dividends on the convertible preference shares did not bear interest. In the year ended December 31, 2022, Bunge paid $8 million of dividends in arrears in cash and for both of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, Bunge recorded $34 million of dividends, paid in cash, on its convertible preference shares.
Dividends on common shares—On November 14, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.625 per common share, payable on March 2, 2023, to shareholders of record on February 16, 2023. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors declared total dividends on common shares of $2.40 per common share.

(1)Bunge has significant operating subsidiaries in Brazil, Argentina, North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The functional currency of Bunge's subsidiaries is generally the local currency. The assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars from the local currency at month-end exchange rates, and the resulting foreign currency translation gains (losses) are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss. 
(2)On February 28, 2022, the Company, together with plan participants and related employee unions, agreed to the transition of one of the Company's international defined benefit pension plans to a multi-employer pension plan. Following the transition, the Company accounts for the multi-employer plan similar to a defined contribution plan, resulting in full settlement of the related defined benefit plan obligations.
In connection with the settlement, during the twelve months ended December 31, 2022, the Company reclassified $27 million (net of $10 million tax expense) in unamortized actuarial gains from Accumulated other comprehensive loss, of which $19 million was attributable to Bunge (net of $7 million in tax expense), and $8 million was attributable to redeemable non-controlling interest (net of $3 million in tax expense).
The year ended December 31, 2022 also included the release of cumulative translation adjustments upon the disposition of substantially all of its wheat milling business in Mexico of $158 million, which had been previously reserved through Cost of goods sold, in the consolidated statements of income in the year ended December 31, 2021 (see Note 3- Acquisitions and Dispositions).

27. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, Bunge recognized approximately $65 million, $61 million, and $71 million, respectively, of total compensation expense related to its stock option and restricted stock unit equity awards.
During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, Bunge granted equity awards under the 2016 Equity Incentive Plan (the "2016 EIP"), a shareholder approved plan. Under the 2016 EIP, the Compensation Committee of Bunge's Board of Directors may grant equity-based awards to officers, employees, consultants, and independent contractors in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (performance-based or time-based) or other equity-based awards. Shares issued under the 2016 EIP may consist, in whole or in part, of authorized and unissued shares, treasury shares, or shares reacquired by the Company in any manner, or a combination thereof.
Stock Option Awards—Options to purchase Bunge Limited common shares are granted with an exercise price equal to the grant date fair market value of Bunge common stock, vest over service periods that generally range from one to three years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. Vesting may be accelerated in certain circumstances as provided in the plans or associated award agreements. Grant date fair value is recognized as compensation expense on a straight-line basis for option grants, and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. Bunge elected to cease awarding stock options to its employees beginning January 1, 2021. Any awards previously granted will continue to vest as awarded.
Restricted Stock Units—Restricted stock units ("RSUs") give recipients the right to receive shares of Bunge common stock upon the lapse of related restrictions determined by the Compensation Committee. The Company has two types of RSUs: time-based restricted stock units ("TBRSUs") and performance-based restricted stock units ("PBRSUs"). Restrictions on TBRSUs are based on continued service by the recipient through the designated term. Restrictions on PBRSUs are based on the achievement of certain performance targets, including earnings per share, return on invested capital, and relative total shareholder return, with the number of PBRSUs earned varying based on the level of achievement against these performance targets. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period for restricted stock units. RSUs generally vest over periods ranging from one to three years. Vesting may be accelerated under certain circumstances as defined in the plans or associated award agreements. RSUs are generally settled in shares of Bunge common stock upon satisfaction of the applicable vesting terms, and forfeitures are recognized as they occur. In locations where share settlement may be prohibited under local law, RSUs are settled in cash. At the time of settlement, a participant holding a vested restricted stock unit will also be entitled to receive corresponding accrued dividend equivalent share payments.
Bunge also established the Bunge Limited 2017 Non-Employee Directors Equity Incentive Plan (the "2017 NED Plan"), a shareholder approved plan. Under the 2017 NED Plan, the Compensation Committee may grant equity-based awards to non-employee directors of Bunge Limited. Awards may consist of restricted stock, restricted stock units, deferred restricted stock units, and non-statutory stock options.
Restricted stock units granted to non-employee directors generally vest on the first anniversary of the grant date, provided the director continues to serve on the Board until such date, and are settled in shares of Bunge Limited common stock. At the time of settlement, a participant holding a vested restricted stock unit is also entitled to receive corresponding accrued dividend equivalent share payments.
The fair value of each stock option granted under any of Bunge's equity incentive plans is estimated on the grant date using the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. Assumptions for the three most recent years are noted in the following table. The expected volatility of Bunge's common shares is a weighted average of historical volatility calculated using the daily closing price of Bunge's shares up to the grant date and implied volatilities on open option contracts on Bunge's stock as of the grant date. Bunge uses historical employee exercise behavior for valuation purposes. The expected option term of granted options represents the period of time that the granted options are expected to be outstanding based on historical experience and giving consideration for the contractual terms, vesting periods and expectations of future employee behavior. The risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury zero-coupon bonds with a term equal to the expected option term of the respective grants and grant dates.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)

(1)During the year ended December 31, 2022, Bunge issued a total of 816,192 common shares, net of common shares withheld to cover taxes, including related common shares representing accrued dividends, with a weighted-average fair value of $52.52 per share upon vesting of TBRSUs and PBRSUs.
(2)Includes accrued unvested dividends, which are payable in Bunge's common shares upon vesting of underlying restricted stock units.
(3)Includes 15,764 TBRSUs to be cash settled.
At December 31, 2022, there was approximately $90 million of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock units granted under the equity incentive plans, which is expected to be recognized over the next two years. The total fair value of restricted stock units vested during the year ended December 31, 2022 was approximately $63 million.
Common Shares Reserved for Share-Based Awards—The 2017 NED Plan and the 2016 EIP provide that 320,000 and 10,900,000 common shares, respectively, are to be reserved for grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other awards under the plans. During 2021, Bunge shareholders approved an increase to the 2017 NED Plan of 200,000 common shares, and during 2020, Bunge shareholders approved an increase to the 2016 EIP of 5,100,000 common shares. At December 31, 2022, 176,569 and 3,639,750 common shares were available for future grants under the 2017 NED Plan and the 2016 EIP, respectively. No shares are currently available for grant under any other Bunge Limited equity incentive plan.
28. LEASES
    The Company routinely leases storage facilities, transportation equipment, land, and office facilities which are typically classified as operating leases. The accounting for some of the Company's leases may require significant judgment when determining whether a contract is or contains a lease, the lease term, and the likelihood of renewal or termination options. Leases with an initial term of more than 12 months are recognized on the balance sheet as right-of-use assets (Operating lease assets) and lease liabilities for the obligation to make payments under such leases (Current operating lease obligations and Non-current operating lease obligations). As of the lease commencement date, the lease liability is initially measured as the present value of lease payments not yet paid. The lease asset is initially measured equal to the lease liability and adjusted for lease payments made at or before lease commencement (e.g., prepaid rent), lease incentives, and any initial direct costs. Over time, the lease liability is reduced for lease payments made and the lease asset is reduced through expense, classified as either Cost of goods sold or Selling, general and administrative expense depending upon the nature of the lease. Lease assets are subject to review for impairment in a manner consistent with Property, plant and equipment. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less ("short-term leases") are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets and the related lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
    The Company’s leases range in length of term, with a weighted average remaining lease term of 3.9 years, but with one water rights lease for up to 89 years. Renewal options are generally exercisable solely at the Company’s discretion. When a renewal option is reasonably certain to be exercised, such additional terms are considered when calculating the associated operating lease asset and liability. When determining the lease liability at commencement of the lease, the present value of lease payments is generally based on the Company’s incremental borrowing rate determined using a portfolio approach and the Company’s incremental cost of debt, adjusted to arrive at the rate in the applicable country and for the applicable term of the lease, as the rate implicit in the lease is generally not readily determinable. As of December 31, 2022, such weighted average discount rate was 4.5%. 
    Certain of the Company’s freight supply agreements for ocean freight vessels and rail cars may include rental payments that are variable in nature. Variable payments on time charter agreements for ocean freight vessels under freight supply agreements are dependent on then current market daily hire rates. Variable payments for certain rail cars can be based on volumes, and in some cases, benchmark interest rates. All such variable payments, other than those that depend on an index or rate, are not included in the calculation of the associated operating lease asset or liability subsequent to the inception date of the associated lease and are recorded as expense in the period in which the adjustment to the variable payment obligation is incurred. Certain of the Company’s lease agreements related to railcars and barges contain residual value guarantees (see Note 22- Commitments and Contingencies). None of the Company’s lease agreements contain material restrictive covenants.

Additionally, from time to time, the Company may enter into re-let agreements to sell the right to use ocean freight vessels under time charter agreements when excess capacity is available.
    The Company is expected to have additional operating leases for ocean freight vessels that have not yet commenced, of $281 million over the lives of the leases, as well as subleases for ocean freight vessels that have not yet commenced with income of $17 million over the lives of the subleases. The operating leases are expected to commence in 2024 and 2025, with lease terms ranging between five and seven years. The subleases are expected to commence early in 2023, with lease terms of up to two years.

29. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company's operations are organized, managed and classified into four reportable segments - Agribusiness, Refined and Specialty Oils, Milling, and Sugar and Bioenergy, organized based upon their similar economic characteristics, products and services offered, production processes, types and classes of customer, and distribution methods. The Company’s remaining operations are not reportable segments, as defined by the applicable accounting standard, and are classified as Corporate and Other.
The Agribusiness segment is characterized by both inputs and outputs being agricultural commodities and thus high volume and low margin. The Refined and Specialty Oils segment involves the processing, production and marketing of products derived from vegetable oils. The Milling segment involves the processing, production and marketing of products derived primarily from wheat and corn. The Sugar & Bioenergy segment primarily comprises the net earnings from the Company’s 50% interest in BP Bunge Bioenergia, a joint venture with BP. 
Corporate and Other includes salaries and overhead for corporate functions that are not allocated to the Company’s individual reporting segments because the operating performance of such reporting segments is evaluated by the Company's chief operating decision maker exclusive of these items, as well as certain other activities including Bunge Ventures, the Company's captive insurance program, accounts receivable securitization activities, and certain income tax assets and liabilities. 
Transfers between the segments are generally valued at market. The segment revenues generated from these transfers are shown in the following table as "Inter-segment revenues."

Total segment earnings before interest and taxes ("EBIT") is an operating performance measure used by Bunge's management to evaluate segment operating activities. Bunge's management believes total segment EBIT is a useful measure of operating profitability, since the measure allows for an evaluation of the performance of its segments without regard to its financing methods or capital structure. In addition, EBIT is a financial measure that is widely used by analysts and investors in Bunge's industries.
