Business Overview
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing our lead clinical candidate, CIN-107, for the treatment of hypertension and other cardio-renal diseases. CIN-107 is a highly selective, oral small molecule inhibitor of aldosterone synthase, the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of aldosterone in the adrenal gland. CIN-107 inhibits aldosterone synthase activity, providing a differentiated mechanism for lowering aldosterone activity via a reduction of aldosterone synthesis, with the goal of providing an improved treatment for patients suffering from hypertension, or high blood pressure. We are conducting multiple Phase 2 clinical trials using CIN-107 in differing populations of patients, all of whom are hypertensive. The most advanced of our trials, called BrigHtn, is being conducted in patients whose blood pressure is not controlled despite treatment with three or more antihypertensive agents, one of which must be a diuretic; these patients are designated as having treatment resistant hypertension, or rHTN. In March 2022, we completed patient enrollment in the BrigHtn trial with 275 randomized patients. A separate Phase 2 clinical trial, referred to as HALO, is evaluating CIN-107’s effects on patients whose blood pressure is not controlled despite treatment with up to two antihypertensive agents, referred to as uncontrolled hypertension, or uHTN. HALO was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2021. The protocol was recently amended to represent a more comprehensive and real-world patient population as well as to enable us to better characterize the relationship between baseline aldosterone levels and blood pressure response across a broader spectrum of aldosterone values. A third patient population being investigated has a condition called primary aldosteronism, or PA, where overproduction of aldosterone by non-malignant tumors or abnormal collections of aldosterone-producing cells in the adrenal glands leads to an aggressive form of hypertension. The trial in PA patients, referred to as spark-PA, was also initiated in 2021 and we have recently amended the protocol to accelerate recruitment in this less commonly diagnosed form of hypertension. Our fourth Phase 2 clinical trial is testing the utility of CIN-107 in lowering the blood pressure of patients with chronic kidney disease, or CKD, as well as exploring the potential impact of CIN-107 on slowing the progression of renal disease using biomarkers of that progression. The CKD trial is expected to commence in the first half of 2022.
 Hypertension is one of the world’s leading causes of mortality. According to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the U.S. CDC, approximately 500,000 people still die every year in the United States with uncontrolled blood pressure listed as a primary or secondary cause of death. Despite decades of understanding the importance of controlling hypertension and the widespread availability of multiple approved therapies, only 43.7% of the 116 million U.S. adults with hypertension achieve blood pressure levels of less than 140/90 mm Hg. In addition, many professional medical societies have published more recent guidelines that report that blood pressures less than 130/80 mm Hg, or even lower, would improve cardiovascular outcomes in sub-groups of patients. Of those patients taking one or more antihypertensive agents, it is estimated that approximately 35% have uncontrolled blood pressure. Although the evidence for the benefits of reducing blood pressure is overwhelming and has consistently supported the medical community’s recommendations to drive blood pressure to lower levels, the current standard-of-care has not meaningfully changed, with no new classes of antihypertensive agents approved in more than a decade.
 Aldosterone is a steroid hormone synthesized in the adrenal gland that regulates water and salt balance in the human body. It causes retention of water and salt by the kidney, via activation of mineralocorticoid receptors expressed on kidney cells, that then regulate a series of gene expression events that contribute to the pathogenesis of hypertension. These so-called genomic effects of aldosterone are accompanied by other hormonal responses to aldosterone (so-called non-genomic effects) that do not depend on mineralocorticoid receptor mediated regulation of nuclear gene transcription and are associated with pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic tissue changes, increases in cellular oxidative stress, as well as cardiac muscle cell hypertrophy and remodeling. Increasing evidence shows a correlation between these non-genomic effects of aldosterone and a worsening of patient outcomes, particularly in patients who have heart disease or kidney disease. Given these potentially deleterious effects of aldosterone, inhibiting its effects is a well understood mechanism of action for the treatment of hypertension and other cardio-renal diseases, such as PA and CKD.
 There are multiple standard-of-care antihypertensive agents currently available, including angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE, inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers, or ARBs, which are designed to reduce angiotensin activity but can also secondarily produce a lowering of aldosterone levels. Mineralocorticoid antagonists, or MRAs, which block the effects of aldosterone at the mineralocorticoid receptor, typically cause aldosterone levels to rise, though they block the genomic effects triggered by aldosterone. Despite the widespread availability and use of these antihypertensive agents, most of which are available as generic products, each class of drugs currently available is associated with significant limitations, including limited efficacy, limited duration of aldosterone lowering, or significant side effects. Given both the importance of reducing aldosterone and the limitations of currently available therapies, we believe that CIN-107 has the potential to have a significant impact on the treatment paradigm for hypertension and other

cardio-renal diseases. The ability to lower aldosterone levels by specially inhibiting the enzyme responsible for its synthesis is the differentiated technology that CIN-107 represents.
Our Corporate History
 We were incorporated in March 2018 and founded as a subsidiary of CinRx Pharma, LLC, or CinRx, a biotechnology company focused on developing novel therapeutics. In May 2019, we entered into an agreement with F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann La-Roche Inc., whom we collectively refer to in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as Roche, for an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license to certain Roche technology to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize a novel aldosterone synthase inhibitor compound, CIN-107, for any and all diseases and conditions. In connection with the closing of our Series A preferred stock financing and the execution of our in-licensing transaction with Roche, we were spun out as an independent company. We completed our Series B preferred stock financing in October 2021 and on January 11, 2022, we completed an initial public offering, or the IPO, of our common stock. For further information on our Series A and Series B preferred stock financing and our IPO, please refer to "Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Our Pipeline
We are developing CIN-107 for the treatment of multiple diseases where aldosterone plays a significant role in disease pathophysiology, including hypertension and PA. We are also exploring its utility in ameliorating complications of CKD. To support the advancement of this “pipeline-in-a-product” opportunity, we are currently conducting three Phase 2 clinical trials of CIN-107 for different indications and patient populations and expect to initiate a fourth Phase 2 clinical trial in the first half of 2022. The following table summarizes our CIN-107 pipeline across multiple indications.
 
* We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CIN-107 in patients with CKD who have uncontrolled blood pressure in the first half of 2022. As we explore the utility of CIN-107 in treating hypertension in patient with CKD, we plan to evaluate the path for maximizing the potential value of CIN-107, including as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatments for the treatment of CKD. 
Our Strategy
 Our strategy is focused on developing and commercializing CIN-107 for the treatment of multiple cardio-renal diseases in which aldosterone is known to play a significant role in the disease pathophysiology, including hypertension and PA. We are also exploring its utility in ameliorating complications of CKD. Key elements of our strategy include the following:
 •Advance CIN-107 through clinical development for the treatment of rHTN. We are currently conducting our BrigHtn trial in patients with rHTN, and expect topline data in the second half of 2022. While we expect to seek a label for hypertension broadly, if CIN-107 is approved for use, we plan to focus our initial commercial efforts on patients with rHTN, which represents a patient population of approximately 12-15 million individuals in the United States, approximately 5-7 million in Europe, and approximately 23-30 million in China. Resistant hypertensive patients have limited treatment options and significant unmet medical need.
 •Expand the hypertension opportunity for CIN-107 to include patients with uHTN and potential use as an earlier line of blood pressure therapy. Despite the widespread availability of multiple antihypertensive agents, 


a large number of patients are considered to have uHTN because they are unable to reach their target blood pressure goals on the therapies they are currently prescribed. There is growing evidence in scientific literature demonstrating that elevated aldosterone levels play a direct role in the pathogenesis of hypertension in this broader hypertensive population. We believe a highly selective aldosterone synthase inhibitor, like CIN-107, may address one of the primary underlying causes of hypertension, thereby allowing more patients to achieve their target blood pressure goal with fewer antihypertensive agents. To evaluate the potential of CIN-107 as an earlier line of therapy and in a broader patient population, we initiated our HALO trial in the fourth quarter of 2021 in patients who have failed to achieve blood pressure control on up to two antihypertensive agents.
 •Leverage the clinical development of CIN-107 in hypertension, if successful, to efficiently develop CIN-107 for the potential treatment of PA. PA results from the autonomous production of excess aldosterone and is estimated to affects approximately 5-10% of the total hypertensive population in the United States. This population is associated with worse outcomes and higher risks of cardiovascular events than the general hypertensive population. The overproduction of aldosterone in patients with PA is caused by unilateral or bilateral adrenal adenoma, and in some cases, adrenal carcinoma. Therefore, the ideal non-surgical treatment of patients with PA would involve both the normalization of blood pressure and reduction of aldosterone synthesis to normal levels. By addressing these elements, the risk of long-term cardiovascular and renal complications may be reduced. CIN-107 exhibits highly specific and potent inhibitory activity of human aldosterone synthase, the enzyme responsible for aldosterone production and could provide the most precisely targeted approach to treating patients with PA. We initiated our spark-PA trial in 2021 to evaluate the potential of CIN-107 as a treatment for hypertension in patients with PA.
 •Develop CIN-107 as a potentially differentiated treatment for CKD by modifying disease progression. Multiple third-party clinical trials and meta-analyses have demonstrated that blocking the effect of aldosterone reduces proteinuria and delays the progression of CKD. Long-term use of current standard-of-care agents blocking activity in the RAAS pathway for CKD are associated with aldosterone breakthrough, where patients experience aldosterone levels reverting back to or exceeding baseline aldosterone levels which may lead to poorer patient outcomes. Based on the results of our preclinical and Phase 1 clinical trials of CIN-107, we plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CIN-107 in patients with CKD who have uncontrolled blood pressure in the first half of 2022.
 •Opportunistically evaluate strategic partnerships to maximize the potential value of CIN-107.  As we advance the development of CIN-107 across multiple diseases and continue to generate additional non-clinical and clinical data, we plan to evaluate the path for realizing the potential value of CIN-107, including in combination with other treatments for certain indications, such as CKD. For certain geographies, we may opportunistically enter into strategic partnerships, inside and outside of the United States, to accelerate development activities in order to realize the commercial potential of CIN-107. Lastly, in disease areas where aldosterone has been shown to play a significant role in disease progression, such as heart failure, which we do not currently plan to pursue on our own, we may also seek to partner with one or more third parties in order to expand the indications where aldosterone lowering might benefit patients and further broaden the commercial potential of CIN-107.
 
CIN-107—A Highly Selective Aldosterone Synthase Inhibitor
 Overview
 CIN-107 is a highly selective, oral, small molecule inhibitor of aldosterone synthase, the enzyme responsible for the production of aldosterone in the adrenal gland. Based on its unique mechanism of action, we believe CIN-107 has the potential to achieve the goal of reducing the deleterious genomic and non-genomic effects of aldosterone, while causing modest effects on plasma potassium and sodium levels and no clinically significant change in blood cortisol levels.


Mechanism of Action of CIN-107
 Directly inhibiting aldosterone synthesis has long been a goal in therapeutic drug development as the relationship between elevated levels of aldosterone and the progression of multiple diseases is well understood. However, the challenge has been developing a molecule with the ability to safely inhibit aldosterone production without negatively impacting cortisol synthesis. The major enzymes responsible for the synthesis of aldosterone and cortisol share approximately 93% amino acid sequence similarity, and therefore, a highly selective aldosterone synthesis inhibitor is required to avoid lowering serum cortisol levels. Multiple programs in development by others have been discontinued over the past several years due to, what we believe is, their product candidates’ lack of selectivity, which resulted in the simultaneous inhibition of both aldosterone and cortisol production. Off-target suppression of cortisol production would have the potential to compromise stress and immunologic responses, adversely affect metabolic functions and potentially increased the risk of mortality from severe adrenal insufficiency.
 CIN-107 was designed to be highly selective in its inhibition of steroid hormone synthesis to specifically overcome this risk of cortisol production. CIN-107 selectively targets aldosterone synthase, which is encoded by the CYP11B2 gene while having a much lower affinity for blocking the activity of 11ß-hydroxylase, the enzyme responsible for cortisol synthesis, which is encoded by the CYP11B1 gene. In multiple preclinical in vivo studies, CIN-107 significantly lowered aldosterone levels without affecting cortisol levels across a wide range of doses. Similar observations were made in two separate Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers. We observed a dose-dependent reduction of plasma aldosterone levels of up to 85%-90% in normal volunteers receiving single doses of the drug at doses up to 360 mg, while patients receiving 1.5 mg to 5 mg doses for 10 consecutive days demonstrated 65% to 71% reductions in their plasma aldosterone levels. These reductions were compared to baseline levels measured the day prior to initial dosing and were not observed in individuals receiving a placebo. Importantly, no effects on cortisol production were observed at doses up to 360 mg (the highest dose evaluated) in the single ascending dose studies or up to 5 mg/d when administered for 10 days, in our multiple ascending dose treatment study.
 Phase 1 Development of CIN-107
  A robust Phase 1 clinical development program for CIN-107 has been conducted, with approximately 180 individuals dosed across multiple clinical trials to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of CIN-107. CIN-107 was shown to be well tolerated in healthy volunteers across all Phase 1 clinical trials conducted to date, with no serious adverse events, or SAEs, or treatment-emergent adverse events, or TEAEs, leading to treatment withdrawal associated with CIN-107. In addition to the single ascending dose, or SAD, and multiple ascending dose, or MAD, studies detailed below, CIN-107 has been evaluated in 14 healthy volunteers to demonstrate lack of food effect and biocompatibility from oral solution to tablet. CIN-107 has also been studied in a drug-to-drug interaction study with metformin in 27 healthy volunteers. Metformin was well tolerated when administered alone or 2 hours after a dose of CIN107. CIN107 did not result in changes in metformin plasma concentrations when compared to levels following administration of metformin alone. In addition, a Phase 1 clinical trial was conducted in subjects with varying degrees of renal function. A single 10 mg dose of CIN-107 was well tolerated when administered to individuals with moderate to severe renal impairment or kidney failure (on hemodialysis). There were no noteworthy increases in systemic exposure or decreases in CLR in individuals with impaired renal function. Dose adjustment of CIN-107 based on metabolism effects is therefore not expected to be required.
Single Ascending Dose (SAD) Phase 1 Clinical Trial
 A two-part, single ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial of CIN-107 in healthy male volunteers evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of a single dose of CIN-107 ranging from 1 mg to 360 mg. Two hours after the administration of a single dose of CIN-107, the majority of subjects in part 1 of the trial underwent an ACTH challenge, which stimulates the synthesis of both aldosterone and cortisol. Four hours later, the subjects participated in a standing aldosterone challenge, which involved moving from a sitting position to a standing position, a movement that immediately increases aldosterone levels as a normal physiological response.
 CIN-107 reduced plasma aldosterone levels in a dose-dependent manner following the ACTH challenge and, in contrast to placebo, reduced levels were maintained following the standing challenge. Significant reductions of 70% to 80% in aldosterone levels were observed at the 1 mg and 3 mg dose levels, and near complete suppression of aldosterone was observed at the 10 mg and higher doses of CIN-107. The reductions in aldosterone levels increased in a dose-dependent manner until 10 mg, after which the reduction levels plateaued through 360 mg. No effect on plasma cortisol levels was observed at all dose levels tested. The results of this trial demonstrated CIN-107’s ability to selectively inhibit aldosterone synthesis without meaningfully impacting cortisol synthesis.


CIN-107 was well tolerated in healthy volunteers across all doses evaluated in the SAD trial, with no SAEs, treatment discontinuations due to a TEAE or deaths reported. No dose-limiting toxicities were reported and the maximum tolerated dose, or MTD, was at the highest dose tested of 360 mg. The most frequently reported AEs following the administration of a single dose of CIN-107 were headache, nasopharyngitis, diarrhea, asthenia, dizziness and nausea. The majority of AEs reported were considered to be mild and not related to CIN-107. AEs considered to be either moderate in intensity or related to CIN-107 included: two events of moderate gastroenteritis (one from the 180 mg dose cohort and one from the placebo group); one event of dizziness considered to be related to CIN-107; one event of fractured coccyx; and one event of concussion. There were no AEs related to markedly abnormal safety laboratory values reported and there were no clinically significant or dose-dependent changes observed over time in vital signs, ocular assessments, cardiac function as measured by electrocardiogram, or ECG, or corrected QT interval by Fridericia formula, or QTcF.
 This trial demonstrated a desirable pharmacokinetics profile for CIN-107 that is supportive of once-daily dosing. CIN-107 was rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations in the plasma occurring within one to two hours after administration. CIN-107 plasma concentrations declined from peak in a biphasic manner, with a mean half-life of 25 to 31 hours, which makes CIN-107 conducive to once daily dosing. It was also observed that dietary salt intake did not affect the pharmacokinetics properties of CIN-107.
 Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) Phase 1 Clinical Trial
 A randomized, double-blind, multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of multiple daily doses of CIN-107 ranging from 0.5 mg to 5 mg. A total of 56 subjects were randomized into the trial, with 42 subjects receiving once-daily doses of CIN-107 and 14 subjects receiving once-daily doses of placebo for ten days. In both groups, subjects were placed either on a low salt diet or a normal salt diet. Subjects in the initial two cohorts were on a low salt diet in order to stimulate aldosterone levels and to enable the evaluation of safety in potential patients who may be following a low salt diet. Subjects in these two cohorts underwent three ACTH challenges: on day -1 (prior to receiving their first dose of CIN-107), on day 1 (after receiving their first dose of CIN-107) and on day 10 (after receiving their tenth dose of CIN-107).
 As shown in the figure below, average aldosterone reductions of 65% to 71% were observed after ten days of once-daily dosing of CIN-107 at doses of 1.5 mg or greater, regardless of dietary salt intake. However, the reductions in aldosterone levels appeared to be greater in the subjects who received a low salt diet. These findings are consistent with those of the SAD results discussed above, though the plateau appears to be occurring at slightly lower doses when the drug is given continuously.
 
CIN-107 Demonstrated Dose-Dependent Reductions in Plasma Aldosterone in Healthy Volunteers
 
Additionally, there was an appropriate increase in cortisol levels after ACTH stimulation, and no meaningful difference in the cortisol responses between the ACTH challenge given before administration of CIN-107 and the ACTH challenge given before the tenth dose of CIN-107.
 Once-daily administration of CIN-107 for ten days was well tolerated in healthy volunteers across all doses tested in the MAD trial. There were no deaths, SAEs or treatment discontinuations due to a TEAE reported, and there were no apparent increases in incidence or severity of AEs with increasing doses of CIN-107. The most common TEAEs among subjects receiving CIN-107 were headache, postural dizziness and dizziness. All TEAEs reported were mild in severity, except for one moderate event of ventricular tachycardia in a subject receiving placebo. There were no clinically

meaningful changes observed in laboratory parameters, physical examination results or cardiac function as measured by ECG, including no meaningful changes in QTcF.
 In this trial, mild and dose-dependent increases in plasma potassium levels and decreases in plasma sodium levels were observed with corresponding changes in urine sodium and potassium levels. However, despite this initial increase in the urine sodium to potassium ratio, which indicates that sodium loss in the urine is greater than the potassium retention, the ratio was normalized by Day 10 of treatment, suggesting that the balance between sodium excretion and potassium absorption was restored.
 The pharmacokinetics observed in this trial were consistent with what was observed in the SAD trial. The data suggests CIN-107 was rapidly absorbed, with maximum concentrations in the plasma occurring within two to three hours after administration. Systemic exposure to CIN-107 demonstrated a predictable increase in plasma concentration and generally in a dose-dependent manner across the dose levels tested. Based on the observed average half-life of CIN-107 of 26 to 31 hours, steady state plasma concentrations of CIN-107 were achieved within approximately 5 days of once-daily dosing. At steady state, the plasma accumulation of CIN-107 was observed to be approximately two times higher with daily dosing as compared to a single dose of CIN-107, which suggests that the blood levels at the 1.5 mg and 5 mg doses in the MAD trial should be comparable to the 3 mg and 10 mg doses in the SAD trial.
 Overview of Hypertension
 Hypertension, which is defined by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association as resting blood pressure above 130/80 mm Hg, is generally acknowledged to be one of the most common preventable risk factors for premature death worldwide. Though often asymptomatic, hypertension significantly increases the risk of heart disease, stroke and kidney disease, amongst other diseases. It is estimated that as much as 20% of the global population suffers from hypertension, and the U.S. CDC estimated that as many as 116 million Americans could be hypertensive and that hypertension costs the United States approximately $131 billion per year.
 The main classifications of hypertension are primary hypertension and secondary hypertension. Primary, or essential, hypertension, which accounts for over 90% of total cases, is not associated with any identifiable cause. However, it may be associated with genetic or lifestyle factors. Secondary hypertension, which affects approximately 10% of hypertensive individuals, occurs when elevated blood pressure is attributable to other medical conditions, such as kidney disease or PA.
 The current standard-of-care for patients newly diagnosed with hypertension is based on a set of guidelines set forth by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association. Depending on baseline blood pressure levels, these guidelines recommend the patient typically begin with lifestyle modifications and then, assuming blood pressure is not controlled, the initiating of treatment with antihypertensive agents would follow. Those agents selected primarily from the following four classes of drugs:
 •Thiazide diuretics, which increase fluid excretion from the kidney by blocking reabsorption of sodium and chloride in the nephron;
 •ACE inhibitors, which inhibit the RAAS axis by blocking the action of angiotensin converting enzyme in the lungs;
 •ARBs, which block the effects of angiotensin II at the level of the angiotensin receptor; and
 •Calcium channel blockers, which slow cardiac contractions by preventing calcium from entering the cells of the heart and arteries.
 When baseline blood pressure is relatively high, initial therapy can be comprised of a combination of two antihypertensive agents given separately or in fixed dose combination pills. If patients are not adequately controlled on the initial treatment prescribed, physicians may decide to increase the dose of the agents and/or add additional hypertensive agents to a patient’s treatment regimen. However, despite the widespread availability and use of many generic antihypertensive agents, as well as the general awareness of the dire consequences of hypertension, the proportion of patients with uncontrolled blood pressure continues to grow. In a 2020 study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, it was shown that the percentage of Americans with hypertension, with blood pressure levels above 140/90 mm Hg in this study, increased from 51.5% in 2007/08 to 56.3% in 2017/18.
 Patients who fail to maintain blood pressure levels of 130/80 mm Hg or less, despite being compliant with at least three antihypertensive agents, including a diuretic, are considered to have rHTN. The rHTN patient population represents an estimated 17% to 20% of the total hypertensive population in the United States, or approximately 12-15 million individuals. For these patients, treatment options are limited and the current standard-of-care is to introduce an MRA

agent to their antihypertensive regimen. Patients with rHTN have approximately five times the number of cardiovascular events per 100 patient-years measured in hypertensive patients whose blood pressure is controlled. MRAs inhibit the effects of aldosterone by preventing aldosterone from binding to the mineralocorticoid receptor. However, MRAs, such as spironolactone, are associated with multiple adverse effects, including a variety of anti-androgenic effects such as breast tenderness and enlargement in men, decreased libido in men and menstrual irregularities in women. In addition, spironolactone treatment can lead to potentially harmful increases in blood potassium levels. Due to these side effects associated with MRAs, many patients are unable to tolerate these agents over the long-term. Newer generations of MRAs, which are non-steroidal and more selective than earlier generations, are in clinical development and have demonstrated less significant potassium fluctuations than observed with currently available MRAs, but appear to retain the aldosterone elevating effects and the inability to mitigate the mineralocorticoid receptor-independent effects of aldosterone.
 CIN-107 for the Treatment of Hypertension
  It is generally understood that lowering aldosterone levels, regardless of baseline levels, should result in a reduction of blood pressure. We plan to evaluate the potential efficacy of CIN-107 across the continuum of hypertensive patients, including those with uHTN, where there remains a significant unmet medical need.
We are currently conducting our BrigHtn trial in hypertensive patients who failed to achieve blood pressure control on three or more antihypertensive agents, including a diuretic, at their maximally tolerated doses. We chose the rHTN patient population for our first Phase 2 clinical trial of CIN-107 based on the high unmet medical need among these patients, the likelihood of reimbursement from payors for this population based on our market analysis, if approved, and the expected translatability of data from this very difficult-to-treat patient population to less severe hypertensive patients. If our clinical trials are successful, we believe CIN-107 has the potential to improve the treatment options for patients with hypertension, including potential earlier in the treatment paradigm of hypertension. In March 2022, we completed our patient enrollment with 275 randomized patients, and we believe we are on track to deliver final topline data from BrigHtn is expected in the second half of 2022.
 In addition to our ongoing BrigHtn trial, we recently initiated our HALO trial in hypertensive patients who have failed to achieve blood pressure control on up to two antihypertensive agents at its maximally tolerated dosages.
 Phase 2 BrigHtn Clinical Trial in rHTN
 Our ongoing BrigHtn trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group, dose-ranging Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CIN-107 for the treatment of hypertension. In March 2022, we completed our patient enrollment with 275 randomized patients who are adherent to a stable regimen of at least three antihypertensive agents, including one diuretic, for at least four weeks prior to randomization. To ensure adherence, a central pharmacy provides screened patients with their regimen of background hypertensive medications for two weeks followed by an additional 2-week single-blind run-in period, during which adherence to background medications, as measured by pill counts, must be at least 70% in order to be eligible for randomization. Following the 2-week single-blind run-in period, eligible patients who continue to meet the elevated blood pressure criteria were initially randomized on a 1:1:1 basis to receive 12 weeks of treatment with once-daily oral doses of 1 mg of CIN-107, 2 mg of CIN-107 or placebo. The primary endpoint of this trial is the change from baseline in mean seated systolic blood pressure, or SBP, as measured by Automated Office Blood Pressure Measurement, or AOBPM, following 12 weeks of treatment. The secondary endpoints of this clinical trial are (i) the change from baseline in mean seated diastolic blood pressure, or DBP, and (ii) the percentage of patients achieving a seated blood pressure response below 130/80 mm Hg, both after 12 weeks of treatment.
 Our BrigHtn trial is a placebo-controlled trial. Placebo effect has been reported in many studies, including hypertension trials. In a publication describing the meta-analysis of a series of hypertension trials that led to the approval by FDA of five antihypertensive drugs (azilsartan, aliskiren, nebivolol, eplerenone and olmesartan) since 2000, the authors described that blood pressure fell by 5.92 mm Hg on average in the non-treatment- resistant hypertension studies in the placebo arm across 52 trials involving 7,451 subjects. The authors also reported on eight resistant hypertension trials in 694 patients, where the average blood pressure reduction in the placebo arm was 8.76 mm Hg. Based on such observations by others, we consistently designed our trials with a placebo-controlled arm wherever relevant.
 When this trial was planned, we did not have any clinical data showing the reduction in blood pressure as a function of a reduction in aldosterone levels. As expected, the Phase 1 clinical trials in healthy volunteers did not demonstrate significant blood pressure reduction, as these subjects were not hypertensive. Therefore, as shown in the figure below, our BrigHtn trial was designed as an adaptive design trial, which allowed us the flexibility to add an additional dose cohort following a preliminary safety data review.
 

Design of Our Phase 2 BrigHtn Clinical Trial
 

Preliminary Safety Data Review Conducted by the DRC
 The Data Review Committee, or DRC, conducted the preliminary safety data review in the first half of 2021 after the first 39 randomized patients either completed 12 weeks of treatment or withdrew from the trial. We intentionally scheduled the DRC review at an early point of the trial in order to allow us sufficient time to add and collect data on a fourth dose cohort without substantially extending the duration of the ongoing trial.
 The DRC conducted its preliminary safety review based on data from 34 patients who had completed the trial as well as five patients who had discontinued treatment or had withdrawn from the trial prematurely. The DRC reviewed clinical and laboratory safety data and vital sign information, including blood pressure levels, of the 39 patients included in the review, all of which was aggregated by dose cohort. Based on their review, the DRC recommended the addition of a 0.5 mg dose cohort to the ongoing BrigHtn trial. The DRC reported that this recommendation was not based on safety or tolerability concerns, but, rather, was intended to allow for exploration of dose response across a broader range of doses of CIN-107.
 Based on the DRC’s recommendation, the fourth cohort of 0.5 mg of CIN-107 was initiated in August 2021, and since August 2021, the randomization schedule has been adjusted to enable a near equal number of patients across all dose cohorts, including the newly added 0.5 mg dose cohort, to complete 12 weeks of treatment during the remainder of the trial.
 Blinded, Preliminary Interim Data from Ongoing Phase 2 BrigHtn Clinical Trial
 In August 2021, we conducted a review of blinded, preliminary safety data of 124 patients, which included 105 patients who had completed 12 weeks of treatment and 19 patients who had discontinued treatment or withdrawn from the trial. The purpose of this blinded data review was to enable an assessment of the overall management and conduct of the trial, without unblinding any individual patient data. Due to the preliminary and blinded nature of the data, this interim data set was not subject to the standard quality control measures typically associated with final clinical trial results. For example, the data that is available at the conclusion of a trial would be unblinded following a data cleansing review, source verification of data using documents from the local clinical trial sites, and other quality control measures to ensure the highest level of accuracy and fidelity possible. In contrast, the blinded data used for our preliminary safety reviews did not undergo this process and is therefore highly preliminary and not yet validated.
 The figure below shows the mean SPB levels from baseline through 12 weeks for the 124 patients from the first three cohorts who had either completed 12 weeks of treatment or withdrew from the trial as of the August 2021 blinded preliminary safety review. In the table below, the orange line shows the mean of the 39 patients included in the DRC review and the blue line shows the mean of all 124 who have completed or discontinued treatment. These mean SBP calculations include all 124 patients, regardless of dose cohort, which means that the blood pressure levels shown below include data from the placebo, 1 mg and 2 mg dose cohorts.
 

Aggregate Mean SBP in Two Preliminary Reviews of BrigHtn Trial
 
As shown above, the mean SBP at baseline was 147 mm Hg for all patients included in the review, and, following 12 weeks, SBP levels declined to a mean of 132 mm Hg for the 124 patients who had either completed 12 weeks of treatment or withdrew from the trial, and to a mean of 133 mm Hg for the initial 39 patients who were included in the DRC review. Due to the blinded nature of the BrigHtn trial, we currently do not know if participants receiving CIN-107 experience any decrease in blood pressure, or if the decreases in blood pressure, if any, differed from participants receiving a placebo. In addition, the BrigHtn trial is ongoing, and we will not know whether treatment with CIN-107 lowers blood pressure in a clinically meaningful manner until all clinical trials we intend to complete prior to submitting a request for marketing authorization have been conducted and the FDA makes its efficacy determination. Furthermore, this preliminary data is not subject to the same quality control measures as final data, which creates a risk that the final results could be materially different from the preliminary results observed in this blinded data review.
 We also reviewed the mean change in serum potassium levels across all patients on a blinded and pooled basis. As shown below, the average change in serum potassium levels observed were modest, with a mean increase from a baseline of 4.1 milliequivalents per litre, or mEq/L to 4.3 mEq/L following 12 weeks in the 39 patients who completed or discontinued treatment prior to the DRC review and a mean increase from 4.0 mEq/L to 4.3 mEq/L in the 124 patients who have completed or discontinued treatment since the beginning of the BrigHtn trial. Similar to our review of SBP changes, the changes in serum potassium levels shown below include all three dose cohorts, including the placebo cohort.
 
Minimal Effects on Plasma Potassium Observed in BrigHtn Trial
 
As of March 2022, enrollment in the BrigHtn trial has been completed with 275 patients randomized across all four dosing cohorts. The precise effect of CIN-107 on systolic blood pressure in the BrigHtn study will not be known until the trial is unblinded, but the blinded data that the study team is permitted to review does show that the overall population of participants in the trial are experiencing a considerable blood pressure reduction consistent with the observations we previously reported.
Additional Clinical Trials for CIN-107 in Hypertension
 Phase 2 HALO Clinical Trial in uHTN
 In order to establish the efficacy and safety profile of CIN-107 in a broader hypertensive population, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we initiated our HALO trial, a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel- group, clinical trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of CIN-107 in approximately 250 patients with SBP greater than 140 mm Hg, or greater than 130 mm Hg if diabetic. Study subjects were initially to have been taking only

one anti-hypertensive agent at maximally tolerated dose, but this inclusion criteria was amended to permit subjects taking up to two antihypertensive agents at their maximally tolerated dosages to participate. In addition, a second amendment to the HALO study modifies the way that we will use baseline aldosterone measurements in the trial. Originally, aldosterone cutpoints of > 6 or 7 ng/dl (depending on which baseline hypertension agent a patient was taking) were used as inclusion criteria for the trial. We will now allow patients into the trial without using these numbers as an inclusion criteria, but rather all baseline aldosterone values will instead be used in post study statistical analyses to examine blood pressure responses to CIN-107 as a function of the baseline aldosterone value. This approach is designed to enable us to determine if single baseline plasma aldosterone values can be useful in identifying patients who respond better to CIN-107. Both of these amendments are reflected in the revised trial schema shown below and have been instituted to enable investigation of a broader population of patients with hypertension and to remove barriers to participation in the HALO trial. Similar to our ongoing BrigHtn trial, we intend to evaluate three dose levels of CIN-107, 0.5 mg, 1 mg and 2 mg, as compared to placebo. The primary endpoint of our HALO trial is the change in SBP after eight weeks of treatment. The secondary endpoints are (i) change from baseline in mean seated DBP, (ii) change from baseline in 24-hour urine and serum aldosterone levels and (iii) the percentage of patients achieving a mean seated SBP below 130 mm Hg, and (iv) change from baseline in 24-hour urine renin and serum renin levels with CIN-107 compared to placebo, all after 8 weeks of treatment. Background antihypertensive therapy will be discontinued after eight weeks and patients will take CIN-107 only for four weeks.

Design of Our Phase 2 HALO Clinical Trial
 

Planned Pivotal Phase 3 Clinical Trials in Hypertension
 Based on the results of our ongoing Phase 2 clinical trials, we intend to conduct two pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials of CIN-107 in hypertensive patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled. The target enrollment for our Phase 3 clinical trials is expected to be based on the number of patients to build an adequately sized safety database for a chronic treatment, which will include at least 1,500 patients with short- term drug exposure, 300 to 600 patients with at least six months of drug exposure at clinical doses and 100 patients with at least one year of drug exposure at clinical doses. We expect to satisfy these requirements based on the combination of our ongoing Phase 2 and our planned Phase 3 clinical trials of CIN-107. We plan to conduct additional clinical pharmacology studies and preclinical studies to establish a comprehensive safety profile of CIN-107. Following the completion of our Phase 2 clinical trials of CIN-107 in rHTN and uHTN, we plan to request an end-of-Phase 2 meeting with the FDA to discuss our Phase 2 results and the proposed clinical design of the Phase 3 clinical trials. We may choose to conduct Phase 3 clinical trials, which may include clinical sites outside of the United States.
 CIN-107 for the Treatment of Primary Aldosteronism
The preclinical and clinical data generated to date for CIN-107 suggests that it could have a beneficial clinical effect in the broader hypertensive population, especially in patients for whom aldosterone plays a more prominent role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. We initiated the Phase 2 clinical trial, spark-PA, in 2021. The spark-PA trial was originally designed as a randomized, double-blind, multicenter, parallel-group, dose-ranging, Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CIN-107 for the treatment of hypertension in patients with confirmed primary aldosteronism, or PA. We have recently amended the spark-PA trial to permit inclusion of patients in the study based on a prior-documented, rigorous diagnosis of PA according to Endocrine Society guidelines. We continue to expect topline data to be available in 2023.


Overview of Primary Aldosteronism
 PA is a hormonal disorder that is caused by the autonomous production of aldosterone by the adrenal gland and often leads to hypertension that can be difficult to treat. Although previously considered a rare disease, PA is now understood to be one of the more common causes of secondary hypertension, accounting for 5% to 10% of all hypertensive patients and approximately 20% to 30% of patients with rHTN, or approximately 5 to 11 million individuals in the United States. Compared to primary hypertension, PA causes more end-organ damage and is associated with higher risks of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Therefore, it is increasingly recognized that it is important to diagnose these patients early in their disease progression. However, PA continues to be underdiagnosed due to the complexity of the current diagnostic guidelines recommended by the Endocrine Society and the inherent variability in plasma aldosterone measurements.
 The overall treatment goal in patients with PA is to prevent the morbidity and mortality associated with hypertension, normalize serum potassium levels in those patients who are hypokalemic, and reduce renal toxicity and cardiovascular damage. In addition to antihypertensive agents, such as ACE inhibitors and ARBs, PA patients are often treated with an MRA agent, such as spironolactone, or, when appropriate, by surgical resection of the adrenal gland. However, MRAs are associated with multiple adverse effects, including a variety of anti-androgenic effects.
Clinical Development Plan for PA
Our original spark-PA trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, parallel-group, dose-ranging, Phase 2 clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CIN-107 for the treatment of hypertensive patients with confirmed PA. The original enrollment eligibility criteria required a washout period of RAAS-modifying antihypertensive agents that could interfere with the process of re-confirming the diagnosis of PA via measurements of renin and aldosterone or use of a captopril challenge test. In addition, some of the participants who qualified as having PA were then to be randomized to a placebo arm in the treatment phase of the study. We have re-designed spark-PA to eliminate the need for re-confirmation of the diagnosis and will instead require only that a diagnosis of PA, having been made according to professional Endocrine Society guidelines be documented in the participant’s medical record. We have also further amended the trial to permit all study participants to receive open label CIN-107 during the active treatment period, which will follow a 2-4 week withdrawal of mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist therapy for those study participants receiving that class of medication. Approximately 12-18 patients are expected to receive once-daily oral treatment with 2 mg of CIN-107, then escalate to 4mg or 8mg at 4-week intervals, depending on both blood pressure and hormonal lab value measurements. The primary endpoint of the trial is the change in SBP from baseline value to that achieved in this 12-week dose escalation treatment paradigm, using AOBPM. In addition, the safety and tolerability of the varying doses of CIN-107 will be evaluated. The secondary endpoints of the trial are (i) change from baseline in mean seated DBP by AOBPM, (ii) changes in serum potassium and need for potassium supplementation, (iii) changes in serum sodium levels and requirements for salt or fluid supplementation, (iv) alterations in BUN and Cr levels across the dosage levels. Exploratory endpoints will entail measurements of the change in plasma urine and blood aldosterone levels as well as other indicators of renin-angiotensin system activity and adrenal hormone production. We believe the amendments will alleviate patients’ and physicians’ concerns about the prolonged period of elevated blood pressure during washout of existing blood pressure medications that was originally needed to re-confirm the diagnosis of PA, followed by the possibility of randomization into a placebo arm.
 Following the completion of our open-label spark-PA clinical trial, we plan to request a Type C meeting with the FDA to discuss the regulatory path to potential approval for this indication. As a CIN-107 approval for general hypertension would also be expected to enable the doses approved to be used in patients with PA, the decision to seek a specific indication approval for PA will be dependent on the data produced in our spark-PA trial and other CIN-107 clinical trials in combination with other commercial and business considerations. Given the high unmet medical need in patients with PA, we plan to explore the most efficient path to seek approval of CIN-107 for this patient population.
CIN-107 for the Treatment of Chronic Kidney Disease
 We are also developing CIN-107 to evaluate its utility in ameliorating complications of CKD. Aldosterone plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of CKD through its hypertensive effect and its non-genomic effects, which are known to enhance oxidative stress and promote inflammation and fibrosis. These deleterious effects of aldosterone are believed to contribute to a progressive decline in kidney function, especially over the multi-year course of chronic kidney disease. Multiple third-party studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated that inhibiting the effect of aldosterone reduces proteinuria, as measured by the level of albumin in the urine, and ultimately delays the progression of CKD. Reductions in systemic aldosterone levels are associated with a blood pressure lowering effect, as well as a direct effect on the progression of CKD.


Overview of CKD
 CKD is a condition characterized by a gradual degradation of renal function over time as measured by glomerular filtration rate, or GFR, which measures how much blood the kidneys filter each minute, and by the presence of increasing levels of filtered protein (proteinuria) in the urine. According to the CDC, CKD afflicts approximately 15% of the U.S. adult population, or approximately 37 million people. Hypertension, diabetes and glomerulonephritis, or inflammation of the tiny filters within the kidneys, are considered to be the leading contributing factors to the development and progression of CKD. CKD has no cure, and currently available therapeutic options are designed to delay the onset of the more severe manifestations of the disease, most notably kidney failure. Patients with early-stage CKD are recommended to undertake dietary and lifestyle changes in order to improve overall health and reduce renal stress. Given the role of hypertension in CKD, many of the therapeutics prescribed to treat hypertension are also used for the treatment of CKD.
 The current treatment paradigm for CKD includes, among others, the use of several classes of aldosterone- targeting agents, including ACE inhibitors, ARBs and MRAs. However, prolonged use of ACE inhibitors and ARBs are associated with aldosterone breakthrough in a significant proportion of patients, leading to enhanced decline in GFR and increased levels of proteinuria, both of which can lead to CKD progression. Furthermore, MRAs cause a compensatory increase in aldosterone levels and patients experience a broad range of adverse effects from these drugs, including a variety of anti-androgenic effects. Treatment with spironolactone can also lead to potentially harmful increases in potassium. Despite the range of treatments currently available for CKD, these patients continue to experience significant mortality and morbidity and a reduced quality of life.
 Aldosterone plays a significant role in the pathogenesis of CKD through its hypertensive effect and its non-genomic effects, which are known to enhance oxidative stress and promote inflammation and fibrosis. All of these deleterious effects are known to have an impact on reducing kidney function, especially over the multi-year course of disease progression. Multiple third-party studies and meta-analyses have demonstrated that inhibiting the effect of aldosterone reduces proteinuria, as measured by the level of albumin in the urine, and ultimately delays the progression of CKD. Reductions in systemic aldosterone levels are associated with a blood pressure lowering effect, as well as a direct effect on the progression of CKD. We plan to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial in the first half of 2022 to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CIN-107, including as a monotherapy or in combination with other treatments, in patients with CKD who have uncontrolled blood pressure.
Preclinical Data
 To evaluate the potential of an aldosterone synthase inhibitor, or ASI, in CKD, an in vivo preclinical study was conducted using the ZSF1 rat model, where ZSF1 rats were infused with angiotensin II, or Ang II, which causes an elevation in aldosterone levels. In this study, markers of kidney injury, kidney function and inflammation were compared across four groups of rats: (1) those that received only vehicle and were not subjected to Ang II infusion; (2) those that received the Ang II infusion but no active treatment; (3) those that received the Ang II infusion and were treated with an ASI; and (4) those that received the Ang II infusion and were treated with eplerenone, an approved MRA.
 This study demonstrated that following the infusion of Ang II, the markers of kidney injury (urea excretion in 24 hours, growth differentiation factor-15, or GDF-15, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, or NGAL, levels), kidney function (albumin excretion in 24 hours and albumin/creatinine ratio) and inflammatory cytokines (transforming growth factor beta, or TGF-ß, and monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1, or MCP1, levels) all worsened as the rats developed CKD in response to increases in aldosterone levels. However, the administration of either the ASI or eplerenone to the Ang II infused animals ameliorated the worsening of their kidney injury parameters caused by Ang II infusion. Importantly, the ASI improved these measures of kidney injury to a greater extent than eplerenone.
 We believe the results of this pre-clinical trial support the further evaluation of CIN-107 in a clinical trial to assess the potential of CIN-107 in delaying the progression of CKD.
 CIN-107 Clinical Development Plan for CKD
 We expect to initiate a Phase 2 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of CIN-107 in patients with CKD who have uncontrolled blood pressure in the first half of 2022. The primary objective of this trial is to assess the impact of CIN-107 in reducing blood pressure after 26 weeks of treatment in these patients. Secondary endpoints are expected to include measurements of the impact on estimated glomerular filtration rate and, urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio. As we explore the utility of CIN-107 in ameliorating the complications of CKD, we plan to evaluate the path for maximizing the potential value of CIN-107.


Manufacturing
 We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely for the foreseeable future, on third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, to produce CIN-107 for clinical testing. We plan to continue to rely on third-party manufacturers for any future trials and commercialization of CIN-107 and any future product candidates, if approved.
 We require all of our CMOs to conduct manufacturing activities in compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements. We have assembled a team of experienced employees and external consultants to provide the necessary technical, quality and regulatory oversight over our CMOs and have implemented a comprehensive plan for audits of our CMOs.
 We currently do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. Currently, we have manufacturing and supply agreements with our CMOs for the manufacture of CIN-107, including work related to the synthesis of the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for future use, as well as manufacture of drug product for ongoing and upcoming Phase 1 and/or Phase 2 clinical trials, and in the future, plan to enter into additional agreements with CMOs to support Phase 3 clinical trials and commercial scale production, but we do not have any formal agreements at this time with these CMOs. If needed, we believe we can identify and establish additional CMOs to provide API and finished drug product without significant disruption to our business or clinical development timelines.
 Competition
 We believe the ability of CIN-107 to selectively inhibit aldosterone synthase without negatively impacting cortisol synthesis with a once-daily oral formulation represents a meaningful competitive advantage in successfully developing a novel and highly effective treatment for hypertension, PA and CKD. However, the biopharmaceutical industry is characterized by the rapid evolution and advancement of technologies and understanding of disease etiology, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We may face competition from multiple sources, including pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and existing or emerging biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions worldwide. Many of our competitors, either alone or through collaboration, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing and marketing than we do. These entities may also compete with us in hiring and retaining scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites, enrolling patients in clinical trials and pursuing strategic collaborations. As a result, our competitors may discover, develop or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do. If CIN-107 does not offer sustainable advantages over competing products, we may not be able to successfully compete against current and future competitors.
 In particular, we face competition from companies in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and other related markets that are pursuing the development of treatments for hypertension, PA and CKD. If approved, we expect CIN-107 to compete with widely available standard-of-care antihypertensive agents, such as ACE inhibitors, ARBs, thiazide diuretics and calcium channel blockers, many of which are available as generic products. In addition, for the treatment of rHTN patients who fail to maintain blood pressure levels of 130/80 mm Hg or less, despite being compliant with at least three antihypertensive agents, of which one is a diuretic, we expect CIN-107 to compete with MRA agents, such as spironolactone, that are typically introduced to patients’ antihypertensive treatment regimens as part of standard-of-care.
 In addition to these currently available antihypertensive agents, there are multiple other aldosterone synthase inhibitors in clinical development, such as Mineralys Therapeutics, Inc.’s MLS-101, which has commenced a Phase 2 clinical trial for hypertension, and Damian Pharma AG’s DP13, which completed a Phase 2 trial in PA. CIN-107 may also face competition from product candidates utilizing other mechanisms of action to lower blood pressure, such as: aprocitentan, a dual A & B endothelin receptor antagonist in Phase 3 development by Idorsia Ltd.; firibastat, an aminopeptidase A inhibitor in Phase 3 development by Quantum Genomics; Sas IONIS-AGT-LRx and ALN-AGT, angiotensinogen antisense production inhibitors in Phase 2 development by Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., respectively; and KBP-5074, an MRA in Phase 3 development by Sihuan Pharmaceutical Holdings Group Ltd and KBP BioSciences Co., Ltd.; among others. Some of these product candidates are in development for certain subpopulations that may not overlap with patient populations we are initially targeting with CIN-107.
 We could see a reduction in or elimination of our commercial opportunity if our competitors develop and commercialize drugs that are safer, more effective, more convenient to administer, less expensive or receiving a more favorable label than CIN-107. Our competitors may also obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their drugs more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of CIN-107, if approved, are likely to be efficacy, safety, convenience, price and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors.


License Agreement with Roche
 In May 2019, following the closing of the initial tranche of our Series A preferred stock financing, we entered into a license agreement, or the Roche Agreement, with Roche, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide, royalty-bearing license under certain patents and specified know-how owned or controlled by Roche and Roche’s interest in joint patents and covering certain specified small molecule aldosterone synthase inhibitors, or the Roche Technology, to research, develop, register, use, make, import, export, market, distribute, sell (as well as the right to have each of the foregoing done) and otherwise exploit products containing such aldosterone synthase inhibitors, or the Licensed Products, for any and all uses, including the treatment, prevention or diagnosis of any and all diseases and medical conditions in humans and animals. We have the right to sublicense our rights granted or to assign our rights under the Roche Agreement to affiliates, as well as to third parties subject to terms and conditions, provided that any subsequent sublicense granted (a) by an affiliate to a third party to which we assign rights or grant a sublicense or (b) by a third party to which we assign rights or grant a sublicense, is subject to Roche’s prior written consent. Roche is responsible for prosecution and maintenance of the patents included in the Roche Technology, with the Company having a comment right, unless Roche elects to assign responsibility for such activities to us.
 We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize one or more Licensed Products in the United States, the European Union, the United Kingdom, Japan and such other countries as we deem appropriate. We are solely responsible for all non-clinical and clinical development, including regulatory activities, and for all commercialization of Licensed Products, at our expense.
 Pursuant to the Roche Agreement, we paid Roche a one-time, upfront non-refundable license fee of $2.0 million and one $1.0 million milestone payment in connection with the completion of the multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial of CIN-107. If we desire to initiate research and development activities with respect to any additional aldosterone synthase inhibitors that are not specified in the Roche Agreement as of the effective date, but are covered by the patents included in the Roche Technology, such additional compounds are included within our exclusive licenses, but we will be required to negotiate in good faith with Roche to agree upon the financial terms applicable to such additional compounds prior to the initiation of any such activities.
 In connection with the Roche Agreement, we also agreed to issue to Roche Finance Ltd. warrants to acquire shares of our common stock, which we refer to collectively as the Roche Warrants. The first Roche Warrant, which was issued in connection with our Series A preferred stock financing, was exercisable for 411,765 shares of our common stock. The second Roche Warrant, issued in connection with our Series A preferred stock financing, was exercisable for 329,552 shares of our common stock. The third Roche Warrant, issued in connection with our Series B preferred stock financing, was exercisable for 113,610 shares of our common stock. The Roche Warrants were collectively exercisable for 854,927 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of $0.04 per share. The Roche Warrants automatically net exercised in whole for an aggregate of 852,788 shares of our common stock immediately prior to the effectiveness of our registration statement first registering our securities under Section12 of the Exchange Act.
 We are required to pay Roche up to an aggregate of $41.0 million with respect to the first Licensed Product upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestone events, of which we have paid $1.0 million in connection with the completion of the multiple ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial of CIN-107. Additionally, we are required to pay Roche up to $175.0 million in the aggregate upon the achievement of specified net sales milestones for a Licensed Product. In addition, on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product and country-by-country basis, we will be obligated to pay Roche tiered royalties on net sales of Licensed Products at percentages ranging from the mid single-digits to 10%. The royalty rates are subject to specified reductions and offsets for necessary third-party intellectual property rights, expiration of the licensed patents and generic entry, subject to a specified floor for aggregate reductions and offsets. We will be required to pay royalties to Roche under the Roche Agreement commencing on the first commercial sale of the applicable Licensed Product in the applicable country and ending on the later of ten years following first commercial sale, or the expiration of the valid claims of all Roche patents and joint patents covering the use, manufacture, import, offering for sale or sale of such Licensed Product in such country.
The Roche Agreement will expire, unless earlier terminated by either party, upon expiration of all royalty or other payment obligations under the agreement. Either party has the right to terminate the Roche Agreement for insolvency of the other party or for a material breach that is uncured within a specified number of days of receiving a notice of default. We also have the right to terminate the Roche Agreement without cause in its entirety or on a Licensed Product-by-Licensed Product or country-by country basis at any time by providing six months’ notice of termination to Roche prior to the first commercial sale of a Licensed Product, or nine month’s written notice following the first commercial sale of a Licensed Product. If the Roche Agreement is terminated by Roche for our material breach or insolvency, or terminated by us for convenience, then all rights in the Licensed Products revert to Roche, provided that Roche will be required to pay us a royalty on net sales of Licensed Products and a portion of any sublicensing revenue received by Roche in

connection with the grant of a sublicense to develop and commercialize the reverted Licensed Products, in each case at a percentage and for a period determined by the timing of such termination.
 Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements that we believe are important to our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or licensed from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, pursuing and obtaining patent protection in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States including Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Japan, and Mexico, related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements, platforms and our product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business.
 As of November 15, 2021, our Roche-licensed patent portfolio includes two issued U.S. patents, 107 issued foreign patents, and 16 pending foreign applications, directed to CIN-107 and its back-up compound, as well as pharmaceutical compositions comprising CIN-107 or the back-up compound, with expected expiry dates not earlier than 2032.
 With regard to our hypertension drug candidate, CIN-107, as of March 22, 2022, we are the exclusive licensee of one U.S. patent, 53 foreign patents, and 8 pending foreign patent application. These patent rights relate to our product candidate’s composition of matter and compositions containing it. These patents are expected to expire in 2032, however, a patent term extension may be available.
 With regard to the use of our hypertension drug candidate, CIN-107, as of March 22, 2022, we are the sole owner of two U.S. provisional patent applications. Assuming the applications will be converted at their 12-month conversion deadlines, patents issuing from these applications would be expected to expire in 2042, however, a patent term extension may be available.
 With regard to our additional hypertension drug candidate, a back-up compound to CIN-107, as of March 22, 2022, we are the exclusive licensee of licensee of one U.S. patent, 54 foreign patents, and 8 pending foreign patent application. These patent rights relate to our product candidate’s composition of matter and compositions containing it. These patents are expected to expire in 2032, however, a patent term extension may be available.
 Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory- related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Furthermore, we rely upon know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our collaborators and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our product candidates or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future product candidates may have an adverse impact on us. If third parties have prepared and filed patent applications prior to March 16, 2013 in the United States that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in

interference proceedings in the USPTO, to determine priority of invention. For more information, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
 Government Regulation and Product Approval
 Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels, and in other countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, marketing, import and export of pharmaceutical products, such as those we are developing. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries, along with subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
United States Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements at any time during the drug development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve a pending New Drug Application, or NDA, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves:
 •completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
 •submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
 •approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
 •performance of adequate and well controlled clinical trials, in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug for each indication;
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of selected clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data;
 •payment of user fees; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA.
 Preclinical Studies
  Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold.
 In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.


Clinical Trials
  Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must continue to oversee the clinical trial while it is being conducted. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined. In Phase 1, the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an initial indication of its effectiveness. In Phase 2, the drug typically is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. In Phase 3, the drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the safety and efficacy of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted, at least annually, to the FDA, and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements, or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Marketing Approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.


The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 The testing and approval process for an NDA requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and takes several years to complete. Data obtained from preclinical and clinical testing are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. The FDA may not grant approval of an NDA on a timely basis, or at all.
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 Post Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or other labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, including a boxed warning, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.


Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market.
 Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 •restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
 •fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
 •refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
 •product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
 •injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label, although physicians, based on their independent medical judgement, may prescribe approved drugs for unapproved indications. However, biopharmaceutical companies may only share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with the labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting their promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative liability.
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level, and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
 Federal and State Fraud and Abuse, Data Privacy and Security, and Transparency Laws and Regulations
 In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state healthcare laws and regulations restrict business practices in the biopharmaceutical industry and the processing of personal data more generally. These laws may impact, among other things, our current and future business operations, including our clinical research activities, and proposed sales, marketing and education programs and constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships with healthcare providers, third-party payors, customers and other parties through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims laws and regulations, data privacy and security, and transparency laws and regulations, including, without limitation, those laws described below.
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and require strict compliance in order to offer protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.


Federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, which can be enforced by individuals through civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, and the Civil Monetary Penalties Law, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of products for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses.
 The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, impose specified requirements on certain types of individuals and entities relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, healthcare clearinghouse and health plans, that create, receive, maintain or transmit individually identifiable health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity, and their covered subcontractors. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.
 The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (including physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
We may also be subject to analogous state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third party payors, including private insurers, or that apply regardless of payor, state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state and local laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information on the pricing of certain drugs, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
 In addition, privacy laws governing personal data more generally, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, or the CCPA, and the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679, or the EU GDPR, are becoming increasingly stringent and exemplify evolving regulatory frameworks related to processing personal data that may increase our compliance obligations and exposure for any noncompliance. For example, the CCPA imposes obligations on covered businesses to provide specific disclosures related to a business’s collecting, using, and disclosing personal data and to respond to certain requests from California residents related to their personal data (for example, requests to know of the business’s personal data processing activities, to delete the individual’s personal data, and to optout of certain personal data disclosures). Also, the CCPA provides for civil penalties and a private right of action for data breaches which may include an award of statutory damages. In addition, it is anticipated that the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, or the CPRA, effective January 1, 2023, will expand the CCPA. The CPRA will, among other things, give California residents the ability to limit use of certain sensitive personal data, establish restrictions on personal data retention, expand the types of data breaches that are subject to the CCPA’s private right of action, and establish a new California Privacy Protection Agency to implement and enforce the new law. U.S. federal and state consumer protection

laws may require us to publish statements that accurately and fairly describe how we handle personal data and choices individuals may have about the way we handle their personal data.
 European data privacy and security laws (including the EU GDPR) impose significant and complex compliance obligations on entities that are subject to those laws. For example, the EU GDPR applies to any company established in the European Economic Area, or the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. These obligations may include limiting personal data processing to only what is necessary for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes; requiring a legal basis for personal data processing; requiring the appointment of a data protection officer in certain circumstances; increasing transparency obligations to data subjects; requiring data protection impact assessments in certain circumstances; limiting the collection and retention of personal data; increasing rights for data subjects; formalizing a heightened and codified standard of data subject consents; requiring the implementation and maintenance of technical and organizational safeguards for personal data; mandating notice of certain personal data breaches to the relevant supervisory authority(ies) and affected individuals; and mandating the appointment of representatives in the UK and/or the EU in certain circumstances.
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties including damages, fines, imprisonment, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws, implementation of corporate compliance programs, reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals, and additional data privacy and security requirements. See the section titled “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Regulatory Matters” for additional information about the laws and regulations to which we are or may become subject and about the risks to our business associated with such laws and regulations.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 The future commercial success of our, or any of our collaborators’, product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on the extent to which third-party payors, such as governmental payor programs at the federal and state levels, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors, provide coverage of and establish adequate reimbursement levels for our product candidates. Third-party payors generally decide which products they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels for those products. In particular, in the United States, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists. Private health insurers and other third-party payors often provide coverage and reimbursement for products based on the level at which the government, through the Medicare program, provides coverage and reimbursement for such products, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare determinations. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor.
 In the United States, the European Union, or EU, and other potentially significant markets for our product candidates, government authorities and third-party payors are increasingly attempting to limit or regulate the price of products, particularly for new and innovative products, which often has resulted in average selling prices lower than they would otherwise be. Further, the increased emphasis on managed healthcare in the United States and on country and regional pricing and reimbursement controls in the European Union will put additional pressure on product pricing, reimbursement and usage. These pressures can arise from rules and practices of managed care groups, judicial decisions and laws and regulations related to Medicare, Medicaid and healthcare reform, pharmaceutical coverage and reimbursement policies and pricing in general.
 Third-party payors are increasingly imposing additional requirements and restrictions on coverage and limiting reimbursement levels for products. For example, federal and state governments reimburse products at varying rates generally below average wholesale price. These restrictions and limitations influence the purchase of products. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of products, in addition to their safety and efficacy. We may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of

our product candidates, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Nonetheless, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Furthermore, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Accordingly, adequate third-party payor reimbursement may not be available to enable us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Legislative proposals to reform healthcare or reduce costs under government insurance programs may result in lower reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, or exclusion of our product candidates from coverage and reimbursement. The cost containment measures that third-party payors and providers are instituting and any healthcare reform could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of any approved product candidates.
 Healthcare Reform
 The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering enacting or have enacted a number of additional legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, if approved. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts, which include major legislative initiatives to reduce the cost of care through changes in the healthcare system, including limits on the pricing, coverage, and reimbursement of pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical products, especially under government-funded health care programs, and increased governmental control of drug pricing.
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the PPACA, became law in March 2010 and substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both third-party payors. Among other measures that may have an impact on our business, the PPACA establishes an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents; a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program; and a new formula that increases the rebates a manufacturer must pay under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. Additionally, the PPACA extends manufacturers’ Medicaid rebate liability, expands eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, and expands entities eligible for discounts under the Public Health Service Act.
 There have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, included a provision that repealed, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” Furthermore, on June 17, 2021, the United States Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Thus, the PPACA will remain in effect in its current form. Further, prior to the United States Supreme Court ruling on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the PPACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the PPACA. It is possible that the PPACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, which, among other things, included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which began in 2013 and, following passage of subsequent legislation, including the BBA and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will continue through 2031 with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In January 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was enacted which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.


Further, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that attempted to implement several of the administration’s proposals. As a result, the FDA concurrently released a final rule and guidance in September 2020, implementing a portion of the importation executive order providing pathways for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, or HHS, finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed by the Biden administration until January 1, 2023. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Trump administration’s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other economically advanced countries. The Most Favored Nation regulations mandate participation by identified Medicare Part B providers and will apply in all U.S. states and territories for a seven-year period beginning January 1, 2021 and ending December 31, 2027. As a result of litigation challenging the Most Favored Nation model, on December 27, 2021, CMS published a final rule that rescinded the Most Favored Nation model interim final rule. In July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. It also possible that governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
 Foreign Regulation
 In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. For example, in the European Union, we must obtain authorization of a clinical trial application, or CTA, in each member state in which we intend to conduct a clinical trial. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a drug, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the drug in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Employees and Human Capital
 As of March 22, 2022, we had 15 full-time employees, eight of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities and three of whom have an M.D. or Ph.D. degree. None of our employees is represented by a labor union and we consider our employee relations to be good. In addition, we intend to continue to use clinical research organizations, or CROs, third-party clinical trial sites and other third parties to conduct our clinical trials and manufacture clinical supplies of our product candidate.
 Our human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards.
