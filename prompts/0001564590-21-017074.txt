Overview
 We are an in vitro diagnostics company and leader in the rapid detection of sepsis-causing pathogens, and are dedicated to improving patient care and reducing the cost of care by helping clinicians effectively treat patients faster than ever before. We have developed an innovative and proprietary technology platform that offers a rapid, sensitive and simple alternative to existing diagnostic methodologies. We are using our T2MR technology to develop a broad set of applications aimed at lowering mortality rates, improving patient outcomes and reducing the cost of healthcare by helping medical professionals make targeted treatment decisions earlier. T2MR enables rapid detection of pathogens, biomarkers and other abnormalities in a variety of unpurified patient sample types, including whole blood, plasma, serum, saliva, sputum and urine, and can detect cellular targets at limits of detection as low as one colony forming unit per milliliter, or CFU/mL. Our products include the T2Dx Instrument, T2Candida Panel, the T2Bacteria Panel, the T2Resistance Panel, and the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel that are all powered by our proprietary T2MR technology. Our development efforts target sepsis, which is an area of significant unmet medical need in which existing therapies could be more effective with improved diagnostics.
On September 22, 2014, we received market clearance from the FDA for our first two products, the T2Dx® Instrument, or the T2Dx and the T2Candida® Panel, or T2Candida, which have the ability to rapidly identify the five clinically relevant species of Candida, a fungal pathogen known to cause sepsis, directly from whole blood. On May 24, 2018, we received market clearance from the FDA for the T2Bacteria® Panel, or T2Bacteria, which runs on the T2Dx Instrument and has the ability to rapidly identify five of the most common and deadly sepsis-causing bacteria directly from whole blood. We have also developed and sell a research use only Candida auris assay, the T2Cauris™ Panel, for the rapid identification of Candida auris, a species of Candida that is highly drug resistant. We have developed a T2Resistance™ Panel for the early and sensitive detection of resistance markers, which can assist clinicians in selecting effective antibiotics. The T2Resistance Panel received FDA Breakthrough Device designation in February 2019 and was granted a CE Mark in November 2019. An additional diagnostic application in development is the T2Lyme™ Panel, or T2Lyme, which is focused on the detection of the bacteria that cause Lyme disease. Diagnostic applications for additional bacteria species and resistance markers were developed as part of a collaboration with CARB-X, a public-private partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, and the Wellcome Trust of London, focused on combatting antibiotic resistant bacteria. On August 2, 2019, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, granted approval for a New Technology Add-on Payment (NTAP) for the T2Bacteria Panel for fiscal year 2020 and in September 2020, CMS extended the approval for 2021. In September 2019, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (“BARDA”) awarded us a milestone-based contract, with an initial value of $6 million, and a potential value of up to $69 million, for the development of new direct-from-blood diagnostic panels that will run on the T2Dx. In September 2020, BARDA exercised the first contract option valued at $10.5 million. On June 30, 2020, we announced the U.S. launch of our COVID-19 molecular diagnostic test, the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel, after validation of the test meeting the FDA’s requirements for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). In August 2020, the FDA issued EUA for the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel. The test is designed to detect the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus extracted from a nasopharyngeal swab sample. The existing reimbursement codes support our sepsis products and anticipate the same for our Lyme disease product candidates. In 2020, CMS authorized Medicare fixed reimbursement to Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, certified laboratories for materials and services to perform COVID testing. The T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel is covered under this reimbursement. The economic savings associated with our sepsis products are realized directly by hospitals. In the United States, we have a commercial team that is primarily targeting hospitals with the highest concentration of patients at risk for sepsis-related infections. Internationally, we have primarily partnered with distributors that target large hospitals in their respective international markets. 
Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, claiming more lives annually than the top three cancers combined: lung, colorectal and breast cancer, and it is the most expensive hospital-treated condition. Most commonly afflicting immunocompromised, critical care, and elderly patients, sepsis is a severe inflammatory response to a bacterial or fungal infection with a mortality rate of approximately 30%. Based on a 2020 study from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), it was estimated that the annual cost of sepsis to the US healthcare system was $62 billion. The rate of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with sepsis has increased by 40% over from 2012 to 2018, the HHS study found. The CDC estimates that sepsis causes more than 270,000 American deaths per year. Sepsis is typically caused by one or more of five Candida species or over 25 bacterial pathogens, and effective treatment requires the early detection and identification of these specific target pathogens in a patient’s bloodstream. Today, sepsis is typically diagnosed through a series of blood cultures followed by post-blood culture species identification if a blood culture tests positive. These methods have substantial diagnostic limitations that lead to a high rate of false negative test results, a delay of up to several days in administration of targeted treatment, and the incurrence of unnecessary hospital expense. In addition, the Survey of Physicians’ Perspectives and Knowledge About Diagnostic Tests for Bloodstream Infections in 2015 reported that negative blood culture results are only trusted by 36% of those physicians. Without the ability to rapidly identify pathogens, physicians typically start treatment of at-risk patients with broad-spectrum antibiotics and switch therapies every 12 to 24 hours if a patient is not responding. These drugs, which can be costly, are often ineffective and unnecessary and have contributed to the spread of antimicrobial resistance. The speed to getting the patient on the right targeted therapy is critical. According to a study published by Critical Care Medicine in 2006, in sepsis patients with documented hypotension, administration of effective antimicrobial therapy within the first hour of detection was associated with a survival rate of 79.9% and, over the ensuing six hours, each hour of delay in initiation of treatment was associated with an average decrease in survival of 7.6%.

Candida is the fourth leading hospital-acquired bloodstream infection, afflicting more than 135,000 patients per year in the United States, and the most lethal form of common bloodstream infections that cause sepsis, with an average mortality rate of approximately 40%. This high mortality rate is largely due to a delay in providing targeted therapy to the patient due to the elapsed time from Candida infection to positive diagnosis. According to a study published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, the Candida mortality rate can be reduced to 11% with the initiation of targeted therapy within 12 hours of presentation of symptoms. Additionally, a typical patient with a Candida infection averages 40 days in the hospital, including nine days in intensive care, resulting in an average cost per hospital stay of more than $130,000 per patient. In a study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, providing targeted antifungal therapy within 24 hours of the presentation of symptoms decreased the length of hospital stay by approximately ten days and decreased the average cost of care by approximately $30,000 per patient.
 We believe our sepsis products, which include T2Candida, T2Bacteria, T2Resistance, and T2Cauris, will redefine the standard of care in sepsis management while lowering healthcare costs by improving both the precision and the speed to detection of sepsis-causing pathogens. According to a study published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology in 2010, targeted therapy for patients with bloodstream infections can be delayed up to 72 hours due to the wait time for blood culture results. In another study published in Clinical Infectious Diseases in 2012, the delayed administration of appropriate antifungal therapy was associated with higher mortality among patients with septic shock attributed to Candida infection and, on that basis, the study concluded that more rapid and accurate diagnostic techniques are needed.
Our pivotal clinical trial for T2Candida demonstrated that it can deliver actionable results in as few as three hours, with an average time to result during the trial of 4.2 hours, compared to the average time to result of one to six or more days typically required for blood-culture-based diagnostics and the pivotal clinical trial for T2Bacteria demonstrated that it can deliver actionable results in an average of 5.4 hours, compared to an average of 60 hours for detecting the same species by blood culture. We believe the speed of the T2Candida and T2Bacteria tests will enable physicians to potentially make treatment decisions and administer targeted treatment to patients in four to six hours versus 24 to 144 hours for blood culture. Furthermore, in April 2015, Future Microbiology published the results of an economic study regarding the use of T2Candida conducted by IMS Health, a healthcare economics agency. In that economic study, IMS demonstrated that an average hospital admitting 5,100 patients at risk for Candida infections could save approximately $5.8 million annually due to decreased hospital stays for patients, reduction in use of antifungal drugs and other associated savings. The economic study further showed T2Candida can potentially reduce the costs of care by $26,887 per Candida patient and that rapid detection of Candida reduces patient deaths by 60.6%. Results from a data analysis of T2Candida for the detection and monitoring of Candida infection and sepsis were published comparing aggregated results from the use of T2Candida to blood culture-based diagnostics for the detection of invasive candidiasis and candidemia. The analysis included samples acquired from more than 1,900 patients. Out of 55 prospective patient cases that were tested with T2Candida and blood culture and determined to be positive or likely to be positive for a Candida infection, T2Candida detected 96.4% of the patients (53 cases) compared to detection of 60% of the patients (33 cases) with blood culture.
 In addition, due to the high mortality rate associated with Candida infections, physicians often will place patients on antifungal drugs while they await blood culture diagnostic results which generally take at least five days to generate a negative test result. Antifungal drugs are toxic and may result in side effects and can cost over $50 per day. The speed to result of T2Candida and T2Bacteria coupled with their higher sensitivity as compared to blood culture may help reduce the overuse of ineffective, or even unnecessary, antimicrobial therapy which may reduce side effects for patients, lower hospital costs and potentially counteract the growing resistance to antifungal therapy. The administration of inappropriate therapy is a driving force behind the spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, which the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or the CDC, recently called “one of our most serious health threats.” The addition of the use of our products, T2Bacteria and T2Candida, which both run on the T2Dx Instrument, with the standard of care for the management of patients suspected of sepsis, enables clinicians to potentially treat 90% of patients with sepsis pathogen infections with the right targeted therapy within the first twelve hours of development of the symptoms of disease. Currently, high risk patients are typically initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotic drugs that typically cover approximately 60% of patients with infections. Of the remaining 40% of patients, approximately 30% of the patients typically have a bacterial infection and 10% typically have Candida infections. T2Candida and T2Bacteria are designed to identify pathogens commonly not covered by broad spectrum antibiotic drugs.
 Our Strategy
T2MR enables rapid and sensitive direct detection of a range of targets, and we believe it can be used in a variety of diagnostic applications that will improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Our objective is to establish T2MR as a standard of care for clinical diagnostics. To achieve this objective, our strategy is to: 

• | Sell T2Dx Instruments to Establish a Recurring, Consumables-Based Business. We are pursuing a consumables-based business model for our products by building an installed base of T2Dx Instruments at hospitals and driving utilization of our diagnostic panels, including T2Candida, T2Bacteria, and T2Resistance. We believe this strategy will foster a sustainable and predictable business model with recurring revenue streams. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Drive Further Commercial Adoption of Our Sepsis Products. We expect our sepsis products to meaningfully improve patient outcomes while reducing costs to hospitals. We have established a direct sales force in the United States, and have partnered with distributors internationally, to demonstrate our clinical and economic value proposition to hospitals that have the highest populations of at-risk critical care and immunocompromised patients. We believe a sustained focus on these hospitals will drive adoption of the T2Dx Instrument, T2Candida, T2Bacteria, T2Resistance and future T2MR-based diagnostics. As a part of this effort, we will continue to work with thought leaders, conduct clinical and health economic studies and seek publication and presentation of these studies. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Convert T2SARS-CoV-2 Customer to Our Core Sepsis Test Products. In 2020, with the commercial launch of our molecular diagnostic test for COVID-19, the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel, we initiated a targeted market penetration strategy to sell T2Dx Instruments and T2SARS-CoV-2 tests to U.S hospitals. We strategically focused on U.S. hospitals treating critical care patients including both COVID-19 patients and sepsis patients. While most of these instruments sold during 2020 were dedicated to COVID-19 testing, our strategy is to convert these new U.S. hospital accounts to our sepsis test panels. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broaden Our Addressable Markets in Infectious Disease. Our product development pipeline includes additional diagnostic panels that provide near-term and complementary market expansion opportunities. We will seek to expand our panels through partnerships to share the costs of our development of certain additional products, as well as through funding from other non-dilutive and government sources. We also are utilizing T2MR to address the challenges of providing a rapid and sensitive diagnosis of Lyme disease. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Broaden Our Addressable Markets Beyond Infectious Disease. We may expand our product offerings by applying T2MR to new applications beyond sepsis and Lyme disease. We may conduct internal development and will continue to work with thought leaders, physicians, clinical researchers and business development partners to pursue new applications for T2MR. We believe the benefits of our proprietary technology, including the ability to rapidly and directly detect a broad range of targets, in a wide variety of sample types, may have potential applications within and outside of the in vitro diagnostics market, including environmental, food safety, industrial and veterinary applications. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand International Distribution Channels. We are currently selling the T2Dx Instrument, T2Candida, T2Bacteria, and T2Resistance internationally through distributors that target large hospitals in their respective markets. We intend to continue to expand in international markets through similar distribution channels.

 Our Technology Platform
T2 Magnetic Resonance Technology Overview
We have built an innovative and proprietary technology platform that offers a rapid, sensitive and simple alternative to existing diagnostic methodologies. T2MR is a miniaturized, magnetic resonance-based approach that measures how water molecules react in the presence of magnetic fields. Our proprietary platform is capable of detecting a variety of targets, including: 

• | molecular targets, such as DNA;
--+--------------------------------


• | immunodiagnostics targets, such as proteins; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | a broad range of hemostasis measurements.
--+------------------------------------------

 For molecular and immunodiagnostics targets, T2MR utilizes advances in the field of magnetic resonance by deploying particles with magnetic properties that enhance the magnetic resonance signals of specific targets. When particles coated with target-specific binding agents are added to a sample containing the target, the particles bind to and cluster around the target. This clustering changes the microscopic environment of water in that sample, which in turn alters the magnetic resonance signal, or the T2 relaxation signal that we measure, indicating the presence of the target. 
 We also believe T2MR is the first technology that can rapidly and accurately detect the presence of molecular targets within samples without the need for time- and labor-intensive purification or extraction of target molecules from the sample, such as that required by traditional polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, where 90% or more of the target can be lost. We can eliminate these steps because the T2 relaxation signal is not compromised or disrupted by the sample background, even the highly complex sample background that is present after a target amplification process, such as thermocycling. This enables T2MR’s low limit of detection, such as 1 CFU/mL, compared to the 100 to 1,000 CFU/mL typically required for PCR-based methods. More than 100 studies published in peer-reviewed journals have featured T2MR in a breadth of applications, including the direct detection and measurement of targets in various sample types, such as whole blood, plasma, serum, saliva, sputum and urine. We believe our T2MR technology will have potential applications within and outside of the in vitro diagnostics market, including environmental, food safety, industrial and veterinary applications. 
 Our Instruments
Utilizing T2MR, we have developed and received FDA marketing clearance for the T2Dx Instrument, a bench-top instrument for detecting pathogens associated with sepsis and Lyme disease, as well as other applications.

T2Dx


Our FDA-cleared T2Dx Instrument is an easy-to-use, bench-top instrument that is capable of running a broad range of diagnostic tests and is fully automated from patient sample input to result, eliminating the need for manual workflow steps such as pipetting that can introduce risks of cross-contamination. To operate the system, a tube containing the patient’s sample is snapped onto a disposable test cartridge, which is pre-loaded with all necessary reagents. The cartridge is then inserted into the T2Dx Instrument, which automatically processes the sample and then delivers a diagnostic test result. Test results are displayed on screen and printed out. 
 By utilizing our proprietary T2MR technology for direct detection, the T2Dx Instrument eliminates the need for sample purification and analyte extraction, which are necessary for other optical-detection devices. Eliminating these sample processing steps increases diagnostic sensitivity and accuracy, enables a broad menu of tests to be run on a single platform, and greatly reduces the complexity of the consumables. The T2Dx Instrument incorporates a simple user interface and is designed to efficiently process up to seven specimens simultaneously. 
 The panels designed to run on the T2Dx are T2Candida, T2Bacteria, T2Resistance, and T2Cauris, which are focused on identifying life-threatening pathogens associated with sepsis and COVID-19. In 2014 we received FDA market clearance for the T2Dx and T2Candida. In May 2018, we received FDA market clearance for T2Bacteria. In November 2019, we received CE Mark for T2Resistance. In August of 2020, we received FDA EUA clearance for the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel, which runs on the T2Dx. 
 Sepsis
Overview
Sepsis is an illness in which the body has a severe, inflammatory response to a bacterial or fungal infection. It is a life-threatening condition to which individuals with weakened immune systems or chronic illnesses are highly susceptible. Sepsis can lead to shock and organ failure, and is a leading cause of death in the United States with a mortality rate of approximately 30%, almost double the mortality rate of acute myocardial infarction, or heart attack. One out of every two hospital deaths in the United States is attributable to sepsis.

Sepsis is one of the leading causes of death in the United States, claiming more lives annually than the top three cancers combined: lung, colorectal and breast cancer, and it is the most expensive hospital-treated condition. Most commonly afflicting immunocompromised, critical care, and elderly patients, sepsis is a severe inflammatory response to a bacterial or fungal infection with a mortality rate of approximately 30%. Based on a 2020 study from HHS, it was estimated that the annual cost of sepsis to the US healthcare system was $62 billion.  The rate of Medicare beneficiaries hospitalized with sepsis has increased by 40% over from 2012 to 2018, the HHS study found. The CDC estimates that sepsis causes more than 270,000 American deaths per year. The high cost of treating sepsis is primarily driven by the extended hospitalization of patients. We believe there are many effective, targeted therapeutic choices that could reduce overall hospitalization costs if applied earlier, but clinicians need to more rapidly identify the specific sepsis-causing pathogens in order to make more informed, targeted treatment decisions. Today, the diagnostic standard to identify these pathogens is blood culture-based, despite typically requiring one to six or more days to generate species-specific results and despite blood cultures inherent low sensitivity of 50% to 65%. 
 
Sepsis contributes to 1 in 5 deaths globally. Virtually all of these patients are rapidly treated with broad-spectrum antibiotic drugs because there is no diagnostic manner for determining the type of infection. Of these 1.35 million patients with sepsis and at high risk for infection, approximately 40% do not respond to broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. Of these patients that are non-responsive, approximately 25% of them have a Candida infection, with the remaining patients having a bacterial infection. Broad-spectrum antibiotics do not treat these Candida and bacterial infections; therefore more targeted drugs are required. 
 We estimate that approximately 15 million patients are tested for bloodstream infections in the United States annually. Of these, approximately 8.75 million are at high risk for a Sepsis infection, 90% of whom are at a high risk for a bacterial infection and 10% of whom are at a high risk for a Candida infection. Of these 8.75 million patients, 6.75 million patients present in in-patient settings and an additional 2.0 million present in emergency departments. We believe that our sepsis products have the potential to enable clinicians to make earlier therapeutic decisions that can reduce the mortality rate for sepsis by over 50% and save the hospitals an estimated $12 billion annually by testing all high risk patients with T2Candida and T2Bacteria. 
 Each year, over 30 million people worldwide are affected by sepsis with approximately 11 million mortalities, according to Rudd et al, (2020). Global, regional, and national sepsis incidence and mortality, 1990–2017: analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study. The Lancet, VOLUME 395, ISSUE 10219, P200-211, making sepsis a leading cause of death worldwide. 
 Limitations of Traditional In Vitro Diagnostics for Sepsis
The current standard for identifying bloodstream infections that cause sepsis requires a series of lengthy and labor-intensive analyses that begin with blood culture. Completing a blood culture requires a large volume of a patient’s blood, typically 20 mLs or more, which is obtained in two 10 mL draws and placed into two blood culture bottles containing nutrients formulated to grow fungi and bacteria. Before blood culture indicates if a patient is infected, pathogens typically must reach a concentration of 1,000,000 to 100,000,000 CFU/mL. This growth process typically takes one to six or more days because the pathogen’s initial concentration in the blood specimen is often less than 10 CFU/mL. A negative test result always requires a minimum of five days. A positive blood culture typically means that some pathogen is present, but additional steps must be performed to identify the specific pathogen in order to provide targeted therapy. These additional steps, which typically must be performed by a highly trained technician, may involve any of (i) a staining procedure for inspection on a microscope slide, (ii) PCR amplification and (iii) mass spectrometry. These steps require a preceding positive blood culture specimen because they need a high concentration of cells generated by the blood culture process for analysis. 
 For most PCR-based diagnostics, nucleic acid extraction of target cells from the sample is performed to remove inhibitory substances that may interfere with the amplification reaction. While PCR amplifies the target signal, this loss of target cells impairs the ability to detect, resulting in typical limits of detection of 100 to 1,000 CFU/mL, which is insufficient for species-specific sepsis diagnostics. 
 Blood culture-based diagnostics have substantial limitations, including: 
  
• | Time to Result Delays Targeted Treatment. Blood culture-based diagnostics typically require a minimum of one and as many as six or more days to identify a pathogen species, and blood culture always requires at least five days to generate a negative test result. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Antimicrobial Therapy Can Cause False Negative Results. Antimicrobial therapies may be administered to a patient prior to taking a blood sample. As a result, the therapeutic agent is contained in the blood sample and its ability to stop or slow the growth of pathogens can delay or completely inhibit the growth of the pathogen during the blood culture process leading to time delays in detection or false negative results. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 8
 

 
• | Slow-Growing Pathogens Can Cause False Negative Results. Some sepsis pathogens grow slowly or not at all and can require up to five or more days to reach sufficient concentrations to be detected by blood culture-based diagnostics. Blood culture procedures are typically stopped after five days and declared negative. Often, pathogens that grow too slowly are not detected by blood culture during this time frame, leading to a false negative diagnosis. For example, C. glabrata, one of the most lethal species of Candida due to its growing resistance to antifungal therapy, often requires more than five days of growth to reach a detectable concentration, and therefore is frequently undetected by blood culture. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Labor-Intensive Workflow Increases Costs and May Delay Targeted Treatment. Blood culture is only the first step in identifying a pathogen that causes sepsis. After a blood culture is determined to be positive, highly trained technicians are required to perform multiple post-culture procedures on the blood culture specimen to identify the specific pathogen. These additional procedures can be expensive and time-consuming and may delay targeted treatment. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Given the typical one-to-six day time to result for blood culture-based diagnostics, the first therapy for a patient at risk of sepsis is often broad-spectrum antibiotics, which treat some but not all bacteria types and do not address fungal infections. Some physicians may use first-line, antifungal therapy for patients at very high risk for fungal infection, or use antifungal therapy if the patient is not responding to broad-spectrum antibiotics while they are still awaiting the blood culture-based result. This therapeutic approach may still not treat the growing number of patients infected with the antimicrobial-resistant species nor may it be the best choice, as the type of therapy is dependent on the specific pathogen causing the infection, which is unknown. 
 This inefficient therapeutic approach has resulted in unnecessary treatment of a significant number of high-risk patients with expensive and often toxic therapies that can worsen a patient’s condition. Such treatments may extend for many days while clinicians await blood culture-based diagnostic results. The overuse of ineffective, or even unnecessary, antimicrobial therapy is also a driving force behind the spread of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens, which the CDC recently called “one of our most serious health threats.” The CDC has specifically noted increasing incidence of Candida infections due to azole- and echinocandin-resistant strains and considers it a “serious” threat level. According to the CDC, at least two million people in the United States acquire serious infections each year that are resistant to one or more of the antimicrobial therapies used to treat these patients. At least 23,000 of these people are estimated to die as a direct result of the resistant infections and many more may die from other conditions that are complicated by a resistant infection. Further, antimicrobial-resistant infections add considerable and avoidable costs to the already overburdened U.S. healthcare system, with the total economic cost estimated to be as high as $20 billion in excess of direct healthcare costs, with additional costs to society as high as $35 billion, due to lost productivity. 
 Our T2Biosystems Product Portfolio 
 We believe T2MR delivers what no conventional technology currently available can: a rapid, sensitive and simple diagnostic platform to enable sepsis applications that can identify specific sepsis pathogens directly from an unpurified blood sample in hours instead of days at a level of accuracy equal to or better than blood culture-based diagnostics. The addition of the use of our products, T2Bacteria and T2Candida, with the standard of care for the management of patients suspected of sepsis enables clinicians to potentially treat 90% of patients with sepsis pathogen infections with the right targeted therapy within the first twelve hours of developing the symptoms of disease. Currently, high risk patients are typically initially treated with broad spectrum antibiotic drugs that typically cover approximately 60% of patients with infections. Of the remaining 40% of patients, approximately 30% of the patients have a bacterial infection and 10% have Candida infections. T2Candida and T2Bacteria are designed to identify pathogens commonly not covered by broad spectrum antibiotic drugs.
We believe our products provide a pathway for more rapid and targeted treatment of infections, potentially reducing the mortality rate by as much as 50% if a patient is treated within 12 hours of suspicion of infection and significantly reducing the cost burden of sepsis. Each year, more than 270,000 patients in the United States die from sepsis. According to a study published by Critical Care Medicine in 2006, in sepsis patients with documented hypotension, administration of effective antimicrobial therapy within the first hour of detection was associated with a survival rate of 79.9% and, over the ensuing six hours, each hour of delay in initiation of treatment was associated with an average decrease in survival of 7.6%. According to such study, the survival rate for septic patients who remained untreated for greater than 36 hours was approximately 5%. The toll of sepsis on a patient’s health can be severe: more than one-in-five patients die within two years as a consequence of sepsis. Sepsis is also the most prevalent and costly cause of hospital readmissions. 
 We believe the T2Biosystems Product Portfolio addresses a significant unmet need in in vitro diagnostics by providing: 
  
• | Limits of Detection as Low as 1 CFU/mL. T2MR is the only technology currently available that can enable identification of sepsis pathogens directly from a patient’s blood sample at limits of detection as low as 1 CFU/mL.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Rapid and Specific Results in as Few as Three Hours. T2MR is the only technology that can enable species-specific results for pathogens associated with sepsis, directly from a patient’s blood sample, without the need for blood culture, to deliver an actionable result in three hours.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 9
 

 
• | Accurate Results Even in the Presence of Antimicrobial Therapy. T2MR is the only technology that can reliably detect pathogens associated with sepsis, including slow-growing pathogens, such as C. glabrata, directly from a patient’s blood sample, even in the presence of an antimicrobial therapy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Easy-to-Use Platform. T2MR eliminates the need for sample purification or extraction of target pathogens, enabling sample- to-result instruments that can be operated on-site by hospital staff, without the need for highly skilled technicians.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our first U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA-cleared products, the T2Dx and T2Candida, focus on the most lethal form of common blood stream infections that cause sepsis, Candida, which has an average mortality rate of approximately 40%. According to a 2005 report published in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, this high mortality rate can be reduced to 11% with the initiation of targeted therapy within 12 hours of presentation of symptoms. Currently, a typical patient with a Candida infection averages 40 days in the hospital, including nine days in intensive care, resulting in an average cost per hospital stay of over $130,000 per patient. In a study published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine in 2009, providing targeted antifungal therapy within 24 hours of the presentation of symptoms decreased the length of hospital stay by approximately ten days and decreased the average cost of care by approximately $30,000 per patient. In addition, many hospitals initiate antifungal drugs, such as caspofungin or micafungin, while waiting for blood culture-based diagnostic results. We estimate this practice costs approximately $500 per patient and is currently in use for over 40% of high-risk patients on average and for all high-risk patients in some hospitals. A negative result from T2Candida can provide timely data allowing physicians to avoid unnecessary antifungal treatment and potentially reduce the treatment cost further. 
 We believe that by identifying the specific species of Candida, physicians can administer the most effective therapy, significantly improving patient outcomes and reducing hospital costs. We further believe that the adoption of the T2Dx and T2Candida can decrease both the high mortality rate and excessive costs of Candida infections because these products can enable clinicians to make earlier and more informed decisions by providing positive test results to direct therapy and negative test results to reduce the use of antifungal drugs. 
 T2Bacteria, a multiplex diagnostic panel that detects the major bacterial pathogens associated with sepsis that are frequently not covered by first-line antibiotics, is FDA-cleared in the United States and CE-Marked and available commercially in Europe and other countries that accept the CE mark. T2Bacteria runs on the T2Dx and addresses the same approximately 6.75 million symptomatic high-risk patients as T2Candida while also expanding our reach to an additional two million people presenting with symptoms of infection in the emergency room setting. We believe that these factors make the United States market opportunity for T2Bacteria over $1.0 billion, and that T2Bacteria has the potential to achieve similar performance capabilities and provide similar benefits as T2Candida. 
 On August 2, 2019, CMS granted approval for an NTAP payment for the T2Bacteria Panel for fiscal year 2020. In its fiscal 2020 inpatient prospective payments system final rule, CMS explained: “the T2Bacteria Test Panel represents a substantial clinical improvement over existing technologies because it reduces the proportion of patients on inappropriate therapy, thus reducing the rate of subsequent diagnostic or therapeutic intervention as well as length of stay and mortality rates caused by sepsis causing bacterial infections.” With this designation, hospitals in the United States treating Medicare inpatients with sepsis will now be eligible for an NTAP, in addition to the standard payment amount. In the final rule, CMS determined a maximum NTAP amount of $97.50 for the T2Bacteria Panel in addition to the diagnosis-related group (MS-DRG)-based reimbursement that hospitals receive under the Medicare Hospital Inpatient Prospective Payment System (IPPS). Hospitals were eligible for the NTAP payment for any in-patient T2Bacteria Panel tests performed on Medicare patients beginning October 1, 2019. The maximum NTAP reimbursement for a qualifying case involving the use of the T2Bacteria Panel is $97.50, (65 percent of the list price of one T2Bacteria Panel test) in addition to the standard hospital payment under the appropriate sepsis MS-DRG codes. According to CMS there are more than 30 million Medicare patients in the United States enrolled in Medicare fee-for-service.
 Clinical Utility
T2Candida
 DIRECT Clinical Trial—Clinical Infectious Disease
In 2013 and 2014, we conducted a pivotal clinical trial for our T2Dx Instrument and T2Candida, or the DIRECT trial. Our DIRECT trial consisted of two patient arms. The first arm, known as the Prospective Arm, consisted of 1,501 samples from patients with a possible infection. The second arm, known as the Contrived Arm, consisted of 300 samples, of which 250 patient specimens were labeled contrived because each contained a known quantity of Candida CFUs that were manually added to each sample, or spiked, at clinically relevant concentrations, while the remaining 50 patient specimens were specifically known not to contain Candida. The DIRECT trial was designed to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of T2Candida on the T2Dx. 
 Sensitivity is the percent concordance, or the percentage of sample results that agree with a reference, or comparative, method for positive results. Specificity is the percent concordance to a reference method for negative results. If a sample does not agree with the result of a referenced method, it is considered discordant. In our clinical trial, the Prospective Arm was compared to blood culture and the Contrived Arm was compared to the known state, which means that it was in the known presence or absence of added Candida organisms.

The design of the DIRECT trial was reviewed by the FDA as part of pre-submission communications. The purpose of the DIRECT trial was to determine the clinical performance of T2Candida running on the T2Dx by identifying the following: 
  
• | clinical specificity of T2Candida results as compared to Candida negative blood culture results in specimens collected from patients in the Prospective Arm;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical specificity of T2Candida results as compared to Candida negative samples collected from patients in the Contrived Arm;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical sensitivity of T2Candida results as compared to the known Candida-positive specimens collected from patients in the Contrived Arm; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical sensitivity calculations of T2Candida results compared to the Candida-positive blood culture results in specimens collected from patients in the Prospective Arm.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 50 known negative samples and 250 contrived samples (50 samples for each of the five Candida species included in the T2Candida Panel) were prepared and run in a blinded manner at the same clinical sites used for processing the prospective samples. The positive contrived samples were prepared by spiking clinical isolates into individual patient specimens at concentrations determined through publications and discussions with the FDA to be equivalent to the clinical state of patients who presented with symptoms of a Candida infection. 20% of the positive contrived samples were spiked at concentrations levels of less than 1 CFU/mL. The contrived samples were collected from patients referred for a diagnostic blood culture per routine standard of care — the same population of patients from whom prospective samples were collected. Unique isolates of the species were used for each patient sample, which means a total of 50 unique isolates were tested for each of the five species of Candida for a total of 250 unique isolates. 
 In addition to the pivotal clinical trial data that we submitted to the FDA, we also provided data from an analytical verification study to determine the limit of detection, or LoD, for each species identified by our T2Candida. The LoD was defined as the lowest concentration of Candida that can be detected in 95% of at least 20 samples tested at a single concentration. 
 The T2Candida Panel reports three results, where species are grouped together according to their responsiveness to therapy. Candida albicans and/or Candida tropicalis are reported as a single result, Candida parapsilosis is a single result, and Candida krusei and/or Candida glabrata are reported as a single result. Specificity and sensitivity are calculated for each reported result. 
 There are five relevant species of Candida, each of which were analyzed in the DIRECT trial. Each are listed in abbreviated form in the tables below. These species are Candida albicans, Candida tropicalis, Candida parapsilosis, Candida krusei, and Candida glabrata. The typical naming convention for a species is to abbreviate by using the first letter of the first word and the full second word; for example, Candida krusei is abbreviated as C. krusei. In the tables below, we also abbreviate each species name by the first letter of the second word; for example, Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis is A/T. 
 The following tables illustrate the results of the DIRECT trial. The primary sensitivity and specificity analysis is presented in Table A, followed by sub-analyses in Tables B and C. Additional data on the LoD and the time to results of T2Candida and the T2Dx are included in the remaining tables.

(1) | Includes samples that are 100% concordant for both methods (i.e. does not include discordant results). We do not include discordant results because a comparison of the duration of time to positive result requires that both the blood culture result and the T2Candida result be positive for a given specimen. Similarly, a comparison of the duration of time to negative result requires that both the blood culture result and the T2Candida result be negative for a given specimen. We therefore would exclude any sample with a discordant result where blood culture yields one result and T2Candida yields the opposite result.

 Results from the study were published in Clinical Infectious Disease in 2015 in an article entitled: “T2 Magnetic Resonance Assay for the Rapid Diagnosis of Candidemia in Whole Blood: A Clinical Trial.” The study findings include:
  
• | the overall sensitivity (Prospective and Contrived Arm combined) of T2Candida was 91.1%;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the average specificity of the three test results for the Prospective and Contrived Arms combined was 99.4% (see Table A) with the specificity by test result ranging from 98.9% to 99.9% (see Table B);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in the Contrived Arm of the study, the average specificity was 99.8%, with the specificity by test result ranging from 99.6% to 100% (see Table C);

• | in the Prospective Arm of the study, the average sensitivity was 71.4% (see Table C).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In this study, the following observations were reported:
  
• | within the Prospective Arm, T2Candida accurately detected a rare co-infection in one study patient with C. albicans and C. parapsilosis in their bloodstream;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | T2Candida detected at least one infection that was not identified by blood culture, which was determined to be a Candida infection seven days after the T2Candida result was obtained. This case is considered a discordant result for the purposes of the FDA filing because of the disagreement between T2Candida and the blood culture-based results, despite the accurate identification by T2Candida. Along with ten other patients with clinical symptoms or microbiological evidence of infection, the study findings indicate that the true sensitivity and specificity of T2Candida may be higher than the reported values;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the LoD of T2Candida was demonstrated to be 1 to 3 CFU/mL depending upon the species of Candida (see Table D). In the Contrived Arm of the study, T2Candida positively detected 97.9% of the samples spiked at and above the LoD while also detecting 72.6% of all samples spiked at concentration levels below the LoD (see Table E);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in the Contrived Arm of the study, T2Candida detected 97% of cases at or above 1 CFU/mL and 70% of cases below 1 CFU/mL (see Table F);
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | in the Contrived Arm of the study, T2Candida detected 98% of cases at or above clinically relevant concentrations of Candida, ranging from 95% to 100% detection depending on the Candida species (see Table G);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | T2Candida demonstrated an average time to positive result of 4.4 hours compared to blood culture average time to result of 129 hours;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | T2Candida demonstrated an average time to negative result of 4.2 hours compared to blood culture average time to result of >120 hours; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | T2Candida has a negative predictive value of 99.8% in a standard population. Negative predictive value is the probability that subjects with a negative result truly do not have the disease.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The authors of the study made the following conclusions based on the study results:
  
• | Because mortality due to invasive candidiasis has remained high and unchanged for the past two decades and early initiation of appropriate antifungal therapy has been reported to reduce mortality by at least two-thirds, the rapid and accurate diagnostic capability offered by this novel technology has the potential to change the management and prognosis of the disease.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The ability to rapidly and accurately exclude the possibility of candidemia can have significant implications in clinical practice, by decreasing the number of patients who need to be on empiric antifungal therapy, and thus decreasing the incidence of resistant strains, the potential of side effects of antifungal treatment, and substantial healthcare costs.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A key advantage of T2MR over other biosensors is that it does not require culture and sample purification or preparation.

Massachusetts General Hospital Study — Science Translational Medicine
 We co-authored a study with investigators from Massachusetts General Hospital, or MGH, to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of T2MR to detect Candida compared to blood culture-based diagnostics. Results from the study were published in an article entitled “T2 Magnetic Resonance Enables Nanoparticle-Mediated Rapid Detection of Candidemia in Whole Blood” in Science Translational Medicine in 2013. In this study:
  
• | T2MR was tested across 320 contrived whole blood samples, each containing one of the five clinically relevant species of Candida, and was able to detect each of the species at a LoD ranging from 1 to 3 CFU/mL.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | T2MR was tested across 24 whole blood specimens from patients exhibiting symptoms of sepsis, with eight Candida positive, eight bacteria positive and eight negative samples. Results showed 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity of T2MR when compared with blood culture results for identification of Candida.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In patients with Candida treated with antifungal therapy, T2MR detected the presence of Candida in patient samples drawn up to four days after antifungal administration, while blood culture failed to identify the infection upon administration of antifungal therapy.

University of Houston Study — Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease
 We sponsored an independent study at the University of Houston to directly compare the sensitivity and time to result of T2Candida running on the T2Dx and blood culture-based diagnostics. In this study, contrived blood samples were split between T2Candida using the T2Dx and standard blood culture. The study showed improved performance of T2Candida over blood culture in terms of speed and sensitivity. The following findings were published in an article entitled “Comparison of the T2Dx Instrument with T2Candida Diagnostic Panel and Automated Blood Culture in the Detection of Candida Species Using Seeded Blood Samples” in Diagnostic Microbiology and Infectious Disease in 2013:
  
• | T2Candida detected all of the samples of C. glabrata at concentrations of 2.8 CFU/mL, while blood culture was not able to detect C. glabrata in any of the samples, even at a higher concentration of 11 CFU/mL and with the standard five-day run time.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | T2Candida detected all of the samples for all of the species of Candida at concentration levels of 3.1 to 11 CFU/mL.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The average time to species identification was approximately three hours for T2Candida, as opposed to over 60 hours for blood culture.

Clinical Data Review of T2MR and T2Candida—Future Microbiology
 Dr. Michael Pfaller (former T2 Biosystems Chief Medical Officer), Donna Wolk, PhD (Geisinger Health System), and Tom Lowery, PhD (T2 Biosystems’ former Chief Scientific Officer) collaborated to perform a meta-analysis of T2MR and T2Candida data that was published in Future Microbiology in 2015 with the title T2MR and T2Candida: novel technology for the rapid diagnosis of candidemia and invasive candidiasis. The article had the following overall summary statements and conclusions:
  
• | There is an urgent need to rapidly and accurately detect and identify fungal pathogens. Current culture-based methodologies are too slow and, with some organisms like C. glabrata, may fail altogether due to the insensitivity of some blood culture systems to detect this slow-growing species.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The development and FDA approval of T2Candida represents the advent of a new class of infectious disease diagnostics that enable rapid, direct detection and identification of pathogens in a culture-independent manner. The new panel will reduce the time to detection and species identification for common Candida species.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | As of the date of publication of the article, the T2Candida Panel had identified over 31 cases of candidemia and 12 cases of candidiasis. In the latter 12 cases, blood culture was unable to detect any of those proven infections. There were an additional ten patients with probable or suspected invasive candidiasis, but patient record review was not available to include these cases. More specifically, across all studies to date, T2Candida had successfully detected 43 of 45 patients with confirmed candidemia (31/33) or candidiasis (12/12). When including patients with probable candidiasis, T2Candida detected 10 of 10 patients, totaling 53 of 55 cases detected for candidemia or candidiasis. In this aggregate population, blood culture only detected 33 of 55 patients. Table 7 from the article summarizes the data showing increases in sensitivity for T2Candida vs. blood culture. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Across all studies to date, T2Candida had an overall specificity of greater than 99.4% from more than 1,560 patients.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


- | Application of the T2Candida Panel facilitates the diagnosis of candidemia and other forms of invasive candidiasis and promises to have major clinical impact resulting from the diagnosis of previously unrecognized, deep-seated candidiasis as well as from the ‘real-time’ (hours) detection of candidemia. The earlier species-level diagnosis provided by T2Candida will allow targeted pre-emptive antifungal therapy which should result in a decrease in Candida -associated morbidity, mortality, and excess length of stay in the hospital and at the same time reduce unnecessary empiric antifungal therapy. T2Candida provides breakthrough performance in the detection and identification of Candida direct from patient samples and may significantly impact patient mortality and hospital costs.

DIRECT2 Pivotal Clinical Trial – Clinical Infectious Diseases
 The DIRECT2 study, published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, was a multi-center study involving 14 sites and evaluated the performance of T2Candida and blood culture in N=152 candidemic patients. T2Candida detected 89% of infections across this patient population, validating the 91.1% clinical sensitivity reported from the FDA pivotal study for the T2Candida in a much larger patient population. Additionally, T2Candida detected almost twice as many confirmed infections as blood culture in patients receiving antifungal therapy. This indicates that T2Candida is a more effective diagnostic tool for patients treated with pre-emptive or empiric antifungal therapy. Consistent with other studies, the time savings afforded by T2Candida was significant. The median time to detection of Candida by diagnostic blood cultures and subsequent species identification was 3.4 days. In comparison, T2Candida provides diagnostic results in an average time of 4.4 hours. The authors noted that T2Candida “ushers in a new era in which rapid molecular testing for invasive candidiasis will serve as an adjunct to microbiologic cultures.”
STAMP Study – Journal of Clinical Microbiology
 The STAMP study, published in the Journal of Clinical Microbiology, compared blood culture to T2Candida for monitoring the clearance of an infection when a patient is being treated with antifungal drugs. The study demonstrated that T2Candida can detect the ongoing presence of a Candida infection while blood culture often yields false negative test results because the administration of antifungal drugs can impede the growth of cells that blood culture requires to detect an infection. These observations are consistent with the DIRECT2 study. The authors concluded that T2Candida can be an effective tool for reliably identifying patients that have cleared an infection, which can reduce the unnecessary and expensive antifungal therapy. The STAMP study evaluated running multiple diagnostic tests for patients with confirmed Candida infections who were receiving antifungal drugs. The study demonstrated that T2Candida outperforms blood culture for monitoring the clearance of Candida infections. 
  
• | T2Candida was positive in 23 patient samples, compared to only 7 for blood culture in cases of true infection.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | T2Candida identified every infection that was detected by blood culture and provided actionable results 3 days earlier than blood culture.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | T2Candida detected a Candida infection that blood culture missed in one patient during the study.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | T2Candida results were a better indicator of disease clearance than blood culture, as two consecutive T2Candida negative results indicated that the patient no longer had an active infection in the blood that required aggressive management.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | STAMP study data suggest that serial testing of patients with the T2Candida Panel may enable more timely management of infections, de-escalation of therapy, better source control and overall reduced costs of care.

T2 Magnetic Resonance Assay Improves Timely Management of Candidemia – The Journal of Antimicrobial Stewardship
 Another study published in The Journal of Antimicrobial Stewardship entitled “T2 Magnetic Resonance Assay Improves Timely Management of Candidemia” compared the management of candidemic patients before and after the implementation of T2Candida and was designed to evaluate time to appropriate therapy. Patients tested with the T2MR platform were treated in a median of 5 hours, a more than 8-fold reduction as compared to that based on blood culture, which delayed appropriate therapy by a median of 44 hours. This speed advantage demonstrates that the T2MR platform may be a valuable clinical tool to aid antifungal stewardship’s goal to deliver timely antifungal therapy for infected patients. In addition to speed, the use of the T2MR platform provided increased identification of Candida infections. Consistent with the performance of blood culture and T2MR published in other studies, the Candida species was definitively identified in 93% of patients after implementation of T2MR and in only 57% of patients prior to implementation of T2MR. Prior to implementation of T2Candida, the only diagnostic tests used at Henry Ford Health System were blood culture and beta-D-glucan (BDG). The authors also identified an additional clinically relevant improvement in patient outcomes after the implementation of T2MR: a significant reduction of Candida ocular involvement from 30% to 12% was observed. The authors point out this could be associated with improved sensitivity of T2MR or due to improved timeliness of patient management by T2MR. Although the study was not adequately powered to evaluate reduction in patient mortality rates, the authors note that appropriately treating patients within 24 hours of the onset of disease is proven to reduce mortality rates from 41% to below 16%. T2MR is the only diagnostic method presented in this study with the speed and accuracy necessary to enable therapeutic decisions that achieve this reduction in mortality.

 T2Bacteria
 T2Bacteria Panel Pivotal Clinical Study Information
 On May 24, 2018, we received market clearance from the FDA for T2Bacteria, a multiplex diagnostic panel that runs on the T2Dx instrument and detects five major bacterial pathogens associated with sepsis and, in conjunction with T2Candida and standard empiric therapy regimens, may enable the early, appropriate treatment of 90% of sepsis patients. T2Bacteria addresses the same approximately 6.75 million symptomatic high-risk patients as T2Candida and also a new population of patients who are at increased risk for bacterial infections, including an additional two million patients presenting with symptoms of infection in the emergency room setting.  
 On August 4, 2017 we completed a pivotal clinical study of T2Bacteria, which is a qualitative T2MR assay designed for the direct detection of bacterial species in human whole blood specimens from patients with suspected bacteremia. T2Bacteria is designed to identify five species of bacteria directly from human whole blood specimens: Enterococcus faecium, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. Outside of the United States, the CE marked T2Bacteria panel identifies all 5 of these species along with a 6th species, Acinetobacter baumannii.
 To the extent that T2Bacteria is performed on an outpatient basis, third-party payors may separately reimburse our customers using existing CPT codes for patients who are not admitted to the hospital. By way of example, Medicare payment for outpatient clinical laboratory services is the lesser of the amount billed, the local fee for a geographic area, or the national limit established by the CMS under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, on an annual basis. For 2020, the national limit for the series of CPT codes used to bill T2Bacteria is approximately $175. Effective January 1, 2018, CLFS rates are based on weighted median private payor rates as required by the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014. We believe that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our diagnostic products or additional pricing pressures.
 The performance characteristics of T2Bacteria were evaluated through a series of analytical studies as well as a multi-center clinical study.  The clinical study evaluated the performance of T2Bacteria in comparison to the current standard of care, blood culture.

The clinical study consisted of two arms, a prospective arm and a seeded arm. In the prospective arm, a total of 1,427 subjects were tested at eleven geographically dispersed and demographically diverse sites in the United States. In the seeded arm, 300 specimens of known bacterial composition were evaluated at three sites. Seeded specimens were prepared by spiking whole blood with multiple strains of the bacterial species detected by T2Bacteria at defined concentrations (CFU/mL). Fifty negative blood samples also were evaluated as part of the seeded arm of the study.  In total, 1,777 (1,427 prospective specimens and 350 seeded and negative) clinical samples were tested to evaluate the clinical performance of T2Bacteria.
 Data from the pivotal clinical trial was presented at the Association of Molecular Pathology annual meeting in November 2017. Results from the trial demonstrated that T2Bacteria can deliver actionable results in an average of 5.4 hours, compared to an average of 60 hours for detecting the same species by blood culture. In addition, T2Bacteria identified 63 infected patients that were missed by the paired blood culture that was simultaneously run. The reported sensitivity was 96%, compared to a sensitivity of 38% for the paired blood culture as measured by the total of 102 patients with confirmed infections by any culture result.  More specifically, the study findings include:
  
• | The overall sensitivity for the prospective and seeded arms combined was 95.8% (see Table I below);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the seeded arm of the study, the average sensitivity was 96.8% (see Table K), with the sensitivity by bacterial target ranging from 90.9% to 100.0% (see Table L);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the prospective arm of the study, the average sensitivity was 89.7% (see Table M), with the sensitivity by bacterial target ranging from 81.3%% to 100.0% (see Table N);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The average specificity for the prospective and seeded arms combined was 98.1% (see Table I);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the seeded arm of the study, the average specificity of the test was 99.0% (see Table K), with the specificity by bacterial target ranging from 97.3% to 100.0% (see Table L);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the prospective arm of the study the average specificity of the test was 97.9% (see Table M), with the specificity by bacterial target ranging from 95.0% to 99.4% (see Table N);
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the prospective arm of the study, results that were identified as positive by T2Bacteria but negative by blood culture were evaluated by looking at additional blood culture results obtained +/- 14 days of the paired T2 / blood culture draw. 36% of the T2 positive / blood culture negative results were found to be culture positive for the organism identified by the T2Bacteria Panel within the defined 14 day window (Table N). 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | In the prospective arm of the study, four specimens that were identified as negative by T2Bacteria but positive by blood culture were evaluated by running a second archived blood sample. Two of the four samples generated positive results by T2Bacteria that were in agreement with blood culture, one for S. aureus and the other for E.coli.

• | Another group of investigators presented at ASM Microbe in June 2018 a study entitled “Validation of a rapid diagnostic test on whole blood for early identification of pathogens in patients in the intensive care unit.” This a combined prospective and retrospective study conducted by Northwestern University with 91 retrospective samples and 58 prospective samples from patients admitted to the ICU. Overall, T2Bacteria was 87% sensitive and 95% specific for the detection of six different organisms compared to BC; The calculated specificity is limited by comparison to BC because many studies demonstrate that BC itself is poorly sensitive. As further support, T2Bacteria detected organisms in the blood when BC was negative but evidence of infection in the kidney, bone, soft-tissue, intra-abdominal area, or lungs was available; a positive T2Bacteria result in this setting may indicate poor source control, inappropriate antibiotics or poor host defenses.

• | Researchers from UPMC presented at ASM Microbe 2018 and ID Week in October 2018 on the pivotal T2Bacteria study in a presentation entitled “Clinical performance of T2Bacteria among patients with bloodstream infections due to five common bacterial species.” This pivotal, clinical multicenter prospective trial was conducted in 11 U.S. Centers with 1427 subjects from presenting to the ICU or ED. They further reported in the pivotal study manuscript that overall, T2Bacteria detected ~66% of BSIs, excluding common contaminants. The mean time to BC+ was 38.5h ± 32.8h; the mean time to BC speciation was 71.7h ± 39.3h; mean time to T2B result was 3.6h ± 0.2h – 7.70hr ± 1.38h; T2Bacteria demonstrated 90% per patient specificity in detecting Blood Stream Infection (BSI) and per assay specificity of 90%. The study pointed out that potential advantages of T2Bacteria over Blood Culture include detection of bacteremia several days before Blood Culture (3-5 hours versus 2-3 days), diagnosing infections missed by Blood Culture, identifying patients with incorrect antibiotics and patients with extra-blood site infections.

• | Also at ECCMID 2019 and EIM 2019, Dr. Christopher Voigt reported on the performance of T2Bacteria in the emergency department of Ochsner Medical Center and Tampa General Hospital. Data from 137 emergency department patients were evaluated and relative to blood culture, T2Bacteria showed 100% positive percent agreement and 99.2% negative percent agreement. In addition, for species on T2Bacteria, the T2Bacteria assay detected 4 more positive results associated with infection than blood culture, the average time to identification was 56.6 hours faster than blood culture and T2Bacteria covered 70.5% of all species detected by blood culture. A review of the 16 positive results identified by T2Bacteria records revealed, relative to actual care, T2Bacteria could have potentially allowed for focused therapy in 8 patients, potentially reduced time to a species-directed therapy in 4 patients, and potentially reduced time to effective therapy in 4 patients. In this emergency department population, T2Bacteria appeared to be a more rapid and sensitive detector of bacteremia for the most common ESKAPE pathogens (E. coli, E. faecium, S. aureus, K. pneumoniae, and P. aeruginosa) and showed the theoretical potential to influence subsequent patient therapy, ranging from antibiotic de-escalation to faster time to effective therapy.

• | Kalligeros et al published an in-depth analysis of T2Bacteria positive results in patients with concurrent negative blood culture in BMC Infectious Diseases in 2020. This study was a sub-study of a larger, multi-center clinical trial and reviewed data from one site. Medical records of patients with a positive T2Bacteria and concurrent negative blood culture (discordant results) were reviewed. Of 233 participants, 21 patients were found meeting the above criteria. Discordant results were often associated with patients with closed space and localized infections. 16 out of 20 patients had received an antimicrobial agent active against the T2Bacteria-detected pathogen within the 2 preceding days. In the majority of discrepant results, T2Bacteria detected a plausible pathogen supported by clinical and/or microbiologic data.

T2Resistance
 We have also developed the T2Resistance Panel, which detects 13 resistance genes from both gram-positive and gram-negative pathogens. These targets include the most clinically important carbapenem resistance genes (KPC, OXA-48, NDM, VIM, IMP), which are listed on the CDC Urgent Threat list for antibiotic resistance; CTXM-14 and CTXM-15, a major source of extended spectrum beta lactamases (ESBLs); AmpC beta-lactamase genes (CMY, DHA); detection of vanA/B resistance genes, which are responsible for vancomycin resistant gram-positive enterococcus; and the detection of the methicillin resistance genes mecC and mecA, which cause methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA).  Initial clinical performance data demonstrates the carbapenemase targets on the T2Resistance Panel identify these resistance genes with an average time of 5.3 hours compared to an average of 30 hours (and up to 95 hours) with conventional methods. Antibiotic resistance is recognized by the WHO as ‘one of the biggest threats to global health, food security, and development today’. We believe the T2Resistance Panel has the potential to prevent the spread of multidrug-resistant organisms and improve patient outcomes by enabling rapid identification of the genes and species associated with antibiotic resistance – enabling the reduction of unnecessary antibiotic use which is the primary cause of antibiotic resistance. Most importantly, these tests can enable more patients to get on the right targeted therapy quicker, potentially reducing mortality and hospitalization cost. Finally, these tests could also be used to accelerate clinical trials for new antibiotics and reduce the time to commercial availability.  The T2Resistance Panel received FDA Breakthrough Device designation in February 2019 and was granted a CE Mark in November 2019 and is available for purchase in the United States as a Research Use Only product.
 T2Cauris
 In September 2017, we entered into an agreement with the CDC, pursuant to which the CDC agreed to validate the T2Dx in its laboratory for potentially testing and monitoring the emergence and outbreaks of the superbug Candida auris.
Candida auris is a multi-drug resistant pathogen recognized by the CDC as a serious global health threat because it can be resistant to all three major classes of antifungal drugs and is difficult to identify. The CDC has also reported that more than one-in-three patients with Candida auris infections have died. Unlike most other species of Candida, Candida auris can spread quickly in a hospital making rapid identification and hospital environment surveillance a critical component of containing these outbreaks. Existing laboratory methods that detect Candida auris, including blood culture, suffer from prolonged detection times and low accuracy, which exacerbates the challenge in the fight to contain the superbug. Recently, reported cases have surged internationally, and the CDC has reported a significant increase in infected patients in the United States. According to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, hospital outbreaks have occurred in the United Kingdom and Spain. Because Candida auris can be resistant to most treatment options and can spread so quickly, these hospital outbreaks have been difficult to contain by even the most enhanced control measures. 
 The goals of the CDC collaboration were to use the T2Dx Instrument to (i) validate the detection of Candida auris from patient skin samples and hospital environmental samples, (ii) validate a process for surveillance of Candida auris in healthcare facilities from skin and environmental samples, and (iii) assist state and local public health labs in combating the outbreak. In a study presented at ASM Microbe 2018 regarding the detection of Candida auris, it was found that the T2MR technology provided accurate diagnostic results from patient skin samples. The study concluded that T2MR could be used to provide a more rapid detection of Candida auris in patient skin swabs. This study was subsequently published as an article entitled “Evaluation of a new T2 Magnetic Resonance assay for rapid detection of emergent fungal pathogen Candida auris on clinical swab samples” in the journal Mycoses.

T2Lyme
 We believe that T2MR can also address the significant unmet need associated with Lyme disease, a tick-borne illness that can cause prolonged neurological disease and musculoskeletal disease. For patients with Lyme disease, early diagnosis and appropriate treatment significantly reduces both the likelihood of developing neurological and musculoskeletal disorders, as well as the significant costs associated with treating these complications. Multiple diagnostic methods are used to test for Lyme disease today, which are labor-intensive, can take weeks to process, and are subject to high false negative rates due to their inability to detect the disease, making each method unreliable in the diagnosis of the condition. Because of these limitations, patients are frequently misdiagnosed or are delayed in the diagnosis of this disease. 
 According to the CDC, Lyme disease affects approximately 30,000 people in the U.S. each year, but the CDC also estimates that the actual number is closer to 360,000 due to under-reporting because of poor diagnostic methods. Approximately 3.4 million tests are run for Lyme disease each year, including serology testing, PCR techniques and blood culture, which has low sensitivity and takes approximately two to three weeks to provide results.  Inadequate identification of Lyme disease may lead to antibiotic resistance, significant costs, and transmission of the disease through healthcare procedures such as blood transfusion. The misdiagnosis of Lyme disease has been reported to have an annual cost of more than $10,000 per patient in the United States, representing over $3 billion per year. 
 Our product candidate, T2Lyme, will identify the bacteria that cause Lyme disease directly from the patient’s blood, without the need for blood culture which, for the bacteria associated with Lyme disease, can take several weeks. The test panel is expected to be run on the T2Dx, the same instrument currently used to run all commercially available test panels. We anticipate the T2Lyme test panel to benefit from similar advantages provided by T2MR, including high sensitivity, high specificity, ease of use and rapid time to result. T2Lyme may provide accurate and timely diagnosis of Lyme disease and may prevent the evolution of the disease to its later stages with associated neurological and musculoskeletal diseases. Based on feedback from the FDA and the dynamics of the Lyme disease testing market, we believe that the most expeditious path for commercializing the T2Lyme panel may be by offering the test with a single partner as a lab developed test our and our current goal is to potentially have T2Lyme validated in a partner’s lab for commercial launch.
 We expect that existing CPT codes will be used to facilitate reimbursement of our T2Lyme diagnostic panel. 
 T2Lyme identifies the microorganisms responsible for most cases of Lyme disease in North America and Europe and are detected directly in whole blood using T2MR and the same methodology used in the T2Candida and T2Bacteria tests. Preliminary data demonstrate that the detection of three species of Borrelia at limits of detection as low as 10 cells/mL was achieved in spiked whole blood and detection of spirochetes in clinical samples from patients with early stage Lyme disease using T2MR.   
 T2SARS-CoV-2
 On March 24, 2020, we announced that we had licensed certain technology for the development of a rapid test for COVID-19 from the Center for Discovery and Innovation (CDI) at Hackensack Meridian Health. Under this license agreement, T2 Biosystems is authorized to use the CDI technology and adapt the CDI-developed COVID-19 test to the T2 Biosystems platform, and market and distribute the test in places of need amid the expanding pandemic. On June 30, 2020, we announced the US launch of our COVID-19 molecular diagnostic test, the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel, after validation of the test meeting the FDA’s requirements for an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA). On July 1, 2020, we submitted an EUA request to the FDA for the T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel. In August 2020, the FDA issued EUA for our T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel.
 The T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel is designed to detect SARS-CoV-2, the virus that is responsible for COVID-19 infections. The T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel provides sample-to-answer results in less than two hours, utilizing a nasopharyngeal swab sample. Clinical testing on known positive and negative patient samples showed a sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 100%. The T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel runs on our FDA-cleared T2Dx Instrument, and is capable of performing seven tests simultaneously. An in silico analysis conducted by the Company in March of 2021 demonstrated that the T2SARS-CoV-2 is capable of detecting all known variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. 
 Clinical data from Wuhan, China showed that for COVID-19 patients, bacterial and fungal co-infections are a significant burden with 71% of patients treated for potential bacterial infections and 15% treated for potential fungal infections. Given the high incidence of bacterial and fungal co-infections, we believe the T2 Biosystems technology has the potential to address the diagnostic needs of COVID-19 patients by helping identify these secondary infections associated with coronavirus and detecting the virus directly. Taken together, these capabilities have the potential to enable clinicians to diagnose and target therapy for patients with secondary bacterial or fungal infections associated with primary COVID-19 infections.    
 Sales, Marketing and Distribution
 We are working to drive awareness and adoption of our T2MR technology and related products by building a direct sales force in the United States, targeting hospitals that treat critical care patients, and continuing to educate physicians, key decision makers and thought leaders through publishing scientific data in peer-reviewed journals, presenting at major industry conferences and conducting and supporting clinical studies. We have a small team of employees in Europe and the Middle East primarily to support our network of distributors in those regions.
23
 

At the end of 2020, our commercial organization consisted of 13 people, including 9 people in sales and marketing and 4 people in medical affairs. In January 2021, we separated the medical affairs team from the commercial organization and hired a Chief Medical Officer to lead the team, which is comprised of United States based Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) clinicians. Our sales team employs a strategic approach focusing on clinical data, the clinical performance of our products, improved patient outcomes and the economic value for hospitals, including providing these hospitals with a customized budget-impact analysis. They also demonstrate the ease-of-use of our products and highlight the advantages of our products over existing diagnostics and empiric therapy practices. We plan to continue to invest in our sales force as we execute our strategy of converting COVID accounts to sepsis accounts and expand our customer reach. 
 Today, our sales force markets the T2Dx, T2Candida, T2Bacteria and T2SARS-CoV-2 products directly to hospitals in the United States, targeting large hospitals that treat the largest number of high-risk patients. If these institutions optimize the full extent of our technology, we expect a positive network effect in the hospital community, accelerating adoption of T2Candida and T2Bacteria. We believe key aspects of healthcare reform, including a sensitivity to the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance, the focus on cost containment, risk-sharing, and outcomes-based treatment and reimbursement, are aligned with the value proposition of our sepsis products, contributing positively to their adoption. We believe the key decision-makers at hospitals are infectious disease and critical care physicians, laboratory directors, hospital pharmacy, Chief Medical Officers, and hospital administrators. In response to the severity and complexity of managing bloodstream infections, a growing number of hospitals have instituted antimicrobial stewardship committees to control hospital practices related to infections, including the use of antibiotic and antifungal therapy. These committees typically include key decision-makers, and we believe they can provide a central forum to present the benefits of our products. In addition, we plan to continue to publish scientific data in peer-reviewed journals, present at major industry conferences and conduct and support clinical trials to provide additional data relative to the performance of T2Candida and T2Bacteria to these decision-makers. 
 Outside of the United States, we have received regulatory approvals in Europe, Australia, and certain countries in the Middle-East and Africa, and expect to seek regulatory approvals in additional international markets. We market our platform primarily through distribution partners who utilize a similar model as our sales approach in the United States.  In July 2014, we received CE marking for T2Candida and the T2Dx, in September 2017 we received CE marking for T2Bacteria and in November 2019, we received CE marking for T2Resistance. As of the end of 2020, we had distributors throughout the European Union (EU), Caribbean, Australia and the Middle East. These distributors have knowledge of infectious diseases and/or microbiology.  They typically have strong, existing relationships with international thought leaders in these areas and have good relationships with important hospitals in their respective countries.  We continue to develop partner relationships in other key international markets and will further investigate potential distribution channels in other key markets around the world.  We have employed a small team of regional distributor managers and field service personnel primarily to support the efforts of our distributors in the EU and Middle East.  
 For the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived approximately 36% of our total revenue from one customer, 11% from a second customer and 6% from a third customer.
 Manufacturing
We manufacture our proprietary T2Dx at our manufacturing facility in Lexington, Massachusetts and our T2Candida, T2Bacteria, T2SARS-CoV2-2 and T2Resistance reagent trays at our manufacturing facility in Wilmington, Massachusetts. We perform all instrument and tray manufacturing and packaging of final components in accordance with applicable guidelines for medical device manufacturing. We outsource manufacturing of our T2Candida, T2Bacteria, T2Resistance and T2SARS-CoV-2 consumable cartridges to a contract manufacturer. Our particles are supplied by a sole source supplier, GE Healthcare. We believe we can secure arrangements with other suppliers on commercially reasonable terms for the products and parts we outsource. 
 We have implemented a quality management system designed to comply with FDA regulations and International Standards Organization, or ISO, standards governing medical device products. These regulations govern the design, manufacture, testing, release and service of diagnostic products as well as raw material receipt and control. We have received ISO 13485:2012 registration from the National Standards Authority of Ireland. Our key outsourcing partners are also ISO-certified. 
 We plan to continue to manufacture components that we determine are proprietary or require special processes to produce, while outsourcing the manufacture of more commodity-like components. We expect to establish additional outsourcing partnerships as we manufacture more products. We believe our facilities in Lexington and Wilmington, Massachusetts are adequate to meet our current manufacturing needs and that additional manufacturing space is readily available for future expansion.

Intellectual Property
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies that we believe are important to our business, and seek to obtain and maintain patents for any patentable aspects of our product and product candidates, including their methods of use and any other inventions that are important to the development of our business. Our success will depend significantly on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important proprietary technology, inventions and know-how related to our business, including our methods, processes and product candidate designs, and our ability to defend and enforce our patents, maintain our licenses to use intellectual property owned by third parties, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on trademarks, copyrights, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the fields targeted by our products and product candidates. Protecting these rights is a primary focus in our relationships with other parties, and we seek to protect such rights, in part, by entering into confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with such third parties and including protections for such proprietary information and intellectual property rights in our other contracts with such third parties, including material transfer agreements, licenses and research agreements. 
 We own or exclusively license over 35 issued U.S. patents and over 15 pending U.S. patent applications, including provisional and non-provisional filings. We also own or license over 50 pending or granted counterpart applications worldwide. We possess substantial know-how and trade secrets which protect various aspects of our business and products. The patent families comprising our patent portfolio are primarily focused on protection of a range of general and specific attributes of our proprietary assay architecture and assay instrumentation for our T2Candida, T2Bacteria, T2Resistance, T2Cauris products, and our T2Lyme product candidates, as well as protection of certain aspects of the conduct of the assays and detection of analytes. The issued patents in our patent families that cover T2Candida and T2Bacteria are expected to expire between 2023 and 2034, while additional pending applications covering T2Candida and T2Bacteria would be expected, if issued, to expire as late as 2037. The issued patents in our patent families that cover T2Lyme are expected to expire between 2023 and 2034, while additional pending applications covering T2Lyme would be expected, if issued, to expire as late as 2037. In all cases, the expiration dates are subject to any extension that may be available under applicable law. 
 Proprietary Rights and Processes
We rely, in some circumstances, on proprietary technology and processes (including trade secrets) to protect our technology. However, these can be difficult to protect. We require all full-time and temporary employees, scientific advisors, contractors and consultants working for us who have access to our confidential information to execute confidentiality agreements in order to safeguard our proprietary technologies, methods, processes, know-how, and trade secrets. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. All of our full-time and temporary employees and independent contractors and consultants are also bound by invention assignment obligations, pursuant to which rights to all inventions and other types of intellectual property conceived by them during the course of their employment are assigned to us. 
 While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. To the extent that our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, contractors, or any future collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. Further, any of our intellectual property and proprietary rights could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented, infringed or misappropriated, or such intellectual property and proprietary rights may not be sufficient to provide competitive advantages. For more information, please see “Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” 
 Trademarks
We have trademarks and intend to continue to seek trademark protection. 
 License Agreements
License Agreement with Massachusetts General Hospital
In 2006, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with MGH, pursuant to which MGH granted to us an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain patent rights to make, use, import and commercialize products and processes for diagnostic, industrial and research and development purposes. In 2008 and 2011, we amended our agreement with MGH to add patent rights and to modify, among other things, our diligence and payment obligations. 
 We are required to use reasonable commercial efforts to develop and make available to the public products and processes covered by the agreement, and to achieve specified organizational, development and commercialization milestones by specified dates. To date, we have met all of our diligence obligations pursuant to this agreement. 
 25
 

We paid MGH an upfront fee and issued to MGH shares of our common stock equal to a low single-digit percentage of our then-outstanding common stock, subject to limited adjustments to prevent dilution in certain circumstances. In addition, we are responsible for reimbursing MGH’s costs associated with prosecution and maintenance of the patent rights licensed to us under the agreement. We will also be required to make payments for achievement of specified regulatory milestones with respect to products and processes covered by the agreement. In addition, we are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee, which is creditable against any royalty payments we are obligated to make to MGH under the agreement. 
 We are required to pay royalties to MGH on net sales of products and processes that are covered by patent rights licensed to us under the agreement at percentages in the low single digits, subject to reductions and offsets in specified circumstances. The products and processes covered by the agreement include T2Candida, T2Bacteria and other particle-based T2MR panels that we may develop in the future. Our royalty obligations, if any, and their duration, will depend on the specific patent rights covering the product or process being sold, and the particular category of product or process, as noted above. With respect to T2Candida and T2Bacteria and other potential particle-based T2MR panels we may develop in the future, our obligation to pay royalties to MGH will expire upon the later of ten years after the first commercial sale of the first product or process in the particular category and the expiration of the patent rights licensed to us under the agreement. We will also be required to pay to MGH a low double-digit percentage of specified gross revenue that we receive from our sublicensees. In addition, we will be required to pay royalties to MGH of less than one percent on net sales of specified products and processes that are not covered by the patent rights licensed to us under the agreement. Our obligation to pay royalties to MGH with respect to such products and processes will expire upon the earlier of 12 years after the first commercial sale of the first such product or process and the termination by MGH of all of the licenses granted to us under the agreement. 
 We have the right to terminate our agreement with MGH for any reason upon 90 days’ written notice to MGH. MGH may terminate our agreement in its entirety if we fail to make a payment required under the agreement and do not cure such failure within a specified time period, if we fail to maintain adequate insurance coverage or if we become insolvent. MGH may also terminate our agreement, with respect to a given category of products or processes, on 60 days’ notice for our uncured breach with respect to such category of products or processes. Absent earlier termination, our agreement with MGH will remain in force until the later of the expiration or abandonment of the licensed patents and patent applications, and the expiration of our obligations under the agreement. 
 Supply Agreement with SMC Ltd.
We are currently party to a supply agreement with SMC Ltd. for the supply and manufacture of plastic injection molded products are used across all T2 product lines. The agreement contains other terms and conditions generally consistent with an agreement for the manufacture and supply of materials or products for use in the development and commercialization of biotechnology products such as our products and product candidates, including with respect to ordering, supply of such product in accordance with specifications, and quality assurance and quality control activities. 
 The supply agreement may be terminated prior to the end of its term upon the occurrence of certain specified events and further provides that upon termination, including upon the expiration of the term, SMC shall continue to manufacture and ship products subject to outstanding purchase orders and we shall be responsible for purchasing finished products, inventory, raw materials and work-in-progress held by SMC to the extent SMC, after the use of commercially reasonable efforts to use such inventory, cannot use such inventory in a financially viable way. 
 Competition
While we believe that we are currently the only diagnostic company with commercial products capable of detecting pathogens associated with bloodstream infections from direct from whole blood samples, at limits of detection as low as 1 CFU/mL without the need of culturing colony growth, we compete with commercial diagnostics companies for the limited resources of our customers.  Our principal competition is from a number of companies that offer platforms and applications in our target sepsis markets, most of which are more established commercial organizations with considerable name recognition and significant financial resources. 
 Companies that currently provide traditional blood culture-based diagnostics include Becton Dickinson & Co. and bioMerieux, Inc. In addition, companies offering post-culture species identification using both molecular and non-molecular methods include bioMerieux, Inc. (and its affiliate, BioFire Diagnostics, Inc.), Bruker Corporation, Accelerate Diagnostics, Luminex, Genmark, Cepheid and Beckman Coulter, a Danaher company.  These post-culture competitors rely on a positive result from blood culture in order to perform their tests, significantly prolonging their results when compared to T2MR. Some of the products offered by our competitors require hours of extensive hands-on labor by an operator, while some rely on high concentrations of pathogens present in a positive blood culture, which can require a final concentration of at least 1,000,000 CFU/mL. In addition, there may be a number of new market entrants in the process of developing other post-blood culture diagnostic technologies that may be perceived as competitive with our technology. Karius, Inc. offers a lab developed culture independent diagnostic test for the identification of pathogens that has not been cleared by the FDA but may be perceived as competitive with our technology.
 26
 

We believe that we have a number of competitive advantages, including:
  
• | T2MR’s ability to detect targets directly in complex and high volume samples, including whole blood, eliminating the need for sample extraction and purification;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | T2MR’s ability to detect a broad range of targets, providing a wide variety of potential applications both within and outside of the in vitro diagnostics market;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | T2MR’s ability to provide rapid and highly-sensitive diagnostic results, which can provide timely information to assist physicians and hospitals to make therapeutic decisions that can improve patient outcomes and reduce healthcare costs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to develop easily operable products for end users;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | our applications in the field of sepsis that we believe will not require separate reimbursement codes due to the established payment and reimbursement structure in place; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our applications may provide substantial economic benefits to hospitals that can accrue the savings related to the rapid treatment of sepsis patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition to identifying sepsis-causing pathogens, T2MR technology can also identify the existence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Competition for molecular testing of the SARS-CoV-2 virus includes the same large commercial organizations named above, and extends to other large companies like Abbott, Roche, Bio-Rad, PerkinElmer, Hologic, Thermo Fisher and others. In 2020, many of these companies have experienced supply shortages for the tests due to high demand. We believe one competitive advantage in this space is the availability of tests due to our ability to produce more tests than our installed base of customers can consume.
 Government Regulation
 Our products under development and our operations are subject to significant government regulation. In the United States, our products are regulated as medical devices by the FDA and other federal, state, and local regulatory authorities.
 FDA Regulation of Medical Devices
 The FDA and other U.S. and foreign governmental agencies regulate, among other things, with respect to medical devices:
  
• | design, development and manufacturing;
--+---------------------------------------


• | testing, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical trials;
--+-----------------


• | product safety;
--+----------------


• | marketing, sales and distribution;
--+-----------------------------------


• | pre-market clearance and approval;
--+-----------------------------------


• | record keeping procedures;
--+---------------------------


• | advertising and promotion;
--+---------------------------


• | recalls and field safety corrective actions;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market approval studies; and
--+----------------------------------


• | product import and export.
--+---------------------------

 In the United States, numerous laws and regulations govern all the processes by which medical devices are brought to market and marketed. These include the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the FDA’s implementing regulations, among others.
 27
 

FDA Pre-market Clearance and Approval Requirements
 Each medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the United States must first receive 510(k) clearance, de novo down classification, or pre-market approval from the FDA, unless specifically exempted by the FDA. For some devices we may seek Breakthrough Device Designation to aid in communications with the FDA during the pre-submission process. The FDA classifies all medical devices into one of three classes. Devices deemed to pose the lowest risk are categorized as either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) pre-market notification submission requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States. Some low risk devices are exempted from this requirement. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device are categorized as Class III. These devices require submission and approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application.
Emergency Use Authorization
 In response to the public health emergency association with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, the FDA has established an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) submission and approval process for molecular diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2 detection.  FDA guidance for submission and approval for the testing of respiratory samples for SARS-CoV-2 virus is outlined in Section V.A. of the FDA guidance document “Policy for Coronavirus Disease-2019 Tests During the Public Health Emergency (January 27, 2020)”.  The T2SARS-CoV-2 Panel was approved by the FDA for EUA in August 2020.
Breakthrough Device Program 
 The FDA offers a voluntary Breakthrough Devices Program where companies can apply to be granted Breakthrough Device Designation from the FDA. To be eligible for Breakthrough Designation a device must (A) “provide for more effective treatment or diagnosis of life-threatening or irreversibly debilitating human disease or conditions and (B) one of the following: (1) represent breakthrough technology; (2) no approved or cleared alternatives can exist; (3) must offer significant advantages over existing approved or cleared alternatives; or (4) device availability is in the best interest of patients. The program offers manufacturers an opportunity to interact with the FDA's experts through several different program options to efficiently address topics as they arise during the premarket review phase, which can help manufacturers receive feedback from the FDA and identify areas of agreement in a timely way. Manufacturers can also expect prioritized review of their submission. The T2Resistance Panel received Breakthrough Device designation in February 2019. 
510(k) Clearance Process
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, we must submit a pre-market notification to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously-cleared 510(k) device, a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of pre-market approval applications, or is a device that has been reclassified from Class III to either Class II or I. In rare cases, Class III devices may be cleared through the 510(k) process. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take significantly longer and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) pre-market notifications are cleared without clinical data, in some cases, the FDA requires significant clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification submission, the FDA may request additional information, including clinical data, which may significantly prolong the review process.  
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or could require pre-market approval. The FDA requires each manufacturer to make this determination initially, but the FDA may review any such decision and may disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination, the FDA may require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA is obtained. Under these circumstances, the FDA may also subject a manufacturer to significant regulatory fines or other penalties. In addition, the FDA is currently evaluating the 510(k) process and may make substantial changes to industry requirements, including which devices are eligible for 510(k) clearance, the ability to rescind previously granted 510(k)s and additional requirements that may significantly impact the process.
 Pre-market Approval Process
 A PMA application must be submitted if the medical device is in Class III (although the FDA has the discretion to continue to allow certain pre- amendment Class III devices to use the 510(k) process) or cannot be cleared through the 510(k) process. A PMA application must be supported by, among other things, extensive technical, preclinical, and clinical trials, as well as manufacturing and labeling data to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and effectiveness of the device.
 After a PMA application is submitted and filed, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the submitted information, which typically takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided. Also during the review period, an advisory panel of experts from outside the FDA will usually be convened to review and evaluate the application and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device. In addition, the 
 28
 

FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility to ensure compliance with Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes elaborate design development, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures in the design and manufacturing process. The FDA may approve a PMA application with post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device including, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale and distribution and collection of long-term follow-up data from patients in the clinical study that supported approval. Failure to comply with the conditions of approval can result in materially adverse enforcement action, including the loss or withdrawal of the approval. New PMA applications or supplements are required for significant modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling of the product and design of a device that is approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an original PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the original PMA application, and may not require as extensive clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
 De novo Classification Process
 Medical device types that the FDA has not previously classified as Class I, II, or III are automatically classified into Class III regardless of the level of risk they pose. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification procedure. This procedure allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA application. Prior to the enactment of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, in July 2012, a medical device could only be eligible for de novo classification if the manufacturer first submitted a 510(k) premarket notification and received a determination from the FDA that the device was not substantially equivalent. FDASIA streamlined the de novo classification pathway by permitting manufacturers to request de novo classification directly without first submitting a 510(k) premarket notification to the FDA and receiving a not substantially equivalent determination. Under FDASIA, FDA is required to classify the device within 120 days following receipt of the de novo application. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. In addition, the FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. We utilized the de novo classification process to obtain marketing clearance for our T2Dx and T2Candida, which were given a Class II designation.  We received marketing clearance for these devices from the FDA on September 22, 2014. We received marketing clearance for our T2Bacteria on May 24, 2018. 
Clinical Trials
 A clinical trial is typically required to support a PMA application and is sometimes required for a 510(k) pre-market notification. Clinical trials generally require submission of an application for an Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the investigational protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for more abbreviated IDE requirements. Clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA as well as the appropriate institutional review boards, or IRBs, at the clinical trial sites, and the informed consent of the patients participating in the clinical trial is obtained. After a trial begins, the FDA may place it on hold or terminate it if, among other reasons, it concludes that the clinical subjects are exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Any trials we conduct must be conducted in accordance with FDA regulations as well as other federal regulations and state laws concerning human subject protection and privacy. Moreover, the results of a clinical trial may not be sufficient to obtain clearance or approval of the product.
Pervasive and Continuing U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation
 After a medical device is placed on the market, numerous FDA regulatory requirements apply, including, but not limited to the following:
  
• | the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which requires manufacturers to follow design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | establishment registration, which requires establishments involved in the production and distribution of medical devices, intended for commercial distribution in the United States, to register with the FDA;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | medical device listing, which requires manufacturers to list the devices they have in commercial distribution with the FDA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 29
 


 
• | labeling regulations, which prohibit “misbranded” devices from entering the market, as well as prohibit the promotion of products for unapproved or “off-label” uses and impose other restrictions on labeling; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | post-market surveillance including Medical Device Reporting, which requires manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA enforces these requirements by inspection and market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include one or more of the following sanctions:
  
• | untitled letters or warning letters;
--+-------------------------------------


• | fines, injunctions and civil penalties;
--+----------------------------------------


• | mandatory recall or seizure of our products;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | administrative detention or banning of our products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusing our request for 510(k) clearance or pre-market approval of new product versions;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | revocation of 510(k) clearance or pre-market approvals previously granted; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | criminal prosecution and penalties.
--+------------------------------------

International Regulation
 Sales of medical devices outside the United States are subject to foreign government regulations, which vary substantially from country to country. In order to market our products in other countries, we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with extensive safety and quality regulations in other countries. The time required to obtain approval by a foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA clearance or approval, and the requirements may differ significantly.
 In the European Economic Area, or EEA, which comprises the 28 Member States of the EU plus Liechtenstein, Norway and Iceland, in vitro medical devices are required to conform with the essential requirements of the EU Directive on in vitro diagnostic medical devices (Directive 98/79/EC, as amended). To demonstrate compliance with the essential requirements, the manufacturer must undergo a conformity assessment procedure. The conformity assessment varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. For low-risk devices, the conformity assessment can be carried out internally, but for higher risk devices (self-test devices and those included in List A and B of Annex II of Directive 98/79/EC) it requires the intervention of an accredited EEA Notified Body. If successful, the conformity assessment concludes with the drawing up by the manufacturer of an EC Declaration of Conformity entitling the manufacturer to affix the CE mark to its products and to sell them throughout the EEA. We concluded an assessment of the conformity of the T2Dx and T2Candida with the EU in vitro diagnostic medical devices directive in late 2014, based upon an EC Declaration of Conformity dated July 7, 2014 and updated on September 9, 2015 and May 26, 2016, allowing us to affix the CE mark to these products. For T2Bacteria we obtained a declaration of conformity on June 30, 2017. For T2Resistance, we obtained a notification to market as a CE-IVD on November 14, 2019. 
 Other Healthcare Laws
 Our current and future business activities are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we conduct our business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations. 
 The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease or order of any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all its facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been violated. 
 Further, the recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal statute governing healthcare fraud statutes to a stricter standard. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of these 
 30
 

statutes or specific intent to violate them. In addition, the Affordable Care Act codifies case law that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and, in some cases, may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 
 Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits, among other things, knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the U.S. government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government intervenes and is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter, or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government’s involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of life sciences companies throughout the country, for example, in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-million and multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws. 
 The Federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the Affordable Care Act amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
 The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
 Also, as stated above, many states have similar fraud and abuse laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor. 
 Moreover, Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act included new requirements for device manufacturers, among others, to report certain payments or “transfers of value” provided to physicians and teaching hospitals, and to report ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members during the preceding calendar year. Section 6002 of the Affordable Care Act includes in its reporting requirements a broad range of transfers of value including, but not limited to, consulting fees, speaker honoraria, charitable contributions, research payments and grants. We collect data annually and report it to the CMS, no later than the last day of March each year. Failure to report could subject companies to significant financial penalties. Tracking and reporting the required payments and transfers of value may result in considerable expense and additional resources. Several states currently have similar laws and more states may enact similar legislation, some of which may be broader in scope. For example, certain states require the implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, implementation of gift bans and spending limits, and/or reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to healthcare professionals. 
 We also may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, including the final omnibus rule published on January 25, 2013, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH, through its implementing regulations, makes certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as a person or organization, other than a member of a covered entity’s workforce, that creates, receives, maintains or transmits protected health information for or on behalf of a covered entity for a function or activity regulated by HIPAA. In addition to HIPAA criminal penalties, HITECH created four new tiers of civil and monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our future operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.

Coverage and Reimbursement
 Maintaining and growing sales of our products and product candidates depends in large part on the availability of adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors, including government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private insurance plans and managed care programs. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursement for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls and restrictions on coverage and reimbursement. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products and/or product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our products and/or product candidates could reduce physician utilization of our products, if approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
 Hospitals, clinical laboratories and other healthcare provider customers that may purchase our products and/or product candidates generally bill various third-party payors to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with diagnostic tests, including the cost of the purchase of our products and/or product candidates. We currently expect that the majority of our diagnostic tests will be performed in a hospital inpatient setting, where governmental payors, such as Medicare, generally reimburse hospitals with a single bundled payment that is based on the patients’ diagnosis under a classification system known as the Medicare severity diagnosis-related groups, or MS-DRGs, classification for all items and services provided to the patient during a single hospitalization, regardless of whether our diagnostic tests are performed during such hospitalization. To the extent that our diagnostic tests will be performed in an outpatient setting, our products and/or product candidates may be eligible for separate payment using existing Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, codes. Third-party payors may deny coverage, however, if they determine that our products are not cost-effective as determined by the payor, or are deemed by the third-party payor to be experimental or medically unnecessary. We are unable to predict at this time whether our products and/or product candidates, if approved, will be covered by third-party payors. Nor can we predict at this time the adequacy of payments, whether made separately in an outpatient setting or with a bundled payment amount in an inpatient setting. Our customers’ access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products and/or product candidates by government and private insurance plans is central to the acceptance of our products. We may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if third-party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of payment, or if our costs of production increase faster than increases in reimbursement levels.
 Healthcare Reform
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system. In March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or collectively the ACA, was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. By way of example, the ACA increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1%; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell certain “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs; implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs; created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. For example, in 2017, Congress enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which eliminated the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a U.S. District Court Judge in the Northern District of Texas, or the Texas District Court Judge, ruled that the individual mandate is a critical and inseverable feature of the ACA, and therefore, because it was repealed as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case, although it is unclear when or how the Supreme Court will rule. It is also unclear how other efforts to challenge, repeal, or replace the ACA will impact the ACA. 
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year and reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers, which will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, absent additional congressional action. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access, and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. Furthermore, there has been increased interest by third party payors and governmental authorities in reference pricing systems and publication of discounts and list prices

Research and Development
 We have committed, and expect to commit, significant resources to developing new technologies and products, improving product performance and reliability and reducing costs. We have assembled an experienced research and development team with the scientific, engineering, software and process talent that we believe is required to successfully grow our business. We are currently focused on several product candidates and enhancements utilizing our proprietary technology. We incurred research and development expenses of $16.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $16.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. Research and development expenses represented 28% of our total costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 27% of our total costs and expenses for the year ended December 31, 2019. Major components of the research and development expenses were salaries and benefits, research-related facility and overhead costs, laboratory supplies, equipment and contract services. Research and development expenses can be impacted by services performed and expenses incurred under collaboration agreements and other research and development contracts. 
 We continuously seek to improve our proprietary technology. As we make improvements, we anticipate we will make available new and improved generations of our diagnostic instruments and panels. Our technology developmental efforts are focused on applying our proprietary technology to additional potential applications in the in vitro diagnostics area. We believe that technical advantage is important to sustain a competitive advantage, and therefore our research and development efforts are focused on the continued enhancement of our proprietary technology. We are dedicated to ongoing innovation to T2MR and expanding our pipeline of product candidates. Our goal is for our technology to become a standard of care by offering a rapid, sensitive and simple diagnostic alternative to existing methodologies for identifying sepsis, with a long-term objective of targeting the broader in vitro diagnostics market.
