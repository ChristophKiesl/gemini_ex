Item 1. Business
General

We are a leading nation-wide operator of retail tire and automotive repair stores in the United States. We offer to our customers, referred to as “guests”, replacement tires and tire related services, automotive undercar repair services as well as a broad range of routine maintenance services, primarily on passenger cars, light trucks and vans. We also provide other products and services for brakes; mufflers and exhaust systems; and steering, drive train, suspension and wheel alignment. 

We believe the convenience and value we offer are key factors in serving and growing our base of customers. At March 27, 2021, we operated 1,263 retail tire and automotive repair stores and serviced approximately 4.8 million vehicles in fiscal 2021. 

Our retail tire and automotive repair stores operate primarily under the names “Monro Auto Service and Tire Centers,” “Tire Choice Auto Service Centers,” “Mr. Tire Auto Service Centers,” “Car-X Tire & Auto,” “Tire Warehouse Tires for Less,” “Ken Towery’s Tire & Auto Care,” “Tire Barn Warehouse,” and “Free Service Tire & Auto Centers.”

The typical format for a Monro store is a free-standing building consisting of a sales area, fully-equipped service bays and a parts/tires storage area. Most service bays are equipped with above-ground electric vehicle lifts. Generally, each store is located within 25 miles of a “key” store which carries approximately double the inventory of a typical store and serves as a mini-distribution point for slower moving inventory for other stores in its area. Individual store sizes, number of bays and stocking levels vary greatly and are dependent primarily on the availability of suitable store locations, population, demographics and intensity of competition among other factors. 

A certain number of our retail locations also service commercial customers. Our locations that serve commercial customers generally operate consistently with our other retail locations, except that the sales mix for these locations includes a higher number of commercial tires.

As of March 27, 2021, Monro had seven wholesale locations and three retread facilities. The wholesale locations, in most cases, sell tires to customers for resale, although these tire sales do not include installation or other tire related services. The retread facilities re-manufacture tires through the replacement of tread on worn tires that are later sold to customers. Monro also had 95 Car-X franchised locations as of March 27, 2021. (Two franchised locations were closed during 2021.)

Our operations are organized and managed in one operating segment. The internal management financial reporting that is the basis for evaluation in order to assess performance and allocate resources by our chief operating decision maker consists of consolidated data that includes the results of our retail, commercial and wholesale locations. As such, our one operating segment reflects how our operations are managed, how resources are allocated, how operating performance is evaluated by senior management and the structure of our internal financial reporting.

Monro incorporated in New York in 1959. We maintain our corporate headquarters in Rochester, New York.

Business Strategy

Our vision is to be America’s leading auto and tire service center, trusted by consumers as the best place in their neighborhoods for quality automotive service and tires. We believe that success in this vision will position Monro to deliver consistent and sustainable organic growth as well as lead to strong, long-term financial performance. Specifically, we are committed to seeing this vision executed across all aspects of the business, through the following actions:

Monro, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 





•Exceed guest expectations. We will continue to invest in and execute strategic initiatives to improve our guests’ in-store experience. This ranges from modernized store infrastructure through rebranding and reimaging investments, new tire pricing and category management technology to match customer demand and building an omni-channel presence.

•Provide consistent value. We intend to be able to offer better value than new car dealers to more price-sensitive consumers. Vehicles generally need more service and repairs as they advance in age. However, as consumers’ vehicles age, the consumers’ willingness to pay higher prices decreases. Monro’s service menu is focused on items that are purchased frequently, like oil changes and other scheduled services, along with higher value services like tires, brakes and other undercar services. Our tire pricing and category management system allows us to dynamically track demand trends and make rapid adjustments to optimize our tire assortment by leveraging the breadth of our tire brand portfolio to offer the right tires at what we believe are the right price points. 

•Build a committed, knowledgeable organization of friendly and professional teammates. We will continue to invest in technology and training to accelerate productivity and team engagement. This includes our data-driven cloud-based store staffing and scheduling software that re-balances our store technician labor to meet customer demand as well as utilizing Monro University, an extensive cloud-based learning curriculum, to provide our employees, referred to as “teammates,” with the technical training needed to effectively serve our customers today and into the future.

We are committed to building an omni-channel presence through our primary retail websites in order to create a seamless buying experience for our customers. With responsive optimized design for mobile users, a streamlined tire search and improved content and functionality, our retail websites better position us to address our customers’ needs. These websites, aligned with our primary retail names, help customers search for store locations, access coupons, make service appointments, shop for tires and access information on our services and products, as well as car care tips. Importantly, they better showcase the solutions we provide to our customers, including our Good, Better, Best product and service packages.

To minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, we modified our plans for some of our strategic initiatives, including temporarily suspending all reimaging and rebranding investments related to our store transformation program during the first three months of fiscal 2021. With sales improvement throughout the year, we resumed these investments and completed the store transformation of 147 stores in fiscal 2021. To date, we have completed the transformation of 366 stores.

Growth Strategy

Executing on accretive acquisition opportunities remains a key element of our growth strategy. We have a robust pipeline and believe the fragmentation of our industry allows for many opportunities for consolidation. Using consumer demographic analytics, we believe we are able to better identify targets that operate in the markets with favorable demographics and customer trends, allowing us to enter regions from which we are poised to benefit most. Additionally, to ensure we are capitalizing on these opportunities, we have added talent and an organizational structure to our mergers and acquisitions team, who will work with our management team to ensure we capitalize on the momentum in the market. 

During the last five years, we have completed 19 acquisitions, adding 262 locations and approximately $411 million in annualized revenue. Additionally, during this time, we have entered seven states, solidifying our presence in the Southern markets as well as expanding into the Western region. As of March 27, 2021, we have stores in 32 states.

Although acquisition activity was temporarily paused in response to the COVID-19 pandemic during the first six months of fiscal 2021, we continued to evaluate potential acquisition candidates that we believe would fit our growth strategy while maintaining financial discipline, and we acquired 17 retail tire and automotive repair stores located in California during December 2020.

Subsequent to March 27, 2021, we acquired 30 retail tire and automotive repair stores located in California from Mountain View Tire & Service, Inc. on April 25, 2021.

In addition to our plan to continue to seek suitable acquisitions, we plan to add new greenfield stores. Greenfield stores include new construction as well as the acquisition of one to four store operations.

Key factors in market and site selection for selecting new greenfield store locations include population, demographic characteristics, vehicle population and the intensity of competition. We partner with a customer analytics firm to provide market segmentation and demographic data specific to a geographic area in close proximity to a Monro location to identify high value lookalike customers and market directly to them. We attempt to cluster stores in market areas in order to achieve economies of scale in advertising, supervision and distribution costs. All new greenfield sites presently under consideration are within our established market areas.

Purchasing and Distribution

We believe that our substantial buying power and our flexibility in making sourcing decisions contributes to our successful purchasing strategy. We also believe our ability to negotiate with our vendor partners allows us to ensure we are receiving competitive pricing and terms as well as minimize the margin impact of economic pressures such as tariffs.

We select and purchase tires, parts and supplies for all Company-operated stores on a centralized basis through an automatic replenishment system based on operational data we collect from stores on a daily basis. This allows us to control store inventory on a near real-time basis. Additionally, each store has access to the inventory carried by up to the 14 stores or distribution center nearest to it. Management believes that this feature improves customer satisfaction and store productivity by reducing the time required to locate out-of-stock parts and tires. It also improves profitability because it reduces the amount of inventory which must be purchased outside Monro from local vendors. Purchases outside Monro are made when needed at the store level and accounted for approximately 18 percent of all parts and tires used in 2021.

Our ten largest vendors accounted for approximately 73 percent of our total stocking purchases, with the largest vendor accounting for approximately 24 percent of total stocking purchases in 2021. In 2021, Monro imported approximately 26 percent of our parts (excluding batteries, oil and supplies) and tire purchases. We purchase parts, oil and tires from 98 vendors. Management believes that our relationships with vendors are excellent and that alternative sources of supply exist, at comparable cost, for substantially all parts used in our business. 

We enter into contracts with certain parts and tire suppliers, some of which require us to buy (at market competitive prices) up to 100 percent of our annual purchases of specific products. These agreements expire at various dates. We believe these agreements provide us with high quality, branded merchandise at preferred pricing, along with strong marketing and training support.

The majority of our parts supply is distributed to our stores through our network of distribution centers, and vendors ship the majority of our tires supply directly to our stores. Stores are generally replenished at least bi-weekly, and such replenishment fills, on average, 96 percent of all items ordered by the automatic replenishment system. Monro operates eleven distribution centers in California, Kentucky, Maryland, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. 

Human Capital

At Monro, our business success is built upon our dedicated, passionate and diverse teammates who work and live in the communities we serve. We are committed to providing a safe, healthy, inclusive and supportive work environment where teammates embrace our core value of collaboration, feel empowered and are motivated to have enriching and successful careers. We seek to be an employer of choice to attract and retain top talent. To that end, we strive to provide an engaging work experience that excites and motivates our teammates to deliver their best every day as well as provides opportunities for learning and growth, to ensure our team is always the best in the business. 

As of March 27, 2021, Monro had approximately 7,800 employees, of whom 7,270 were employed in the field organization, 210 were employed at the distribution centers, 260 were employed at our corporate headquarters, referred to as store support center, and 60 were employed in other offices. Monro's employees are not members of any union. Due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we reduced our workforce through furlough or other reduction. With sales improvement, we adjusted our workforce to meet demand.

Teammate Retention

We understand that our teammates will benefit from a clear path to advancement and from investments in their continuous learning to allow them to achieve their personal development needs and career growth. To that end, we invest in training and development programs at all levels within the Company. We also leverage annual processes that support individual performance planning, individual professional development planning and a broad review of talent throughout our organization. Our continuous efforts are reflected in our turnover rates, which are our lowest since 2015.

During fiscal 2020 our online training platform, Monro University, was initially focused on the technical and operational excellence training that technicians need to effectively serve our customers today and prepare them to handle future requirements. We have since expanded the platform across a wide variety of topics accessible to our teammates in our stores, distribution centers and store support center.

New technician development has been an area of particular focus for Monro to increase productivity and retention and make it easier for technicians to overcome barriers of joining the industry. One way we do this is by offering a tool purchase program through which trainee technicians can acquire their own set of tools. We also provide Automotive Service Excellence (“ASE”) certification in eight different categories as technicians advance in their careers.

 
Monro, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 





Store and operations managers also have courses available through Monro University that are supplemented with live and on-line vendor training courses. Management training covers topics including safety, customer service, human resources, leadership and scheduling, and is delivered on a regular basis. We believe that involving operations management in the development and delivery of these sessions results in more relevant and actionable training for store managers, helping improve staff retention as well as overall performance.

Monro University also provides targeted training for corporate management and staff, including diversity training, harassment training and people manager training.

We also foster development through annual reviews at which time employees can discuss with their manager goals for aligning their own development with our business objectives.

The compensation for our teammates is tied to, and increases with, increased productivity. Our store compensation plan also streamlines bonus programs, creating consistency and providing us the ability to use human capital more productively across our stores.

In fiscal 2022, we will provide all teammates with an engagement and satisfaction survey, and intend to use those results to inform further strategy and goal-setting.

In addition to providing ongoing learning and development opportunities, ensuring our teammates feel supported is also important in teammate retention. Besides standard employee benefits we offer a confidential Employee Assistance Program with 24/7 support, financial counseling, estate planning, and online resources for parents whose children struggle with developmental disabilities, as well as other services aimed at enhancing our teammates’ well-being. 

Workplace Safety 

We are committed to providing a safe and secure work environment and have specific safety programs. To identify elevated safety-related risk areas more effectively, we have increased our focus on data gathering, tracking and analysis. With greater insight into real-time data, we can prioritize focus on areas that present the biggest potential hazards to our teammates and identify process improvements. Another important component of our risk analysis is conducting formal and thorough investigations into safety-related incidents. Investigations are analyzed by our Vice President of Risk and Safety as well as our Risk Management Team to determine a root cause, and pro-active plans are in place to improve safety related patterns that emerge, determining the next steps to address these patterns. 

Monro’s training programs are key to our strong safety culture. Training increases awareness and helps to reduce and eliminate workplace accidents and injuries. Our Monro University platform has allowed us to conduct more robust and structured trainings based on a teammates’ job position, and Monro’s safety manuals are available at every workstation within our stores and distribution centers and serve as the basis for our safety training and protocols.

COVID-19

Given the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the end of fiscal 2020 and all of fiscal 2021 presented a unique set of challenges. In February 2020, we formed a COVID-19 Crisis Committee comprised of members of management that has been leading and coordinating the Company’s overall response. This team leads efforts to develop and monitor mitigation and business continuity plans; track all relevant state and local government guidelines, directives and regulations; develop work-from-home plans for non-store teammates; implement safe working protocols for store teams; assess appropriate return-to-office protocols; and provide timely and transparent communications to teammates and key stakeholders. We also incurred additional costs in procuring and distributing the supplies necessary to keep our teammates safe, such as cleaning supplies, face masks and other protective equipment, including sneeze guards installed at each sales counter, as well as investments in technology to allow our teammates to work remotely.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion

Diversity is one of our core values and we are committed to driving diversity, equity and inclusion across our Company. This commitment will continue to be supported by training and awareness programs as well as focused efforts to recruit, retain, develop and promote a diverse workforce. Our Code of Ethics lays out a zero-tolerance policy for discrimination or harassment behavior.

We are taking action to increase the focus on our diversity efforts and are committed to making continuous progress. In 2020, we formed a Team Resource Group (“TRG”), comprised of a cross-functional coalition of teammates to educate and provide resources and training to help Monro build and maintain an inclusive culture where every teammate feels they belong, can contribute and are 

 
Monro, Inc. 2021 Form 10-K 



able to reach their full potential. A Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (“DE&I”) expert consultant and the TRG have also been working with the Senior Leadership Team to assist in the formulation of an official DE&I strategy which will include goals and a long-term plan.

We have also added resources to our recruitment team to help launch new hiring initiatives aimed at reaching diverse groups and are also expanding the recruitment platforms we use to broaden our pool of candidates.

We also view training as a tool to foster inclusion and, through Monro University, we provide Unconscious Bias Diversity and Inclusion Awareness courses to our teammates.

Competition

Our segment of the retail industry is fragmented and highly competitive, and the number, size and strength of competitors vary widely from region to region. We operate in the automotive repair service and tire industry, which is currently and is expected to continue to be highly competitive with respect to price, store location, name awareness and customer service. Monro's primary competitors include national and regional undercar, tire specialty and general automotive service chains, both franchised and company-operated; car dealerships, mass merchandisers’ operating service centers; and, to a lesser extent, gas stations, independent garages and Internet tire sellers. Monro considers TBC Corporation (operating primarily under the NTB, Midas and Tire Kingdom brands), Firestone Complete Auto Care service stores, The Pep Boys – Manny, Moe and Jack service stores, Meineke, and Mavis Discount Tire to be direct competitors. 
Regulation

We maintain programs to facilitate compliance with various federal, state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business, including, among other things, those regarding employment and labor practices, workplace safety, building and zoning requirements, the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous substances contained in the products that we sell and use in our service bays, the recycling of batteries, tires and used lubricants, and the ownership and operation of real property. We believe that we are in compliance with these applicable laws and regulations, and our related compliance costs are not material.

Monro stores new oil and recycled antifreeze and generates and/or handles used tires and automotive oils, antifreeze and certain solvents, which are disposed of by licensed third-party contractors. In certain states, as required, we also recycle oil filters. Accordingly, we are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental laws including the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act. In addition, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA"), under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA"), as well as various state and local environmental protection agencies, regulate our handling and disposal of certain waste products and other materials. The EPA, under the Clean Air Act, also regulates the installation of catalytic converters, engines and equipment sold or distributed in the United States by periodically spot checking repair jobs, and may impose sanctions, including but not limited to civil penalties of approximately $45,000 per violation (or approximately $45,000 per day for certain willful violations or failures to cooperate with authorities), for violations of RCRA and the Clean Air Act. 

Monro strives to maintain an environmentally conscious corporate culture, demonstrated by our recycling policies at our offices, distribution centers and stores. In 2021, Monro recycled approximately 2.5 million gallons of oil and 3.3 million tires, as well as approximately 73,000 vehicle batteries and 316 tons of cardboard, all as part of our commitment to the environment. 

Seasonality

Although our business is not highly seasonal, customers do purchase more undercar service during the period of March through October than the period of November through February, when miles driven tend to be lower. Sales of tires are more heavily weighted in the months of May through August, and October through December. The slowest months are typically January through April and September. As a result, profitability is typically lower during slower sales months, or months where mix is more heavily weighted toward tires, which is a lower margin category. 

Sales can also be volatile in areas in which we operate as a result of warmer weather in winter months, which typically causes a decline in tire sales, or severe weather, which can result in store closures.

Given our use of a fiscal calendar, there may be some fluctuations between quarters due to holiday shifts in the calendar year and the number of days in a particular fiscal quarter or year. In addition, the COVID-19 outbreak has had an impact on consumer behaviors and customer traffic that may result in temporary changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business.
