ITEM 1.    Business
USA Compression Partners, LP (the “Partnership”) is a growth-oriented Delaware limited partnership. We are managed by our general partner, USA Compression GP, LLC (the “General Partner”), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Energy Transfer Operating, L.P. (“ETO”), a consolidated subsidiary of Energy Transfer LP (“ET LP”). 
On April 2, 2018 (the “Transactions Date”), we acquired (the “CDM Acquisition”) all of the equity interests in CDM Resource Management LLC and CDM Environmental & Technical Services LLC, which together represent the CDM Compression Business (the “USA Compression Predecessor”), and ET LP acquired all of the equity interests in the General Partner, which it subsequently contributed to ETO. USA Compression Predecessor has been determined to be the historical predecessor of the Partnership for financial reporting purposes because ET LP controlled the USA Compression Predecessor prior to the CDM Acquisition and obtained control of the Partnership through its acquisition of the General Partner.
All references in this report to the USA Compression Predecessor, as well as the terms “our,” “we,” “us” and “its” refer to the USA Compression Predecessor when used in periods prior to the Transactions Date, unless the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated. All references in this section to the Partnership, as well as the terms “our,” “we,” “us” and “its” refer to USA Compression Partners, LP, together with its consolidated subsidiaries, including the USA Compression Predecessor, when used in periods subsequent to the Transactions Date, unless the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated. 
Overview
We believe that we are one of the largest independent providers of natural gas compression services in the U.S. in terms of total compression fleet horsepower. We have been providing compression services since 1998 and completed our initial public offering in January 2013. As of December 31, 2020, we had 3,726,181 horsepower in our fleet. We provide compression services to our customers primarily in connection with infrastructure applications, including both allowing for the processing and transportation of natural gas through the domestic pipeline system and enhancing crude oil production through artificial lift processes. As such, our compression services play a critical role in the production, processing and transportation of both natural gas and crude oil.
We provide compression services in a number of shale plays throughout the U.S., including the Utica, Marcellus, Permian Basin, Delaware Basin, Eagle Ford, Mississippi Lime, Granite Wash, Woodford, Barnett, Haynesville, Niobrara and Fayetteville shales. Demand for our services is driven by the domestic production of natural gas and crude oil. As such, we have focused our activities in areas of attractive natural gas and crude oil production growth, which are generally found in these shale and unconventional resource plays. According to studies promulgated by the EIA, the production and transportation volumes in these shale plays are expected to increase over the long term. Furthermore, the changes in production volumes and pressures of shale plays over time require a wider range of compression services than in conventional basins. We believe we are well-positioned to meet these changing operating conditions due to the operational design flexibility inherit in our compression units. 
While our business focuses largely on compression services serving infrastructure applications, including centralized natural gas gathering systems and processing facilities, which utilize large horsepower compression units, typically in shale plays, we also provide compression services in more mature conventional basins, including gas lift applications on crude oil wells targeted by horizontal drilling techniques. Gas lift, a process by which natural gas is injected into the production tubing of an existing producing well, in order to reduce the hydrostatic pressure and allow the oil to flow at a higher rate, and other artificial lift technologies are critical to the enhancement of oil production from horizontal wells operating in tight shale plays. 
We operate a modern fleet of compression units, with an average age of approximately seven years. We acquire our compression units from third-party fabricators who build the units to our specifications, utilizing specific components from original equipment manufacturers and assembling the units in a manner that provides us the ability to meet certain operating condition thresholds. Our standard new-build compression units are generally configured for multiple compression stages allowing us to operate our units across a broad range of operating conditions. The design flexibility of our units, particularly in midstream applications, allows us to enter into longer-term contracts and reduces the redeployment risk of our horsepower in the field. Our modern and standardized fleet, decentralized field level operating structure and technical proficiency in predictive 
and preventive maintenance and overhaul operations have enabled us to achieve average service run times consistently at or above the levels required by our customers and maintain high overall utilization rates for our fleet.
As part of our services, we engineer, design, operate, service and repair our compression units and maintain related support inventory and equipment. The compression units in our modern fleet are designed to be easily adaptable to fit our customers’ changing compression requirements. Focusing on the needs of our customers and providing them with reliable and flexible compression services in geographic areas of attractive growth helps us to generate stable cash flows for our unitholders.
We provide compression services to our customers under fixed-fee contracts with initial contract terms typically between six months and five years, depending on the application and location of the compression unit. We typically continue to provide compression services at a specific location beyond the initial contract term, either through contract renewal or on a month-to-month or longer basis. We primarily enter into fixed-fee contracts whereby our customers are required to pay our monthly fee even during periods of limited or disrupted throughput, which enhances the stability and predictability of our cash flows. We are not directly exposed to commodity price risk because we do not take title to the natural gas or crude oil involved in our services and because the natural gas used as fuel by our compression units is supplied by our customers without cost to us.
We provide compression services to major oil companies and independent producers, processors, gatherers and transporters of natural gas and crude oil.  Regardless of the application for which our services are provided, our customers rely upon the availability of the equipment used to provide compression services and our expertise to maximize the throughput of product, reduce fuel costs and minimize emissions. While we significantly expanded our geographic footprint with the CDM Acquisition, our customers may have compression demands in areas of the U.S. in conjunction with their field development projects where we are not currently operating. We continually consider further expansion of our geographic areas of operation in the U.S. based upon the level of customer demand. Our modern, flexible fleet of compression units, which have been designed to be rapidly deployed and redeployed throughout the country, provides us with opportunities to expand into other areas with both new and existing customers. 
We also own and operate a fleet of equipment used to provide natural gas treating services, such as carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide removal, natural gas cooling and dehydration, to natural gas producers and midstream companies.
Our assets and operations are organized into a single reportable segment and are all located and conducted in the U.S. See our consolidated financial statements, and the notes thereto, in Part II, Item 8 “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for financial information on our operations and assets; such information is incorporated herein by reference.
Recent Developments
Credit Agreement Amendment
The Credit Agreement was amended on August 3, 2020 (the “Amendment Effective Date”) to amend, among other things, the requirements of certain covenants and the date on which certain covenants in the Credit Agreement must be met beginning on the Amendment Effective Date until the last day of the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2021 (the “Covenant Relief Period”).
The amendment, among other items, increases the maximum funded debt to EBITDA ratio to (i) 5.75 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2020 and December 31, 2020, (ii) 5.50 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2021 and June 30, 2021 and (iii) 5.25 to 1.00 for the fiscal quarters ending September 30, 2021 and December 31, 2021 (reverting back to 5.00 to 1.00 after the Covenant Relief Period).
In addition, during the Covenant Relief Period, the applicable margin for Eurodollar borrowings is increased from a range of 2.00% – 2.75% to a range of 2.25% – 3.00%.
COVID-19
Beginning in the first quarter of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic prompted several states and municipalities in which we operate to take extraordinary and wide-ranging actions to contain and combat the outbreak and spread of the virus, including mandates for many individuals to substantially restrict daily activities and for many businesses to curtail or cease normal operations. These mandates and restrictions have varied across jurisdictions and, over time, have been rescinded and reinstated as the severity of the pandemic fluctuated. For as long as COVID-19 continues or worsens, governments may impose additional similar restrictions or reinstate previously lifted ones. To date, our field operations have continued largely uninterrupted as the U.S. Department of Homeland Security designated our industry part of our country’s critical infrastructure. Thus far, remote work and other COVID-19 related conditions have not significantly impacted our ability to maintain operations or caused us to incur significant additional expenses; however, we are unable to predict the duration or ultimate impact of current and potential future COVID-19 mitigation measures.
Our Operations
Compression Services
We provide compression services for a fixed monthly service fee. As part of our services, we engineer, design, operate, service and repair our fleet of compression units and maintain related support inventory and equipment. In certain instances, we also engineer, design, install, operate, service and repair certain ancillary equipment used in conjunction with our compression services. We have consistently provided average service run times at or above the levels required by our customers. In general, our team of field service technicians services only our compression fleet and ancillary equipment. In limited circumstances and for established customers, we will agree to service third-party owned equipment. We do not own any compression fabrication facilities.
Our Compression Fleet
The fleet of compression units that we own and use to provide compression services consists of specially engineered compression units that utilize standardized components, principally engines manufactured by Caterpillar, Inc. and compressor frames and cylinders manufactured by Ariel Corporation. Our units can be rapidly and cost effectively modified for specific customer applications. As of December 31, 2020, the average age of our compression units was approximately seven years. Our modern, standardized compression unit fleet is powered primarily by the Caterpillar 3400, 3500 and 3600 engine classes, which range from 401 to 5,000 horsepower per unit. These larger horsepower units, which we define as 400 horsepower per unit or greater, represented 86.3% of our total fleet horsepower as of December 31, 2020. The remainder of our fleet consists of smaller horsepower units ranging from 40 horsepower to 399 horsepower that are primarily used in gas lift applications. We believe the average age and overall composition of our compressor fleet result in fewer mechanical failures, lower fuel usage, and reduced environmental emissions.
The following table provides a summary of our compression units by horsepower as of December 31, 2020:

Unit Horsepower | FleetHorsepower | Number ofUnits | | Percent ofFleetHorsepower | Percent ofUnits

(1)Fleet horsepower is horsepower for compression units that have been delivered to us (and excludes units on order).
(2)Total available horsepower is revenue generating horsepower under contract for which we are billing a customer, horsepower in our fleet that is under contract but is not yet generating revenue, horsepower not yet in our fleet that is under contract but not yet generating revenue and that is subject to a purchase order, and idle horsepower. Total available horsepower excludes new horsepower on order for which we do not have an executed compression services contract. 
(3)Revenue generating horsepower is horsepower under contract for which we are billing a customer.
(4)Calculated as the average of the month-end revenue generating horsepower for each of the months in the period. 
(5)Calculated as the average of the month-end revenue generating horsepower per revenue generating compression unit for each of the months in the period. 
(6)Horsepower utilization is calculated as (i) the sum of (a) revenue generating horsepower, (b) horsepower in our fleet that is under contract, but is not yet generating revenue and (c) horsepower not yet in our fleet that is under contract, not yet generating revenue and that is subject to a purchase order, divided by (ii) total available horsepower less idle horsepower that is under repair. Horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower was 80.4% and 89.9% at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. 
(7)Calculated as the average utilization for the months in the period based on utilization at the end of each month in the period. Average horsepower utilization based on revenue generating horsepower and fleet horsepower was 84.5% and 89.8% for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Many of our compression units contain devices that enable us to monitor the units remotely through cellular and satellite networks to supplement our technicians’ on-site monitoring visits. We intend to continue to selectively add remote monitoring systems to our new and existing fleet during 2021 where beneficial from an operational and financial standpoint. All of our compression units are designed to automatically shut down if operating conditions deviate from a pre-determined range. While we retain the care, custody, ongoing maintenance and control of our compression units, we allow our customers, subject to a defined protocol, to start, stop, accelerate and slow down compression units in response to field conditions.
We adhere to routine, preventive and scheduled maintenance cycles. Each of our compression units is subjected to rigorous sizing and diagnostic analyses, including lubricating oil analysis and engine exhaust emission analysis. We have proprietary field service automation capabilities that allow our service technicians to electronically record and track operating, technical, environmental and commercial information at the discrete unit level. These capabilities allow our field technicians to identify potential problems and often act on them before such problems result in down-time.
Generally, we expect each of our compression units to undergo a major overhaul between service deployment cycles. The timing of these major overhauls depends on multiple factors, including run time and operating conditions. A major overhaul involves the periodic rebuilding of the unit to materially extend its economic useful life or to enhance the unit’s ability to fulfill broader or more diversified compression applications. Because our compression fleet is comprised of units of varying horsepower that have been placed into service with staggered initial on-line dates, we are able to schedule overhauls in a way that avoids excessive annual maintenance capital expenditures and minimizes the revenue impact of down-time.
We believe that our customers, by outsourcing their compression requirements, can achieve higher compression run-times, which translates into increased volumes of either natural gas or crude oil production and, therefore, increased revenues. 
Utilizing our compression services also allows our customers to reduce their operating, maintenance and equipment costs by allowing us to efficiently manage their changing compression needs. In many of our service contracts, we guarantee our customers availability (as described below) ranging from 95% to 98%, depending on field-level requirements.
Marketing and Sales
Our marketing and client service functions are performed on a coordinated basis by our sales team and field technicians. Salespeople, applications engineers and field technicians qualify, analyze and scope new compression applications as well as regularly visit our customers to ensure customer satisfaction, determine a customer’s needs related to existing services being provided and determine the customer’s future compression service requirements. This ongoing communication allows us to quickly identify and respond to our customers’ compression requirements.
Customers
Our customers consist of more than 275 companies in the energy industry, including major integrated oil companies, public and private independent exploration and production companies, and midstream companies. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 35%, 33% and 33% of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Suppliers and Service Providers
The principal manufacturers of components for our natural gas compression equipment include Caterpillar, Inc., Cummins Inc., and Arrow Engine Company for engines, Air-X-Changers and Alfa Laval (US) for coolers, and Ariel Corporation, GE Oil & Gas Gemini products and Arrow Engine Company for compressor frames and cylinders. We also rely primarily on four vendors, A G Equipment Company, Alegacy Equipment, LLC, Standard Equipment Corp. and Genis Holdings LLC, to package and assemble our compression units. Although we rely primarily on these suppliers, we believe alternative sources for natural gas compression equipment are generally available if needed. However, relying on alternative sources may increase our costs and change the standardized nature of our fleet. We have not experienced any material supply problems to date. Although lead-times for new Caterpillar engines and new Ariel compressor frames have in the past been in excess of one year due to increased demand and supply allocations imposed on equipment packagers and end-users, as of December 31, 2020, lead-times for such engines and frames are approximately six months. Please read Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – We depend on a limited number of suppliers and are vulnerable to product shortages and price increases, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations”.
Competition
The compression services business is highly competitive. Some of our competitors have a broader geographic scope and greater financial and other resources than we do. On a regional basis, we experience competition from numerous smaller companies that may be able to more quickly adapt to changes within our industry and changes in economic conditions as a whole, more readily take advantage of available opportunities and adopt more aggressive pricing policies. Additionally, the historical availability of attractive financing terms from financial institutions and equipment manufacturers has made the purchase of individual compression units affordable to our customers. We believe that we compete effectively on the basis of price, equipment availability, customer service, flexibility in meeting customer needs, quality and reliability of our compressors and related services. Please read Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – We face significant competition that may cause us to lose market share and reduce our cash available for distribution”.
Seasonality
Our results of operations have not historically been materially affected by seasonality, and we do not currently have reason to believe that seasonal fluctuations will have a material impact in the foreseeable future.
Insurance
We believe that our insurance coverage is customary for the industry and adequate for our business. As is customary in the energy services industry, we review our safety equipment and procedures and carry insurance against most, but not all, risks of our business. Losses and liabilities not covered by insurance would increase our costs. The compression business can be hazardous, involving unforeseen circumstances such as uncontrollable flows of gas or well fluids, fires and explosions or environmental damage. To address the hazards inherent in our business, we maintain insurance coverage that, subject to significant deductibles, includes physical damage coverage, third party general liability insurance, employer’s liability, environmental and pollution and other coverage, although coverage for environmental and pollution related losses is subject to significant limitations. Under the terms of our standard compression services contract, we are responsible for maintaining insurance coverage on our compression equipment. Please read Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors – General Risk Factors – We do not insure against all potential losses and could be seriously harmed by unexpected liabilities”.
Environmental and Safety Regulations
We are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to protection of human health, safety and the environment. These regulations include compliance obligations for air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges and solid and hazardous waste disposal, as well as regulations designed for the protection of human health and safety and threatened or endangered species. Compliance with these environmental laws and regulations may expose us to significant costs and liabilities and cause us to incur significant capital expenditures in our operations. We are often obligated to assist customers in obtaining permits or approvals in our operations from various federal, state and local authorities. Permits and approvals can be denied or delayed, which may cause us to lose potential and current customers, interrupt our operations and limit our growth and revenue. Moreover, failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imposition of remedial obligations and the issuance of injunctions delaying or prohibiting operations. Private parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance as well as to seek damages for non-compliance with environmental laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage. While we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that continued compliance with current requirements would not have a material adverse effect on us, we cannot predict whether our cost of compliance will materially increase in the future. Any changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, existing environmental laws and regulations, or passage of additional environmental laws and regulations that result in more stringent and costly pollution control equipment, waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or remediation requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial position.
We do not believe that compliance with federal, state or local environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations or cash flows. We cannot assure you, however, that future events such as changes in existing laws or enforcement policies, the promulgation of new laws or regulations, or the development or discovery of new facts or conditions or unforeseen incidents will not cause us to incur significant costs. The following is a discussion of material environmental and safety laws that relate to our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all of these environmental laws and regulations. Please read Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Government Legislation and Regulation – We are subject to substantial environmental regulation, and changes in these regulations could increase our costs or liabilities”.
Air emissions. The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws regulate emissions of air pollutants from various industrial sources, including natural gas compressors, and impose certain monitoring and reporting requirements. Such emissions are regulated by air emissions permits, which are applied for and obtained through various state or federal regulatory agencies. Our standard natural gas compression contract provides that the customer is responsible for obtaining air emissions permits and assuming the environmental risks related to site operations. In some instances, our customers may be required to aggregate emissions from a number of different sources on the theory that the different sources should be considered a single source. Any such determinations could have the effect of making projects more costly than our customers expected and could require the installation of more costly emissions controls, which may lead some of our customers not to pursue certain projects.
Increased obligations of operators to reduce air emissions of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants from internal combustion engines in transmission service have been enacted by governmental authorities. For example, in 2010, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) published new regulations under the CAA to control emissions of hazardous air pollutants from existing stationary reciprocal internal combustion engines, also known as Quad Z regulations. The rule requires us to undertake certain expenditures and activities, including purchasing and installing emissions control equipment on certain compressor engines and generators.
In recent years, the EPA has lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for several air pollutants. For example, in 2015, the EPA finalized a rule strengthening the primary and secondary standards for ground level ozone, both of which are 8-hour concentration standards of 70 parts per billion. In December 2020, the EPA announced its decision to retain, without changes, the 2015 NAAQS. After the EPA revises a NAAQS standard, the states are expected to establish revised attainment/non-attainment regions. State implementation of the 2015 NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, delay or prohibit our customers’ ability to obtain such permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, which could impact our customers’ operations, increase the cost of additions to property, plant, and equipment, and negatively impact our business.
In 2012, the EPA finalized rules that establish new air emissions controls for oil and natural gas production and natural gas processing operations. Specifically, the EPA’s rule package included New Source Performance Standards to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds (“VOCs”) and a separate set of emissions standards to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with oil and natural gas production and processing activities. The rules established specific new requirements regarding emissions from compressors and controllers at natural gas processing plants, dehydrators, storage tanks 
and other production equipment as well as the first federal air standards for natural gas wells that are hydraulically fractured. In June 2016, the EPA took steps to expand on these regulations when it published New Source Performance Standards, known as Subpart OOOOa, that required certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce methane gas and VOC emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards would have expanded the 2012 New Source Performance Standards by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices, requiring additional controls for pneumatic controllers and pumps as well as compressors, and imposing leak detection and repair requirements for natural gas compressor and booster stations. However, in September 2020, the EPA issued a final rule that removed the transmission and storage segment from the 2016 New Source Performance Standards, rescinded VOCs and methane emissions standards for the transmission and storage segment, and rescinded methane emissions standards for the production and processing segments. Various states and industry and environmental groups are separately challenging the EPA’s 2016 standards and its September 2020 final rule. Notwithstanding the current court challenges, on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing the EPA to consider publishing for notice and comment a proposed rule suspending, revising, or rescinding the September 2020 rule, which could result in more stringent methane emission rulemaking.
Any additional regulation of air emissions from the oil and gas sector could result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, which could impact our customers’ operations and negatively impact our business.
We are also subject to air regulation at the state level. For example, the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (“TCEQ”) has finalized revisions to certain air permit programs that significantly increase the air permitting requirements for new and certain existing oil and gas production and gathering sites for 15 counties in the Barnett Shale production area. The final rule establishes new emissions standards for engines, which could impact the operation of specific categories of engines by requiring the use of alternative engines, compressor packages or the installation of aftermarket emissions control equipment. The rule became effective for the Barnett Shale production area in April 2011, with the lower emissions standards becoming applicable between 2015 and 2030 depending on the type of engine and the permitting requirements. The cost to comply with the revised air permit programs is not expected to be material at this time. However, the TCEQ has stated it will consider expanding application of the new air permit program statewide. At this point, we cannot predict the cost to comply with such requirements if the geographic scope is expanded.
There can be no assurance that future requirements compelling the installation of more sophisticated emissions control equipment would not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution.
Climate change. Methane, a primary component of natural gas, and carbon dioxide, a byproduct of the burning of natural gas, are examples of greenhouse gases (“GHGs”). In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered legislation to reduce GHG emissions. At the federal level, President Biden could seek to pursue legislative, regulatory or executive initiatives that may impose significant restrictions on fossil-fuel exploration, production and use such as limitations or bans on hydraulic fracturing of oil and gas wells, bans or restrictions on new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, and imposing restrictive requirements on new pipeline infrastructure or fossil-fuel export facilities. For example, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing the Secretary of the Interior to pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. Other energy legislation and initiatives could include a carbon tax or cap and trade program. At the state level, many states, including the states in which we or our customers conduct operations, have adopted legal requirements that have imposed new or more stringent permitting, disclosure or well construction requirements on oil and gas activities. Further, although Congress has not passed such legislation, almost half of the states have begun to address GHG emissions, primarily through the planned development of emissions inventories or regional GHG cap and trade programs. Depending on the particular program, we could be required to control GHG emissions or to purchase and surrender allowances for GHG emissions resulting from our operations.
Independent of Congress, the EPA undertook to adopt regulations controlling GHG emissions under its existing CAA authority. For example, in 2009, the EPA officially published its findings that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs endanger human health and the environment, allowing the agency to proceed with the adoption of regulations that restrict emissions of GHG under existing provisions of the CAA. In 2009 and 2010, the EPA adopted rules regarding regulation of GHG emissions from motor vehicles and requiring the reporting of GHG emissions in the U.S. from specified large GHG emissions sources, including petroleum and natural gas facilities such as natural gas transmission compression facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent per year.
In addition, from time to time, there have been various proposals to regulate hydraulic fracturing at the federal level. Hydraulic fracturing involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into the rock formation to stimulate gas production. On January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing the Secretary of the Interior to pause approval of new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review 
and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices, effectively limiting hydraulic fracturing on federal lands and waters. Any limitations or bans on hydraulic fracturing at the federal level could increase the costs of operations for our customers who operate on federal land, and negatively impact our business.
Some states have also passed legislation or regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing. For example, in 2019, Colorado passed Senate Bill 181, which delegates authority to local governments to regulate oil and gas activities and requires the Colorado Oil and Gas Conservation Commission to minimize emissions of methane and other air contaminants. Some local communities have adopted additional restrictions for oil and gas activities, such as requiring greater setbacks, and some groups are petitioning local governments to ban hydraulic fracturing. If additional regulatory measures are adopted that ban or restrict production of natural gas through hydraulic fracturing, our customers could experience delays, limitations, or prohibitions on their activities. Such delays, limitations, or prohibitions could result in decreased demand for our services. 
Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of cities, local governments and other plaintiffs have sued companies engaged in the exploration and production of fossil fuels in state and federal courts, alleging various legal theories to recover for the impacts of alleged global warming effects, such as rising sea levels. Many of these suits allege that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. Although a number of these lawsuits have been dismissed, others remain pending and the outcome of these cases remains difficult to predict. 
At the international level, nearly 200 nations entered into an international climate agreement at the 2015 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, under which participating countries did not assume any binding obligation to reduce future emissions of GHGs but instead pledged to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions. The Paris Agreement went into effect on November 4, 2016. While the U.S. withdrew from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020, President Biden issued an executive order on January 20, 2021 recommitting the United States to the Paris Agreement. In addition, certain U.S. city and state governments have announced their intention to satisfy their proportionate obligations under the Paris Agreement.
Although it is not currently possible to predict with specificity how any proposed or future GHG legislation, regulation, agreements or initiatives will impact our business, any legislation or regulation of GHG emissions that may be imposed in areas in which we conduct business or on the assets we operate, including a carbon tax or cap and trade program, could result in increased compliance or operating costs or additional operating restrictions or reduced demand for our services, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the EIA estimates that oil and gas will continue to represent a major share of energy use through 2050.  However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector.
Finally, it should be noted that some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHG in Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant weather-related effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods and other climatic events. If any of those effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.

The Clean Water Act (“CWA”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the U.S. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. The CWA and regulations implemented thereunder also prohibit the discharge of dredge and fill material into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, unless authorized by an appropriately issued permit. The CWA also requires the development and implementation of spill prevention, control and countermeasures, including the construction and maintenance of containment berms and similar structures, if required, to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters in the event of a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak at such facilities. In addition, the CWA and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the CWA and analogous state laws and regulations.
Our compression operations do not generate process wastewaters that are discharged to waters of the U.S. In any event, our customers assume responsibility under the majority of our standard natural gas compression contracts for obtaining any permits that may be required under the CWA, whether for discharges or developing property by filling wetlands. On April 21, 2020, the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a rule streamlining the standard for what constitutes jurisdictional waters and wetlands subject to the protections and requirements of the CWA. Lawsuits have been filed challenging the rule, and on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order directing the heads of all agencies to immediately review all 
regulatory actions taken between January 20, 2017 and January 20, 2021, including the April 2020 rule. Should the April 2020 rule be rescinded or a different rule promulgated that expands the jurisdictional reach of the CWA, our customers could face increased costs and delays due to additional permitting and regulatory requirements and possible challenges to permitting decisions.
Safe Drinking Water Act. A significant portion of our customers’ natural gas production is developed from unconventional sources that require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. Legislation to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act (“SDWA”) to repeal the exemption for hydraulic fracturing from the definition of “underground injection” and require federal permitting and regulatory control of hydraulic fracturing, as well as legislative proposals to require disclosure of the chemical constituents of the fluids used in the fracturing process, have been proposed from time to time and the U.S. Congress continues to consider legislation to amend the SDWA. Several states have also proposed or adopted legislative or regulatory restrictions on hydraulic fracturing, including prohibitions on the practice. We cannot predict the future of such legislation and what additional, if any, provisions would be included. If additional levels of regulation, restrictions and permits were required through the adoption of new laws and regulations at the federal or state level or if the agencies that issue the permits develop new interpretations of those requirements, that could lead to delays, increased operating costs and process prohibitions that could reduce demand for our compression services, which could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.
Site remediation. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and comparable state laws may impose strict, joint and several liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons that contributed to the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the owner and operator of a disposal site where a hazardous substance release occurred and any company that transported, disposed of or arranged for the transport or disposal of hazardous substances released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be liable for the costs of remediating the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources, and for the costs of certain health studies. In addition, where contamination may be present, it is not uncommon for the neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury, property damage and recovery of response costs. While we generate materials in the course of our operations that may be regulated as hazardous substances, we have not received notification that we may be potentially responsible for cleanup costs under CERCLA at any site.
While we do not currently own or lease any material facilities or properties for storage or maintenance of our inactive compression units, we may use third party properties for such storage and possible maintenance and repair activities. In addition, our active compression units typically are installed on properties owned or leased by third party customers and operated by us pursuant to terms set forth in the natural gas compression services contracts executed by those customers. Under most of our natural gas compression services contracts, our customers must contractually indemnify us for certain damages we may suffer as a result of the release into the environment of hazardous and toxic substances. We are not currently responsible for any remedial activities at any properties we use; however, there is always the possibility that our future use of those properties may result in spills or releases of petroleum hydrocarbons, wastes or other regulated substances into the environment that may cause us to become subject to remediation costs and liabilities under CERCLA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or other environmental laws. We cannot provide any assurance that the costs and liabilities associated with the future imposition of such remedial obligations upon us would not have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial position.
Safety and health. The Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state statutes require that we organize and, as necessary, disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations to various federal, state and local agencies, as well as employees.
Human Capital Management
USA Compression Management Services, LLC (“USAC Management”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the General Partner, performs certain management and other administrative services for us, such as accounting, corporate development, finance and legal. All of our employees, including our executive officers, are employees of USAC Management. As of December 31, 2020, USAC Management had 742 full time employees. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. We consider our employee relations to be good.
Our employees are our greatest asset, and we seek to attract and retain top talent by fostering a culture that is guided by our four pillars of people, culture, equipment and service. These four pillars guide our values in a manner that respects all people with a commitment to safety and the environments where we operate.
Ethics and Values. We are committed to operating our business in a manner that honors and respects all people and the communities in which we do business. We recognize that people are our most critical resource, and we are committed to hiring and investing in our employee base. We value employees for what they bring to our organization by embracing those from diverse backgrounds, cultures, and experiences. We believe that one of the keys to our successes over time has been the cultivation of an atmosphere of inclusion and respect. These are the principles upon which we build and strengthen relationships among our people, our unitholders, our customers, and those within the communities we support. 
We believe strict adherence to our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics is not only right, but is in our best interest and the best interest of our unitholders, our customers, and the industry in general. In all instances, our policies require that the business of the Partnership be conducted in a lawful and ethical manner. Every employee acting on behalf of the Partnership must adhere to our policies. Please refer to Part III, Item 10 “Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance” for additional information on our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.
Commitment to Safety and the Environment. We have a strong commitment to safety and the environment. We provide continuous training opportunities for employees, including training that is required by applicable laws, regulations, standards, and permit conditions. Our safety standards and expectations are clearly communicated to all operations employees with the expectation that each individual has the obligation to make safety their highest priority. Our safety culture promotes an open environment for discovering, resolving, and sharing safety challenges. We strive to eliminate unwanted safety events and support our safety culture through a comprehensive program that includes a dedicated field operations based safety team, monthly employee safety meetings and safety audits, among other things. A portion of our senior management bonuses and field management bonuses are dependent on our safety performance. We promote employee empowerment, leadership, communication, personal responsibility to comply with standard operating procedures and regulatory requirements, effective risk reduction processes, and personal wellness. Our goal is operational excellence, which includes maintaining an injury- and incident-free workplace. To achieve this, we strive to hire and maintain the most qualified and dedicated workforce in the industry and make safety and safety accountability part of our daily operations. The OSHA Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) is a key performance indicator by which we evaluate the success of our safety program. TRIR provides a measure of occupational safety performance for the year by calculating the number of recordable incidents compared to the total number of hours worked by all employees. Out of more than 1,850,000 hours worked, our TRIR was 0.32 for 2020, compared to 0.84 in 2019, versus the industry average for 2020 which was 0.90. We believe our low TRIR and our 2,000,000 hours worked without a lost time event speaks to our investment in and focus on safety.
Regarding COVID-19, as an essential business providing critical energy infrastructure, the safety of our employees and the continued operation of our assets are our top priorities, and we continue to follow and operate in accordance with federal, state and local health guidelines and safety protocols. We also continue to follow the U.S. Center for Disease Control guidance and provide employees with training and direction to help maintain the health and safety of our workforce.
