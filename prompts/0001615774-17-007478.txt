Item 1  Description of Business
Background
 
Prior History — Sustut Exploration, Inc.
 
Sustut Exploration, Inc. was a Delaware corporation formed on April 11, 2006 to search for available mining properties in North Central British Columbia. It entered into an option agreement in 2006 to purchase a mineral claim, and the option expired in May 2008 without any payment being made. Thus, as of May 2008, Sustut had no operating business.
 
As a result of the reorganization on March 30, 2009, which is described below, Optex Systems Holdings changed its name from Sustut Exploration Inc. to Optex Systems Holdings, Inc.
 
Reorganization
 
On March 30, 2009, a reorganization occurred whereby the then existing shareholders of Optex Systems, Inc., a private Delaware corporation (“Optex Systems, Inc. (Delaware)”), exchanged their shares of Optex Systems, Inc. (Delaware) common stock with the shares of common stock of us as follows (all on a pre-split basis due to the historical context): (i) the outstanding 85,000,000 shares of Optex Systems, Inc. (Delaware) common stock were exchanged for 113,333,282 shares of our common stock, (ii) the outstanding 1,027 shares of Optex Systems, Inc. (Delaware) Series A preferred stock were exchanged for 1,027 shares of Series A preferred stock and (iii) the 8,131,667 shares of Optex Systems, Inc. (Delaware) common stock purchased in the private placement were exchanged for 8,131,667 (presplit) shares of us common stock. Optex Systems, Inc. (Delaware) has remained our wholly-owned subsidiary.

Current Line of Business
 
We manufacture optical sighting systems and assemblies, primarily for Department of Defense applications. Our products are installed on various types of U.S. military land vehicles, such as the Abrams and Bradley fighting vehicles, light armored and armored security vehicles and have been selected for installation on the Stryker family of vehicles. We also manufacture and deliver numerous periscope configurations, rifle and surveillance sights and night vision optical assemblies. Our products consist primarily of build-to-customer print products that are delivered both directly to the armed services and to other defense prime contractors. Less than 1% of today’s revenue is related to the resale of products substantially manufactured by others. In this case, the product would likely be a simple replacement part of a larger system previously produced by us.
 
We continue to field new product opportunities from both domestic and international customers. Given continuing unrest in multiple global hot spots, the need for precision optics continues to increase. Most of these requirements are for observation and situational awareness applications; however, we continue to see requests for higher magnification and custom reticles in various product modifications. The basic need to protect the soldier while providing information about the mission environment continues to be the primary driver for these requirements.
 
We do not believe that the change in government administration will cause a major change in the direction of funding or product need for the U.S. military. Maintenance will still be required, and the opportunities for us to upgrade existing systems with higher performing systems will continue to present themselves. Spending levels may change, but given the mix between foreign spending, domestic/prime demand, and the more recent commercial opportunities, we do not expect any negative trends arising from political domestic changes into fiscal 2017.
 
Recent Events
 
Sileas Corp.
 
On June 9, 2017, Sileas Corp. (“Sileas”), a related party to us, entered into a transaction with The Longview Fund, L.P.(“Longview”) to settle its February 20, 2009 note with Longview in the original principal amount of $13,524,405 (the “Note”). The parties agreed to a conversion by Longview of $3,358,538 of the amount due under the Note into 2,798,782 shares of Company common stock owned by Sileas and previously pledged to Longview as security with respect to the Note. Simultaneously therewith, Sileas made a $250,000 cash payment to Longview, and Longview agreed to cancel the remaining debt of $10,571,791 due under the Note. The remaining amount due under the Note is $64,000 which shall be paid in cash by Sileas to Longview on a quarterly basis, upon the payment of quarterly dividends by us, over the next four calendar quarters commencing on or about June 30, 2017. In order to effect the above, Longview also released the pledge on all of our shares owned by Sileas and previously pledged to Longview.
 
Simultaneously with the above, Sileas sold 800,000 shares of our common stock to Danny Schoening and Karen Hawkins at a price equal to $314,000 (which is a discounted amount based upon recognition of years of administrative support by Mr. Schoening and Ms. Hawkins for the Company) as follows: (i) Danny Schoening: 640,000 Shares for $200,000 plus a $50,825 promissory note; and (ii) Karen Hawkins: 160,000 Shares for $50,000 plus a $12,706 promissory note. Each promissory note has a one year term, with interest at 1.18% per annum and shall be payable in four equal quarterly installments of $12,800 for Danny Schoening and $3,200 for Karen Hawkins, each installment payable within five business days after the payment of cash dividends by us to each of them. As a result, Sileas no longer owns any shares of our common stock.
 
After giving effect to the above transactions, the beneficial ownership of our equity securities by held by each of the Longview Fund, Danny Schoening and Karen Hawkins as of December 18, 2017 is follows:
 
The Longview Fund 2,800,132 shares or 31.1%

Danny Schoening 744,287 shares or 8.3%
 
Karen Hawkins shares 192,563 or 2.1%
 
Changes to the Board of Directors
 
Effective as of May 31, 2017, Charles Trego resigned as a director of us and from all appointments to Committees of our Board of Directors. On May 26, 2016, Kerry Craven resigned as one of our directors.
 
Effective as of June 9, 2017, Peter Benz resigned as Chairman of the Board and a Director of us.

--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | The facility contains customary events of default. Upon the occurrence of an event of default that remains uncured after any applicable cure period, Avidbank’s commitment to make further advances may terminate, and Avidbank would also be entitled to pursue other remedies against us and the pledged collateral. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pursuant to a guaranty executed by Optex Systems Holdings in favor of Avidbank, Optex Systems Holdings has guaranteed all obligations of Optex Systems, Inc. to Avidbank. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
On October 17, 2016, we further amended our revolving credit facility with Avidbank to increase the facility to $2.2 million and to allow for a $250 thousand letter of credit sublimit with an annual fee of 1.5% of the face amount of the letter of credit. On October 17, 2016, we secured a $250 thousand irrevocable letter of credit from Avidbank with Cabot Industrial Value Fund II Operating Partnership, L.P. as the beneficiary. The letter of credit was issued as a condition of our facility lease, executed on October 21, 2016t for the Applied Optics Center facility in Dallas, Texas.
 
2016 Restricted Stock Unit Plan
 
On June 14, 2016, our Compensation Committee approved our 2016 Restricted Stock Unit Plan. This plan provides for issuance of stock units (“RSUs”) for up to 1,000,000 shares of our common stock. Each RSU constitutes a right to receive one share of our common stock, subject to vesting, which unless otherwise stated in an RSU agreement, shall vest in equal amounts on the first, second and third anniversary of the grant date. Shares of our common stock underlying the number of vested RSUs will be delivered as soon as practicable after vesting. During the period between grant and vesting, the RSUs may not be transferred, and the grantee has no rights as a shareholder until vesting has occurred. If the grantee’s employment is terminated for any reason (other than following a change in control of us or a termination of an officer other than for cause), then any unvested RSUs under the award will automatically terminate and be forfeited. If an officer grantee’s employment is terminated by us without cause or by the grantee for good reason, then, provided that the RSUs have not been previously forfeited, the remaining unvested portion of the RSUs will immediately vest as of the officer grantee’s termination date. In the event of a change in control, our obligations regarding outstanding RSUs shall, on such terms as may be approved by the Committee prior to such event, immediately vest, be assumed by the surviving or continuing company or cancelled in exchange for property (including cash).

On June 15, 2016, we issued 150,000 RSUs to our Chief Executive Officer, Danny Schoening, and 50,000 RSUs to our Chief Financial Officer, Karen Hawkins. The RSUs issued to Mr. Schoening and Ms. Hawkins vest as follows: 34% on January 1, 2017, 33% on January 1, 2018 and 33% on January 1, 2019.
 
On June 14, 2017, we issued 50,000 RSUs to Bill Bates, General Manager of the Applied Optics Center and a newly appointed board member. The RSUs will vest over three years as follows: 34% on January 1, 2018, 33% on January 1, 2019 and 33% on January 1, 2020.
 
Public Offering
 
On August 26, 2016, we consummated a public offering of 2,291,000 Class A units consisting of common stock and warrants and 400 Class B units consisting of shares of Series C convertible stock and warrants for a total gross purchase price of $4,750,280.
New Product Development
 
On November 10, 2015, we entered into a retail sales relationship with Cabela’s Inc., to distribute our Red Tail Digital Spotting Scope, patented on July 11, 2017, as well as our new Stabilized Monocular. We are presently in negotiations to make these devices available via General Services Administration schedules for government personnel.
Products
 
Our products are installed on various types of U.S. military land vehicles, such as the Abrams and Bradley, and Stryker families of fighting vehicles, as well as light armored and armored security vehicles. We also manufacture and deliver numerous periscope configurations, rifle and surveillance sights and night vision optical assemblies. We deliver our products both directly to the federal government and to prime contractors.
 
We deliver high volume products, under multi-year contracts, to large defense contractors and government customers. Increased emphasis in the past two years has been on new opportunities to promote and deliver our products in foreign military sales, where U.S.-manufactured, combat and wheeled vehicles, are supplied (and upgraded) in cooperation with the U.S. Department of Defense.

Location and Facility
 
We are headquartered in Richardson, TX and lease approximately 93,967 combined square feet of facilities including Richardson, Texas and Dallas, Texas. As of December 5, 2017, we had 98 full time equivalent employees. We operate with a single shift, and capacity could be expanded by adding a second shift. Our proprietary processes and methodologies provide barriers to entry for other competing suppliers. In many cases, we are the sole source provider or one of only two providers of a product. We have capabilities which include machining, bonding, painting, tracking, engraving and assembly and can perform both optical and environmental testing in-house. We renewed the lease on our 49,100 square foot, Richardson, Texas facility, effective as of December 10, 2013, with a lease expiration of March 31, 2021. As of December 5, 2017, the Richardson facility operates with 61 full time equivalent employees in a single shift operation.
 
In November 2014, we also acquired a business unit from L-3 Communications, Inc., which is described herein below under “Recent Events — Acquisition”. The acquisition, Applied Optics Center, is located in Dallas, Texas with leased premises consisting of approximately 44,867 square feet of space. As of December 5, 2017, the Applied Optics Center operates with 37 full time equivalent employees in a single shift operation.
 
Contracts
 
Many of our contracts allow for government contract financing in the form of contract progress payments pursuant to Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.232-16, “Progress Payments”.  As a small business, and subject to certain limitations, this clause provides for government payment of up to 90% of incurred program costs prior to product delivery.  To the extent our contracts allow for progress payments, we intend to utilize this benefit, thereby minimizing the working capital impact on us for materials and labor required to complete the contracts.
 
Our contracts allow for Federal Acquisition Regulation 52.243-1 which entitles the contractor to an “equitable adjustment” to the contract if the contract changes result in a change in contract costs or time of performance.  In essence, an equitable price adjustment request is a request for a contract price modification (generally an increase) that allows for the contractor to be “made whole” for additional costs incurred which were necessitated by some modification of the contract effort.  This modification may come from an overt change in U.S. Government requirements or scope, or it may come from a change in the conditions surrounding the contract (e.g., differing site conditions or late delivery of U.S. Government-furnished property) which result in statement of work additions, deletions, part substitutions, schedule or other changes to the contract which impact the contractor’s overall cost to complete.

Each contract with our customers has specific quantities of material that need to be purchased, assembled, and then shipped. Prior to bidding a contract, we contact potential sources of material and receive qualified quotations for each material. In some cases, the entire volume is given to a single supplier and in other cases, the volume might be split between several suppliers. If a contract has a single source supplier and that supplier fails to meet their obligations (e.g., quality, delivery), then we would attempt to find an acceptable alternate supplier, and if successful, we would then renegotiate contractual deliverables (e.g., specifications, delivery, price). As of December 5, 2017, approximately 22% of our material requirements are single-sourced across 9 suppliers representing approximately 17% of our active supplier orders. Single-sourced component requirements span across all of our major product lines. Of these single sourced components, we have material contracts (purchase orders) with firm pricing and delivery schedules in place with each of the suppliers to supply the parts necessary to satisfy our current contractual needs.
 
We are subject to, and must comply with, various governmental regulations that impact, among other things, our revenue, operating costs, profit margins and the internal organization and operation of our business. The material regulations affecting our U.S. government business are summarized in the table below.
 

Regulation | Summary 
------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Federal Acquisition Regulation | The principal set of rules in the Federal Acquisition Regulation System. This system consists of sets of regulations issued by agencies of the federal government of the United States to govern what is called the “acquisition process,” which is the process through which the government acquires goods and services. That process consists of three phases: (1) need recognition and acquisition planning, (2) contract formation, and (3) contract administration. This system regulates the activities of government personnel in carrying out that process. It does not regulate the purchasing activities of private sector firms, except to the extent that those activities involve government solicitations and contracts by reference. 
International Traffic in Arms Regulations | United States government regulations that control the export and import of defense-related articles and services on the United States Munitions List. These regulations implement the provisions of the Arms Export Control Act. 
Truth in Negotiations Act | A public law enacted for the purpose of providing for full and fair disclosure by contractors in the conduct of negotiations with the government. The most significant provision included is the requirement that contractors submit certified cost and pricing data for negotiated procurements above a defined threshold of $750,000. It requires contractors to provide the government with an extremely broad range of cost or pricing information relevant to the expected costs of contract performance, and it requires contractors and subcontractors to submit cost or pricing data to the government and to certify that, to the best of their knowledge and belief, the data are current, accurate, and complete. 

 
We are responsible for full compliance with the Federal Acquisition Regulation. Upon award, the contract may identify certain regulations that we need to meet. For example, a contract may allow progress billing pursuant to specific Federal Acquisition Regulation clauses incorporated into the contract. Other contracts may call for specific first article acceptance and testing requirements. The Federal Acquisition Regulation will identify the specific regulations that we must follow based on the type of contract awarded. The Federal Acquisition Regulation also contains guidelines and regulations for managing a contract after award, including conditions under which contracts may be terminated, in whole or in part, at the government’s convenience or for default. These regulations also subject us to financial audits and other reviews by the government of our costs, performance, accounting and general business practices relating to our government contracts, which may result in adjustment of our contract-related costs and fees and, among other things and impose accounting rules that define allowable and unallowable costs governing our right to reimbursement under certain contracts.
 
First Article Testing and Acceptance requirements consist of specific steps. For example, the first article testing associated with Howitzer-type product is comprehensive and time consuming. The dimensions and material specifications of each piece of the assembly must be verified, and each product has in excess of 100 piece parts. Once the individual piece parts are verified to be compliant to the specification, the assembly processes are documented and verified. A sample of the production (typically three units) is verified to meet final performance specifications. Once the units meet the final performance specification, they are then subjected to accelerated life testing, a series of tests which simulate the lifetime use of the product in the field. This consists of exposing the units to thermal extremes, humidity, mechanical shock, vibration, and other physical exposure tests. Once completed, the units undergo a final verification process to ensure that no damage has occurred as a result of the testing and that they continue to meet the performance specification. All of the information and data is recorded into a final first article inspection and test report and submitted to the customer along with the test units for final approval. First Article Acceptance and Testing is generally required on new contracts/product awards but may also be required on existing products or contracts where there has been a significant gap in production, or where the product has undergone significant manufacturing process, material, tooling, equipment or product configuration changes.

We are also subject to laws, regulations and executive orders restricting the use and dissemination of information deemed classified for national security purposes and the exportation of certain products and technical data as covered by the International Traffic in Arms Regulation. In order to import or export items listed on the U.S. Munitions List, we are required to be registered with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls office. The registration is valid for one year, and the registration fees are established based on the number of license applications submitted the previous year. We currently have an approved and current registration on file with the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls office. Once the registration is approved, each import/export license must be filed separately. License approval requires the company to provide proof of need, such as a valid contract or purchase order requirement for the specific product or technical data requested on the license and requires a detailed listing of the items requested for export/import, the end-user, the end-user statement, the value of the items, consignees/freight forwarders and a copy of a valid contract or purchase order from the end-user. The approval process for the license can vary from several weeks to six months or more. The licenses we currently use are the DSP-5 (permanent export), DSP-6 (license revisions) and DSP-73 (temporary export).
 
The aforementioned licenses are valid for 48 months from date that each such license is issued as set forth on the table below (updated as of December 5, 2017).

Market Opportunity — U.S. Military
 
During the twelve months ending October 1, 2017, approximately 68% of our business was in support of U.S. military products. The chart below was derived from public government spending sources and depicts total U.S. military spending from 2007 through 2016 and estimated spending through 2022. The purpose of including this chart is to provide the reader with historical trend data and projected U.S. military defense and procurement spending over time. Military spending peaked at $678.1 billion in 2011. As of fiscal year 2017 the total projected military spending is projected to decline by 15.5% to $573.0 billion from the peak 2011 level. However, the military spending in the chart below depicts increased spending through 2022 of 11.8% with the largest increase of 8.5% occurring in the next fiscal year (2018). The projected increase of military procurement in fiscal 2018 represents an 8.1% increase over fiscal year 2017 levels. On November 16, 2017, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2018 was sent to President Trump to sign into law after passing both the House of Representatives and the Senate. The NDAA authorizes total spending of $700 billion which includes the authorization of $65.8 billion in additional funding for the Overseas Contingency Operation (OCO) account.

The table below depicts the U.S. Department of Defense budget request for fiscal year 2018 for major ground system programs. The total fiscal year 2018 budget request for major ground system programs is increased by 11.2% over the fiscal year 2017 levels and 16.7% over the fiscal year 2016 levels. Although it is difficult to directly tie the budget request to specific components provided by Optex Systems, we provide periscopes, collimator assemblies, vision blocks and laser interface filters to the U.S. armed forces on almost all of the ground system platforms categorized below.

The U.S. government spending reductions in the last seven years have had a significant impact on our product lines as our products directly support various types of U.S. military land vehicle procurements. As a result of lower U.S. government spending from the peak 2011 levels, the Company has continued to explore other opportunities for manufacturing outside of our traditional product lines for products which could be manufactured using our existing lines in order to fully utilize our existing capacity.
 
We are cautiously optimistic that the new government administrations proposed boost in military spending will have a favorable impact in the direction of funding or product need for the U.S. military. We anticipate that absent any significant changes from the current defense spending levels, maintenance will still be required, and the opportunities for us to upgrade existing systems with higher performing systems will continue to present themselves. Spending levels may change, but given the mix between foreign spending, domestic/prime demand, and the more recent commercial opportunities, we do not expect any negative trends arising from political domestic changes over the next twelve months.
 
The following factors are important to the U.S. military:
 

● | Product reliability — failure can cost lives 
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | Speed to delivery and adherence to delivery schedule 
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | System life cycle extension 
--+--------------------------------


● | Low cost/best value
--+--------------------


● | Visual aids for successful execution of mission objectives 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mission critical products specifically related to soldier safety. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 
15


We focus on delivering products that satisfy these factors and believes it is well positioned to continue to service U.S. and foreign military needs.

Market Opportunity — Foreign Military 
 
Despite the downturn in U.S. military spending, foreign military funding for products built in the United States for selected foreign militaries has held to peak funding levels. Thus, we have increased efforts to promote our proven military products, as well as newly improved product solutions directly to foreign military representatives. In 2014, we completed the first shipments of M17 Day/Thermal Periscope (NSN 6650-01-619-6545) to a country in South America. During fiscal year 2016, Optex Systems completed its first order of its patented M17 Day / Thermal Periscope for $0.6 million to Brazil. These direct sales transactions allow us to directly serve South American customers and affect influence into their future procurements. Additionally, shipment of the new M17 Day/Thermal Periscope validates our efforts to upgrade existing platforms with new technology. The M17 Day/Thermal Periscope is a cost effective upgrade to existing systems in that it provides both day and thermal views specifically designed for driving armored vehicles. It can be installed in vehicles which were originally designed without this technology and may be used as a backup to existing systems. We anticipate our efforts in South America will culminate in new orders for this technology in the near term. We will continue to pursue international opportunities through direct sales (e.g., General Dynamics Land Systems — Canada), International Parts Supply and through other existing customers (e.g., General Dynamics Land Systems — Israeli Namer Project).
 
We are also exploring possibilities to adapt some of our products for commercial use in those markets that demonstrate potential for solid revenue growth, both domestically and internationally.

Market Opportunity — Commercial
 
Our products are currently sold to military and related government markets. We believe there may be opportunities to commercialize various products we presently manufacture to address other markets. Our initial focus will be directed in four product areas.

● | Big Eye Binoculars — While the military application we produce is based on mature military designs, we own all castings, tooling and glass technology. These large fixed mount binoculars could be sold to cruise ships, personal yachts and cities/municipalities. The binoculars are also applicable to fixed, land based outposts for private commercial security as well as border patrols and regional law enforcement.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Night Vision Sight — We have manufactured the optical system for the NL-61 Night Vision Sight for the Ministry of Defense of Israel. This technology could be implemented for commercial applications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Infrared Imaging Equipment — We manufacture and assemble infrared imaging equipment and components for Raytheon’s Thermal Imaging M36 Mount product and has recently added a low-cost, uncooled, thin film, thermal imager through its partnership with selective suppliers. This combined equipment and technology has potential applications with the border patrol, police and governmental or commercial security agencies.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Thin Film Coatings — The acquisition of the Applied Optics Center (AOC) also creates a new sector of opportunity for commercial products for us. Globally, commercial optical products use thin film coatings to create product differentiation. These coatings can be used for redirecting light (mirrors), blocking light (laser protection), absorbing select light (desired wavelengths), and many other combinations. They are used in telescopes, rifle scopes, binoculars, microscopes, range finders, protective eyewear, photography, etc. Given this broad potential, the commercial applications are a key opportunity going forward.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Optical Assemblies – Through the Applied Optics Center, we are utilizing our experience in military sighting systems to pursue commercial opportunities associated with products that incorporate multi-lens optical cell assemblies, bonded optical elements and mechanical assemblies. There are a wide variety of products in the medical, machine vision, automotive and outdoor recreation fields that can benefit from our capabilities. Support to domestic customers for these type products has driven significant increases in overall sales during the last two years.

Customer Base
 
We serve customers in four primary categories: as prime defense contractor (Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Land and Maritime, DLA Warren, DLA Aviation, U.S. Army, Navy and Marine Corps), as defense subcontractor (General Dynamics, L-3 Communications, Harris Corporations, BAE, and NorcaTec), as a military supplier to foreign governments (Israel, Australia, South America and NAMSA) and also as a commercial optical assembly supplier (Nightforce Optics, Cabela’s). During the twelve months ended October 1, 2017, we derived approximately 86% of our gross business revenue from four major customers: U.S. government agencies (38%), Nightforce Optics, Inc. (22%), General Dynamics (19%), Harris Corporation (7%). We have approximately 100 discrete contracts for items that are utilized in vehicles, product lines and spare parts. Due to the high percentage of prime and subcontracted U.S. defense revenues, large customer size and the fact that there are multiple contracts with each entity, which are not interdependent, we are of the opinion that this provides us with a fairly well diversified revenue pool.
Marketing Plan
 


Potential Entrants — Low Risk to us. In order to enter this market, potential competitors must overcome several barriers to entry. The first hurdle is that an entrant would need to prove to the government agency in question the existence of a government approved accounting system for larger contracts. Second, the entrant would need to develop the processes required to produce the product. Third, the entrant would then need to produce the product and then submit successful test requirements (many of which require lengthy government consultation for completion). Finally, in many cases, the customer has an immediate need and therefore cannot wait for this qualification cycle and therefore must issue the contracts to existing suppliers. 
 
Historically, we competed with two other companies in different spaces. First, we previously competed with Miller-Holzwarth in the plastic periscope business. In July 2012, Miller-Holzwarth, Inc. ceased operations apparently as a result of an inability to meet its financial obligations combined with a decline in defense market conditions. Second, we currently compete with Seiler Instruments for fire control products. These contracts are higher value products, but lower quantities. Given the expense of development and qualification testing, the barrier to entry is high for new competitors. During the last four years, overall plastic periscope demand quantities have declined, while competition on the lower level periscope products has significantly increased as new contractors aggressively compete for market share amongst the existing customer base and quantities.
 
17


Buyers — Medium Risk to us. In most cases the buyers (usually government agencies or defense contractors) have two fairly strong suppliers. It is in their best interest to keep at least two, and therefore, in some cases, the contracts are split between suppliers. In the case of larger contracts, the customer can request an open book policy on costs and expects a reasonable margin to have been applied. 
 
Substitutes — Low Risk to us. We have both new vehicle contracts and replacement part contracts for the exact same product. The U.S. government has declared that the Abrams/Bradley base vehicles will be the ground vehicle of choice through 2040.
 
The Bradley vehicle has been in service for 28 years, the Abrams for 27 years. In February 2008, the U.S. Army signed a multiyear third party contract for the delivery of improved Abrams and Bradleys. The contract is for up to 435 tanks and 540 Bradley vehicles. These are the only production tanks currently in production by the government. This, in conjunction with the 30-year life span, supports their continued use through 2040. The Abrams is the principal battle tank of the United States Army and Marine Corps, and the armies of Egypt, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, and since 2007, Australia. The new contract terms allow efficiencies within the supply chain and a very long return on investment on new vehicle proposals. 
 
Suppliers — Low to Medium Risk to Optex Systems Holdings. The suppliers of standard processes (e.g., casting, machining and plating) need to be very competitive to gain and/or maintain contracts. Those suppliers of products that use top secret clearance processes are slightly better off; however, there continues to be multiple avenues of supply and therefore only moderate power. 
 
Consistent with our marketing plan and business model, the AOC acquisition strengthened our overall position by decreasing the bargaining power of their suppliers through the backwards integration of a key supplier and created additional barriers of entry of potential competitors. Overall, the customer base and the competition have seen the acquisition as creating a stronger company.
 
The second model is a two by two matrix for products and customers.

Manufacturing Space Planning 
 
We currently lease 93,967 square feet of manufacturing space (see “Location and Facility”), including the additional leased space in conjunction with our recent acquisition as described under “Recent Events”. Our current facilities are sufficient to meet our immediate production needs without excess capacity. As our processes are primarily labor driven, we are able to easily adapt to changes in customer demand by adjusting headcounts, overtime schedules and shifts in line with production needs. In the event additional floor space is required to accommodate new contracts, Optex has the option to lease adjacent floor space at the current negotiated lease cost per square foot. Consistent with the space planning, we will drive economies of scale to reduce support costs on a percentage of sales basis. These cost reductions can then be either passed through directly to the bottom line or used for business investment.
 
Our manufacturing process is driven by the use of six sigma techniques and process standardization. Initial activities in this area have been the successful six sigma projects in several production areas which have led to improved output and customer approval on the aesthetics of the work environment. In addition, we use many tools including 5S programs, six sigma processes, and define, measure, analyze, improve, control (DMAIC) problem solving techniques to identify bottlenecks within the process flow, reduce cost and improve product yields. Successful results can then be replicated across the production floor and drive operational improvements.
 
Economies of Scale
 
Plant efficiencies fluctuate as a function of program longevity, complexity and overall production volume. Our internal processes are primarily direct labor intensive and can be more easily adapted to meet fluctuations in customer demand; however, our material purchases, subcontracted operations and manufacturing support costs are extremely sensitive to changes in volume. As our volume increases, our support labor, material and scrap costs decline as a percentage of revenue as we are able to obtain better material pricing, and scrap, start up and support labor (fixed) costs and they are spread across a higher volume base. On the contrary, as production volumes decline, our labor and material costs per unit of production generally increase. Additional factors that contribute to economies of scale relate to the longevity of the program. Long running, less complex programs (e.g., periscopes) do not experience as significant of an impact on labor costs as production volumes change, as the associated workforce is generally less skilled and can be ramped quickly as headcounts shift. Our more complex thin laser filter coatings, Howitzer and thermal day/night programs are more significantly impacted by volume changes as they require a more highly-skilled workforce and ramp time is longer as the training is more complex. We continually monitor customer demand over a rolling twelve-month window and in order to anticipate any changes in necessary manpower and material which allows us to capitalize on any benefits associated with increased volume and minimize any negative impact associated with potential declines in product quantities. 
Intellectual Property
 
We utilize several highly specialized and unique processes in the manufacture of our products. While we believe that these trade secrets have value, it is probable that our future success will depend primarily on the innovation, technical expertise, manufacturing and marketing abilities of our personnel. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or that our non-disclosure agreements will provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use, misappropriation or other disclosure. The confidentiality agreements that are designed to protect our trade secrets could be breached, and we might not have adequate remedies for the breach. Additionally, our trade secrets and proprietary know-how might otherwise become known or be independently discovered by others. We possess two utility patents.
 
Our competitors, many of which have substantially greater resources, may have applied for or obtained, or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make and sell some of our products. Although we believe that our products do not infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties, we cannot assure you that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us or that such claims will not be successful.
 
On July 11, 2017, we were issued U.S. Patent No. D791,852 S, for our Red Tail Digital Spotting Scope. We have a retail sales relationship with Cabela’s Inc., to distribute these scopes. They are currently the only digital spotting scope offered by Cabela’s. Our Red Tail Digital Spotting Scopes also received a favorable review from Trigger Magazine in 2017.

In May 2015, we announced the issuance to us of U.S. Patent No. 13,792,297 titled “ICWS Periscope”. This invention improves previously accepted levels of periscope performance that, in turn, improve soldier’s safety.
 
In December 2013, Optex Systems, Inc. was issued U.S. Patent No. 23,357,802 titled “Multiple Spectral Single Image Sighting System Using Single Objective Lens Set.” The technology platform, designed for our DDAN program, is applicable to all ground combat vehicles used by the US and foreign militaries. This invention presents a single image to both day and night sensors using precision optics, which in turn allows the user to individually observe day, night, or day and night simultaneously. In addition, it has proven to be especially useful in light transition points experienced at dusk and dawn. We are in production and currently delivering sighting systems with this advanced technology, a significant upgrade in the goal of supporting our customers as they modernize the worldwide inventory of aging armored vehicles. This technology is applicable to many sighting systems, and it has already been designed for implementation on the Light Armored Vehicles, the Armored Security Vehicle, the Amphibious Assault Vehicle, and the M60 Main Battle Tank. Digital Day and Night technology has advanced the capabilities of these installed weapon systems and is the first in a series of patents we have applied for to protect our Intellectual Property portfolio in support of the warfighters who use these systems.
 
In May 2012, we purchased a perpetual, non-exclusive license, with a single up front license fee of $200,000 to use Patent 7,880,792 “Optical and Infrared Periscope with Display Monitor” owned by Synergy International Optronics, LLC. We believe the purchase of the license agreement may allow us to extend and expand our market potential for the M113APC vehicle type which has the highest number of commonly used armored vehicles in the world. The current estimated active M113 APC worldwide inventory is over 80,000 units. This licensing of this patent allows us to develop additional products for this vehicle type, including the M17 Day/Thermal and M17 Day/Night periscopes. We are actively marketing the new periscopes internationally and completed our first international shipment utilizing this technology in March 2014. We continue to prototype these products and demonstrate them to potential customers.

Competition
 
The markets for our products are competitive. We compete primarily on the basis of our ability to design and engineer products to meet performance specifications set by our customers. Our customers include military and government end users as well as prime contractors that purchase component parts or subassemblies, which they incorporate into their end products. Product pricing, quality, customer support, experience, reputation and financial stability are also important competitive factors.
 
There are a limited number of competitors in each of the markets for the various types of products that we design, manufacture and sell. At this time, we consider our primary competitors for the Optex, Richardson site to be Kent Periscopes and Synergy International Optronics, LLC. The Applied Optics Center thin film and laser coatings products compete primarily with Materion-Barr, Artemis and Alluxa.
 
Our competitors are often well entrenched, particularly in the defense markets. Some of these competitors have substantially greater resources than we do. While we believe that the quality of our technologies and product offerings provides us with a competitive advantage over certain manufacturers, some of our competitors have significantly more financial and other resources than we do to spend on the research and development of their technologies and for funding the construction and operation of commercial scale plants. 
 
We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products. We cannot assure investors that our competitors will not develop enhancements to, or future generations of, competitive products that will offer superior price or performance features, or that new technology or processes will not emerge that render our products less competitive or obsolete. Increased competitive pressure could lead to lower prices for our products, thereby adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost, and we may not be able to successfully develop or expend the financial resources necessary to acquire new technology. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future.
