ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The Company
CoreSite delivers secure, reliable, high-performance data center, cloud access and interconnection solutions to a growing customer ecosystem across eight key North American communication markets. More than 1,375 of the world’s leading enterprises, network operators, cloud providers, and supporting service providers choose CoreSite’s network dense, cloud-enabled data center campuses to connect, protect and optimize their performance-sensitive data, applications and computing workloads. 
Our Business
We are a fully integrated, self-administered, and self-managed REIT for federal income tax purposes and we conduct certain activities through our taxable REIT subsidiaries. Through our controlling interest in CoreSite, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, our “Operating Partnership,” we are engaged in the business of ownership, acquisition, construction and operation of strategically located data centers in some of the largest and fastest growing data center markets in the United States, including the San Francisco Bay area, Los Angeles, the Northern Virginia area (including Washington D.C.), the New York area, Boston, Chicago, Denver and Miami. We are a Maryland corporation organized in 2010.
Our data centers are highly specialized and secure buildings that house networking, storage and communications technology infrastructure, including servers, storage devices, switches, routers and fiber optic transmission equipment. These buildings are designed to provide the power, cooling and network connectivity necessary to efficiently operate this mission-critical equipment. Data centers located at points where many communications networks converge can also function as interconnection hubs where customers are able to connect to multiple networks, cloud companies and other service providers to exchange traffic and interoperate with each other. Our data centers feature advanced reliable and efficient power, cooling and security systems, and many are points of network interconnection that provide the evolved ecosystems our customers need to meet their own competitive challenges, digital transformations, and other business goals. CoreSite has the flexibility and scalability to satisfy the full spectrum of our customers’ growth requirements and corresponding data center needs by providing data center space ranging in size from an entire building or large dedicated suite to a cage or half cabinet. Our interconnected data center campuses are particularly suitable for customers serving consumers and businesses with low-latency digital products in our major metro markets as well as customers deploying hybrid-cloud / multi-cloud information technology architectures. 





The first data center in our portfolio was purchased in 2000 by certain real estate funds (the “Funds”) affiliated with The Carlyle Group, our predecessor, and since then we have continued to acquire, develop and operate these types of data center facilities. Our properties are self-managed, including construction project management in connection with our development initiatives. As of December 31, 2020, our property portfolio included 25 operating data center facilities, office and light-industrial space and multiple development projects and space, which collectively comprise, when fully built-out, over 4.6 million net rentable square feet (“NRSF”), of which over 2.7 million NRSF is existing operating data center space.

Recent Developments
During the first quarter of 2020, we placed into service the third phase of our second data center in the New York market, referred to as NY2 in Secaucus, New Jersey, comprised of 35,000 NRSF and 4.0 megawatts (“MWs”) of power. During the second quarter of 2020, we completed and placed into service Phase 1 of our new Chicago data center, referred to as CH2, comprised of 55,000 NRSF and 6.0 MWs of power. CH2 is one of the first purpose-built, ground-up developments in downtown Chicago. We also completed the third and final phase of SV8, comprised of 52,000 NRSF and 6.0 MWs of power, during the second quarter. SV8 is the newest ground-up data center development on our Santa Clara campus. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we completed and placed into service Phase 1 of our new Los Angeles data center, referred to as LA3, comprised of 51,000 NRSF and 6.0 MWs of power. 
Our Competitive Strengths
CoreSite’s key differentiators position us to compete, efficiently scale our business, capitalize on the demand for data center space and interconnection services, and thereby grow our cash flow.
Secure, Reliable, and Compliant. We help businesses protect mission-critical data, performance sensitive applications and information technology (“IT”) infrastructure by delivering secure, reliable, and compliant data center solutions. Our data centers feature advanced efficient power and cooling infrastructure to support our customers’ IT infrastructures with additional power capacity to support continued growth. CoreSite provides 24/7 in-house data center operations with customizable security features. We also provide the infrastructure and physical security required to support many of our customers’ information, data, and security compliance needs across all of our properties.
High Performance Interconnection. CoreSite offers cloud-enabled, network rich data center campuses with over 30,000 interconnections across our portfolio. Our customers have direct access to over 445 carriers and Internet Service Providers (“ISPs”) and over 325 leading cloud and IT service providers, including 20 cloud on-ramps deployed on-site in our campuses currently, which we expect to increase in 2021. In addition to standard interconnection offerings, we also operate the CoreSite Open Cloud Exchange™, and the Any2 Exchange for Internet Peering, the second largest peering exchange in the U.S. The diverse network and cloud connectivity options at many of our data centers provide us with a competitive advantage by creating an ideal environment for enterprises to build holistic, streamlined hybrid and multi-cloud architectures. Many providers in our data center facilities can leverage our sites as revenue opportunities by offering their services directly to other customers within our data centers. Additionally, enterprises can reduce their total cost of operations, while increasing their performance, by directly connecting to service providers in the same data center in a cost effective manner.
Scalable. Across 25 operating data centers in eight key North American markets, CoreSite leases space to enterprises, cloud and IT service providers, and network and mobility providers. We believe our ability to be both flexible and scalable is a key differentiator. By offering many space, power, and interconnection options, we allow customers to select products and services that meet their exact business needs. Our offering is available in most of the top data center markets in the U.S. with the ability to meet customers’ growing capacity requirements within those markets.
We have the ability to increase our occupied data center square footage by approximately 1,992,000 NRSF, or 87%, through leasing our 505,000 NRSF of unoccupied space and the development of 54,000 NRSF of space under construction and approximately 1,433,000 NRSF at multiple facilities that are held for future development based on market supply and demand, in each case, as of December 31, 2020. 
High-Quality Customer Experience. Our approximately 480 dedicated professionals execute a client-first model to support the planning, implementation and operating requirements of customers. We provide dedicated implementation resources for a customer-friendly onboarding process. Our leasing and sales professionals can develop complex data center solutions for the most demanding customer requirements. Our experienced and committed operations and facilities personnel are available for extensive management support. We believe one of the data points validating our customer satisfaction is indicated by the 89% of annualized rent signed during the year ended December 31, 2020, which came from existing customers who chose us to support their growth.
Facilities in Key Markets. Our portfolio is concentrated in some of the largest and most important U.S. metropolitan markets, and we expect to continue benefitting from this concentration as customers seek new, high-quality

data center space and interconnections within many of the key North American network, financial, cloud and commercial hubs. Our data centers are located in the San Francisco Bay area, Los Angeles, the Northern Virginia area (including Washington D.C.), the New York area, Boston, Chicago, Denver and Miami. Many of our facilities are also situated in close proximity to a concentration of key businesses and corporations, driving demand for our data center space and interconnection services.
Diversified Customer Base. CoreSite has a diverse, global customer base, which we believe is a reflection of our strong reputation and proven track record, as well as our customers’ trust for us to effectively house their mission-critical applications and vital communications technology. Our diverse customer base spans many industries across eight key North America markets. In addition to geographic markets, we group our customers into the following industry verticals:

● | Enterprises: digital content and multimedia, systems integrators and managed service providers (“SI & MSP”), financial, healthcare, education, government, manufacturing and professional services;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cloud Providers;
--+-----------------


● | Networks and Mobility: domestic and international telecommunications carriers, subsea cables, ISPs and Content Delivery Networks (“CDNs”).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business and Growth Strategies
Our business objective is to continue growing our position as a provider of strategically located data center space in North America. Key components of our strategy include the following:
Increase Cash Flow from In-Place Data Center Space. We actively manage and lease our properties to increase cash flow by:

● | Leasing Available Space. CoreSite has the ability to increase both our revenue and our revenue per square foot by leasing additional space and power services to new and existing data center customers. As of December 31, 2020, our existing data center facilities had approximately 450,000 NRSF of data center space available to lease, or 16.2% of our current operating data center portfolio. We believe our available space, together with available power, enables us to generate incremental revenue within our existing data center footprint. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increasing Interconnection in our Facilities. As more customers deploy in our data center facilities, it benefits their business partners and customers to deploy with CoreSite in order to gain the full economic and performance benefits of our interconnection services. We believe this ecosystem of customers continues to drive new and existing customer growth, and in turn, increases the volume of interconnection services and the amount of value-add power services such as breakered AC and DC primary and redundant power. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Capitalize on Embedded Expansion Opportunities. We plan to grow by developing new secure, reliable and high-performance data center space. Our development opportunities include leveraging existing in-place infrastructure and entitlements in currently operating properties or campuses. In many cases, we are able to strategically deploy capital by developing space in incremental phases to meet customer demand. Including the space currently under construction, pre-construction projects, and space and land targeted for future development at December 31, 2020, we own land and buildings sufficient to develop approximately 1,487,000 NRSF of data center space. The following table summarizes the NRSF under construction and NRSF held for development throughout our portfolio, each as of December 31, 2020:

----+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Selectively Pursue Acquisition and Development Opportunities in New and Existing Markets. We evaluate opportunities to acquire or develop data center space with abundant power and/or dense points of interconnection in key markets that will expand our customer base and broaden our geographic footprint. Such acquisitions may entail subsequent development, which requires significant capital expenditures. We also intend to continue to implement the “hub-and-spoke strategy” that we have deployed in our largest markets, namely Los Angeles, New York, the San Francisco Bay, Northern Virginia, and Chicago areas. In these markets, we have extended our data center footprint by connecting via fiber our newer facilities, the spokes, to our established data centers, our hubs, which allows our customers leasing space at the spokes to leverage the significant interconnection capabilities of our hubs. In order to deploy our “hub-and-spoke strategy,” we typically rely on third-party providers of network connectivity to establish highly reliable network connectivity within and between facilities. Our SV9 held-for-development project, when constructed, will be connected via dark fiber to its campus hub.
Leverage Existing Customer Relationships and Reach New Customers. Our strong customer and industry relationships, combined with our national footprint and sales force, afford us insight into the size, timing and location of customers’ planned growth. Historically, we have been successful in leveraging this market visibility to expand our footprint and customer base in our markets. We intend to continue to strengthen and expand our relationships with existing customers and to further grow and diversify our customer base by targeting growing customers and segments.

(1) | This table presents NRSF at each market that is currently occupied or readily available for lease as data center space and pre-stabilized data center space. Both occupied and available data center NRSF includes a factor based on management’s estimate to account for a customer’s proportionate share of the required data center support space (such as the mechanical, telecommunications and utility rooms) and building common areas, which may be updated on a periodic basis to reflect the most current build-out of our properties. Operating data center NRSF may require investment of Deferred Expansion Capital (see definition on page 10).
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | Pre-stabilized NRSF represents projects or facilities that recently have been developed and are in the initial lease-up phase. Pre-stabilized projects or facilities become stabilized operating properties at the earlier of achievement of 85% occupancy or 24 months after development completion.
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | “Annualized Rent” represents the monthly contractual rent under existing commenced customer leases as of December 31, 2020, multiplied by 12. This amount reflects total annualized base rent before any one-time or non-recurring rent abatements and excludes power revenue, interconnection revenue and operating expense reimbursement. Our management uses annualized rent as a supplemental performance measure because, when compared quarter over quarter or year over year, it captures profitability of our assets. We offer this measure because we recognize that annualized base rent will be used by investors to compare our profitability with that of other REITs. On a gross basis, our total portfolio annualized rent was approximately $327.8 million as of December 31, 2020, which includes $5.7 million in operating expense reimbursements under modified gross and triple-net leases.

(4) | “Percent Occupied” represents customer leases that have commenced and are occupied as of December 31, 2020. The percent occupied is determined based on occupied square feet as a proportion of total operating NRSF as of December 31, 2020. Our management uses percent occupied as a supplemental performance measure because, when compared year-over-year, it captures trends in market demand for our assets. We offer this measure because we recognize that percent occupied will be used by investors as a basis to compare our operating performance with that of other REITs. The percent occupied for stabilized data center space would have been 88.6%, rather than 86.9%, if all leases signed in the current and prior periods had commenced. The percent occupied for our total portfolio, including stabilized data center space, pre-stabilized space and office and light-industrial space, would have been 83.8%, rather than 81.6%, if all leases signed in current and prior periods had commenced.

(6) | In the fourth quarter of 2020, CoreSite made the decision to exit and vacate our leased data center space at LA4 and two computer rooms at LA1 by the end of 2021. These spaces, which represent 21,850 NRSF for LA4 and 6,723 NRSF at LA1, were previously acquired in 2018 through the acquisition of U.S. Colo. Due to this business decision, we have excluded these leased spaces from the reported Los Angeles market operating property portfolio.

The decrease of $2.6 million is primarily due to the move-out of a customer at our SV7 data center during the year ended December 31, 2020, partially offset by the commencement of new and expansion leases.

Capital Expenditures
The following table sets forth information regarding capital expenditures during the year ended December 31, 2020 (in thousands):















​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
-------------------------------+---+-------------------+---------+--
​ | ​ | Year Ended | ​ 
​ | | December 31, 2020 | 
Data center expansion | ​ | $ | 202,992 | ​
Non-recurring investments | ​ | ​ | 3,963 | ​
Tenant improvements | ​ | ​ | 5,919 | ​
Recurring capital expenditures | ​ | ​ | 8,336 | ​
Total capital expenditures | ​ | $ | 221,210 | ​

​
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred approximately $221.2 million of capital expenditures, of which approximately $203.0 million related to data center expansion activities, including new data center construction, the development of capacity within existing data centers and other revenue generating investments. As we construct data center capacity, we work to optimize both the amount of capital we deploy on power and cooling infrastructure and the timing of that capital deployment. As such, we generally construct our power and cooling infrastructure supporting our data center NRSF based on our estimate of customer utilization. This practice can result in our investment at a later time in “Deferred Expansion Capital”. We define Deferred Expansion Capital as our estimate of the incremental capital we may invest in the future to add power or cooling infrastructure to support existing or anticipated future customer utilization of NRSF within our operating data centers.





During the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed (i) one computer room at SV8, which was the final phase of that data center; (ii) a data center core and shell building, and therein one computer room, at CH2, which was the first phase of the project placed into service; (iii) a data center core and shell building, and therein one computer room, at LA3, which was the first phase of the project placed into service; and (iv) one computer room and a power infrastructure project at NY2, which added incremental power capacity to the new computer room and other existing computer rooms. As of December 31, 2020, we had an ongoing construction project at LA3 scheduled to complete development during the year ending December 31, 2021. The following table sets forth capital expenditures spent on data center expansion NRSF placed into service during the year ended December 31, 2020, and under construction as of December 31, 2020:

Lease Distribution
Within our operating portfolio, we manage three primary types of customer deployments, including (i) Data center deployments, which represent customers who lease a defined amount of space and power within our data centers, (ii) Powered shell deployments, which are typically larger deployments of raw physical space with available power connectivity, and (iii) Office and light-industrial deployments, which represent customers utilizing space within our properties for office or light-industrial purposes. The following table sets forth information relating to the NRSF distribution of leases in the properties in our portfolio, based on type of deployment (excluding space held for development, under construction, or in pre-construction) under lease as of December 31, 2020:

Competition
We compete with numerous developers, public and private owners and operators of technology-related real estate and data center. Many of these companies own properties similar to ours in the same markets in which our properties are located, including CyrusOne, Inc., Cyxtera Technologies, Inc., Digital Realty Trust, Inc., Equinix, Inc., Evoque (formerly AT&T, Inc. Data Centers), Flexential, Internap Network Services Corporation, Quality Technology Services, RagingWire Data Centers, a NTT Communications company, SABEY Corporation, Stack Infrastructure, Switch, Inc., and zColo. In addition, we may face competition from new entrants into the data center market. Some of our current and potential competitors may have significant advantages over us, including greater name recognition, longer operating histories, pre-existing relationships with current or potential customers, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources, ownership of more data centers more broadly distributed geographically, access to less expensive power, and more robust interconnected hubs in certain geographic markets. All of these potential advantages could allow competitors to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities. If our competitors offer space, power and/or interconnection services at rates below current market rates, or below the rates we currently charge our customers, we may lose potential customers or be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge in order to retain customers when our customers’ leases expire.
As a developer of data center space and provider of interconnection services, we also compete for the services of key third-party service providers, including engineers and contractors with expertise in the development of data centers. The competition for the services of specialized contractors and other third-party providers required for the development of data centers is intense, increasing the cost of engaging such providers and the risk of delays in completing our development projects.

13




Finally, we face competition from real estate developers in our sector and in other industries for the acquisition of additional properties suitable for data center development. Such competition may reduce the number of properties available for acquisition or development, increase the price of these properties and reduce the demand for data center space in the markets we seek to serve.
Regulation
General
Data centers in our markets are subject to various laws, ordinances and regulations, including regulations relating to common areas. We believe that each of our properties has the necessary permits and approvals to operate our business.
Americans with Disabilities Act
Our properties must comply with Title III of the American with Disabilities Act, or the ADA, to the extent that such properties are places of “public accommodation” or “commercial facilities” as defined by the ADA. The ADA requires properties that are places of “public accommodation” to, among other things, remove existing barriers to access by persons with disabilities where such removal is readily achievable. The ADA also requires places of “public accommodation” as well as “commercial facilities” undergoing new construction or alterations to conform to the ADA Accessibility Guidelines, which provide design standards that permit accessibility by individuals with disabilities. Further, if entities on our properties offer certain examinations or courses (i.e., those related to applications, licensing, certification, or credentialing for secondary or postsecondary education, professional, or trade purposes), they must be offered in an accessible place and manner or with alternative accessible arrangements. We believe that our properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to those properties to address the requirements of the ADA. However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of monetary damages and civil penalties in lawsuits brought by the Attorney General or an award of attorneys’ fees to private litigants. The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations as required by the ADA is an ongoing one, and we will continue to assess our properties and make alterations as appropriate.
Environmental Matters
Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for contamination resulting from the presence or discharge of hazardous or toxic substances at that property, and may be required to investigate and clean up such contamination at that property or emanating from that property. Such laws and regulations often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of, or was responsible for, the presence of the contaminants, and a party may be liable for all of the cleanup costs, even when more than one person was responsible for the contamination. Previous owners used some of our properties for industrial and retail purposes, so those properties may contain some level of environmental contamination. The presence of contamination or the failure to remediate contamination at our properties may expose us to third-party liability or materially adversely affect our ability to sell, lease or develop the real estate or to borrow using the real estate as collateral. In addition, we could incur costs to comply with such laws and regulations, the violation of which could lead to substantial fines and penalties.
Environmental laws and regulations also require that asbestos-containing building materials be properly managed and maintained and may impose fines and penalties on building owners or operators for failure to comply with these requirements. Further, third parties could potentially seek recovery from owners or operators for personal injury associated with exposure to asbestos-containing building materials.
In addition, certain of our customers, particularly those that lease light-industrial space from us, routinely handle hazardous substances and wastes as part of their operations at our properties. Environmental laws and regulations subject our customers, and potentially us, to liability resulting from these activities or from previous industrial or other uses of those properties. Environmental liabilities could also affect a customer’s ability to make rental payments to us. We require our customers to comply with these environmental laws and regulations and to indemnify us for any related liabilities.

14




Independent environmental consultants have conducted Phase I or similar environmental site assessments on all owned properties in our portfolio. Each of the site assessments has been either completed or updated since 2005. Site assessments are intended to collect and evaluate information regarding the environmental condition of the surveyed property and surrounding properties. These assessments do not generally include soil sampling, subsurface investigations or asbestos sampling. Although prior commercial or industrial operations at some of our properties may have released hazardous materials and some of our properties contain or may contain asbestos-containing building materials, none of the recent site assessments revealed any past or present environmental liability that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets or results of operations. However, the assessments may have failed to reveal all environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns. Material environmental conditions, liabilities or compliance concerns may have arisen after the reviews were completed or may arise in the future; and future laws, ordinances or regulations may impose material additional environmental liability. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—Environmental problems are possible and can be costly.”
Insurance
We carry comprehensive liability, fire, extended coverage, earthquake, business interruption, rental loss, and umbrella liability insurance covering all of the properties in our portfolio augmented by excess liability coverage in an amount that we believe to be appropriate. We select policy specifications and insured limits which we believe to be appropriate given the relative risk of loss, the cost of the coverage and industry practice and, in the opinion of our management, the properties in our portfolio are currently adequately insured. We do not carry insurance for generally uninsured losses such as loss from riots, war or acts of God. In addition, we carry earthquake insurance on our properties in an amount and with deductibles which we believe are commercially reasonable. Certain of the properties in our portfolio are located in areas believed to be seismically active. Potential losses to our properties may not be covered by insurance or may exceed our policy coverage limits. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business and Operations—Potential losses to our properties may not be covered by insurance or may exceed our policy coverage limits” in Item 1A. of this Annual Report.
Human Capital Resource Management
​
As of December 31, 2020, our workforce is comprised of 481 full-time employees, including approximately 257 in data center operations, 71 in sales and marketing, 23 in construction, engineering and product and 130 in corporate operations. All employees are located in the United States. 
​
The success of our employees drives the success of the business, and supports our goal of long-term value creation for our shareholders. We offer competitive benefits and training programs to develop employees’ expertise and skillsets, use training, communication, appropriate investments and clear corporate policies to strive to provide a safe, harassment-free work environment guided by principles of fair and equal treatment, and prioritize employee engagement. As a result, we believe our employees are committed to building strong, innovative and long-term relationships with each other and with our customers.
​
We track key human capital metrics including demographics, talent pipeline, diversity, and employee engagement. We have a stable workforce with an average tenure of 4.8 years and voluntary employee turnover of approximately 9% during the year ended December 31, 2020. To attract diversity in our applicant pools, we post our openings to a wide variety of job boards and deploy appropriate language in our postings. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our applicant pool was 50% minority and our hiring trend of minorities was 51%. Overall, as of December 31, 2020, our workforce is approximately 54% non-minority and 46% minority. During the year ended December 31, 2020, our applicant pool was 26% identifying as female with our hiring trend of self-identified females at 28%. As of December 31, 2020, our employee base self-identified as 78% male and 22% female, and our senior leadership team, which has an average tenure with the Company of 8.3 years, consists of 30% executives identifying as female and 10% minority executives. As of February 4, 2021, our board of directors consists of 30% directors identifying as female and 10% as minority.
​
We invest in employee development by offering a number of training opportunities, including a data center technician training course and career path to enable non-technicians (such as security personnel) to develop technical skills and create a path for upward mobility. This is a six-tiered program that educates employees on the basics of data center operations and guides employees through the specifics of operating a data center. During the year ended December 31, 2020, 40 employees were promoted through this program.

​
COVID-19 Health and Safety
​
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have put into place a number of health and safety measures to enable our operations team to continue to work from our data centers. We implemented an Information Technology application to enable and track daily employee health screening and a daily compliance process for all vendors. We also required social distancing in accordance with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) and local health agency guidelines, made modifications to our facilities (including upgrades to air ventilation and filtration), engaged in regular sanitation, posted signage, required all visitors and employees to wear facial coverings and provided N-95 masks to our essential data center employees to reduce the potential for disease transmission. We worked with our operations teams to implement innovative approaches to maintain our high standards of customer service, including virtual data center tours to ensure activities typically accomplished on-site or in-person continued throughout periods of reduced travel. Our non-essential and corporate personnel adopted a work-from-home approach beginning in March 2020 which has continued past the end of the year, without significant impacts to productivity. Refer to the discussion in Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis for further information related to the impact of the pandemic on our business.
