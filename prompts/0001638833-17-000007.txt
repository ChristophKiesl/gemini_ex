Item 1. Business
Overview
We are a leading healthcare services company with a differentiated outpatient delivery model focused on providing high quality, cost effective solutions for surgical and related ancillary care in support of our patients and physicians. Founded in 2004 as a limited liability company, to own and operate ambulatory surgery centers (“ASCs”), provide anesthesia services, and operate physician practices, we expanded our business in 2011 by acquiring NovaMed, Inc. and in 2014, we acquired Symbion Holdings Corporation (“Symbion”). Further, we completed an initial public offering ("IPO") in October 2015. We are now one of the largest and fastest growing surgical services businesses in the country.
As of December 31, 2016, we owned or operated primarily in partnership with physicians, a portfolio of 104 surgical facilities comprised of 99 ASCs and five surgical hospitals (“surgical hospitals,” and together with ASCs referred to as “surgical facilities” or “facilities”) across 29 states and we owned a majority interest in 74 of these facilities. Additionally, approximately 73% of these facilities were multi-specialty focused. During 2016, over 4,000 physicians provided services to over 600,000 patients in our surgical facilities generating $1.0 billion in revenue. 
Our innovative strategy provides a suite of targeted and complementary ancillary services in support of our patients and physicians. This suite of ancillary services is comprised of a diagnostic laboratory, multi-specialty physician practices, urgent care facilities, anesthesia services, optical services and specialty pharmacy services (our “ancillary services”). We believe this approach improves the quality of care provided to our patients, results in superior clinical outcomes and allows us to realize the revenue associated with these ancillary services that are otherwise outsourced to unrelated third-party providers.
Our patient- and physician-centric culture, our commitment to high quality care, our differentiated approach to physician engagement and our suite of complementary ancillary services have been instrumental to our growth. These areas of focus, along with investments in systems and processes, strategic acquisitions and favorable industry trends, have all contributed to our industry leading track record of growth.
Our Growth Strategies
Our differentiated operating model employs a multifaceted strategy to grow revenue, earnings and cash flow. We believe the following are key components to this strategy:

• | Deliver outstanding patient care and clinical outcomes;


• | Expand ancillary services across our national platform;


• | Continue to execute and expand upon our physician engagement strategy in attractive markets;


• | Drive organic growth at existing facilities through targeted physician recruitment, service line expansion and implementing our efficient operating model;


• | Continue our disciplined acquisition strategy; and


• | Introduce new service offerings to provide a more comprehensive continuum of care.

Industry Overview
Surgical Facilities
For many years, government programs, private insurance companies, managed care organizations and self-insured employers have implemented cost containment measures intended to limit the growth of healthcare expenditures. These cost-containment measures, together with technological advances, have contributed to the significant shift in the delivery of healthcare services away from traditional inpatient hospital settings to more cost effective surgical facilities, including ASCs and surgical hospitals. ASCs have been viewed as a successful way to increase efficiency by improving the quality of, and access to, healthcare and increasing patient satisfaction, while simultaneously reducing costs. Surgical hospitals are larger than a typical ASC and include inpatient hospital rooms and, in some cases, a limited scope emergency department. The offerings in a surgical hospital also include acute care services, such as diagnostic imaging, pharmacy, laboratory, obstetrics, physical therapy, oncology and wound care. As the focus on containing healthcare expenditures grows in response to the Affordable Care Act, surgical procedures are expected to continue to shift dramatically from inpatient to outpatient settings. 
Increasing Demand for Surgical Procedures in Outpatient Settings
According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services ("CMS"), the percentage share of outpatient surgery has increased from 15% in 1985 to 77% in 2012. This shift has occurred for a variety of reasons, including an increase in the number of procedures that can be performed safely in an outpatient environment, the high quality outcomes at lower cost of the outpatient setting relative to the inpatient setting, patient preference due to increased convenience, physician preference due to increased efficiency, patient and payor preference due to the lower cost setting.
Advancements in Medical Technology
New technologies, faster acting and more effective anesthesia and less invasive surgical techniques have increased the number of procedures that can be performed in an ASC. Lasers, arthroscopy, enhanced endoscopic techniques and fiber optics have reduced the trauma and recovery time for patients. Advances in the use of anesthesia have shortened recovery time by minimizing postoperative side effects such as nausea and drowsiness. Procedures that only a few years ago required major incisions, long-acting anesthetics and extended convalescence can now be performed through closed techniques utilizing short-acting anesthetics and with minimal recovery time. Of these 
 1

new techniques and technologies, more complex surgical procedures that previously were performed only on an inpatient basis can now be performed in an ASC. Medicare, often the benchmark for other insurance plans, has approved approximately 3,400 procedures to be performed in a surgery center. We believe that ASCs are likely to receive continued regulatory support as more cost effective alternative surgical procedures can be performed in the ASC setting compared to the traditional, inpatient hospital setting.
Improved Outcomes and Convenience for Patients at Lower Costs
ASCs provide outstanding patient safety and superior clinical outcomes due to the focus and specialization of a center’s professional staff. ASCs have lower rates of inpatient hospital admission, hospital-acquired infections and mortality than hospital-based outpatient surgery departments. Finally, ASCs often offer patients greater convenience than hospital outpatient departments with more convenient locations and ability to schedule surgery.
Compelling Value Proposition for Physicians
Many physicians prefer surgical facilities over general acute care hospitals because of greater scheduling flexibility, more consistent nurse staffing and faster turnaround times between cases, which allows physicians to increase the number of surgical procedures they can perform in a given period of time. Due to the non-emergency, elective nature of most ASC procedures, physicians’ schedules are rarely interrupted, enabling physicians to more efficiently secure preferred blocks of time in the operating room. This is in contrast to acute care hospitals, where medical emergencies often demand the unplanned use of operating rooms and result in the postponement or delay of scheduled surgical procedures, disrupting physicians’ practices and inconveniencing patients. Physicians are also increasingly interested in pursuing partnerships with other physicians in order to gain greater stability, access to scaled clinical and operating systems and a pathway to participating in new payment models. These partnerships help relieve physicians of the financial and administrative burdens resulting from uncertainty regarding reimbursement and healthcare legislation. In addition, our ancillary services provide support for our surgical specialists who are then relieved from the additional burden of coordinating third-party support services.
Reduced Costs for Payors
There has been an increased focus on controlling the growth of healthcare expenditures and as a result, cost containment measures have contributed to the significant shift in the delivery of healthcare services away from traditional inpatient hospitals to more cost effective alternate sites, including ASCs. Government programs, private insurance companies, managed care organizations and self-insured employers have implemented these cost containment measures to limit increases in healthcare expenditures, including procedure reimbursement. In addition, as patients are facing increased financial responsibility through higher co-pays and deductibles, there is increased consumerism as patients are encouraged to find more cost effective options for their healthcare. Surgery performed at an ASC is generally less expensive than hospital-based outpatient surgery because of lower facility development costs, more efficient staffing and space utilization, a specialized operating environment focused on quality of care and aligned incentives for physicians and ASCs to control costs and improve efficiency. A procedure in an ASC costs, on average, approximately 73% of what the same procedure costs when performed in a hospital surgery department, according to an Ambulatory Surgery Center Association analysis of 2014 Medicare fee schedules. These cost savings will continue to incentivize constituents across the healthcare continuum to shift the delivery of surgical procedures to ASCs.
Ancillary Services 
A broad market of ancillary and related services facilitates operational efficiencies for physicians. In the areas of specialty where our physicians are focused, the associated ancillary services include a diagnostic laboratory, multi-specialty physician practices, urgent care facilities, anesthesia services, optical services and specialty pharmacy services. These industries represent approximately $127 billion of annual healthcare expenditures and provide a broad opportunity for us to expand our Ancillary Services outreach to support patients and physicians.

Surgical Facility Services Segment
Surgical Facility Operations
As of December 31, 2016, we owned (primarily with physician investors or healthcare systems) or operated 104 surgical facilities including five that are licensed as hospitals.  
Our typical ASC is a free-standing facility for planned, surgical procedures performed on an outpatient basis on patients not requiring hospitalization and for whom an overnight stay is not expected after surgery. Each center typically has one to four operating or procedure rooms with areas for reception, pre-operative care, recovery and administration. The average facility size is 8,000 to 12,000 square feet. Centers are specifically tailored to meet the needs of physician-partners and their specialties. Of our 99 ASCs, 97 utilize leased real property. We expect to be able to renew or replace a substantial majority of these leases on substantially similar terms. The staff of our ASCs generally includes a center administrator, registered nurses, operating room technicians, as well as other administrative staff.
Our surgical hospitals are generally larger than our ASCs and include inpatient hospital rooms and, in two cases, a limited scope emergency department. Our surgical hospitals also provide ancillary services such as diagnostic imaging, pharmacy, laboratory, obstetrics, physical therapy, oncology and wound care.
As of December 31, 2016, we provided anesthesia in 38 of our 104 surgical facilities. These services are provided by our certified registered nurse anesthetists or physician anesthesiologists. These employment or contract relationships vary by state to comply with corporate practice of medicine laws. 
Each facility is licensed by the state and certified as a provider under federal programs. The facilities are available for use only by licensed physicians performing surgical procedures. We ensure consistent quality of care by assisting our partners with establishing and maintaining accreditation with the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care (“AAAHC”) or the Joint Commission, the accrediting bodies for the ASC and hospital industries. As of December 31, 2016, 80 of our 104 surgical facilities were accredited by either AAAHC or the Joint Commission, and the remainder were in the process of obtaining accreditation.
We operate both multi-specialty and single-specialty facilities. In multi-specialty facilities, a variety of surgical procedures are performed, including: GI, general surgery, ophthalmology, orthopedics and pain management. We have diversified our facility procedure mix by strategically introducing select specialties that will complement existing facilities. In many cases, we keep certain facilities as single-specialty where it suits an individual facility or market demand.
Our surgical facilities are generally located in close proximity to physicians’ offices. We provide each of our surgical facilities with a full range of financial, marketing and operating services. For example, our regional managed care directors assist the local management team at each of our surgical facilities in developing relationships with managed care providers and negotiating managed care contracts.
Surgical Facility Ownership Structure
We own and operate our surgical facilities through partnerships or limited liability companies with physicians, physician groups and healthcare systems. One of our wholly owned subsidiaries typically serves as the general partner or managing member of our surgical facilities.  We generally seek to own a majority interest in our surgical facilities, or otherwise have sufficient control over the facilities to be able to consolidate the financial results of operations of the facilities with ours.  In some instances, we will acquire ownership in a surgical facility with the prior owners retaining ownership, and, in some cases, we offer new ownership to other physicians or healthcare systems.  We hold majority ownership in 74 of the 104 surgical facilities in which we own an interest. We provide intercompany loans to our consolidated facilities which often are secured by a pledge of assets of the partnership or limited liability company.  We also have a management agreement with the majority of our surgical facilities, under which we provide day-to-day management services for a management fee, which is typically equal to a percentage of the revenues of the facility.
Each of the partnerships and limited liability companies through which we own and operate our surgical facilities is governed by a partnership or operating agreement.  These partnership and operating agreements typically provide, among other things, for voting rights and limited transfer of ownership.  The partnership and operating agreements also provide for the distribution of available cash to the owners.  In addition, the agreements typically restrict the physician owners from owning an interest in a competing surgical facility during the period in which the physician owns an interest in our surgical facility and for one year after that period.  The partnership and operating agreements for our surgical facilities may provide that the facilities will purchase all of the physicians’ ownership if certain adverse regulatory events occur, such as it becoming illegal for the physicians to own an interest in a surgical facility, refer patients to a surgical facility or receive cash distributions from a surgical facility.  The purchase price that we would be required to pay for the ownership is based on predetermined formulas, typically either a multiple of the surgical facility’s EBITDA, as defined in our partnership and operating agreements, or the fair market value of the ownership as determined by an independent third-party appraisal.  Some of these agreements require us to make a good faith effort to restructure our relationships with the physician investors in a manner that preserves the economic terms of the relationship prior to purchasing these interests.  In certain circumstances, we have the right to purchase a physician’s ownership, including upon a physician’s breach of the restriction on ownership provisions of a partnership or operating agreement.  In some cases, we have the right to require the physician owners to purchase our ownership in the event our management agreement with a surgical facility is terminated.

Strategic Relationships
When attractive opportunities arise, we may develop, acquire or operate surgical facilities through strategic relationships with healthcare systems, payors and other healthcare providers.  We believe that forming a relationship with a healthcare system can enhance our ability to attract physicians and access managed care contracts for our surgical facilities in that market.  
The strategic relationships through which we own and operate surgical facilities are governed by partnership and operating agreements that are generally comparable to the partnership and operating agreements of the other surgical facilities in which we own an interest.  The primary difference between the structure of these strategic relationships and the other surgical facilities in which we hold ownership is that, in these strategic relationships, a healthcare system holds ownership in the surgical facility, in addition to physician investors.  For a general description of the terms of our partnership and operating agreements, see “—Operations—Surgical Facility Services Segment—Surgical Facility Ownership Structure.” In each of these strategic relationships, we also have entered into a management agreement under which we provide day-to-day management services for a management fee equal to a percentage of the revenues of the surgical facility.  The terms of those management agreements are comparable to the terms of our management agreements with other surgical facilities in which we own an interest.
As of December 31, 2016, we have relationships with eight healthcare systems relating to 12 ASC's. These healthcare systems include:

▪ | Baptist Memorial Health Services, Inc. (“Baptist Memorial”), for which we manage five surgical facilities in Memphis, Tennessee and surrounding areas;


▪ | Crozer-Keystone Health Systems, for which we manage and operate a surgical facility in Havertown, Pennsylvania;


▪ | Lee Health Ventures, with which we own and operate a surgical facility in Ft. Myers, Florida;


▪ | Munroe Regional Health Systems, with which we own and operate a surgical facility in Ocala, Florida;


▪ | Trinity Health System, with which we own and operate a surgical facility in Steubenville, Ohio;


▪ | UCLA Health, with which we own and operate a surgical facility in Encino, California;


▪ | Vanderbilt Health Services, Inc., with which we own and operate a surgical facility in Franklin, Tennessee; and


▪ | Wellmont Health Systems, with which we own and operate a surgical facility in Bristol, Tennessee.

We manage five surgical facilities owned by Baptist Memorial under management agreements with Baptist Memorial in exchange for a management fee based on a percentage of the revenues of these surgical facilities.  The management agreements terminate in 2019 and may be terminated earlier by either party for material breach after notice and an opportunity to cure.
Ancillary Services Segment
Our portfolio of outpatient surgical facilities is complemented by our suite of ancillary services, which support our physicians in providing high quality and cost-efficient patient care. Rather than contracting with third-party providers, we own ancillary businesses including a diagnostic laboratory, multi-specialty physician practices, urgent care facilities, anesthesia services and specialty pharmacy services. Our Company, physicians and patients benefit from these services through improved clinical efficiency and scheduling, and from incremental revenue and profitability associated with retaining these fees.

• | Diagnostic Laboratory: We offer physicians toxicology testing services through our diagnostic laboratory, Logan Laboratories ("Logan Labs"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company based in Tampa, Florida. Advanced toxicology screening provides physicians with the ability to identify when a patient is taking too much of a prescribed substance, when a patient is non-compliant with a prescribed substance or when a patient is taking unprescribed or illicit substances. Logan Labs provides quantitative confirmation testing of all drugs requested within 24 hours of receipt of a specimen, and results are available the following business day. Certified clinical chemists provide detailed laboratory reports that summarize and identify inconsistencies relating to test results and a patient's prescribed medications. Testing also ensures that regular toxicology screenings are appropriately interpreted. We intend to broaden our diagnostic laboratory offerings in support of the needs of our physicians across our existing specialties and new service lines.


• | Multi-Specialty Physician Practices: We employ two models in connection with our network of physician practices. In the state of Florida, where the law does not preclude a business corporation from employing physicians, we own and operate Tampa Pain Relief Center, Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary with several locations throughout Florida. In states other than Florida, we operate physician practices pursuant to long-term management service agreements with separate professional corporations that are wholly-owned by physicians. We derive revenues from these practice operations through management fees and expense reimbursement as set forth in the management services agreements. As of December 31, 2016, we owned or operated 56 physician practices with facilities in nine states. In total, through our physician practices, we employed over 100 physicians who focus on a number of specialties. We also provide our physician practices with relief from scheduling, billing and collections, staffing, regulatory compliance and other administrative and operational activities to allow them to focus on patient care.


• | Urgent Care Facilities: Our urgent care facilities primarily treat injuries or illnesses requiring immediate care, but not serious enough to require an emergency room visit. Urgent care centers have become an increasingly viable alternative for patients as wait times for both primary care and emergency care providers continue to rise. Our urgent care facilities fill an access gap by providing walk-in care, especially during evening and weekend hours. In addition to the convenience they provide patients, our

 7

urgent care facilities also offer one of the lowest cost settings for both patients and payors. As the demands on primary care providers increase and insurance coverage expands, the urgent care industry is expected to continue growing. As of December 31, 2016, we owned and operated seven urgent care facilities in proximity to our surgical hospitals. Our urgent care facilities provide support and additional access points to our surgical hospitals. 

• | Specialty Pharmacy Services: Our specialty pharmacy service line supports our physicians and provides expansion opportunities across multiple specialties within our delivery system, including GI, general surgery, ophthalmology, orthopedic and pain management specialties. Our specialty pharmacy service line allows us to maintain control of quality and compliance with treatment programs. To ensure a high standard of care and appropriately expand these offerings, we have hired experienced pharmacists to supervise operations of our specialty pharmacy service offerings, which include compounding to meet the unique needs of our patients and distribution of these complex medications. Our specialty pharmacy service line affords us the ability to expand services across new specialties, such as infusion therapy and sterile products and support future growth into new service lines.

Optical Services Segment
We offer group discounts and pricing structures for optical and medical products to independent eye care professionals through our wholly-owned subsidiary, The Alliance Product Purchasing Organization ("The Alliance").
Our wholly-owned optometric practice, Family Vision Care, provides full spectrum vision care to patients, including eye exams and vision testing, and offers an extensive collection of prescription eye wear. We provide operations oversight through ongoing management, finance, product and marketing support. We share in the primary goal of ensuring the highest level of patient care while maintaining costs and growing practice revenue and income. 
Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Optical Synergies, was founded in 1995 as a buying group for independent optical laboratories whose common goal is to bring quality eye wear and related services to the ophthalmic industry. Member laboratories are provided with a forum for the exchange of information and ideas; this is accomplished through supplier sponsored sales promotions, networking opportunities within the group, and an annual educational conference. With the combined purchasing power of the group, members receive cost savings from Optical Synergies suppliers, thus increasing their competitiveness in the marketplace.
With locations in Indianola, IA and Chicago, IL, our wholly-owned, full-service wholesale optical laboratories, Midwest Labs, have served eye care professionals for over 35 years.

To ensure the highest quality of finished products, we continue to invest in the latest equipment and technology. 
Acquisitions and Developments
In the last five years we completed acquisitions of NovaMed, Inc. and Symbion, both of which materially expanded our network of existing facilities and ancillary services. 
We continuously evaluate opportunities to expand our presence in the surgical facility market by making strategic acquisitions of existing surgical facilities and by developing new surgical facilities in cooperation with local physician partners and, when appropriate, with healthcare systems and other strategic partners. We have the flexibility to structure our partnerships as two-way arrangements where either we are a majority owner partnered with physicians or we are a minority owner with buy-up rights. These buy-up rights give us the option to own a controlling interest at some point in the future. Alternatively, we may choose to pursue a three-way arrangement with physicians and a healthcare system.
Acquisition Program. We employ a dedicated acquisition team with experience in healthcare services. Our team seeks to acquire surgical facilities that meet our criteria, including prominence and quality of physician partners, specialty mix, opportunities for growth, level of competition in the local market, level of managed care penetration and our ability to access managed care organization contracts. Our team utilizes its extensive industry contacts, as well as referrals from current physician partners and other sources, to identify, contact and develop potential acquisition candidates.
We believe there are numerous acquisition opportunities that would pass our general screening criteria. We carefully evaluate each of our acquisition opportunities through an extensive due diligence process to determine which facilities have the greatest potential for growth and profitability improvements under our operating structure. In many cases, the acquisition team identifies specific opportunities to enhance a facility’s productivity post-acquisition. For example, we may renovate or construct additional operating or treatment rooms in existing facilities to meet anticipated demand for procedures based on an analysis of local market characteristics. Our team may also identify opportunities to attract additional physicians to increase the acquired facility’s revenues and profitability.  
Development Program. We develop surgical facilities in markets in which we identify substantial interest by physicians and payors. We have experience in developing both single and multi-specialty surgical facilities. When we develop a new surgical facility, we generally provide all of the services necessary to complete the project. We offer in-house capabilities for structuring partnerships and financing facilities and work with architects and construction firms in the design and development of surgical facilities. Before and during the development phase of a new surgical facility, we analyze the competitive environment in the local market, review market data to identify appropriate services to provide, prepare and analyze financial forecasts, evaluate regulatory and licensing issues and assist in designing the surgical facility and identifying appropriate equipment to purchase or lease. After the surgical facility is developed, we generally provide startup operational support, including information systems, equipment procurement and financing.  
Information Systems and Controls
Each of our surgical facilities uses a financial reporting system that provides information to our corporate office to track financial performance on a timely basis. In addition, each of our surgical facilities uses an operating system to manage its business that provides critical support in areas such as scheduling, billing and collection, accounts receivable management, purchasing and other essential operational functions.  
 8

We have implemented systems to support all of our surgical facilities and to enable us to more easily access information about our surgical facilities on a timely basis.
The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the "ARRA") provides for Medicare and Medicaid incentive payments for eligible hospitals and professionals that implement and achieve meaningful use of certified Electronic Health Records ("EHR") technology. Our surgical hospitals have implemented systems to comply with the EHR meaningful use requirements of the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (the “HITECH Act”) in time to qualify for the maximum available incentive payments. Compliance with the meaningful use requirements has and will continue to result in significant costs including business process changes, professional services focused on successfully designing and implementing EHR solutions along with costs associated with the hardware and software components of the project.
We calculate net revenues through a combination of manual and system generated processes.  Our operating systems include insurance modules that allow us to establish profiles of insurance plans and their respective payment rates. The systems then match the charges with the insurance plan rates and compute a contractual adjustment estimate for each patient account. We then manually review the reasonableness of the systems’ contractual adjustment estimate using the insurance profiles. This estimate is adjusted, if needed, when the insurance payment is received and posted to the account.  Net revenues are computed and reported by the systems as a result of this activity.
It is our policy to collect co-payments and deductibles prior to providing services. It is also our policy to verify a patient’s insurance 72 hours prior to the patient’s procedure. Because our services are primarily non-emergency, our surgical facilities have the ability to control these processes. We do not track exceptions to these policies, but we believe that they occur infrequently and involve insignificant amounts.  When exceptions do occur, we require patients whose insurance coverage is not verified to assume full responsibility for the fees prior to services being rendered, and we seek prompt payment of co-payments and deductibles and verification of insurance following the procedure.
Claims are submitted electronically if the payor accepts electronic claims.  We use clearinghouses for electronic claims, which then forward the claims to the respective payors. Payments are manually input to the respective patient accounts.
We have developed proprietary measurement tools to track key operating statistics at each of our surgical facilities by integrating data from our local operating systems and our financial reporting systems. Management uses these tools to measure operating results against target thresholds and to identify, monitor and adjust areas such as specialty mix, staffing, operating costs, employee expenses and accounts receivable management. Our corporate and facility-level management teams are compensated in part using performance-based incentives focused on revenue growth and improving operating income.
Marketing
We primarily direct our sales and marketing efforts at physicians who would utilize our surgical facilities. Marketing activities directed at physicians and other healthcare providers are coordinated locally by the individual surgical facility and are supplemented by dedicated corporate personnel. These activities generally emphasize the benefits offered by our surgical facilities compared to other facilities in the market, such as the proximity of our surgical facilities to physicians’ offices, the ability to schedule consecutive cases without preemption by inpatient or emergency procedures, the efficient turnaround time between cases, our advanced surgical equipment and our simplified administrative procedures. Although the facility administrator is the primary point of contact, physicians who utilize our surgical facilities are important sources of recommendations to other physicians regarding the benefits of using our surgical facilities. Recruiting teams develop a target list of physicians, and we continually review our progress in successfully recruiting additional local physicians.
We also market our surgical facilities directly to payors, such as health maintenance organizations ("HMOs"), preferred provider organizations ("PPOs"), and other managed care organizations and employers. Payor marketing activities conducted by our corporate office management and facility administrators emphasize the high quality of care, cost advantages and convenience of our surgical facilities, and are focused on making each surgical facility an approved provider under local managed care plans.
Competition
In each market in which we operate a surgical facility, we compete with hospitals and operators of other surgical facilities to attract physicians and patients.  We believe that the competitive factors that affect our surgical facilities’ ability to compete for physicians are convenience of location of the surgical facilities, access to capital and participation in managed care programs.  In addition, we believe the national prominence, scale and reputation of our company are instrumental in attracting physicians. We believe that our surgical facilities attract patients based upon our quality of care, the specialties and reputations of the physicians who operate in our surgical facilities, participation in managed care programs, ease of access and convenient scheduling and registration procedures.
In developing or acquiring existing surgical facilities, we compete with other public and private surgical facility and hospital companies.  Several large national companies own and/or manage surgical facilities, in some cases in connection with other lines of business with which we do not compete, including HCA  Holdings, Inc., Surgical Care Affiliates, Inc., Envision Healthcare Corporation and Tenet Healthcare Corporation. We also face competition from local hospitals, physicians and other providers who may compete with us in the ownership and operation of surgical facilities, as well as the trend of physicians choosing to perform procedures in an office-based setting rather than in a surgical facility.
Seasonality 
Our net revenue fluctuates based on the number of business days in each calendar quarter, because the majority of services provided by physicians in our surgical facilities consist of scheduled procedures and office visits that occur during business hours. Revenue in the fourth quarter could also be impacted by an increased utilization of services due to annual deductibles which are not usually met until later in the year and also as patients utilize their healthcare benefits before they expire at year-end.

Employees
At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 6,000 employees, including approximately 4,000 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement.  We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
Environmental
We are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including those governing the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, the cleanup of contaminated sites and the maintenance of a safe workplace. Our operations include the use, generation and disposal of hazardous materials. We may, in the future, incur liability under environmental statutes and regulations with respect to contamination of sites we own or operate (including contamination caused by prior owners or operators of such sites, adjoining properties or other persons) and the off-site disposal of hazardous substances. We believe that we have been and are in substantial compliance with the terms of all applicable environmental laws and regulations and that we have no liabilities under environmental requirements that we would expect to have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition (including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position).
Insurance
We maintain liability insurance in amounts that we believe are appropriate for our operations. Currently, we maintain professional liability insurance that provides coverage on a claims-made basis of $1.0 million per occurrence with a retention of $100,000 per occurrence and $3.0 million in annual aggregate coverage per surgical facility, including the facility and employed staff.  We maintain general liability insurance that provides coverage on an occurrence basis of $1.0 million per occurrence with a retention of $25,000 per occurrence and $3.0 million in annual aggregate coverage per surgical facility. We also maintain business interruption insurance and property damage insurance. Coverage under certain of these policies is contingent upon the policy being in effect when a claim is made regardless of when the events which caused the claim occurred. The cost and availability of such coverage has varied widely in recent years.  
In addition, physicians who provide professional services in our surgical facilities are required to maintain separate malpractice coverage with similar minimum coverage limits. While we believe that our insurance policies are adequate in amount and coverage for our anticipated operations, we cannot assure you that the insurance coverage is sufficient to cover all future claims or will continue to be available in adequate amounts or at a reasonable cost.
Sources of Revenue - Surgical Facilities
Revenue from our surgical facilities is obtained from facility fees related to healthcare services performed in our surgical facilities and is included in our patient service revenues, which accounted for 98.2%, 98.0%, and 96.2% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. More detailed financial information about our surgical facilities segment can be found in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included elsewhere in this report. 
The fee charged for surgical services varies depending on the type of service provided, but usually includes all charges for usage of an operating room, a recovery room, special equipment, supplies, nursing staff and medications.  Our fees do not typically include professional fees charged by the patient's surgeon, anesthesiologist or other attending physician, which are billed directly by such physicians to the patient or third-party payor.  We recognize our facility fees on the date of service, net of estimated contractual adjustments and discounts for third-party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid.  Any changes in estimated contractual adjustments and discounts are recorded in the period of change.
We are dependent upon private and government third-party sources of payment for the surgical services we provide.  The amounts that our surgical facilities receive in payment for their services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors as well as other factors over which we have no control, including Medicare, Medicaid and state regulations as well as cost containment and utilization decisions and reduced reimbursement schedules of third-party payors. Approximately 40%, 38% and 35% of our patient service revenues were from government sources, mostly Medicare, for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
The following table sets forth the percentage of our total patient service revenues for our consolidated surgical facilities by type of payor for the periods indicated:

 | Year Ended December 31,
 | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Private Insurance | 51 | % | | 55 | % | 52 | %
Government | 40 | % | | 38 | % | 35 | %
Self-pay | 2 | % | | 2 | % | 3 | %
Other | 7 | % | | 5 | % | 10 | %
Total patient service revenues | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

We receive reimbursement from Medicare for surgical services based on three different payment systems depending on the site of service: outpatient hospital surgical services, hospital inpatient surgical services and outpatient surgical services provided in our ASCs. 
Medicare Reimbursement - Hospital Outpatient Departments
Surgical services that are provided in hospital outpatient departments (“HOPDs”) are generally reimbursed by Medicare on the Outpatient Prospective Payment System (the “OPPS”). The OPPS is a system established by the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) that determines payment amounts prospectively for various categories of medical services performed in HOPDs. On November 14, 
 10

2016, CMS published its OPPS final rule for CY 2017. Among other things, the final rule provides for a payment rate increase of 1.65%. The rate increase is based on a hospital market basket increase of 2.7%, which is reduced by a multi-factor productivity adjustment of 0.3% and an additional 0.75% reduction required by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “Affordable Care Act”) and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (together with the Affordable Care Act, the “Healthcare Reform Acts”). Hospitals that do not meet the reporting requirements of the Medicare Hospital Outpatient Quality Reporting Program will be subject to an additional 2.0% payment rate decrease
Beginning in CY 2017, CMS is also implementing Section 603 of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015. Under this section, certain off-campus HOPDs that began billing under the OPPS (or underwent certain changes) on or after November 2, 2015 will no longer be paid for most services under the OPPS. Instead, beginning January 1, 2017, these facilities will be paid under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (“MPFS”), which will typically result in lower reimbursements. Services provided in a dedicated emergency department will continue to be paid under the OPPS. We do not expect this change to impact reimbursement to any of our HOPDs, but we cannot assure you that our HOPDs will not be impacted in the future. 
Medicare Reimbursement - ASCs
Payments under the Medicare program to ASCs are also made based on the OPPS. However, the payment received from the Medicare program by an ASC is a percentage of the payment to HOPDs. Reimbursement rates for ASCs are updated annually based on changes in the consumer price index offset by multifactor productivity adjustments. In 2016, ASC reimbursement rates increased by 0.3% and, based on the OPPS Final Rule, will increase by an additional 1.9% for 2017. CMS has established the Ambulatory Surgical Center Quality Reporting (“ASCQR”) Program as a pay-for-reporting, quality data program. Our ASCs that participate in the ASCQR Program receive the full annual update to the ASC payment rate. Those ASCs that do not successfully report quality data under the ASCQR Program may receive a payment reduction.
Medicare Reimbursement - Hospital Inpatient Services
Five of our surgical facilities are licensed as hospitals. Most inpatient services provided by hospitals are reimbursed by Medicare under the inpatient prospective payment system (“IPPS”). Under the IPPS, a hospital receives a fixed amount for inpatient hospital services based on each patient's final assigned Medicare-severity diagnosis related group (“MS-DRG”). Each MS-DRG is assigned a payment rate that is prospectively set using national average resources used per case for treating a patient with a particular diagnosis. This MS-DRG assignment also affects the prospectively determined capital rate paid with each MS-DRG. MS-DRG and capital payments are adjusted by a predetermined geographic adjustment factor assigned to the geographic area in which the hospital is located. The index used to adjust the MS-DRG rates, known as the “hospital market basket index,” gives consideration to the inflation experienced by hospitals in purchasing goods and services.
On August 22, 2016, CMS published the IPPS final rule for federal fiscal year (“FFY”) 2017, which began on October 1, 2016. Under the FFY 2017 final rule, rates for inpatient stays in hospitals paid under the IPPS that successfully report certain quality data under the Hospital Inpatient Quality Reporting (“IQR”) Program and demonstrate meaningful use of certified electronic health record technology will be increased by 0.95%. Those hospitals that do not successfully report quality data under the IQR Program may receive a payment rate increase of only 0.275%. In addition to the IQR Program, hospitals will be subject to payment adjustments under the Value Based Purchasing Program, Readmissions Reduction Program and Hospital Acquired Conditions Reduction Programs that have been implemented by HHS.
Annual Cost Reports
Hospitals participating in the Medicare and some Medicaid programs, whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a prospective payment system, are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements. Federal and, where applicable, state regulations require submission of annual cost reports identifying medical costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to Medicare beneficiaries and Medicaid recipients. Annual cost reports required under the Medicare and some Medicaid programs are subject to routine governmental audits. These audits may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be payable to us under these reimbursement programs. Finalization of these audits often takes several years. Providers may appeal any final determination made in connection with an audit.
Sources of Revenue - Ancillary and Optical Services
Our ancillary services segment derives revenue from the provision of physician services and laboratory services. The fees charged for ancillary and optical services depend on the type of service provided, the location in which the service is provider and the provider of the service. Ancillary and optical services fees are received from both private and government third-party sources of payment. The amounts that we receive in payment for the provision of ancillary and optical services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors as well as other factors over which we have no control, including Medicare, Medicaid and state regulations as well as cost containment and utilization decisions and reduced reimbursement schedules of third-party payors. More detailed financial information about our ancillary and optical services segments can be found in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” included elsewhere in this report.
Our ancillary services revenue primarily consists of fee for service revenue that is derived principally from the provision of physician and laboratory services to patients of our surgical facilities. Medicare pays for physician services based upon the MPFS. Payment rates under the MPFS are determined based on (i) relative value units for the services provided, (ii) a geographic adjustment factor and (iii) a conversion factor. Payment rates under the MPFS are updated annually by HHS. The primary element in each year’s update calculation is the Medicare Economic Index (“MEI”), which is a measure of the inflation of the cost of operating a physician practice. The update is then adjusted in conformity with the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”), which was enacted in April 2015. MACRA established a fixed 0.5% annual adjustment through calendar year 2018. Beginning in 2019, Medicare compensation to physicians and physician practices will be subject to adjustment under the Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”). Under MIPS, physicians will be assigned a composite performance score based on measures of quality, resource use, meaningful use of electronic health records, and clinical practice improvement activities. A threshold performance score will be set annually by CMS at the mean or median of all composite scores for a prior annual performance period. Performance exceeding the threshold will result in a positive adjustment, performance below 
 11

the threshold will result in a negative adjustment, and performance at the threshold will result in no adjustment. Physicians who participate in certain alternative payment models, such as accountable care organizations, will be guaranteed a positive payment adjustment under MACRA. The effect of the payment methodology changes under MACRA on our physician practices cannot be predicted.
Certain of our laboratory ancillary services are reimbursed by Medicare under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule (“CLFS”). Under a June 23, 2016 final rule that implements the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014 (“PAMA”), as of January 1, 2018 the CLFS payment methodology will be adjusted so that payment amounts for laboratory tests on the CLFS will be determined by calculating a weighted median of private payor rates using reported private payor rates and associated volume (number of tests). For tests that were paid on the CLFS prior to the implementation of PAMA, any reduction in payment amount will be phased in over the first 6 years of payment under the new system.
Private Third-Party Payors
Most third-party payors reimburse us for surgical and ancillary services pursuant to a written contract. These contracts generally require that we offer discounts from our established charges. Some of our payments come from third-party payors with which we do not have written contracts. In those situations, commonly known as “out-of-network” services, we generally charge the patients the same co-payment or other patient responsibility amounts that we would have charged had we had a contract with the third-party payor. We also submit a claim for the services to the third-party payor along with full disclosure that we have charged the patient an in-network patient responsibility amount.
Governmental Regulation
General
The healthcare industry is highly regulated, and we cannot provide any assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not significantly change in the future or that we will be able to successfully address any such changes. 
Every state imposes licensing requirements on individual physicians and healthcare facilities. In addition, federal and state laws regulate HMOs and other managed care organizations. Many states require regulatory approval, including licensure and accreditation, and in some cases, certificates of need, before establishing certain types of healthcare facilities, including surgical hospitals and ASCs, offering certain services, including the services we offer, or making expenditures in excess of certain amounts for healthcare equipment, facilities or programs. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our surgical facilities obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses, accreditation, certificates of need and other approvals and operating in compliance with applicable healthcare regulations. Failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Our surgical facilities are subject to federal, state and local laws dealing with issues such as occupational safety, employment, medical leave, insurance regulations, civil rights, discrimination, building codes and medical waste and other environmental issues. Federal, state and local governments are expanding the regulatory requirements on businesses like ours. The imposition of these regulatory requirements may have the effect of increasing operating costs and reducing the profitability of our operations. 
We believe that hospital, outpatient surgery, physician, laboratory and other diagnostic and healthcare services will continue to be subject to intense regulation at the federal and state levels. We are unable to predict what additional government regulations, if any, affecting our business may be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws and regulations might be interpreted. If we, or any of our surgical facilities, fail to comply with applicable laws, it might have a material adverse effect on our business. 
Certificates of Need and Licensure 
Capital expenditures for the construction of new healthcare facilities, the addition of beds or new healthcare services or the acquisition of existing healthcare facilities may be reviewable by state regulators under statutory schemes that are sometimes referred to as certificate of need laws. States with certificate of need laws place limits on the construction and acquisition of healthcare facilities and the expansion of existing facilities and services. In these states, approvals, generally known as certificates of need, are required for capital expenditures exceeding certain preset monetary thresholds for the development, acquisition and/or expansion of certain facilities or services, including surgical facilities. We have a concentration of surgical facilities in certificate of need states as we believe the regulations present a competitive advantage to existing operators. 
Our healthcare facilities also are subject to state licensing requirements for medical providers. Our ASC facilities have licenses to operate in the states in which they operate and must meet all applicable requirements for ASCs. In addition, even though our surgical facilities that are licensed as hospitals primarily provide surgical services, they must meet all applicable requirements for general hospital licensure. To assure continued compliance with these regulations, governmental and other authorities periodically inspect our surgical facilities. The failure to comply with these regulations could result in the suspension or revocation of a facility’s license. In addition, based on the specific operations of our surgical facilities, some of these facilities maintain a pharmacy license, a controlled substance registration, a clinical laboratory certification waiver, and environmental protection permits for biohazards and/or radioactive materials, as required by applicable law. 
Healthcare Reform 
The Affordable Care Act has been subject to a number of challenges to its constitutionality. On June 28, 2012, the United States Supreme Court upheld challenges to the constitutionality of the “individual mandate” provision, which generally requires all individuals to purchase healthcare insurance or pay a penalty, but struck down as unconstitutional the provision that would have allowed the federal government to revoke all federal Medicaid funding to any state that did not expand its Medicaid program. As a result, many states have refused to extend Medicaid eligibility to more individuals as envisioned by the law. 
 12

On June 25, 2015, the United States Supreme Court upheld the legality of premium subsidies made available by the federal government to individuals residing in the 36 states that have federally-run health insurance exchanges. The subsidies are provided to low-income individuals to assist with the cost of purchasing health insurance through federally-run health insurance exchanges. Other legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act are pending.
Initiatives to repeal the Affordable Care Act, in whole or in part, to delay elements of implementation or funding, and to offer amendments or supplements to modify its provisions have been persistent and may increase as a result of the 2016 election. The ultimate outcomes of legislative attempts to repeal or amend the Affordable Care Act and legal challenges to the Affordable Care Act are unknown. Results of recent Congressional elections and the change of Presidential administrations beginning in 2017 could create a political environment in which substantial portions of the Affordable Care Act are repealed or revised. Specifically, President Donald Trump's 100 Day Action Plan calls for full repeal of the Affordable Care Act and its replacement with health savings accounts, cross-states sales of health insurance, and modifications to state-managed Medicaid programs. Nevertheless, prospects for rapid enactment of radical change in the health care regulatory landscape are not clear, and President Trump has indicated that certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act, such as provisions restraining the ability of insurers to deny or limit coverage based on pre-existing conditions or mandating that parents have the ability to extend insurance coverage to their children until they turn 26, should be preserved. On March 6, 2017, Republican leadership in the House of Representatives introduced legislation that would repeal substantial portions of the Affordable Care Act, including the individual mandate. The legislation would eliminate health care exchanges and would replace means-tested insurance premium subsidies with age-adjusted tax credits. The legislation would also limit federal funding available for the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion and transition federal Medicaid funding to a per-capita cap basis by 2020. It remains unclear what portions of the Affordable Care Act may remain, or what any replacement or alternative programs may be created by any future legislation. Any such future repeal or replacement may have significant impact on the reimbursement for healthcare services generally, and may create reimbursement for services competing with the services offered by the Company. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that the adoption of any future federal or state healthcare reform legislation will not have a negative financial impact on the Company.
Moreover, other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will remain in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These and other similar new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial operations. 
Medicare and Medicaid Private Contractor Audits 
CMS has implemented a number of programs that use private contractors that contract with CMS to identify overpayments and underpayments and other potential sources of billing fraud. These contractors, known as Recovery Audit Contractors (“RACs”) and Zone Program Integrity Contractors (“ZPICs”) conduct both post-payment and pre-payment review of claims submitted by Medicare providers. In addition, CMS employs Medicaid Integrity Contractors (“MICs”) to perform post-payment audits of Medicaid claims and identify overpayments. Our facilities and providers continue to receive letters from auditors such as RACs and ZPICs requesting repayment of alleged overpayments for services and incur expenses associated with responding to and appealing these determinations, as well as the costs of repaying any overpayments. Moreover, in recent years, the increase in Medicare payment appeals has created a backlog such that resolving appeals often takes multiple years. 
For instance, we recently received the results of a MIC audit that resulted in an overpayment obligation. HMS Federal Solutions, a MIC, completed the audit of one of our surgical hospitals for the period July 1, 2009 through May 31, 2012 and determined an overpayment obligation in the amount of approximately $4.6 million based on its extrapolation of a statistical sampling of claims, as well as a civil monetary penalty in the amount of $162,000, for a total amount owed to Idaho’s Department of Health and Welfare, Medicaid Program Integrity Unit of approximately $4.7 million for failure to comply with Medicaid rules by billing for (i) non-covered services, (ii) services provided by non-eligible providers, (iii) services not provided and (iv) unauthorized services. We have appealed the audit and are currently awaiting the result. 
Although all other repayments requested to date as a result of RAC, MIC and ZPIC audits have not been material to our Company, we are unable to quantify the aggregate financial impact of these audits on our facilities given the pending appeals and uncertainty about the extent of future audits. 
Quality Improvement 
The Medicare program presently requires hospitals and ASCs to report performance data on a variety of quality metrics. Facilities that fail to report are penalized with reduced Medicare payments. Additionally, payments to hospitals are adjusted based on the hospital’s performance on these quality measures. A substantial portion of hospital payment is at risk depending on its individual performance relative to benchmarks and other hospitals’ performance. There is a substantial risk that our Medicare payments could be reduced if our hospitals fail to perform adequately on these measures. Additionally, there is a risk that Medicare payments could be reduced if our facilities-hospitals and ASCs-fail to adequate report data as required by CMS. ASC payments are not yet adjusted based on performance against quality measures, but there is a substantial risk that Congress may soon link ASC Medicare payments to actual performance, in addition to reporting.
If the public performance data becomes a primary factor in determining where patients choose to receive care, and if competing hospitals and ASCs have better results than our facilities on those measures, we would expect that our patient volumes could decline.

Medicare and Medicaid Participation 
The majority of our revenue is expected to continue to be received from third-party payors, including federal and state programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and commercial payors. To participate in the Medicare program and receive Medicare payment, our surgical facilities must comply with regulations promulgated by the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). Among other things, these regulations, known as “conditions for coverage” or “conditions of participation,” impose numerous requirements on our facilities, their equipment, their personnel and their standards of medical care, as well as compliance with all applicable state and local laws and regulations. On April 26, 2007, CMS issued a policy memorandum that reaffirmed its prior interpretation of its conditions of participation that all hospitals (other than critical access hospitals) participating in the Medicare program are required to provide basic emergency care interventions regardless of whether or not the hospital maintains an emergency department. Our five facilities licensed as hospitals are required to meet this requirement to maintain their participating provider status in the Medicare program. As of December 31, 2016, two of our hospitals, which do not have an emergency room, maintain a protocol for the transfer of patients requiring emergency treatment, which protocol may be interpreted as inconsistent with the 2007 CMS policy memorandum. Our surgical facilities must also satisfy the conditions of participation to be eligible to participate in the various state Medicaid programs. The requirements for certification under Medicare and Medicaid are subject to change and, in order to remain qualified for these programs, we may have to make changes from time to time in our facilities, equipment, personnel or services. Although we intend to continue to participate in these reimbursement programs, we cannot assure you that our surgical facilities will continue to qualify for participation. 
The Affordable Care Act and its implementing regulations require a hospital to provide written disclosure of physician ownership interests to the hospital’s patients and on the hospital’s website and in any advertising, along with annual reports to the government detailing such interests. Additionally, hospitals that do not have 24/7 physician coverage are required to inform patients of this fact and receive signed acknowledgment from the patients of the disclosure. A hospital’s provider agreement may be terminated if it fails to provide the required notices. In 2010, CMS issued a “self-referral disclosure protocol” for hospitals and other providers that wish to self-disclose potential violations of the Stark Law to CMS and to attempt to resolve those potential violations and any related overpayment liabilities at levels below the maximum penalties and amounts set forth in the statute. The disclosure requirements set forth in the Affordable Care Act and the self-referral disclosure protocol reflect a move towards increasing government scrutiny of the financial relationships between hospitals and referring physicians and increasing disclosure of potential violations of the Stark Law to the government by hospitals and other healthcare providers. We intend for all of our facilities to meet their disclosure obligations. 
Survey and Accreditation 
Hospitals and healthcare facilities are subject to periodic inspection by federal, state and local authorities to determine their compliance with applicable regulations and requirements necessary for licensing, certification and accreditation. All of our hospitals and surgical facilities currently are licensed under appropriate state laws and are qualified to participate in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Renewal and continuation of certain of these licenses, certifications and accreditations are based on inspections or other reviews generally conducted in the normal course of business of health facilities. Loss of, or limitations imposed on, licenses or accreditations could reduce a facility’s utilization or revenue, or its ability to operate all or a portion of its facilities. 
Utilization Review 
Federal law contains numerous provisions designed to ensure that services rendered by hospitals to Medicare and Medicaid patients meet professionally recognized standards and are medically necessary and that claims for reimbursement are properly filed. These provisions include a requirement that a sampling of admissions of Medicare and Medicaid patients must be reviewed by quality improvement organizations, which review the appropriateness of Medicare and Medicaid patient admissions and discharges, the quality of care provided, the validity of MS-DRG classifications and the appropriateness of cases of extraordinary length of stay or cost. Quality improvement organizations may deny payment for services provided or assess fines and also have the authority to recommend to HHS that a provider which is in substantial noncompliance with the standards of the quality improvement organization be excluded from participation in the Medicare program. Utilization review is also a requirement of most non-governmental managed care organizations. 
Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Medicare Fraud and Abuse Laws 
The Social Security Act includes provisions addressing false statements, illegal remuneration and other instances of fraud and abuse in federal health care programs. These provisions include the statute commonly known as the federal Anti-Kickback statute (the “Anti-Kickback Statute”). The Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits providers and others from, among other things, soliciting, receiving, offering or paying, directly or indirectly, any remuneration in return for either making a referral for, or ordering or arranging for, or recommending the order of, any item or service covered by a federal healthcare program, including, but not limited to, the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are criminal offenses punishable by imprisonment and fines of up to $25,000 for each violation. Civil violations are punishable by fines of up to $50,000 for each violation, as well as damages of up to three times the total amount of remuneration received from the government for healthcare claims. 
Because physician-investors in our surgical facilities are in a position to generate referrals to the facilities, the distribution of available cash to those investors could come under scrutiny under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Some courts have held that the Anti-Kickback Statute is violated if one purpose (as opposed to a primary or the sole purpose) of a payment to a provider is to induce referrals. Further, Section 6402(f)(2) of the Affordable Care Act amends the Anti-Kickback Statute by adding a provision to clarify that a person need not have actual knowledge of such section or specific intent to commit a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. Because none of these cases involved a joint venture such as those owning and operating our surgical facilities, it is not clear how a court would apply these holdings to our activities. It is clear, however, that a physician’s investment income from a surgical facility may not vary with the number of his or her referrals to the surgical facility, and we believe that we comply with this prohibition. 
Under regulations issued by the OIG, certain categories of activities are deemed not to violate the Anti-Kickback Statute (commonly referred to as the safe harbors). According to the preamble to these safe harbor regulations, the failure of a particular business arrangement to 
 14

comply with the regulations does not determine whether the arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute. The safe harbor regulations do not make conduct illegal, but instead outline standards that, if complied with, protect conduct that might otherwise be deemed in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. Failure to meet a safe harbor does not indicate that the arrangement violates the Anti-Kickback Statute, although it may be subject to additional scrutiny. 
We believe the ownership and operations of our surgery centers and hospitals do not fit wholly within any of the safe harbors, but we attempt to structure our ASCs to fit as closely as possible within the safe harbor designed to protect distributions to physician-investors in ASCs who directly refer patients to the ASC and personally perform the procedures at the center as an extension of their practice (the “ASC Safe Harbor”). The ASC Safe Harbor protects four categories of investors, including ASCs owned by (1) general surgeons, (2) single-specialty physicians, (3) multi-specialty physicians and (4) hospital/physician joint ventures, provided that certain requirements are satisfied. These requirements include the following: 

• | The ASC must be certified to participate in the Medicare program, and its operating and recovery room space must be dedicated exclusively to the center and not a part of a hospital (although such space may be leased from a hospital if such lease meets the requirements of the safe harbor for space rental).


• | Each investor must be either (a) a physician who derived at least one-third of his or her medical practice income for the previous fiscal year or 12-month period from performing procedures on the list of Medicare-covered procedures for ASCs, (b) a hospital, or (c) a person or entity not in a position to make or influence referrals to the center, nor to provide items or services to the center, nor employed by the center or any investor.


• | Unless all physician-investors are members of a single specialty, each physician-investor must perform at least one-third of his or her procedures at the ASC each year. This requirement is in addition to the requirement that the physician-investor has derived at least one-third of his or her medical practice income for the past year from performing procedures.


• | Physician-investors must have fully informed their referred patients of the physician’s investment.


• | The terms on which an investment interest is offered to an investor are not related to the previous or expected volume of referrals, services furnished or the amount of business otherwise generated from that investor to the entity.


• | Neither the ASC nor any other investor nor any person acting on their behalf may loan funds to or guarantee a loan for an investor if the investor uses any part of such loan to obtain the investment interest.


• | The amount of payment to an investor in return for the investment interest is directly proportional to the amount of the capital investment (including the fair market value of any pre-operational services rendered) of that investor.


• | All physician-investors, any hospital-investor and the center agree to treat patients receiving benefits or assistance under a federal healthcare program in a non-discriminatory manner.


• | All ancillary services performed at the ASC for beneficiaries of federal healthcare programs must be directly and integrally related to primary procedures performed at the center and may not be billed separately.


• | No hospital-investor may include on its cost report or any claim for payment from a federal healthcare program any costs associated with the ASC.


• | The ASC may not use equipment owned by or services provided by a hospital-investor unless such equipment is leased in accordance with a lease that complies with the Anti-Kickback Statute equipment rental safe harbor and such services are provided in accordance with a contract that complies with the Anti-Kickback Statute personal services and management contract safe harbor.


• | No hospital-investor may be in a position to make or influence referrals directly or indirectly to any other investor or the center.

We believe that the ownership and operations of our surgical centers will not satisfy this ASC Safe Harbor for investment interests in ASCs because, among other things, we or one of our subsidiaries will generally be an investor in and provide management services to each ASC. We cannot assure you that the OIG would view our activities favorably even though we strive to achieve compliance with the remaining elements of this safe harbor. 
In addition, although we expect each physician-investor to utilize our ASCs as an extension of his or her practice and ask each physician-investor to certify this practice, we cannot assure you that all physician-investors will derive at least one-third of their medical practice income from performing Medicare-covered ASC procedures, perform one-third of their procedures at the centers or inform their referred patients of their investment interests. Interests in our joint venture ASCs are purchased at what we believe to be fair market value. Investors who purchase at a later time generally pay more for a given percentage interest than founding investors. The result is that while all investors are paid distributions in accordance with their ownership interests, for ASCs where there are later purchases, we cannot meet the safe harbor requirement that return on investment is directly proportional to the amount of capital investment. The OIG has on several occasions reviewed investments relating to ASCs, and in Advisory Opinion No. 07-05, raised concerns that (a) purchases of interests from physicians might yield gains on investment rather than capital infusion to the ASCs, (b) such purchases could be meant to reward or influence the selling physicians’ referrals to the ASC or the hospital, and (c) such returns might not be directly proportional to the amount of capital invested. Nonetheless, we believe our fair market value purchase requirements and distribution policies comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute. 
In OIG Advisory Opinion No. 09-09 (July 29, 2009), the OIG concluded that an arrangement involving an ASC joint venture between a hospital and physicians involving the combination of their two ASCs into a single, larger center presented minimal risk of fraud or abuse, despite the fact that it did not fit within any applicable Anti-Kickback safe harbors. Additionally, the OIG stated that fair market value should 
 15

be determined based only on the tangible assets of each facility since the physician investors are referral sources for the ASC. The OIG stated that a cash flow-based valuation of the business contributed by the physician investors potentially would include the value of the physician investors’ referrals over the time that their ASC was in existence prior to the merger with the hospital’s ASC. The OIG went on to note that a valuation involving intangible assets would not necessarily result in a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute, but would require a review of all the facts and circumstances. It is not clear whether the OIG is concerned about using a cash flow-based valuation in most healthcare transactions involving referral sources, or just transactions, similar to this one, where the parties’ contributions would be valued differently for contributing the same assets if only one party’s contribution is valued as a going concern based on cash flow. Also, the OIG appears to be focused on historical cash flow rather than a projected, discounted cash flow, which is a commonly used valuation methodology. What is clear is that for the first time, the OIG addressed valuation methodologies, which could lead to increased scrutiny of all transactions involving physicians. 
Our hospital investments do not fit wholly within the safe harbor for investments in small entities because more than 40.0% of the investment interests are held by investors who are either in a position to refer to the hospital or who provide services to the hospital and more than 40.0% of the hospital’s gross revenue last year were derived from referrals generated by investors. However, we believe we comply with the remaining elements of the safe harbor. 
In addition to the physician ownership in our surgical facilities, other financial relationships of ours with potential referral sources could potentially be scrutinized under the Anti-Kickback Statute. We have entered into management agreements to manage the majority of our surgical facilities. Most of these agreements call for our subsidiary to be paid a percentage-based management fee. Although there is a safe harbor for personal services and management contracts (the “Personal Services and Management Safe Harbor”), the Personal Services and Management Safe Harbor requires, among other things, that the amount of the aggregate compensation paid to the manager over the term of the agreement be set in advance. Because our management fees are generally based on a percentage of revenue, our management agreements do not typically meet this requirement. We do, however, believe that our management arrangements satisfy the other requirements of the Personal Services and Management Safe Harbor for personal services and management contracts. The OIG has taken the position in several advisory opinions that percentage-based management agreements are not protected by a safe harbor, and consequently, may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute. We have implemented formal compliance programs designed to safeguard against overbilling and believe that our management agreements comply with the requirements of the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, we cannot assure you that the OIG would find our compliance programs to be adequate or that our management agreements would be found to comply with the Anti-Kickback Statute. 
Certain of our ASCs have entered into arrangements for professional services, including arrangements for anesthesia services. In a Special Advisory Bulletin issued in April 2003, the OIG focused on “questionable” contractual arrangements where a health care provider in one line of business (the “Owner”) expands into a related health care business by contracting with an existing provider of a related item or service (the “Manager/Supplier”) to provide the new item or service to the Owner’s existing patient population, including federal health care program patients (so called “suspect Contractual Joint Ventures”). The Manager/Supplier not only manages the new line of business, but may also supply it with inventory, employees, space, billing, and other services. In other words, the Owner contracts out substantially the entire operation of the related line of business to the Manager/Supplier-otherwise a potential competitor-receiving in return the profits of the business as remuneration for its referrals. Through an Advisory Opinion, the OIG extended this suspect contractual joint venture analysis to arrangements between anesthesiologists and physician owners of ASCs. In Advisory Opinion 12-06, the OIG concluded that certain proposed arrangements between anesthesia groups and physician-owned ASCs could result in prohibited remuneration under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. We believe our arrangements for anesthesia services are distinguishable from those described in Advisory Opinion 12-06 (May 25, 2012) and are in compliance with the requirements of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. However, we cannot assure you that regulatory authorities would agree with that position. 
We also may guarantee a surgical facility’s third-party debt financing and certain lease obligations as part of our obligations under a management agreement. Physician investors are generally not required to enter into similar guarantees. The OIG might take the position that the failure of the physician investors to enter into similar guarantees represents a special benefit to the physician investors given to induce patient referrals and that such failure constitutes a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute. We believe that the management fees (and in some cases guarantee fees) are adequate compensation to us for the credit risk associated with the guarantees and that the failure of the physician investors to enter into similar guarantees does not create a material risk of violating the Anti-Kickback Statute. However, the OIG has not issued any guidance in this regard. 
The OIG is authorized to issue advisory opinions regarding the interpretation and applicability of the Anti-Kickback Statute, including whether an activity constitutes grounds for the imposition of civil or criminal sanctions. We have not, however, sought such an opinion regarding any of our arrangements. If it were determined that our activities, or those of our surgical facilities or hospitals, violate the Anti-Kickback Statute, we, our subsidiaries, our officers, our directors and each surgical facility and hospital investor could be subject, individually, to substantial monetary liability, prison sentences and/or exclusion from participation in any healthcare program funded in whole or in part by the U.S. government, including Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE or state healthcare programs. 
Evolving interpretations of current, or the adoption of new, federal or state laws or regulations could affect many of our arrangements. Law enforcement authorities, including the OIG, the courts and Congress, are increasing their scrutiny of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to exchange remuneration for patient care referrals or opportunities. Investigators have also demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction to determine the underlying purposes of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources. 
Federal Physician Self-Referral Law 
Congress has enacted the federal physician self-referral law, or Stark Law, that prohibits certain self-referrals for healthcare services. As currently enacted, the Stark Law prohibits a practitioner, including a physician, dentist or podiatrist, from referring patients to an entity with which the practitioner or a member of his or her immediate family has a “financial relationship” for the provision of certain “designated 
 16

health services” that are paid for in whole or in part by Medicare or Medicaid unless an exception applies. The term “financial relationship” is broadly defined and includes most types of ownership and compensation relationships. The Stark Law also prohibits the entity from seeking payment from Medicare or Medicaid for services that are rendered through a prohibited referral. If an entity is paid for services provided through a prohibited referral, it may be required to refund the payments. Violations of the Stark Law may also result in the imposition of damages equal to three times the amount improperly claimed and civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per prohibited claim and $100,000 per prohibited circumvention scheme and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. For the purposes of the Stark Law, the term “designated health services” is defined to include: 

• | clinical laboratory services;


• | physical therapy services;


• | occupational therapy services;


• | radiology services, including magnetic resonance imaging, computerized axial tomography scan and ultrasound services;


• | radiation therapy services and supplies;


• | durable medical equipment and supplies;


• | parenteral and enteral nutrients, equipment and supplies;


• | prosthetics, orthotics and prosthetic devices and supplies;


• | home health services;


• | outpatient prescription drugs; and


• | inpatient and outpatient hospital services.

The list of designated health services does not, however, include surgical services that are provided in ASCs. Furthermore, in final Stark Law regulations published by HHS on January 4, 2001, the term “designated health services” was specifically defined to not include services that are reimbursed by Medicare as part of a composite rate, such as services that are provided in ASCs. However, if designated health services are provided by an ASC and separately billed, referrals to the ASC by a physician-investor would be prohibited by the Stark Law. Because our facilities that are licensed as ASCs do not have independent laboratories and do not provide designated health services apart from surgical services, we do not believe referrals to these facilities by physician-investors are prohibited. If legislation or regulations are implemented that prohibit physicians from referring patients to surgical facilities in which the physician has a beneficial interest, our business and financial results would be materially adversely affected. 
Five of our facilities are licensed as hospitals as of December 31, 2016. The Stark Law currently includes the Whole Hospital Exception, which applies to physician ownership of a hospital, provided such ownership is in the whole hospital and the physician is authorized to perform services at the hospital. We believe that physician investments in our facilities licensed as hospitals meet this requirement. However, changes to the Whole Hospital Exception have been the subject of recent regulatory action and legislation. Changes in the Affordable Care Act include: 

• | a prohibition on hospitals from having any physician ownership unless the hospital already had physician ownership and a Medicare provider agreement in effect as of December 31, 2010;


• | a limitation on the percentage of total physician ownership or investment interests in the hospital or entity whose assets include the hospital to the percentage of physician ownership or investment as of March 23, 2010;


• | a prohibition from expanding the number of beds, operating rooms, and procedure rooms for which it is licensed after March 23, 2010, unless the hospital obtains an exception from the Secretary;


• | a requirement that return on investment be proportionate to the investment by each investor;


• | restrictions on preferential treatment of physician versus non-physician investors;


• | a requirement for written disclosures of physician ownership interests to the hospital’s patients and on the hospital’s website and in any advertising, along with annual reports to the government detailing such interests;


• | a prohibition on the hospital or other investors from providing financing to physician investors;


• | a requirement that any hospital that does not have 24/7 physician coverage inform patients of this fact and receive signed acknowledgments from the patients of the disclosure; and


• | a prohibition on “grandfathered” status for any physician owned hospital that converted from an ASC to a hospital on or after March 23, 2010.

The Affordable Care Act also requires that each hospital with physician ownership submit an annual report of ownership and/or investment interest. Our hospitals have submitted their first reports. CMS has delayed the collection of the second report and publication of the first annual report. We cannot predict whether other proposed amendments to the Whole Hospital Exception will be included in any future legislation, including a repeal of the Affordable Care Act, or if Congress will adopt any similar provisions that would prohibit or otherwise restrict physicians from holding ownership interests in hospitals. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. 
In addition to the physician ownership in our surgical facilities, we have other financial relationships with potential referral sources that potentially could be scrutinized under the Stark Law. We have entered into personal service agreements, such as medical director 
 17

agreements, with physicians at our hospitals. We believe that our agreements with referral sources satisfy the requirements of the personal service arrangements exception to the Stark Law and have implemented formal compliance programs designed to ensure continued compliance. However, we cannot assure you that the OIG or CMS would find our compliance programs to be adequate or that our agreements with referral sources would be found to comply with the Stark Law. 
False and Other Improper Claims 
The U.S. government is authorized to impose criminal, civil and administrative penalties on any person or entity that files a false claim for payment from the Medicare or Medicaid programs or other federal and state healthcare programs. Claims filed with private insurers can also lead to criminal and civil penalties, including, but not limited to, penalties relating to violations of federal mail and wire fraud statutes, as well as penalties under the anti-fraud provisions of HIPAA. While the criminal statutes are generally reserved for instances of fraudulent intent, the U.S. government is applying its criminal, civil and administrative penalty statutes in an ever-expanding range of circumstances. For example, the U.S. government has taken the position that a pattern of claiming reimbursement for unnecessary services violates these statutes if the claimant merely should have known the services were unnecessary, even if the government cannot demonstrate actual knowledge. The U.S. government has also taken the position that claiming payment for low-quality services is a violation of these statutes if the claimant should have known that the care being provided was substandard. 
Over the past several years, the U.S. government has investigated an increasing number of healthcare providers for potential violations of the federal False Claims Act. The federal False Claims Act prohibits a person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government. The statute defines “knowingly” to include not only actual knowledge of a claim’s falsity, but also reckless disregard for or intentional ignorance of the truth or falsity of a claim. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 further expanded the scope of the False Claims Act by, among other things, creating liability for knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. The Affordable Care Act also created federal False Claims Act liability for the knowing failure to report and return an overpayment within 60 days of the identification of the overpayment or the date by which a corresponding cost report is due, whichever is later. This requirement has led to an increasing use of the self-disclosure protocols that have been implemented by CMS, the OIG and other governmental agencies by the healthcare industry. The Affordable Care Act also provided that claims submitted in connection with patient referrals that result from violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitute false claims for the purposes of the federal False Claims Act, and some courts have held that a violation of the Stark Law can result in False Claims Act liability as well. Because our surgical facilities perform hundreds of similar procedures a year for which they are paid by Medicare and other government health care programs, and there is a relatively long statute of limitations, a billing error or cost reporting error could result in significant civil or criminal penalties. 
Under the qui tam, or whistleblower, provisions of the False Claims Act, private parties may bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government. These private parties, often referred to as relators, are entitled to share in any amounts recovered by the government through trial or settlement. Both whistleblower lawsuits and direct enforcement activity by the government have increased significantly in recent years and have increased the risk that a healthcare company, like us, will have to defend a false claims action, pay fines or be excluded from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and other federal and state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation resulting from a whistleblower case. Although we believe that our operations materially comply with both federal and state laws, they may nevertheless be the subject of a whistleblower lawsuit or may otherwise be challenged or scrutinized by governmental authorities. Providers found liable for False Claims Act violations are subject to damages of up to three times the actual damage sustained by the government plus mandatory civil monetary penalties between $5,500 and $11,000 for each separate false claim. A determination that we have violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on us. 
Other Fraud and Abuse Laws 
The Medicare Patient and Program Protection Act of 1987, as amended by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, (“HIPAA”), and the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, impose civil monetary penalties and exclusion from state and federal healthcare programs on providers who commit violations of fraud and abuse laws. HIPAA authorizes the Secretary of the Department of Health & Human Services (“Secretary”), and in some cases requires the Secretary, to exclude individuals and entities that the Secretary determines have “committed an act” in violation of applicable fraud and abuse laws or improperly filed claims in violation of such laws from participating in any federal healthcare program. HIPAA also expanded the Secretary’s authority to exclude a person involved in fraudulent activity from participating in a program providing health benefits, whether directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, by the U.S. government. Additionally, under HIPAA, individuals who hold a direct or indirect ownership or controlling interest in an entity that is found to violate these laws may also be excluded from Medicare and Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs if the individual knew or should have known, or acted with deliberate ignorance or reckless disregard of, the truth or falsity of the information of the activity leading to the conviction or exclusion of the entity, or where the individual is an officer or managing employee of such entity. This standard does not require that specific intent to defraud be proven by OIG. Under HIPAA it is also a crime to defraud any commercial healthcare benefit program. 
Federal and State Privacy and Security Requirements 
On January 16, 2009, CMS published its 10th Edition of International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (“ICD-10”) and related changes to the formats used for certain electronic transactions. ICD-10 contains significantly more diagnostic and procedural codes than the existing ICD-9 coding system, and as a result, the coding for the services provided in our surgical facilities and hospitals require much greater specificity. ICD-10 has required a significant investment in technology and training. We met CMS’s October 1, 2015 deadline for ICD-10 implementation.
We are subject to HIPAA, including The HITECH Act, which was enacted as part of The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The HITECH Act strengthened the requirements and significantly increased the penalties for violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. On January 25, 2013, HHS issued the HIPAA Omnibus Rule, which became effective on March 26, 2013. Prior to the 
 18

HIPAA Omnibus Rule, the HITECH Act required us to notify patients of any unauthorized access, acquisition, or disclosure of their unsecured protected health information that poses significant risk of financial, reputational or other harm to a patient. The HIPAA Omnibus Rule eliminated this harm threshold standard and instead we are now required to notify patients of any unauthorized access, acquisition, or disclosure of their unsecured protected health information in all situations except those in which we can demonstrate that there is a low probability that the protected health information has been compromised. We now have the burden of demonstrating through a risk assessment that a breach of protected health information has not occurred. This new more objective standard may lead to an increased number of occurrences that require breach notifications. In addition, the HIPAA Omnibus Rule also modified the following aspects of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations: 

• | makes our facilities’ business associates directly liable for compliance with certain of HIPAA’s requirements;


• | makes our facilities liable for violations by their business associates if HHS determines an agency relationship exists between the facility and the business associate under federal agency law;


• | adds limitations on the use and disclosure of health information for marketing and fund-raising purposes, and prohibits the sale of protected health information without individual authorization;


• | expands our patients’ rights to receive electronic copies of their health information and to restrict disclosures to a health plan concerning treatment for which our patient has paid out of pocket in full;


• | requires modifications to, and redistribution of, our facilities’ notice of privacy practices;


• | requires modifications to existing agreements with business associates;


• | adopts the additional HITECH Act provisions not previously adopted addressing enforcement of noncompliance with HIPAA due to willful neglect;


• | incorporates the increased and tiered civil money penalty structure provided by the HITECH Act; and


• | revises the HIPAA privacy rule to increase privacy protections for genetic information as required by the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008.

The HIPAA privacy standards apply to individually identifiable information held or disclosed by a covered entity in any form, whether communicated electronically, on paper or orally. These standards impose extensive administrative requirements on us. These standards require our compliance with rules governing the use and disclosure of this health information. They create rights for patients in their health information, such as the right to amend their health information, and they require us to impose these rules, by contract, on any business associate to whom we disclose such information in order to perform functions on our behalf. 
The HIPAA security standards require us to establish and maintain reasonable and appropriate administrative, technical and physical safeguards to ensure the integrity, confidentiality and the availability of electronic protected health and related financial information. Although the security standards do not reference or advocate a specific technology, and covered healthcare providers, plans and clearinghouses have the flexibility to choose their own technical solutions, the security standards have required us to implement significant new systems, business procedures and training programs. 
Violations of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations may result in civil and criminal penalties. The HITECH Act strengthened the requirements of the HIPAA privacy and security regulations and significantly increased the penalties for violations by introducing a tiered penalty system, with penalties of up to $50,000 per violation with a maximum civil penalty of $1.5 million in a calendar year for violations of the same requirement. However, a single breach incident can result in violations of multiple requirements, resulting in possible penalties well in excess of $1.5 million. Under the HITECH Act, HHS is required to conduct periodic compliance audits of covered entities and their business associates. The HITECH Act and the HIPAA Omnibus Rule also extend the application of certain provisions of the security and privacy regulations to business associates and subjects business associates to civil and criminal penalties for violation of the regulations. 
The HITECH Act authorizes State Attorneys General to bring civil actions seeking either an injunction or damages in response to violations of HIPAA privacy and security regulations or the new data breach law that affects the privacy of their state residents. We expect vigorous enforcement of the HITECH Act’s requirements by HHS and State Attorneys General. Additionally, HHS conducted a pilot audit program that concluded December 2012 in the first phase of HHS’ implementation of the HITECH Act’s requirements of periodic audits of covered entities and business associates to ensure their compliance with the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. HHS has allocated increased funding towards HIPAA enforcement activity and such enforcement activity has seen a marked increase over recent years. We cannot predict whether our surgical facilities will be able to comply with the final rules and the financial impact to our surgical facilities in implementing the requirements under the final rules when they take effect, or whether our hospitals will be selected for an audit, or the results of such an audit. 
Our facilities also remain subject to any state laws that relate to privacy or the reporting of data breaches that are more restrictive than the regulations issued under HIPAA and the requirements of the HITECH Act. For example, various state laws and regulations may require us to notify affected individuals in the event of a data breach involving certain personal information, such as social security numbers, dates of birth and credit card information. 
Adoption of Electronic Health Records 
The HITECH Act includes provisions designed to increase the use of EHR by both physicians and hospitals. Beginning in 2011 and extending through 2016, eligible hospitals may receive incentive payments based upon successfully demonstrating meaningful use of its certified EHR technology. Beginning in 2015, those hospitals that do not successfully demonstrate meaningful use of EHR technology are subject to reduced payments from Medicare. EHR meaningful use objectives and measures that hospitals and physicians must meet in order to qualify for incentive payments will be implemented in three stages. Stage 1 has been in effect since 2011 and Stage 2 took effect for 
 19

hospitals beginning in fiscal year 2014. On October 16, 2015, CMS published a final rule that consolidated Stage 1 and Stage 2 into a “Modified Stage 2” effective as of 2015 and set out requirements for Stage 3, which is set to take full effect in 2018. In connection with the acquisition of Symbion, we acquired six surgical facilities that are licensed as hospitals, five of which we own as of December 31, 2016. These hospitals began the implementation of EHR initiatives in 2012. We strive to comply with the EHR meaningful use requirements of the HITECH Act so as to qualify for incentive payments. Continued implementation of EHR and compliance with the HITECH Act will result in significant costs. We recorded income from electronic health record incentives of $408,000, $1.8 million and $3.4 million which was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We incurred negligible costs for hardware, software and implementation expenses during the same periods. 
HIPAA Administrative Simplification Requirements 
The HIPAA transaction regulations were issued to encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry. These regulations include standards that healthcare providers must follow when electronically transmitting certain healthcare transactions, such as healthcare claims.
Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act 
Our hospitals are subject to the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act (“EMTALA”). This federal law requires any hospital that participates in the Medicare program to conduct an appropriate medical screening examination of every person who presents to the hospital’s emergency department for treatment and, if the patient is suffering from an emergency medical condition, to either stabilize that condition or make an appropriate transfer of the patient to a facility that can handle the condition. The obligation to screen and stabilize emergency medical conditions or transfer exists regardless of a patient’s ability to pay for treatment. Off-campus facilities such as surgery centers that lack emergency departments or otherwise do not treat emergency medical conditions generally are not subject to EMTALA. They must, however, have policies in place that explain how the location should proceed in an emergency situation, such as transferring the patient to the closest hospital with an emergency department. There are severe penalties under EMTALA if a hospital fails to screen or appropriately stabilize or transfer a patient or if the hospital delays appropriate treatment in order to first inquire about the patient’s ability to pay, including civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in the government health care programs. In addition, an injured patient, the patient’s family or a medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of another hospital’s violation of the law can bring a civil suit against that other hospital. CMS has actively enforced EMTALA and has indicated that it will continue to do so in the future. Although we believe that our hospitals comply with EMTALA, we cannot predict whether CMS will implement new requirements in the future and, if so, whether our hospitals will comply with any new requirements. 
State Regulation 
Many of the states in which our surgical facilities operate have adopted statutes and/or regulations that prohibit the payment of kickbacks or any type of remuneration in exchange for patient referrals and that prohibit healthcare providers from, in certain circumstances, referring a patient to a healthcare facility in which the provider has an ownership or investment interest. While these statutes generally mirror the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and Stark Law, they vary widely in their scope and application. Some are specifically limited to healthcare services that are paid for in whole or in part by the Medicaid program; others apply to all healthcare services regardless of payor; and others apply only to state-defined designated services, which may differ from the designated health services under the Stark Law. In addition, many states have adopted statutes that mirror the False Claims Act and that prohibit the filing of a false or fraudulent claim with a state governmental agency. We intend to comply with all applicable state healthcare laws, rules and regulations. However, these laws, rules and regulations have typically been the subject of limited judicial and regulatory interpretation. As a result, we cannot assure you that our surgical facilities will not be investigated or scrutinized by the governmental authorities empowered to do so or, if challenged, that their activities would be found to be lawful. A determination of non-compliance with the applicable state healthcare laws, rules, and regulations could subject our surgical facilities to civil and criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
We are also subject to various state insurance statutes and regulations that prohibit us from submitting inaccurate, incorrect or misleading claims. Many state insurance laws and regulations are broadly worded and could be implicated, for example, if our surgical facilities were to adjust an out-of-network co-payment or other patient responsibility amounts without fully disclosing the adjustment on the claim submitted to the payor. While some of our surgical facilities adjust the out-of-network costs of patient co-payment and deductible amounts to reflect in-network co-payment costs when providing services to patients whose health insurance is covered by a payor with which the surgical facilities are not contracted, our policy is to fully disclose adjustments in the claims submitted to the payors. We believe that our surgical facilities are in compliance with all applicable state insurance laws and regulations regarding the submission of claims. We cannot assure you, however, that none of our surgical facilities’ insurance claims will ever be challenged. If we were found to be in violation of a state’s insurance laws or regulations, we could be forced to discontinue the violative practice, which could have an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations, and we could be subject to fines and criminal penalties. 
Fee Splitting; Corporate Practice of Medicine 
The laws of many states prohibit physicians from splitting fees with non-physicians (i.e., sharing in a percentage of professional fees), prohibit non-physician entities (such as us) from practicing medicine and exercising control over or employing physicians and prohibit referrals to facilities in which physicians have a financial interest. The existence, interpretation and enforcement of these laws vary significantly from state to state. In light of these restrictions, in certain states we facilitate the provision of physician services by maintaining long-term management services agreements through our subsidiaries with affiliated professional contractors, which employ or contract with physicians and other healthcare professionals to provide physician professional services. Under these arrangements, our subsidiaries perform only non-medical administrative services, do not represent that they offer medical services and do not exercise influence or control over the practice of medicine by the physicians employed by the affiliated professional contractors. Although we believe that the fees we receive from affiliated professional contractors have been structured in a manner that is compliant with applicable fee-splitting laws, it is possible that a government regulator could interpret such fee arrangements to be in violation of certain fee-splitting laws. Future interpretations of, or changes in, these laws might require structural and organizational modifications of our existing relationships, and we cannot assure you that

we would be able to appropriately modify such relationships. In addition, statutes in some states could restrict our expansion into those states. 
Clinical Laboratory Regulation 
Our clinical laboratories are subject to federal oversight under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (“CLIA”) which extends federal oversight to virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring that they be certified by the federal government or by a federally-approved accreditation agency. CLIA requires that all clinical laboratories meet quality assurance, quality control and personnel standards. Laboratories also must undergo proficiency testing and are subject to inspections. Standards for testing under CLIA are based on the complexity of the tests performed by the laboratory, with tests classified as “high complexity,” “moderate complexity,” or “waived.” Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than moderate complexity laboratories. Laboratories performing only waived tests, which are tests determined by the Food and Drug Administration to have a low potential for error and requiring little oversight, may apply for a certificate of waiver exempting them from most of the requirements of CLIA. Our operations also subject to state and local laboratory regulation. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations different from or more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls, or require maintenance of certain records. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laboratory requirements, but no assurances can be given that our laboratories will pass all future licensure or certification inspections. 
Regulatory Compliance Program 
It is our policy to conduct our business with integrity and in compliance with the law. We have in place and continue to enhance a company-wide compliance program that focuses on all areas of regulatory compliance including billing, reimbursement, cost reporting practices and contractual arrangements with referral sources. 
This regulatory compliance program is intended to help ensure that high standards of conduct are maintained in the operation of our business and that policies and procedures are implemented so that employees act in full compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and company policies. Under the regulatory compliance program, every employee and certain contractors involved in patient care, and coding and billing, receive initial and periodic legal compliance and ethics training. In addition, we regularly monitor our ongoing compliance efforts and develop and implement policies and procedures designed to foster compliance with the law. The program also includes a mechanism for employees to report, without fear of retaliation, any suspected legal or ethical violations to their supervisors, designated compliance officers in our facilities, our compliance hotline or directly to our corporate compliance office. We believe our compliance program is consistent with standard industry practices. However, we cannot provide any assurances that our compliance program will detect all violations of law or protect against qui tam suits or government enforcement actions.
