Overview
 
GeoVax is a clinical-stage biotechnology company developing immunotherapies and vaccines against cancers and infectious diseases using a novel vector vaccine platform (Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Virus Like Particle or “GV-MVA-VLP™”). During January 2020, we began a program to develop a vaccine for prevention of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) infection. That effort has resulted in four COVID-19 vaccine candidates. These COVID-19 vaccine candidates have been designed and constructed and are being tested using relevant experimental animal challenge models. Additional development programs are focused on preventive vaccines against hemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebola, Sudan, Marburg, and Lassa fever), Zika virus and malaria; preventive and therapeutic vaccines against Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV); as well as immunotherapies for solid tumor cancers.
 
For our infectious disease vaccines, our recombinant MVA vector expresses target proteins on highly immunogenic VLPs (Virus-Like Particles) in the person being vaccinated, with the intended result of producing durable immune responses with the safety characteristics of the replication deficient MVA vector and cost-effective manufacturing.
 
In cancer immunotherapy, we believe that stimulating the immune system to treat cancers is a compelling concept and that the opportunity for immune-activating technologies is promising, especially in light of advancements such as checkpoint inhibitors leading the way in oncology. Despite drug approvals in limited indications and promising results in clinical trials, there remains a significant need and opportunity for further advancements. We believe our GV-MVA-VLP™ platform is well-suited for delivery of tumor-associated antigens and we plan to pursue development of our platform in this space.
 
Our most advanced vaccine program is focused on prevention of the clade B subtype of HIV prevalent in the regions of the Americas, Western Europe, Japan and Australia; our HIV vaccine candidate, GOVX-B11, will be included in an upcoming clinical trial (HVTN 132) managed by the HIV Vaccine Clinical Trials Network (HVTN) with support from the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which we expect may begin in late 2021. Additionally, during August 2020 a consortium led by researchers at the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) began a clinical trial using our vaccine as part of a combinational therapy to induce remission in HIV-positive individuals. Through the efforts of our collaborator, American Gene Technologies International, Inc. (AGT), we expect that our HIV vaccine will also enter clinical trials during 2021 in combination with AGT’s gene therapy technology to seek a functional cure for HIV.
 
Our other vaccine and immunotherapy programs are at various other stages of development as described below.

Our corporate strategy is to advance, protect and exploit our differentiated vaccine/immunotherapy platform leading to the successful development of preventive and therapeutic vaccines against infectious diseases and various cancers. With our design and development capabilities, we are progressing and validating an array of cancer and infectious disease immunotherapy and vaccine product candidates. Our goal is to advance products through regulatory registration and commercialization while maintaining consideration of collaborations and partnering that will maximize the financial value return to our stockholders. We also seek to leverage third party resources through collaborations and partnerships for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as strategic supply chain relationships with various government, academic and industry entities to ensure and achieve the highest level of expertise and quality in support of our developments.
 
Our current and recent collaborators and partners include the NIAID/NIH, U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), U.S. Army Research Institute of Infectious Disease (USAMRIID), U.S. Naval Research Laboratory (USNRL), Emory University, University of Pittsburgh, Georgia State University Research Foundation (GSURF), University of Texas Medical Branch (UTMB), the Institute of Human Virology (IHV) at the University of Maryland, the Scripps Research Institute (Scripps), Burnet Institute in Australia, the Geneva Foundation, American Gene Technologies International, Inc. (AGT), ViaMune, Inc., Leidos, Inc., University of California San Francisco (UCSF), the HIV Vaccines Trial Network (HVTN), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),
 
Our Differentiated Vaccine and Immunotherapy Platform
 
Vaccines typically contain agents (antigens) that resemble disease-causing microorganisms. Traditional vaccines are often made from weakened or killed forms of the virus or from its surface proteins. Some newer vaccines use recombinant DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) technology to generate vaccine antigens in bacteria or cultured cells from specific portions of the DNA sequence of the target pathogen. The generated antigens are then purified and formulated for use in a vaccine. We believe the most successful of these purified antigens have been non-infectious virus-like particles (VLPs) as exemplified by vaccines for hepatitis B (Merck’s Recombivax® and GSK’s Engerix®) and Papilloma viruses (GSK’s Cervarix®, and Merck’s Gardasil®). Our approach uses recombinant DNA and/or recombinant MVA to produce VLPs in the person being vaccinated (in vivo) reducing complexity and costs of manufacturing. In human clinical trials of our HIV vaccines, we believe we have demonstrated that our VLPs, expressed from within the cells of the person being vaccinated, can be safe, yet elicit both strong and durable humoral and cellular immune response.
 
VLPs mimic authentic viruses in form but are not infectious or capable of replicating and can cause the body’s immune system to recognize and kill targeted viruses to prevent an infection. VLPs can also train the immune system to recognize and kill virus-infected cells to control infection and reduce the length and severity of disease. One of the biggest challenges with VLP-based vaccines is to design the vaccines in such a way that the VLPs will be recognized by the immune system in the same way as the authentic virus would be. We design our vaccines such that, when VLPs for enveloped viruses like HIV, Ebola, Marburg or Lassa fever are produced in vivo (in the cells of the recipient), they include not only the protein antigens, but also an envelope consisting of membranes from the vaccinated individual’s cells. In this way, they are highly similar to the virus generated in a person’s body during a natural infection. VLPs produced in vitro (in a pharmaceutical plant), by contrast, have no envelope; or, envelopes from the cultured cells (typically hamster or insect cells) used to produce them. We believe our technology therefore provides distinct advantages by producing VLPs that more closely resemble the authentic viruses. We believe this feature of our immunogens allows the body’s immune system to more readily recognize the virus. By producing VLPs in vivo, we believe we also avoid potential purification issues associated with in vitro production of VLPs.

Figure 1 below shows examples of thin section electron micrographs of actual viruses and VLPs for these viruses expressed by GeoVax MVA-VLP vaccines.
 

Figure 1. Comparison of MVA-VLPs and native virus structures
 
In the MVA-VLP platform, we take advantage of MVA’s large “coding capacity” to insert genes that encode multiple proteins, the combination of which is adequate to support the generation of VLPs by the MVA infected cells. Utility has been demonstrated for multiple vaccine candidates wherein the MVA-encoded viral matrix proteins and glycoproteins assemble into VLPs. MVA was originally developed as a safer smallpox vaccine for use in immune-compromised individuals. It was developed by attenuating the standard smallpox vaccine by passaging it (over 500 passages) in chicken embryos or chicken embryo fibroblasts, resulting in a virus with limited ability to replicate in human cells (thus safe) but with high replication capability in avian cells (thus cost effective for manufacturing). The deletions also resulted in the loss of immune evasion genes which assist the spread of wild type smallpox infections, even in the presence of human immune responses.
 
We collaborated with the laboratory of Dr. Bernard Moss at NIH/NIAID on four different generations of MVA vectors, spanning over 15 years of collaboration, to effectively express vaccine proteins that assemble into VLPs. These efforts led to the development of different shuttle vectors and the identification of multiple insertion sites for introducing foreign genes encoding the vaccine target proteins into MVA in a manner that optimizes each product for manufacturing stability. Each MVA-VLP vaccine has up to two expression cassettes, each encoding one or more antigens selected from pathogens of interest. At a minimum, each vaccine expresses two antigens required for VLP formation; in the case of HIV and hemorrhagic fever vaccines for example, a viral matrix protein and an envelope glycoprotein. We use a synthetic early late promoter that provides high, yet not lethal, levels of insert expression, which is initiated immediately after infection in cells of the vaccinated individual.
 
Our GV-MVA-VLP™ vaccine platform affords other advantages:
 

● | Safety: Our HIV vaccines have demonstrated outstanding safety in multiple human clinical trials. Safety for MVA, generally, has been shown in more than 120,000 subjects in Europe, including immunocompromised individuals during the initial development of MVA and more recently with the development of MVA as a safer vaccine against smallpox.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Durability: Our technology raises highly durable (long-lasting) vaccine responses, the most durable in the field of vectored HIV vaccines. We hypothesize that elicitation of durable vaccine responses is conferred on responding B cells by the vaccinia parent of MVA, which raises highly durable responses for smallpox.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Limited pre-existing immunity to vector: Following the eradication of smallpox in 1980, smallpox vaccinations subsequently ended, leaving all but those born before 1980 and selected populations (such as vaccinated laboratory workers and first responders) unvaccinated and without pre-existing immunity to MVA-derived vaccines. A potential interference of pre-existing immunity to a vector may be more problematic with those vectors related to parent viruses used in routine vaccinations (e.g. measles) or constitute common viruses that infect people of all ages (e.g. cytomegalovirus).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Repeated use of the platform for different vaccines used in sequence. In mouse experiments, we have shown that two of our vaccines (e.g. GV-MVA-VLP-Zika followed by GV-MVA-VLP-Ebola) can be given at <4 week intervals without any negative impact on their immunogenicity (lack of vector immunity).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | No need for adjuvants: MVA generally stimulates strong innate immune responses and does not require the use of adjuvants.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Thermal stability: MVA is stable in both liquid and lyophilized formats (> 6 years of storage).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Genetic stability and manufacturability: If appropriately engineered, MVA is genetically stable and can reliably be manufactured in either the established Chick Embryo Fibroblast cell substrate, or novel continuous cell lines that support scalability as well as greater process consistency and efficiency.

Our Product Development Pipeline
 
Our primary focus is to advance, independently and in partnerships, the products developed from our GV-MVA-VLP™ platform. We are currently developing a number of vaccines and immunotherapies for prevention or treatment of infectious diseases and cancer. The table below summarizes the status of our product development programs, which are discussed in greater detail in the following pages.

We are seeking to develop a broad product pipeline based on our GV-MVA-VLP™ platform and have been pleased with the results, particularly considering the challenges we have faced in obtaining sufficient capital prior to our underwritten public offering in September 2020, and the related relatively small number of scientifically skilled employees we employ. These constraints have made it necessary to set priorities as to our primary focuses, and those will change as opportunities, resources, and other circumstances dictate. During 2019, for example, in addition to working with our collaborators/sponsors, we chose to focus a portion of our management time and budget in the area of immuno-oncology. More recently, the emergence of novel coronavirus (COVID-19) led us to decide to devote our management time and resources, and our platform, to address this epidemic. At times, some of our development programs are paused as we shift our focus due to our limited resources.
 
Our Cancer Immunotherapy Programs
 
Cancer is the second most common cause of death in the US, exceeded only by heart disease. Its global burden is expected to rise to 22 million new cases per year by 2030. There have been multiple technology advancements and product approvals that have highlighted the potential of immunology approaches to treat cancer. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) such as Herceptin® and dendritic cell therapy Provenge® for prostate cancer have had varying degrees of success. Dendritic or other cell-based therapy is a highly personalized medicine involving removing cells from the patient, modifying and multiplying them, and then returning them to the body. In addition to the high cost and complex processes to manufacture products, this approach has not been shown to generate high levels of cancer-specific T cells.

The field of immuno-oncology has received new momentum with the discovery and initial launch of a form of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), a type of monoclonal antibodies (Mabs). Tumors hijack the body’s natural immune checkpoints by over expressing immune checkpoint ligands (proteins that bind to and activate the inhibitory activity of immune checkpoints), as a mechanism of immune resistance, especially against the T cells that are specific for tumor antigens and can kill cancer cells. ICIs block the interaction of immune checkpoints with their ligands on tumor cells, allowing otherwise poorly functional T cells to resume proliferation, cytokine production and killing of tumor cells.
 
More recently, a new category of immunotherapies called adoptive cell transfer, CAR-T technology for example, has provided further evidence of the merit of providing an enhanced T cell presence to fight cancer. Unfortunately, they have also been associated with significant side effects. Moreover, adoptive cell transfer such as CAR-T, like dendritic cell therapy, involves removing T cells from a patient, modifying them to better target a cancer cell, multiplying the T cells, then returning them to the patient. These complex therapeutic products need to be manufactured and released for each patient, leading to expensive manufacturing and increased supply chain complexity.
 
Unlike conventional therapies (e.g. radiation, chemotherapy, antibody, etc.), therapeutic cancer vaccines have the potential to induce responses that not only result in the control and even clearance of tumors but also establish immunological memory that can suppress and prevent tumor recurrence. Convenience, safety, and low toxicity of cancer vaccines could make them invaluable tools to be included in future immunotherapy approaches for treating tumors. Currently, there are only a few vectored cancer vaccines being tested in combination with ICIs, all of which are in early clinical stages.
 
Collaborations with University of Pittsburgh and ViaMune – We have established a collaboration with Dr. Olivera Finn, a leading expert in cancer immunotherapy at the University of Pittsburgh. Dr. Finn was one of the first to show that many tumors express an abnormal form of cell surface-associated Mucin 1 (MUC1) protein that is recognized by the immune system as foreign. Given this, we are developing our GV-MVA-VLP™ vaccine platform to deliver abnormal forms of MUC1 with the goal of raising therapeutic anti-tumor antibodies and T cell responses in cancer patients. Our collaboration with Dr. Finn has shown that a combination of our MVA-VLP-MUC1 vaccine candidate with a MUC1 synthetic peptide was capable of breaking tolerance to human MUC1 in huMUC1 transgenic mice and inducing immune responses with protective efficacy against challenge in a lymphoma tumor model (experiments were performed at the University of Pittsburgh).
 
We are also collaborating with ViaMune, Inc., which has developed a fully synthetic MUC1 vaccine candidate (MTI). The collaboration will assess each companies’ vaccine platform, separately, and in combination, with the goal of developing a tumor MUC1 vaccine that can produce a broad spectrum of anti-tumor antibody and T cell responses. The resulting MUC1 vaccine could be combined with ICIs as a novel vaccination strategy for cancer patients with advanced MUC1+ tumors. We have produced a MVA-VLP-MUC1 vaccine candidate, demonstrated VLP production by electron microscopy using MUC1 immunogold staining, and showed that the VLPs express a hypo-glycosylated form of MUC1 in human cell lines. Preclinical studies of the combined MTI and MVA-VLP-MUC1 vaccines conducted at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte have shown the combination of our vaccine with MTI and ICI have significantly reduced the tumor burden in a mouse model for colorectal cancer.
 
Collaboration with Emory Vaccine Center – In July 2018, we began collaborating with Emory University on the development of a therapeutic vaccine for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, with a specific focus on head and neck cancer (HNC). This is an important research area as there are currently no medical treatments for chronic HPV infections, which can lead to the formation of cancerous tumors. The GeoVax/Emory collaboration will include testing GeoVax’s MVA-VLP-HPV vaccine candidates in therapeutic animal models of HPV in the laboratory of Dr. Rafi Ahmed, Director of the Emory Vaccine Center. Dr. Ahmed, a member of the National Academy of Sciences, is a world-renowned immunologist whose work during the past decade has been highly influential in shaping understanding of memory T cell differentiation and T and B cell-mediated antiviral immunity. We believe our collaboration with Emory on the HPV project is extremely valuable as it was Dr. Ahmed who first discovered in 2006 that the PD-1 pathway could also be exploited by many pathogens to repress normal T cell function during chronic viral infection. This led to development of numerous blockbuster anti-PD1 antibodies currently being used for treatment of various cancers and which hold promise as adjunctive therapy for several chronic infectious diseases. To increase the therapeutic efficacy of our HPV vaccine, we intend to apply a combination strategy which could include co-administration of anti-PD1 antibodies and/or other newly discovered immunotherapy drugs to improve a patient’s own anti-cancer immune response.
Collaboration with Leidos – In November 2018, we began collaborating with Leidos, Inc. on a research program evaluating the combination of the companies’ respective technologies in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Currently, there are major limitations on cancer immunotherapies which include high costs (limiting patient access, straining both the healthcare system and the patient’s own finances), the need for multiple injections, and significant side effects. Moreover, monotherapy with one checkpoint inhibitor drug can induce drug resistance in some patients making it necessary to combine with other drugs and treatments, which in turn may further increase toxicity. We have shown that our MVA platform can be safe in humans without any major side effects and believe that delivery of the immune checkpoint inhibitors with or without the tumor-associated antigens may overcome some of the challenges associated with the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors in cancers or other chronic infectious diseases. The GeoVax/Leidos collaboration includes the design, construction, and characterization of multiple immunotherapeutic vaccine candidates using our GV-MVA-VLP™ vaccine platform combined with certain novel peptide PD-1 checkpoint inhibitors developed by Leidos. We believe this effort may lead to expanded efforts in cancer immunotherapy, treatments for chronic Hepatitis B infections, or other diseases where an immunological-based therapeutic approach would be beneficial.

Our Infectious Disease Vaccine Programs
 
Our COVID-19 Vaccine Program
 
Coronaviruses are common in many species of animals including mammals, avian and bats. In rare occasions these viruses can evolve to cross the animal species and infect humans and quickly spread from person to person resulting in lethal respiratory infections. Recent epidemic with SARS and MERS coronaviruses resulted in 774 and 858 deaths, respectively. In January 2020, WHO identified a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2 (or COVID-19), in the city of Wuhan, China. On January 31, World Health Organization (WHO) declared the novel coronavirus to be a global health emergency, and on March 11, 2020 WHO declared a global pandemic. As of late March, 2021, more than 120 million people worldwide have been infected and nearly 2.7 million people have died as a result of COVID-19 infections. The situation is fluid, with the infection and death statistics changing significantly on a regular basis.
 
During January 2020, we initiated vaccine development for prevention and/or control of COVID-2019 infection. Using our GV-MVA-VLP™ vaccine platform and expertise, multiple COVID-19 vaccine candidates have been designed and constructed, and are being tested in animal challenge models. Preclinical small animal studies are currently being conducted in collaboration with researchers at the University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston. (UTMB) and at BioQual, Inc.
 
In January 2021, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), awarded the Company a Small Business Innovative Research (SBIR) grant in support of our development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The Phase 1 grant, titled, “Preclinical Development of GV-MVA-VLP Vaccines Against COVID-19,” will support the ongoing design, construction and preclinical testing of our vaccine candidates in preparation for human clinical trials. The efficacy testing will be performed in collaboration with UTMB.
 
There are currently three COVID-19 vaccines approved by the FDA for use in the United States. These first generation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are based on the ‘Spike (S)’ protein and are designed to induce antibodies that block infection of human cells, an effect referred to as virus neutralization. The GV-MVA-VLP platform provides the opportunity to design and test vaccine candidates that differ significantly through the inclusion of multiple SARS-CoV-2 proteins that are presented to the immune system as VLPs. Unique among other vaccines approved or under development, the experimental GeoVax candidates are therefore specifically designed to provide a broader and more long-lived level of protective immunity against SARS-CoV-2 which should protect against emerging variants while avoiding the potential side effects that can limit vaccine utility and acceptance.
 
Our HIV/AIDS Vaccine Programs
 
About HIV/AIDS. An estimated 37 million people are living with HIV worldwide, with approximately 1.8 million newly infected annually. Since the beginning of the epidemic, more than 70 million people have been infected with the HIV virus and about 35 million have died of HIV. The United States currently has an estimated 1.1 million HIV-infected individuals, with approximately 40,000 new infections per year. Gay and bisexual men bear the greatest burden by risk group, representing nearly 70% of new infections in the U.S. African-Americans also bear a disproportionate burden, representing 43% of people living with HIV, yet representing just 12% of the total population.
 
There are several AIDS-causing HIV virus subtypes, or clades, that are found in different regions of the world. These clades are identified as clades A, B, C and so on. The predominant clade found in Europe, North America, parts of South America, Japan and Australia is clade B, whereas the predominant clades in Africa are clades A and C. In India, the predominant clade is clade C. Genetic differences between the clades may mean that vaccines or treatments developed against HIV of one clade may only be partially effective or ineffective against HIV of other clades. Thus, there is often a geographical focus to designing and developing HIV vaccines.

At present, the standard approach to treating HIV infection is to inhibit viral replication through the use of combinations of drugs – antiretroviral therapies (ART). Available drugs include reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, integration inhibitors and inhibitors of cell entry. However, HIV is prone to genetic changes that can produce strains that are resistant to currently approved drugs. When HIV acquires resistance to one drug within a class, it can often become resistant to the entire class, meaning that it may be impossible to re-establish control of a genetically altered strain by substituting different drugs in the same class. Furthermore, these treatments continue to have significant limitations which include toxicity, patient non-adherence to the treatment regimens and cost. Thus, over time, viruses acquire drug-resistant mutations, and many patients develop intolerance to the medications or simply give up taking the medications due to cost, inconvenience or side effects.
 
There is no approved vaccine to prevent HIV infection. Prevention of HIV infection remains a worldwide unmet medical need, even in the United States and other first world countries where effective antiretroviral therapies are available. ART do not eliminate HIV infection, requiring individuals to remain on such drugs for their entire lives. Uptake and successful long-term adherence to therapy is also limited. Only 30% of those infected with HIV in the US ultimately remain in HIV care with their viral load sufficiently suppressed to prevent spread of HIV. Furthermore, the financial burden to the U.S. taxpayer for HIV education, prevention, and treatment costs is borne through multiple federal agencies, totaling over $25 billion annually.
 
According to the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative (IAVI), the cost and complexity of new treatment advances for HIV/AIDS puts them out of reach for most people in the countries where treatment is most needed. In industrialized nations, where drugs are more readily available, side effects and increased rates of viral resistance have raised concerns about their long-term use. Vaccines are seen by many as the most promising way to end the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We expect that vaccines, once developed, will be used universally and administered worldwide by organizations that provide healthcare services, including hospitals, medical clinics, the military, prisons and schools.
 
Our Preventive HIV Vaccine Program 
 
Clade B Preventive HIV Vaccine Program. Our most clinically advanced vaccine is GOVX-B11, designed to protect against the clade B subtype of the HIV virus prevalent in the Americas, Western Europe, Japan and Australia. GOVX-B11 consists of a recombinant DNA vaccine used to prime immune responses and a recombinant MVA vaccine (MVA62B) used to boost the primed responses. Both the DNA and MVA vaccines induce the production of non-infectious VLPs by the cells of the vaccinated person.
 
Phase 1 and Phase 2a human clinical trials of GOVX-B11 were conducted by the HVTN. The HVTN is the largest worldwide clinical trials network dedicated to the development and testing of HIV/AIDS vaccines. Support for the HVTN comes from the NIAID, part of the NIH. The HVTN’s HIV Vaccine Trial Units are located at leading research institutions in 27 cities on four continents. In these trials, totaling approximately 500 participants, GOVX-B11 was tested at various doses and regimens. The vaccine was demonstrated to be safe, well-tolerated and immunogenic, inducing both antibody and cellular immune responses.
 
In January 2017 HVTN began the next human clinical trial (HVTN 114) in the path toward pivotal efficacy trials. HVTN 114 enrolled individuals who previously participated in the HVTN 205 Phase 2a trial of the GOVX-B11 vaccine, which concluded in 2012. HVTN 114 tested the ability of late booster vaccines (additional vaccinations) to increase the antibody responses elicited by the GOVX B11 vaccine regimen. These “late booster vaccines” consisted of the GeoVax MVA62B vaccine with or without a recombinantly produced HIV envelope glycoprotein (gp120) protein vaccine. The gp120 protein, AIDSVAX® B/E, is the same protein used to boost immune responses in the partially protective RV144 trial completed in Thailand and publicly reported in 2009. Participants in HVTN 114 received either (a) a MVA62B booster, (b) a combined booster of MVA62B and AIDSVAX® B/E, or (c) AIDSVAX® B/E alone. HVTN 114 was completed during 2018 and results were presented during the HIV Research for Prevention (HIVR4P) conference in Madrid, Spain in October 2018. The study demonstrated the most effective booster vaccine to be the combination of MVA62B live vector and AIDSVAX B/E proteins, which increased titers of antibodies to the HIV envelope gp120 by more than 600-fold.
 
Following completion of HVTN 114, the HVTN is moving forward with plans for an additional Phase 1 trial, designated HVTN 132, which will be a multi-center, randomized, double-blind trial, enrolling up to 70 healthy adults. The primary objectives of HVTN 132 will be to further assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity (elicited antibody responses) of a prime-boost regimen of GOVX-B11, in combination with gp120 booster vaccines. The protein booster vaccines are being tested for their ability to enhance the antibody response elicited by GOVX-B11 to gp120. The gp120 proteins to be evaluated in the trial were developed by Duke University and by the Institute of Human Virology of the University of Maryland School of Medicine. HVTN 132 will be conducted by the HVTN with support from NIAID and is expected to commence patient enrollment in late 2021.
 
Clade C Preventive HIV Vaccine Program. We also are developing DNA/MVA vaccines designed for use against the clade C subtype of HIV that predominates in South Africa and India. NIAID has previously awarded GeoVax SBIR grants in support of this effort, but further development of these vaccines will be dependent upon additional funding support.

Our HIV Immunotherapy Program – Seeking a Cure
 
Finding a cure for HIV/AIDS remains an elusive goal. Current ART, though highly effective at suppressing HIV viral load, are unable to eliminate latent forms of HIV that are invisible to the immune system and inaccessible to antiretroviral drugs. Long-term use of ART can lead to loss of drug effectiveness and can come with severe, debilitating side effects. The lifetime medical costs saved by preventing (or curing) a single HIV infection in the U.S. are estimated to approach $400,000. Therefore, any new treatment regimen that allows patients to reduce, modify, or discontinue their antiretroviral therapy could offer measurable quality of life benefits to the patient and tremendous value to the marketplace.
 
Collaboration with AGT – In March 2017, we entered into collaboration with American Gene Technologies International, Inc. (AGT) whereby AGT intends to conduct a Phase 1 human clinical trial with our combined technologies, with the ultimate goal of developing a functional cure for HIV infection. In the AGT trial, the GeoVax vaccine will be used to stimulate virus specific CD4+ T cells in vivo, which will then be harvested from the patient, genetically modified ex vivo using AGT’s technology, and reinfused to the patient. The primary objectives of the trial will be to assess the safety of the therapy, with secondary objectives to assess the immune responses as a measure of efficacy. In a previous Phase 1 clinical trial (GV-TH-01), we demonstrated that our vaccine can stimulate production of CD4+ T cells in HIV infected patients– the intended use of the GV-MVA-VLP™ HIV vaccine in the AGT study. AGT began patient enrollment for their Phase 1 in September 2020. We expect our vaccine to be added to the AGT trial in 2021.
 
Collaboration with UCSF – In November 2019, we entered into an agreement with the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), whereby we will participate in a collaborative effort led by researchers at UCSF to develop a combinational therapy aimed at inducing remission in HIV-positive individuals (a “functional cure”). The studies will be conducted with funding from amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research. The proposed clinical trial will enroll 20 HIV-infected adults who are on stable and effective ART. The therapeutic regimen to be tested involves a combination of vaccines, drugs and biologics. GeoVax will provide the MVA62B vaccine for use in the studies. The primary objectives of the trial will be to assess the safety and tolerability of the combinational therapy and to determine the viral load “set-point” during ART interruption. Secondary objectives will be to assess immune responses and changes in viral reservoir status. Patient enrollment for the clinical trial commenced in August 2020.
 
Our Filovirus (Ebola, Sudan, Marburg) Vaccine Program
 
Ebola (EBOV, formerly designated as Zaire ebolavirus), Sudan (SUDV), and Marburg viruses (MARV) are the most virulent species of the Filoviridae family. They can cause up to a 90% fatality rate in humans and are epizootic in Central and West Africa with 29 outbreaks since 1976. The most severe Ebola outbreak (2013-16 in Western Africa) caused 28,616 cases and 11,310 deaths (case fatality rate of 40%). During 2018-20, an outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo caused 3,470 cases and 2,280 deaths (66% fatality rate). Additional outbreaks are certain in future due to indigenous reservoirs of the virus (e.g. fruit bats), the zoonotic nature of the virus, weak local infrastructure for healthcare systems, high population mobility, political unrest, cultural beliefs and burial practices, and for those not at natural risk, the risk of intentional release by a bioterrorist.
 
We believe an ideal vaccine against major filoviruses must activate both humoral and cellular arms of the immune system. It should include the induction of antibodies to slow the initial rate of infection and a cellular immune response to help clear the infection. Moreover, it should address strain variations by providing broad coverage against potential epizootic filovirus strains, and it should be safe not only in healthy individuals (e.g. travelers or health care workers), but also in immunocompromised persons (e.g., HIV infected) and those with other underlying health concerns.
 
In December 2019, FDA approved the first live recombinant Ebola vaccine for prevention of Ebola disease by Zaire virus. This rVSV-ZEBOV showed safety concerns in Phase 1 trials and by virtue of being replication competent could pose threats to immunocompromised individuals, such as those infected with HIV living in West Africa where recent Ebola epidemics started. The less advanced adeno-vectored vaccine candidates require relatively cumbersome heterologous prime/boost regimens, for example with MVA, to elicit durable protective immunity. The use of Ad5 vectors also has been associated with concerns over increased susceptibility to HIV infection in areas with high HIV incidence. Even with rVSV-ZEBOV showing promise in the 2013-2015 epidemic, the world would benefit by being prepared with a safer and effective vaccine, to prevent or alleviate the effects of the current and future epidemics.

To address the unmet need for a product that can respond to future filovirus epidemics we are developing innovative vaccines utilizing our GV-MVA-VLP™ platform. We are addressing strain variations, and induction of broad humoral and cellular response through development of monovalent vaccines, which we may also investigate blending together as a single vaccine to provide broad coverage, potentially with a single dose. The MVA vector itself is considered safe, having originally been developed for use in immunocompromised individuals as a smallpox vaccine. We expect our vaccines to not only protect at-risk individuals against EBOV, SUDV and MARV, but also potentially reduce or modify the severity of other re-emerging filovirus pathogens such as Bundibugyo, Ivory Coast, and Reston viruses, based on antigenic cross reactivity and the elicitation of T cells to the more conserved matrix proteins (e.g. VP40 or Z) in addition to standard GP proteins used by us and other manufacturers. Thus, the GeoVax GV-MVA-VLP™ approach could offer a unique combination of advantages to achieve breadth and safety of a pan-filo vaccine. In addition to protecting people in Africa, it is intended to prevent the spread of disease to the US, and for preparedness against terrorist release of any of bio-threat pathogens.
 
Our initial preclinical studies in rodents and nonhuman primates for our EBOV vaccine candidate have shown 100% protection against a lethal dose of EBOV upon a single immunization. These studies were conducted with support from NIAID and USAMRIID. We have also designed and constructed vaccine candidates for SUDV and MARV. In an independent, peer-reviewed paper published by Lazaro Frias et al (J Virol. 2018 June 1; 92(11): e00363-18), the authors concluded that the MVA-VLP-Ebola and MVA-VLP-Sudan vaccines are the best-in class vaccine in development.
 
In July 2019, we reported positive results (100% protection) from preclinical challenge studies of our MARV vaccine candidate. In this study, our MARV vaccine was administered by intramuscular (IM) inoculations to guinea pigs, with a control group receiving saline injections. Eight weeks after inoculation, animals in each group were exposed to a lethal dose of MARV. Within 8 days post-challenge, all animals in the control group had developed moribund conditions and had to be euthanized. At the conclusion of the study (21 days post-challenge), all vaccinated animals survived, with no weight loss or other health issues. The study was conducted in collaboration with researchers at UTMB. Similar to MARV vaccine, our Sudan vaccine provided 100% protection in guinea pig challenge studies with near sterile immunity which is unprecedented for a replication deficient MVA virus.
 
Further development of our filovirus vaccines will be dependent upon additional funding support.
 
Our Lassa Fever Vaccine Program
 
Lassa fever virus (LASV), a member of the Arenaviridae family, causes severe and often fatal hemorrhagic illnesses in an overlapping region with Ebola. Lassa Fever is an acute viral hemorrhagic illness caused by LASV. In contrast to the unpredictable epidemics of filoviruses, LASV is endemic in West Africa with an annual incidence of >300,000 infections, resulting in 5,000-10,000 deaths. Data from a recent independent study suggest that the number of annual Lassa Fever cases may be much higher, reaching 3 million infections and 67,000 deaths, putting as many as 200 million persons at risk.
 
Our initial preclinical studies in rodents for our LASV vaccine candidate have shown 100% single-dose protection against a lethal dose of LASV challenge composed of multiple strains delivered directly into the brain. The study was conducted at the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. Multiple repeats of the study confirmed the findings.
 
Subsequent to these initial findings, in April 2018 NIAID awarded GeoVax a SBIR grant in support of further advancing our Lassa vaccine development program. The work was performed in collaboration with the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland, The Scripps Research Institute, and the University of Texas Medical Branch.
 
In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) awarded GeoVax a $2,442,307 cooperative agreement in support of our LASV vaccine development program. The grant was awarded by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity pursuant to the Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program (PRMRP), part of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP). In addition to the grant funds provided directly to GeoVax, DoD will also fund testing of the GeoVax vaccine by U.S. Army scientists at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), under a separate subaward. The project award is supporting generation of immunogenicity and efficacy data for our vaccine candidate in both rodent and nonhuman primate models, as well as manufacturing process development and cGMP production of vaccine seed stock in preparation for human clinical trials. The work is ongoing and is being performed in collaboration with USAMRIID and the Geneva Foundation.
 
Further development of our Lassa Fever vaccine beyond the work being funded by the U.S. DoD will be dependent upon additional funding and/or partnering support.

Our Zika Vaccine Program
 
Zika disease is an emerging infectious disease caused by the Zika virus (ZIKV) and has been linked to an increase in microcephaly in infants and Guillain-Barre syndrome (a neurodegenerative disease) in adults. ZIKV is a member of the Flaviviridae family, which includes medically important pathogens such as dengue fever, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, tick-borne encephalitis, and West Nile viruses. ZIKV, which was first discovered in 1947 in the Zika forest of Uganda, was considered only a minor public health concern for 60 years. During 2015 and 2016, with its appearance and rapid spread in the Americas, it has emerged as a serious threat with pandemic potential. Symptoms of Zika infection have historically been mild. In the recent epidemic, however, an alarming association between ZIKV infection and fetal brain abnormalities including microcephaly has been observed. No approved preventive or therapeutic products are currently available to fight the Zika epidemic. Public health officials recommend avoiding exposure to ZIKV, delaying pregnancy, and following basic supportive care (fluids, rest, and acetaminophen) after infection. A vaccine is needed to prevent a Zika pandemic.
 
To address the unmet need for a ZIKV vaccine, we are developing novel vaccine candidates constructed using our MVA-VLP platform. MVA has an outstanding safety record, which is particularly important given the need to include women of child-bearing age and newborns among those being vaccinated. Our Zika vaccine is designed based on the NS1 gene product to eliminate the risk of Antibody Dependent Enhancement (ADE), which is a serious side effect observed when a vaccinated individual doesn’t have a fully protective immune response which actually causes a more virulent reaction if infected.
 
Our initial preclinical studies in rodents using our MVA-NS1 vaccine candidate demonstrated 100% single-dose protection against a lethal dose of ZIKV delivered directly into the brain. The study was conducted and funded by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which also provided technical assistance. In June 2017 NIAID awarded GeoVax a SBIR grant in support of preclinical testing of our MVA-NS1 vaccine in nonhuman primates in preparation for human clinical trials. In rhesus macaques vaccination with MVA-NS1 induced immune responses that effectively controlled the virus replication despite the fact the vaccine is not designed to induce ZIKV neutralizing antibodies.
 
Further development of our ZIKV vaccine will be dependent upon partnering support.
 
Our Malaria Vaccine Programs
 
Malaria is a mosquito-borne disease caused by Plasmodium parasites. Symptoms are fever, chills, sweating, vomiting and flu-like illness. If untreated, severe complications (severe anemia, cerebral malaria and organ failure) will lead to death. Over 3 billion people in 106 countries and territories live at risk of malaria infection. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 229 million new cases of malaria were recorded worldwide in 2019, resulting in 409,000 deaths. Current treatments include bed net distributions, drug treatment and mosquito spraying. Malaria parasites develop resistance to drugs and insecticides. Vaccines have shown to be the most cost-effective ways to fight and eliminate infectious diseases (Smallpox, polio, etc.), but after many decades of research and development, there is only one commercial malaria vaccine, known as “RTS, S” or by the tradename “Mosquirix”. It requires four injections and has low efficacy (approximately 30%) which wanes over time. Current experimental vaccine candidates have limitations such as poor immunogenicity, based on limited number of antigens (generally 1-5 antigens), do not target multiple stages of the parasite life cycle, and do not induce strong durable functional antibodies and T cell responses. Therefore, identification of appropriate antigens and vaccine technologies remains critical for development of an effective malaria vaccine.
 
An ideal malaria vaccine candidate should contain antigens from multiple stages of the malaria parasite’s life cycle, and should induce both functional antibodies (predominantly IgG1 and IgG3 subtypes shown to be associated with protection) and strong cell mediated immunity (e.g. Th1 biased CD4+ ad CD8+) to reduce parasitemia by clearing infected cells (liver cells or erythrocytes). We have shown (in animal models and humans) that GV-MVA-VLP™ vaccines for non-malarial disease targets induces a Th1 biased response with both durable functional antibodies and CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses and that multiple antigens can be included in a single vaccine. As such, we believe the GeoVax MVA-VLP platform is well-suited for use in the malaria vaccine field.
 
Collaboration with Burnet Institute – During 2017 we established a collaboration with the Burnet Institute, a leading infectious diseases research institute in Australia, for the development of a vaccine to prevent malaria infection. The project includes the design, construction, and characterization of multiple malaria vaccine candidates using GeoVax’s GV-MVA-VLP™ vaccine platform combined with malaria Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax sequences identified by the Burnet Institute. The vaccine design, construction, and characterization is being performed at GeoVax with immunogenicity and challenge studies in animal models conducted at Burnet Institute using their unique functional assays that provide key information on vaccine efficacy. This project is ongoing.
 
Collaboration with Leidos – In February 2019, we began a collaboration with Leidos, Inc. to develop malaria vaccine candidates. The work is supported under a contract to Leidos from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Malaria Vaccine Development Program (MVDP). Leidos has been tasked by USAID to advance promising vaccine candidates against P. falciparum malaria and selected the GeoVax GV-MVA-VLP™ platform as part of this development effort. The collaboration with Leidos complements our ongoing malaria vaccine development project with Burnet Institute and offers a separate opportunity for success. This project is ongoing.

Support from the United States Government
 
Grants and Contracts.
 
We have been the recipient of multiple federal grants and contracts in support of our vaccine development programs. Our most recent awards are as follows:
 
Lassa DoD Grant. In September 2018, the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) awarded us a $2,442,307 cooperative agreement in support of our LASV vaccine development program. The grant was awarded by the U.S. Army Medical Research Acquisition Activity pursuant to the Peer Reviewed Medical Research Program (PRMRP), part of the Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs (CDMRP). In addition to the grant funds provided directly to GeoVax, DoD will also fund testing of our vaccine by U.S. Army scientists under a separate subaward. The award, entitled “Advanced Preclinical Development and Production of Master Seed Virus of GEO-LM01, a Novel MVA-VLP Vaccine Against Lassa Fever”, will support generation of immunogenicity and efficacy data for our vaccine candidate in both rodent and nonhuman primate models, as well as manufacturing process development and cGMP production of vaccine seed stock in preparation for human clinical trials.
 
Lassa SBIR Grant. In April 2018, NIAID awarded us a $300,000 SBIR grant entitled “Construction and efficacy testing of novel recombinant vaccine designs for eliciting both broadly neutralizing antibodies and T cells against Lassa virus.”
 
COVID-19 SBIR Grant. In January 2021, NIAID awarded us a $299,927 Phase I SBIR grant in support of our development of a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. The grant, titled, “Preclinical Development of GV-MVA-VLP Vaccines Against COVID-19,” will support the ongoing design, construction and preclinical testing of our vaccine candidates in preparation for human clinical trials. The efficacy testing will be performed in collaboration with UTMB.
 
Malaria Contract with Leidos – In March 2019, we entered into a $196,126 subcontract with Leidos, Inc., supported by a contract to Leidos from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) Malaria Vaccine Development Program (MVDP). Leidos has been tasked by USAID to advance promising vaccine candidates against P. falciparum malaria and selected the GeoVax GV-MVA-VLP™ platform as part of this development effort. In January 2020, the work was extended through an additional subcontract for $385,193.
 
Zika SBIR Grant. In June 2017, NIAID awarded us a SBIR grant entitled “Advanced Preclinical Testing of a Novel Recombinant Vaccine Against Zika Virus.” The initial grant award was $300,000 for the first year of a two-year project period beginning June 24, 2017, with a total project budget of $600,000. In May 2018, the second-year grant of $300,000 was awarded to us.
 
HIV Staged Vaccine Development Contract. In August 2016, NIAID awarded us a Staged Vaccine Development contract to produce our preventive HIV vaccine for use in future clinical trials. The award included a base contract of $199,442 for the initial period from August 1, 2016 to December 31, 2017 (the “base period”) to support process development, as well as $7.6 million in additional development options that can be exercised by NIAID. Prior to the end of the base period NIAID notified us that it did not plan to exercise the additional development option under the contract due to funds availability and NIAID’s programmatic needs. We do not expect this to have an impact on the human clinical trials of our preventive HIV vaccine currently being conducted by the HVTN, or future trials being planned.
 
HIV SBIR Grant. In April 2016, NIAID awarded us a SBIR grant entitled “Enhancing Protective Antibody Responses for a DNA/MVA HIV Vaccine.” The initial grant award was $740,456 for the first year of a two-year project period beginning April 15, 2016, with a total project budget of $1,398,615. In March 2017, NIAID awarded us $658,159 for the second year of the project period to test the effects of adding two proteins to our vaccine regimen, and we subsequently received a one-year no-cost extension of the project period, which was completed during 2019.
 
Clinical Trial Support.
 
All our human clinical trials to date for our preventive HIV vaccines, including the recently completed HVTN 114 trial and the HVTN 132 trial currently planned, have been or will be conducted by the HVTN and funded by NIAID. This financial support has been provided by NIAID directly to the HVTN, so has not been recognized in our financial statements, and we do not know the cost of these trials. See “Our Preventive HIV Vaccine Program” above for the current status of our human clinical trials.
 
   11

  

Other Federal Support.
 
We have been the recipient of additional in-kind federal support through collaborative and intramural arrangements with CDC for our Zika vaccine program, the Rocky Mountain Laboratory facility of NIAID for our hemorrhagic fever virus vaccine program, and the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID) for our hemorrhagic fever virus vaccine program. This support generally has been for the conduct or support of preclinical animal studies on our behalf.
Government Regulation
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in our ongoing research and development activities and in the manufacture of our products. Complying with these regulations involves considerable expertise, time and expense.
 
In the United States, drugs and biologics are subject to rigorous federal and state regulation. Our products are regulated under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act), the Public Health Service Act, and the regulations promulgated under these statutes, and other federal and state statutes and regulations. These laws govern, among other things, the testing, manufacture, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion of medications and medical devices. Product development and approval within this regulatory framework is difficult to predict, takes several years and involves great expense. The steps required before a human vaccine may be marketed in the United States include:
 

● | Preclinical laboratory tests, in vivo preclinical studies and formulation studies; 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Manufacturing and testing of the product under strict compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) regulations; 
● | Submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials can commence;
● | Adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the product; 
● | The submission of a Biologics License Application to the FDA, along with the required user fees; and 
● | FDA approval of the BLA prior to any commercial sale or shipment of the product 

 
Before marketing any drug or biologic for human use in the United States, the product sponsor must obtain FDA approval. In addition, each manufacturing establishment must be registered with the FDA and must pass a pre-approval inspection before introducing any new drug or biologic into commercial distribution.
 
The Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) authority granted to the FDA allows the FDA to help strengthen the nation’s public health protections against certain threats by facilitating the availability and use of medical countermeasures needed during public health emergencies. Under section 564 of the FD&C Act, the FDA Commissioner may allow unapproved medical products or unapproved uses of approved medical products to be used in an emergency to diagnose, treat, or prevent serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions caused by threat agents when there are no adequate, approved, and available alternatives. This potentially may provide a faster pathway to market for our COVID-19 or other infectious disease vaccine candidates. This was the approval pathway followed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna for their respective COVID-19 vaccines.
 
Because GeoVax does not manufacture vaccines for human use within our own facilities, we must ensure compliance both in our own operations and in the outsourced manufacturing operations. All FDA-regulated manufacturing establishments (both domestic establishments and foreign establishments that export products to the United States) are subject to inspections by the FDA and must comply with the FDA’s cGMP regulations for products, drugs and devices.
 
The FDA determines compliance with applicable statutes and regulations through documentation review, investigations, and inspections. Several enforcement mechanisms are available to the FDA, ranging from a simple demand to correct a minor deficiency to mandatory recalls, closure of facilities, and even criminal charges for the most serious violations.
 
Even if FDA regulatory clearances are obtained, a marketed product is subject to continual review, and later discovery of previously unknown problems or failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions.
 
Whether or not the FDA has approved the drug, approval of a product by regulatory authorities in foreign countries must be obtained prior to the commencement of commercial sales of the drug in such countries. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials and drug approvals vary widely from country to country, and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
 
   12

  

We also are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory and manufacturing practices, the experimental use of animals, and the use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research. The extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted.
 
FDA Tropical Disease Priority Review Voucher Program
 
Section 524 of the FD&C Act authorizes the FDA to award priority review vouchers (PRVs) to sponsors of approved tropical disease product applications that meet certain criteria. To qualify for a PRV, a sponsor’s application must be for a drug or biological product for the prevention or treatment of a “tropical disease,” must otherwise qualify for priority review, and must contain no active ingredient (including any salt or ester of an active ingredient) that has been approved in any other application under Section 505(b)(1) of the FD&C Act or section 351 of the Public Health Services Act. Priority review means that the FDA aims to render a decision in 6 months.
 
The PRV may be sold. For example, a small company might win a voucher for developing a drug for a neglected disease and sell the voucher to a large company for use on a commercial disease. The price of the voucher depends on supply and demand. The voucher’s value derives from three factors: shifting sales earlier, longer effective patent life due to earlier entry, and competitive benefits from earlier entry relative to competitors. Top-selling treatments can yield billions in sales each year, so being approved months earlier can be worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the voucher. Since the first voucher sale in 2014, the price of the vouchers has ranged from $68 million to $350 million.
 
GeoVax believes that its vaccine programs in Ebola, Sudan, Marburg, Lassa Fever, Malaria and Zika may each be eligible for a PRV and we intend to apply for a PRV at the appropriate time. There can be no assurance, however, that we will qualify or be approved for a PRV.
 
Manufacturing
 
We do not have the facilities or expertise to manufacture any of the clinical or commercial supplies of any of our products. To be successful, our products must be manufactured in commercial quantities in compliance with regulatory requirements and at an acceptable cost. To date, we have not commercialized any products, nor have we demonstrated that we can manufacture commercial quantities of our product candidates in accordance with regulatory requirements. If we cannot manufacture products in suitable quantities and in accordance with regulatory standards, either on our own or through contracts with third parties, it may delay clinical trials, regulatory approvals and marketing efforts for such products. Such delays could adversely affect our competitive position and our chances of achieving profitability. We cannot be sure that we can manufacture, either on our own or through contracts with third parties, such products at a cost or in quantities that are commercially viable.
 
We currently rely and intend to continue to rely on third-party contract manufacturers to produce vaccines needed for research and clinical trials. We have arrangements with third party manufacturers for the supply of our DNA and MVA vaccines for use in our planned clinical trials. These suppliers operate under the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practices and (in the case of European manufacturers) similar regulations of the European Medicines Agency. We anticipate that these suppliers will be able to provide sufficient vaccine supplies to complete our currently planned clinical trials. Various contractors are generally available in the United States and Europe for manufacture of vaccines for clinical trial evaluation, however, it may be difficult to replace existing contractors for certain manufacturing and testing activities and costs for contracted services may increase substantially if we switch to other contractors. Furthermore, there is currently a shortage of vaccine manufacturing capability due to demand for potential COVID-19 vaccines, which could affect our ability to have our vaccine candidates manufactured.
 
The MVA component of our vaccine is currently manufactured in cells that are cultured from embryonated eggs. We are exploring a number of approaches to growing MVA in continuous cell lines that can be grown in bioreactors more suitable for commercial-scale manufacturing.
 
The raw materials and other supplies that are used in the production process for our vaccines and that we use in our research activities are generally available from a number of commercial suppliers and we believe we will be able to obtain sufficient quantities of such materials and supplies for all foreseeable clinical investigations.

Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive. There are many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, public and private universities and research organizations actively engaged in the research and development of products that may be competitive with our products. As we develop and seek to ultimately commercialize our product candidates, we face and will continue to encounter competition with an array of existing or development-stage drug and immunotherapy approaches targeting diseases we are pursuing. We are aware of various established enterprises, including major pharmaceutical companies, broadly engaged in vaccine/immunotherapy research and development. These include Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Sanofi-Aventis, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck, Pfizer, and MedImmune. There are also various development-stage biotechnology companies involved in different vaccine and immunotherapy technologies including Aduro Biotech, Advaxis, BioNTech, Curevac, Dynavax, Juno, Moderna, and Novavax. If these companies are successful in developing their technologies, it could materially and adversely affect our business and our future growth prospects. The number of companies seeking to develop products and therapies for the treatment of unmet needs in these indications is likely to increase. Some of these competitive products and therapies are based on scientific approaches that are similar to our approaches, and others are based on entirely different approaches.
 
Many of our competitors, either alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of product candidates, obtaining FDA and other regulatory approvals of products and the commercialization of those products. Our competitors’ products may be more effective, or more effectively marketed and sold, than any drug we may commercialize and may render our product candidates obsolete or non-competitive. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new drugs enter the market and advanced technologies become available. We expect any products that we develop and commercialize to compete based on, among other things, efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payers.
 
There are currently three COVID-19 vaccines approved for use in the United States under emergency use authorizations (EUA) from the FDA -- from Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen (Johnson & Johnson). Vaccines from AstraZeneca and Novavax are in late-stage development, and many others are in earlier stages of development. There are currently no FDA licensed and commercialized HIV vaccines, Zika vaccines, or hemorrhagic fever virus vaccines (other than for Ebola) available in the world market. We are aware of several development-stage and established enterprises, including major pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, which are actively engaged in vaccine research and development in these areas. For hemorrhagic fever viruses, these include NewLink Genetics and Merck, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, Inovio and GlaxoSmithKline. For HIV, these include Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline, and Johnson & Johnson. Other HIV vaccines are in varying stages of research, testing and clinical trials including those supported by the NIH Vaccine Research Center, the U.S. Military, IAVI, the European Vaccine Initiative, and the South African AIDS Vaccine Initiative. For Zika, these include NewLink Genetics, Inovio, Merck, Butantan Institute and NIH (NIAID). In December 2019, the FDA approved the first vaccine (ERVEBO®) for prevention of Ebola, developed by Merck.
 
There are numerous FDA-approved treatments for HIV, primarily antiretroviral therapies, marketed by large pharmaceutical companies. Currently, there are no approved therapies for the eradication of HIV. We expect that major pharmaceutical companies that currently market antiretroviral therapy products or other companies that are developing HIV product candidates may seek to develop products for the eradication of HIV.
 
There are currently no commercialized vaccines to prevent malaria infection. A first-generation infection-blocking malaria vaccine, RTS, S, is under regulatory review. It requires 4 doses and has been recommended by the WHO for pilot implementation studies. Since this vaccine is based on a single antigen and has modest efficacy (30-40%, depending on the age of subjects), the WHO has defined a Road Map for developing and licensing of next generation malaria vaccines. These vaccines are expected to contain multiple antigens designed to block both infection and transmission of malaria with at least a 75% efficacy rate.
 
A number of companies are developing various types of therapeutic vaccines or other immunotherapy approaches to treat cancer including Advaxis, Immune Design, Oncothyreon, Bavarian Nordic, Roche Pharmaceuticals, Merck & Co, Bristol Myers Squibb, and AstraZeneca plc.
 
Our Intellectual Property
 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our vaccines, including our Modified Vaccinia Ankara-Virus-Like Particle (MVA-VLP) based vaccines, and methods of treatment using our vaccines.
 
   14

  

We seek patent protection on each of our product and developmental candidates and, where applicable, on combinations with other therapeutic and/or antigenic agents and dosing schedules. Our success also depends on our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. patent applications and, where appropriate, foreign patent applications covering our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Additionally, we expect to benefit, where appropriate, from statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe, and other countries that provide a period of clinical data exclusivity to compensate for the time required for regulatory approval of our vaccine candidates.
 
We continually assess and refine our intellectual property strategies as we develop new technologies and product candidates. We plan to file additional patent applications based on our intellectual property strategies where appropriate, including where we seek to improve our basic technology, adapt to competition, or to improve business opportunities. Further, we plan to file patent applications, as we consider appropriate under the circumstances, to protect new technologies that we develop. Our patent filing strategy typically includes seeking patent protection in the United States and, wherein appropriate, in additional countries where we believe such protection is likely to be useful.
 
As of December 31, 2020, our owned and in-licensed patent estate, on a worldwide basis, includes 14 granted U.S. patents, 16 pending U.S. patent applications; 43 granted foreign patents, 13 pending foreign patent applications, and 1 Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) application spread over 19 patent families. The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In the countries in which we currently file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application which serves as a priority application. In addition, we plan to seek patent term adjustments, restorations, and/or patent term extensions where applicable in the United States and other jurisdictions. For example, depending upon the timing, duration, and specifics of FDA approval of our vaccine products, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the “Hatch-Waxman Amendments,” and codified as 35 U.S.C. § 156. 35 U.S.C. § 156 permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a Biologics License Application (BLA), plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved vaccine product is eligible for such an extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. A similar kind of patent extension, referred to as a Supplementary Protection Certificate, is available in Europe. Legal frameworks are also available in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent. We currently intend to seek patent term extensions on any of our, or our exclusively licensed, issued patents in any jurisdiction where we have a qualifying patent and the extension is available; however, there is no guarantee that the applicable regulatory authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions. Further, even if our patent is extended, the patent, including the extended portion of the patent, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court of final jurisdiction in the United States or a foreign country.
 
Our current patent portfolio includes 5 patent families directed to various aspects of our DNA and MVA-based HIV vaccines, their genetic inserts expressing multiple HIV protein components, composition, structure, claim of immunization against multiple subtypes of HIV, routes of administration, safety and other related factors and methods of therapeutic and prophylactic use thereof including administration regimes. We have in-licensed patents from Emory University and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) relevant to our HIV-vaccine program. These patents will expire between 2022 and 2028, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions. We wholly own one patent family directed to specific vaccine administration methods which, if issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire in 2037, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We wholly own one U.S. patent application directed to preventive vaccines against hemorrhagic fever viruses (Ebola, Sudan, Marburg and Lassa), and uses thereof. This application, if issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire in 2036, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We wholly own one U.S. patent application directed to preventive vaccines against Zika virus, and uses thereof. This application, if issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire in 2037, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.

We co-own one patent family with Georgia State University directed to preventive vaccines against human papilloma virus (HPV), and uses thereof. These applications, if issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire in 2037, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We wholly own one U.S. patent application directed to preventive vaccines against malaria, and use thereof. This application, if issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire in 2038, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We wholly own 3 patent families directed to our immuno-oncology vaccine compositions and methods of use thereof. The patent applications of these families, if issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire between 2037-2040, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We have a pending U.S. application directed to our virus-like particle (VLP) platform technology. This patent application, if issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire in 2037, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We wholly own one pending patent family directed to various MVA-based vaccines for the treatment of SARS CoV-2. The patent applications in this family, if issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire in 2041, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions. We have non-exclusively in-licensed from the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) 3 patent families directed to certain aspects of our MVA-viral backbone used in our SARS-CoV2 vaccine, which will expire between 2023 and 2032, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions. We have non-exclusively in-licensed from the NIH 2 patent families relating to coronavirus spike protein compositions relevant to our MVA SARS-CoV2 vaccine candidates. The patent applications for these families, if issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire between 2037 and 2041, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We are the exclusive, worldwide licensee of several patents and patent applications, which we refer to as the Emory Technology, owned, licensed or otherwise controlled by Emory University for HIV or smallpox vaccines pursuant to a license agreement originally entered into on August 23, 2002 and restated on June 23, 2004 (the “Emory License”). The in-licensed Emory University patents will expire between 2022 and 2028, exclusive of any patent term extensions. Through the Emory License we are also a non-exclusive licensee of four issued United States patents owned by the NIH related to the ability of our MVA vector vaccine to operate as a vehicle to deliver HIV virus antigens, and to induce an immune response in humans. These in-licensed NIH patents will expire in 2023, exclusive of any patent term extensions.
 
The MVA backbone that we have been using in our vaccines was provided to us by the laboratory of Dr. Bernard Moss of the NIAID, Laboratory of Viral Diseases (LVD). We have a non-exclusive commercial license to the NIH MVA backbone for our SARS CoV-2 vaccine with the NIAID of the National Institutes of Health NIH on behalf of the United States, which includes the use of certain patents and patent applications arising from the Moss laboratory and the provided materials. We also have a non-exclusive research and development license to use the MVA backbone for our other vaccine candidates. If we later decide to commercialize vaccine candidates that are under the research and development license, we will need to negotiate appropriate commercialization licenses. These in-licensed NIH patents and patent applications, if and where issued, valid, and enforceable, will expire between 2023 and 2032, exclusive of any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 
We cannot be certain that any of the current pending patent applications we have or have licensed, or any new patent applications we may file or license, will ever be issued in the United States or any other country. Even if issued, there can be no assurance that those patents will be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our products or processes. Furthermore, our patents, as well as those we have licensed or may license in the future, may be held invalid or unenforceable by a court, or third parties could obtain patents that we would need to either license or to design around, which we may be unable to do. Current and future competitors may have licensed or filed patent applications or received patents and may acquire additional patents or proprietary rights relating to products or processes competitive to ours. In addition, any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, or earlier date of invention, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, lengthy governmental proceedings, divert management’s attention and resources and require us to enter royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous to us, if available at all.
 
We also expect to benefit, where appropriate, from statutory frameworks in the United States, Europe, and other countries that provide a period of regulatory exclusivity to compensate for the time and cost required in securing regulatory approval of our vaccine products. For example, in 2010, the United States enacted the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act (BPCIA). Under the BPCIA, innovator manufacturers of vaccine products may be granted 12 years of exclusive use before biosimilar versions of such products can be licensed for marketing in the U.S. This means that the FDA may not approve an application for a biosimilar version of our vaccine product until 12 years after the date our vaccine product is approved for sale (with a potential six-month extension of exclusivity if certain pediatric studies are conducted and the results accepted by the FDA), although a biosimilar application may be submitted four years after the date we receive approval from the FDA to sell our vaccine product. Additionally, the BPCIA establishes procedures by which potentially relevant patents may be shared and litigation over patents may proceed in advance of approval. The BPCIA also provides incentives to biosimilar applicants by providing a period of exclusivity to the first biosimilar of a product approved by the FDA. The 12-year data exclusivity provision of the BPCIA does not prevent a competitor from seeking marketing approval of one of our vaccine products, or a product similar thereto, by submitting its own, original Biologics License Application (BLA).

We intend to benefit, where applicable, from additional market exclusivity provisions in various jurisdictions that reward the treatments of rare diseases. For example, in the United States under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a vaccine product intended to prevent or treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety, or providing a major contribution to patient care, or in instances of drug supply issues. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication; in the latter case, because health care professionals are free to prescribe products for off-label uses, the competitor’s product could be used for the orphan indication despite our orphan exclusivity.
 
We are not a party to any litigation, opposition, interference, or other potentially adverse proceeding with regard to our patent positions. However, if we become involved in litigation, interference proceedings, oppositions or other intellectual property proceedings, for example as a result of an alleged infringement or a third-party alleging an earlier date of invention, we may have to spend significant amounts of money and time and, in the event of an adverse ruling, we could be subject to liability for damages, invalidation of our intellectual property and injunctive relief that could prevent us from using technologies or developing products, any of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. In addition, any claims relating to the infringement of third-party proprietary rights, or earlier date of invention, even if not meritorious, could result in costly litigation, lengthy governmental proceedings, divert management’s attention and resources and require us to enter royalty or license agreements which are not advantageous if available at all.
 
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented, proprietary trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 
Research and Development
 
Our expenditures for research and development activities were $2,444,459 and $1,910,715 during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As our vaccines continue to go through the process to obtain regulatory approval, we expect our research and development costs to increase. We have not yet formulated any plans for marketing and sales of any vaccine candidate we may successfully develop. Compliance with environmental protection laws and regulations has not had a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position to date.
