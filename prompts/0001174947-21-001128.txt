ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
General 
 
The Holding Company was incorporated in New York in July 2013 to serve as a holding company for the Gas Company and its dormant subsidiary Corning Natural Gas Appliance Corporation (the “Appliance Company”), Pike, Leatherstocking Gas Company, LLC, and Leatherstocking Pipeline Company, LLC. The Holding Company also owns 50% of Leatherstocking Gas of New York, Inc. (“Leatherstocking NY”). As used in this document, the term “the Company” refers to the consolidated operations of the Holding Company, Gas Company, Pike and (from July 1, 2020) the Leatherstocking Companies.
 
The Company’s principal executive offices are located at 330 W. William Street, Corning New York, 14830, the telephone number is (607) 936-3755, and our website is www.corninggas.com.
 
Business 
 
The Company’s primary business, through its subsidiaries Corning Gas, Pike and the Leatherstocking Companies, is natural gas and electric distribution. Corning Gas serves approximately 15,000 residential, commercial, industrial and municipal customers in the Corning, Hammondsport and Virgil, New York, areas and two other gas utilities which serve the Elmira and Bath, New York areas. It is franchised to supply gas service in all the political subdivisions in which it operates. The Gas Company is under the jurisdiction of the New York Public Service Commission (“NYPSC”) which oversees and sets rates for New York gas distribution companies. In addition, the Gas Company has contracts with Corning Incorporated and Woodhull Municipal Gas Company, a small local utility, to provide maintenance service on their gas lines. Pike is an electric and gas utility regulated by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission (“PAPUC”). Pike provides electric service to approximately 4,900 customers in the Townships of Westfall, Milford, the northern part of Dingman, and in the Boroughs of Milford and Matamoras. Pike provides natural gas service to 1,300 customers in Westfall Township and the Borough of Matamoras. All these communities are located in Pike County, Pennsylvania. Additionally, Leatherstocking Gas is also regulated by the PAPUC and distributes gas in Susquehanna and Bradford Counties, Pennsylvania. Leatherstocking Pipeline, an unregulated company, has served one customer in Lawton, Pennsylvania and has had no revenues since 2018. Leatherstocking NY has an application pending before the NYPSC for authority to provide gas distribution services in Broome County, New York.
Pending Merger
 
On January 12, 2021, Holding Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) by and among Holding Company, affiliates of Argo Infrastructure partners, LP named ACP Crotona Corp. (“Parent”), and ACP Crotona Merger Sub Corp. (“Merger Sub”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into Holding Company, and Holding Company will continue as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (the “Merger” or the “Argo Merger”). As a result of the Merger, shareholders of Holding Company will receive consideration for their shares in the following amounts: (i) $24.75 in cash, per share of common stock (the “Merger Consideration”); (ii) $25 per share of Series A preferred stock; (iii) $29.70 per share of Series B preferred stock; and (iv) $25 per share of Series C preferred stock. Amounts payable to all shareholders will include cash for any unpaid dividends.

The Merger is subject to, among other customary closing conditions, the approvals of the NYPSC and the PAPUC. In addition, the Merger requires the approval of the Company’s shareholders and the expiration of any applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act. The Merger Agreement also includes certain termination rights for both the Company and Parent and provides that, in connection with the termination of the Merger Agreement under specified circumstances, termination fees may be owed by the Company to Parent, depending on the circumstances surrounding a termination.
 The Merger Agreement provided for a 45-day “Go Shop” period which expired on February 26, 2021. During the “Go Shop” period, the Company received no competing offers or alternative acquisition proposals. The Company is now subject to a customary “No Shop” provision that restricts the Company’s ability to solicit acquisition proposals from third parties and to provide non-public information and to negotiate with third parties regarding unsolicited acquisition proposals that is reasonably expected to lead to a superior proposal. On April 30, 2021, the Company and Argo filed with the NYPSC and PAPUC joint petitions requesting approval to conclude the merger. Decisions from the commissions on the merger petitions are not expected until the first half of 2022. The Merger was voted on and approved by the Company’s shareholders at its annual shareholder meeting on May 27, 2021.
 
In connection with the execution of the Merger Agreement, the Company has suspended its dividend reinvestment plan.
 
Upon consummation of the Merger, the Company’s common stock will be delisted from the OTCQX and deregistered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) as soon as practicable.
 
Gas and Electric Supply
 
Corning Gas has contracted with various sources to provide natural gas to our distribution system. The Gas Company contracts for pipeline capacity, as well as storage capacity of approximately 736,000 dekatherms (“Dth”). The Company manages its transportation and storage capacity with internal resources. Pike has contracted with Orange and Rockland Utilities, Inc. (“O&R”) to provide electricity and natural gas according to agreements until August 2022, subject to renewal. Leatherstocking Gas has a supply agreement with Cabot Oil and Gas that expires in August of 2026.
 
Corning Gas secured the NYPSC-required fixed price and storage gas supply for the 2021-2022 winter season and is managing its storage and gas supply contracts following its gas supply and acquisition plan. Assuming no extraordinary conditions for the winter season, gas supply, flowing and storage will be adequate to serve its customers.
 
Corning Gas does not expect a shortage of natural gas to impact our business over the next five to ten years. Natural gas supply over the last several years has been positive, and domestic reserves and production have increased. This is especially true in proximity to our distribution network. We likewise anticipate no shortages of the necessary pipes and valves for safe distribution of natural gas and continue to receive material inventory from various reliable sources. We also have confidence that our agreement with O&R will enable Pike to meet all our electric and gas needs for Pike’s customers and that Cabot Oil and Gas will be able to continue reliably supplying Leatherstocking Gas.
 
Seasonality
 
The Company’s business is seasonal in nature, and sales for each quarter of the year vary and are not comparable. Sales vary depending on seasonal variations in temperature. Gas sales peak in the winter, while Pike’s electric sales peak in the summer.
Significant Customers
 
The Gas Company has three major customers, Corning Incorporated, New York State Electric & Gas, and Bath Electric, Gas & Water Systems. In total, these customers accounted for approximately 14.98% of the Gas Company’s revenues in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021 (“FY 2021”) and 14.32% in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2020 (“FY 2020”). The loss of any of these customers would have an adverse impact on our financial results.
Human Capital
 
The Company had 73 employees as of September 30, 2021, and 72 as of September 30, 2020. Of this total, approximately one third are union labor working under a union contract effective until April 3, 2023. Our people work primarily at three business locations in New York and Pennsylvania. The Company offers its employees competitive salaries and wages, excellent health and welfare benefit plans, including a 401(k) plan with a company match, and at the Gas Company, a qualified defined benefit pension plan. Our employees enjoy eleven paid holidays, paid vacation and personal days, paid sick leave, and Company sponsored group term life insurance benefits.
 
We offer employee training programs that enable our employees to obtain and maintain industry certifications required to assist customers with gas and electric service issues. We promote safety in the workplace by requiring our people to receive training on sexual

harassment in the workplace, alcohol and substance abuse, and we offer free training on interpersonal skills. We also offer our employees access to professional counseling to help them deal with personal and family issues.
 
Competition
 
Historically, the competition in the Gas Company’s residential market and Pike’s and Leatherstocking Gas’s gas franchise territories has been primarily from electricity for water heating and clothes drying, and to a small degree, fuel oil and propane for heating. The price of gas remains low in comparison to that of alternative fuels in our service territories and our competitive position in the residential, commercial and industrial markets continues to be strong. When we expand our distribution system to attract new customers, our principal competition is oil and propane. Natural gas enjoys a price advantage over these fuels today. Pike electric has not faced significant competition to date. Although not material today, we could experience competition from customer owned solar in the future.
Environmental Regulation
 
We believe we are in compliance with present federal, state and local provisions relating to the protection of the environment. We do not expect that continued compliance with these requirements will have any material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings and financial position. The Company has no former manufactured gas plant sites (MGP) and is not a party to any environmental proceedings, litigation or complaints.
Regulatory Matters
 
On May 19, 2021, the NYPSC issued a rate order establishing rates and a rate plan for the Gas Company for a one-year period ending January 31, 2022. The rate order reduced customer rates by $766,000, but it eliminated a $1.3 million tax sur-credit related to income tax rate reductions in the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The rate order was retroactive to February 1, 2021.
 
On July 16, 2021, the Gas Company filed a three-year rate plan with the NYPSC for rate years ending on June 30, 2023, 2024, and 2025. The rate increases requested for the three-year rate plan are $6,555,000, $1,030,000, and $843,000, respectively.
 
On June 25, 2021, the PAPUC issued a rate order approving Pike’s gas rate increase of $225,000 per year, and on July 15, 2021, the PAPUC issued a rate order approving an electric rate increase in the amount of $1.4 million per year. Both rate increases took effect on July 28, 2021.
