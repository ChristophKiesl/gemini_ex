ITEM 1 – BUSINESS
Our Mission
Our mission is to champion the world's creators by helping them monetize their content, creativity and influence.
Our Business
IZEA creates and operates online marketplaces that connects marketers with influential content creators. These creators produce and distribute text, videos and photos on behalf of marketers through websites, blogs and social media channels. Our technology brings the marketers and creators together, enabling their transactions to be completed at scale through the management of content workflow, creator search and targeting, bidding, analytics and payment processing. 
Marketers, including brands, agencies and publishers, engage us to gain access to our technology and network of creators. These companies are our primary customers and where we generate the majority of our revenue. They use our technology for two primary purposes; the engagement of online influencers for influencer marketing campaigns (also known as “Influencer Marketing”), or the creation of stand-alone content for distribution through their owned channels (“Custom Content”).
Influencer Marketing. We work with marketers to facilitate influencer marketing campaigns at scale. A subset of influencer marketing known as "Sponsored Social" is when a company compensates an online influencer such as a blogger or tweeter (“creators”) to share sponsored content with the creator's social network following. This sponsored content is included within the body of the content stream, a practice also referred to as “native advertising.” We believe that we pioneered the concept of a marketplace for sponsorships on the social web in 2006 with the launch of our first platform, PayPerPost, and have focused on scaling our product and service offerings ever since.
Custom Content. We also work with marketers to augment or replace their content development efforts. These customers use our platform to connect with creators to produce both editorial and marketing content that can be published both online and offline. Our network of creators includes professional journalists, subject matter experts, bloggers and everyday content creators, allowing our customers to produce content ranging from complex white papers to simple product descriptions. Many of our content customers use this service to create a steady stream of posts for their corporate blog. We first began offering custom content services in 2015 after the acquisition of Ebyline, Inc. ("Ebyline"), a leading marketplace in the editorial content space, and continued to expand this offering with our acquisition of ZenContent, Inc. ("ZenContent"), which predominantly focused on e-commerce-related asset creation, in July 2016.
Our Platforms
IZEA.com and The IZEA Exchange. We launched a public beta of IZEA.com powered by The IZEA Exchange ("IZEAx") in March 2014 and unveiled our latest version 2.0 of the platform in February 2017. IZEAx is designed to provide a unified ecosystem that enables the creation of multiple types of custom content including blog posts, status updates, videos and photos through a wide variety of social channels including blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr, among others. The system is available to our customers and partners via a self-serve portal, as a managed service or as a licensed white label. IZEAx is engineered from the ground-up to replace all of our previous platforms with an integrated offering that is improved and more efficient for the company to operate. Our intention is to focus all of our engineering resources on the IZEAx platform for the foreseeable future. We completed the sunset of our previous platforms in November 2014 and currently use IZEAx as the only automated system for managing social sponsorships.
Ebyline.  In January 2015, we acquired Ebyline, Inc. including the Ebyline technology platform. Ebyline is a content marketplace which was originally designed to replace editorial newsrooms located within newspapers with a “Virtual Newsroom.” We have evolved Ebyline’s model to focus on producing content for brands, in addition to the self-service functionality used by newspapers. We plan to integrate certain functions of this platform into IZEAx in the future. 
ZenContent. In July 2016, we acquired ZenContent, Inc. including its custom content creation workflow technology and database of creators. ZenContent’s platform enables highly scalable, multi-part production of content for both e-commerce entities, as well as brand marketers. Whereas Ebyline utilizes editorial or expert-grade creators (given its newspaper and media heritage), ZenContent’s approach is the opposite: to parse work out to a wide array of qualified creators who together can develop custom content assets with unmatched quality, speed, and price. This platform is currently utilized by our Managed

Service team to service its orders for custom content. We plan to integrate certain functions of this platform into IZEAx in the future. 
Our Marketers and Creators
IZEAx, Ebyline and ZenContent were designed with the same purpose: to streamline transactions between marketers and creators. We utilize these proprietary technologies to create efficiencies and economies of scale for both parties. Each platform provides marketers with access to a large network of creators along with complete workflow management, content control, payment processing and related performance tracking. 
For influencer marketing campaigns, IZEAx provides integrated Federal Trade Commission ("FTC") legal compliance. In particular, the integrated FTC compliance framework requires creators to provide disclosure to their followers with respect to the sponsored nature of the content and allows marketers to review the content for FTC compliance. If the marketer chooses, sponsorships can be managed end-to-end without the need for interaction with one of our team members through a self-service interface.
IZEA offers turnkey account management services to manage campaigns on behalf of the customer if they choose to not license our technology to do so for themselves. This includes working with marketers to optimize the opportunity that is presented to creators, providing clear instructions on what is required to fill the opportunity, identifying and sourcing the creators that are the best fit for the opportunity, managing the offer and acceptance process with the creators, verifying that the creators’ content, once submitted, meets the requirements of the opportunity and managing the overall campaign to meet the goals of the marketer. Account managers also provide customers with progress updates on their campaign that include campaign metrics and all postings created throughout the campaign. Additionally, they assemble comprehensive campaign recaps at the conclusion of the campaign and work with the marketers on plans for follow-up strategies after the initial campaign has ended.
Our customers, or our account management staff acting on the customers’ behalf as part of the account management services we offer, have the ability to review the creators’ content through our platforms to verify whether or not it conforms to the requirements of the opportunity. Our platforms provide for the ability to review creators’ content prior to publishing, and all the other platforms provide for a review after the content is published. If the content does not conform, the creator is requested to make any necessary adjustments. If the creator refuses, the opportunity is deemed to have been withdrawn. Neither the customer nor our account management staff modifies creators’ content without the creators’ involvement and consent.
The value proposition we offer to both marketers and creators strengthens our position as a trusted partner and allows us to derive revenue from both customer bases. As more marketers utilize our marketplaces, we increase the breadth and depth of monetization opportunities for creators, attracting more creators and further enhancing value for our marketers.
As of December 31, 2016, we have more than 810,000 user connections from 539,000 user accounts in IZEAx. The approximate aggregate reach of those user connections is 4.7 billion, which represents the total number of non-unique fans and followers of IZEAx users. Creators in our system range from leading social influencers to accredited journalists. Our total number of user accounts may be higher than the number of our actual individual creators because some creators may have created multiple accounts. We define a user connection as a social account or blog that has been added to IZEAx under a user account. It is possible for one user to add as many user connections as they like, and it is common for talent managers and large publishers to add many connections under a single account. The aggregate reach number includes current and naturally expired OAuth connections, but does not include manual disconnects. We define naturally expired OAuth connections as a social media user authentication that has timed out for any number of reasons. Our creators currently publish sponsored content to blogs and Twitter and reach other existing platforms such as Facebook, Pinterest, Tumblr, LinkedIn, Google and Bing through syndication or sharing of that content. 
We are currently limited in our ability to service the needs of all marketers and creators. We have a large number of marketers and creators that we cannot currently match for sponsorship or custom content opportunities. We believe that IZEAx should improve our ability to more efficiently match marketplace participants by providing access to more social media channels and by offering a larger inventory of quality marketers and creators. However, we are still limited by the number of marketers using our platforms to bring more liquidity and transactions to the creators in the marketplace. In October 2015, we announced the public beta of SocialLinks, a new offering inside of IZEAx. Through our research and development efforts, we are developing additional product offerings to solve this problem. Recent announcements have included SocialLinks, an affiliate marketing compensation opportunity for creators, and ContentAmp, a performance-based content syndication 
2

compensation opportunity. SocialLinks is designed to provide creators with an ability to monetize their social channels through an affiliate marketing model which compensates them for generating sales for IZEA partners. 
To date, we have completed over 3.6 million social sponsorship transactions for customers ranging from small local businesses to Fortune 500 companies. We consider each individual piece of custom content, sponsored blog post, tweet or other status update as an individual transaction so long as the creator of that content is being compensated for such post, tweet or other status update.
 We derive the majority of our revenue from marketers for the use of our network of social media content creators to fulfill marketer sponsor requests for a blog post, tweet, click or action ("Sponsored Revenue"). We derive the remaining portion of our revenue from the creation of custom content ("Content Revenue") and from various service fees charged to marketers and creators for services, maintenance and enhancement of their accounts ("Service Fee Revenue"). 
Industry Background and Trends
Despite the inherently conversational nature of influencer and content marketing as part of the broader integrated marketing landscape, many marketer budgets are currently allocated towards traditional display advertising and paid search, including banner ads and text links on social sites. While most marketers understand the value of word of mouth marketing, peer recommendations, and product reviews, the industry is nascent and few understand how to effectively and efficiently engage influencers and content creators and produce custom content appropriately for these purposes. Those who engage are quickly limited by the amount of effort required to adequately manage and measure a truly integrated campaign.
The influencer and content marketing categories have been limited primarily by the current inefficiencies of the market. Due to their large and highly fragmented nature, marketers have been forced to utilize a variety of highly inefficient sources and processes to navigate the complicated landscape, often resulting in low returns on their time investment or worse-yet, questionable results. We believe this is largely due to marketers and creators lacking an efficient way to identify and engage each other in the marketplace. 
At the same time, influencers and content creators that would like to monetize their community and work product are faced with significant challenges in making marketers aware of their services and finding quality marketers who are motivated to sponsor them. In addition, those creators with smaller networks simply lack the individual influence and audience needed to warrant the processing of a micro-transaction. In many cases, it costs a marketer more money to issue a check to a small creator than the value of the sponsorship payment itself. Further complicating the sponsorship process for both parties are FTC regulations around social media endorsements, IRS tax reporting generally applicable to anyone receiving income for services, and the associated campaign tracking required to provide compliance. While many marketers would prefer to be “part of the conversation,” we believe the complexity and cost of individual sponsorship often deters them from doing so.
We believe that the current challenges in efficiency and measurable success represent a significant opportunity for us. We address these challenges with targeted, scalable marketplaces that aggregate content creators and marketers. In doing so, we offer an efficient, innovative way for creators and marketers of all sizes to find each other and form a compensated relationship.
Since our inception in 2006, we have worked diligently to establish and leverage key strengths in our business model, including:
A culture of innovation and creativity. We believe the only way to survive and thrive in our rapidly changing world is to change ahead of it. We are in a state of constant evolution and re-invention; this is “The IZEA Way.” We have created a culture committed to innovation and creativity that challenges convention and breaks new ground. IZEA team members are protective and proud of our culture by applying its “humble, yet hungry” attitude to all facets of our business. Our people and their innovations ultimately provide us with our largest competitive advantage. 
First-mover advantage with a highly disruptive business model. We believe that by pioneering the social sponsorship space and investing heavily in innovation, acquisitions and marketing, we were first to develop positive rapport among creators and marketers alike. This loyalty has resulted in consistent revenue growth and high levels of repeat business.
Scalable and leverageable operations. Our business model allows revenue to be derived in a variety of ways, all of which rely on our marketplace as a hub. We intend to introduce multiple new product offerings within IZEAx to substantially decrease our operations and support expense over time as revenue grows.

Experienced management team, board of directors and strategic advisors. Our management team includes not only a highly experienced team of entrepreneurs and executives from the digital media, technology and entertainment industries, but also outstanding strategic advisory board members who are experts in social media and integrated marketing campaigns. See “Management” for details.
Our Growth Strategy 
After ten years of working in and developing the influencer and content marketing categories, we believe our business model is market-tested and ready for growth. Our development efforts have included assembling a diverse and experienced senior management team and engineering team, launching and optimizing our proprietary marketplaces, developing a cross-platform sales force and refining our message to the market. Key elements of our strategy to accelerate revenue growth and continue product development include: 
An integrated approach. We believe we are the only company that can currently provide both custom content creation and influencer marketing at scale. It is our opinion that this provides a significant advantage for us in the market and we have already seen strong sales response to proposals that include both content and sponsored social. Moving forward we believe that content revenues will play a significant role in IZEA’s growth.
Large client services team. We expect the growth of our client development team to be the primary driver of near-term revenues. We have been developing a comprehensive on-boarding and on-going education curriculum that led to record bookings in 2016. We intend to add additional client development personnel who receive a commission for meeting sales targets to more effectively service customers throughout North America. These individuals will be based across our various offices in Winter Park, Chicago, Los Angeles and Toronto. 
Strategic partnerships. We continue to develop strategic partnerships and reseller agreements with companies that can provide additional growth in our base of creators and marketers. IZEAx is designed to be easily “white labeled,” allowing partners to operate their own “node” on the exchange. IZEAx is also designed to be resold by partners that do not require a custom-branded solution. 
Product development. We will continue to recruit additional engineering and product innovation team members to enhance IZEAx to develop new technology ideas within this platform that complement our mission as a company. In 2017, we intend to focus our efforts on building functionality to meet partner demand, developing our mobile app and unlocking additional revenue generating opportunities utilizing our existing platforms and users through initiatives such as SocialLinks and ContentAmp.
Accretive acquisitions. We continually seek to identify and acquire companies, technologies and assets to add to our portfolio of software services that will drive additional near and long-term revenue. In July 2011, we acquired Germany’s Magpie Twitter advertising network that included a large network of marketers and Twitter creators in multiple countries. In December 2012, we acquired FeaturedUsers, one of the first advertising networks specifically designed to help Twitter users grow their followers. 
In January 2015, we acquired Ebyline, Inc., an online marketplace that enables publishers to access a network of over 15,000 content creators ranging from writers to illustrators in 84 countries. Over 2,000 fully vetted individuals in the Ebyline network have professional journalism credentials with backgrounds at well-known media outlets. Ebyline’s proprietary workflow is utilized by leading media organizations to manage the entire customer content creation process - from creator selection through electronic payment. In addition to publishers, Ebyline is leveraged by marketers to produce custom branded content for use on their owned and operated sites, as well as third party content marketing and native advertising efforts. The Ebyline technology platform has been used by publishers and brands to manage their content projects. 
In July 2016, we acquired ZenContent, which developed a proprietary custom content marketing technology platform to facilitate the creation of high volume original content for businesses. ZenContent services a number of Fortune 500 e-commerce customers, amongst others. ZenContent’s proprietary tools ingest full product databases, source creators and provide quality assurance for custom content projects, making product listings friendlier for consumers and more indexable for search. Outside of e-commerce, ZenContent also works with leading online publishers for the production of articles and text updates, including a real-time application program interface (API) that enables production of content for rapid publishing of news stories and augmentation of consumer content.

Customers
As of December 31, 2016, we had more than 810,000 user connections from 539,000 user accounts in IZEAx. The approximate aggregate reach of those user connections is 4.7 billion, which represents the total number of non-unique fans and followers of IZEAx users. Creators in our system include leading social influencers to accredited journalists.
In the case of our managed marketers, we typically enter into a master agreement. Under the master agreement, the marketer may submit one or more insertion orders pursuant to which we provide services for production of requested content specifically for the marketer or for advertising through our creator's network of social media connections. The master agreement, according to our standard terms, is terminable by us or our customers upon 30 days prior written notice or immediately if a material breach has occurred that is not promptly cured. Fees under the master agreement are typically payable within 30 days after the date of our invoice in accordance with the terms agreed to in the applicable statement of work. The master agreement additionally provides for standard service disclaimers and limitations of liability for our benefit, as well as a reciprocal confidentiality provision. We also enter into agreements with “self-service" customers who agree to our terms of service available on the applicable online platform when they create their account. These self-service customers do not separately enter into a master agreement with us.
We provide services to customers in multiple industry segments, including consumer products, retail/eTail, technology and travel. Our customers are predominantly located in the United States followed by Canada, India, the United Kingdom and over 150 other countries. Our business serves advertising and public relations agencies, as well as brands and businesses directly. In many cases, influencer marketing dollars flow through the advertising or public relations agency, even when we have a direct relationship with the brand. 
We have only one customer who accounts for 10% or more of our revenues in recent years. Gannett Co. Inc., acquired by Journal Media Group, Inc. in April 2016, accounted for 9.97% and 14.03%, of our revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Sales and Marketing
We primarily sell social sponsorship and custom content campaigns through our sales team, our self-service platforms and, to a lesser extent, by utilizing distribution relationships such as resellers, affiliates and white label partners. We target regional, national and global brands and advertising agencies in the following ways:
Client Development Team.  We have a client development team each of whom is assigned a geographic region or specific marketers, primarily within the United States. The team members are responsible for identifying and managing sales opportunities in their respective target areas.
Business Development Team.  We have a business development team that develops and maintains partnerships with independent resellers and distribution partners who are responsible for selling one or more of our platforms under an independent contractor relationship. We maintain two types of reseller relationships: resellers and white label partners. Resellers focus their efforts on selling a variety of marketers in geographies around the world. White label partners are complementary relationships that add additional marketers and creators to our network. We intend to increase our number of resellers and white label partners under the IZEAx technology platform.
Self-Service Platforms.  Announced at IZEAFest in February 2017, ContentAmp was developed as a self-service marketplace to enable marketers and publishers of all sizes to independently access our network of creators for performance-oriented content syndication. The Ebyline platform also serves as self-service marketplace for publishers and agencies of all sizes to independently access our network of journalists a request the creation of custom content. Self-service customers extend our global reach and increase deal flow. 
Referral Program. As more marketers contribute opportunities into our marketplaces, we believe we will increase the breadth and depth of the monetization value offered to our creators, attracting more creators to enroll into our platforms and thereby enhancing the value of our platforms to future marketers. IZEAx contains a program designed to compensate social media content creators for referring other creators to join these platforms. In these programs, we incur the cost to pay a referral fee to the referrer equal to 2.5%-10% of the referee's earnings for up to a two-year period. Directly trackable creator referrals are new creator signups that we receive as the result of a current creator sharing a unique tracking link to our platform. The link allows us to determine how a new creator learned about our platform. We paid referral fees to creators approximating $70,000 and $46,000 in the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. These programs amplify our marketing dollars and decrease the investment required to attract new creators.

Industry Acumen. Our team possesses a strong marketing and advertising background. We focus our corporate marketing efforts on increasing brand awareness, communicating each of our platform advantages, generating qualified leads for our sales team and growing our creator network. Our corporate marketing plan is designed to continually elevate awareness of our brand and generate demand for social sponsorship. We rely on a number of channels in this area, including tradeshows, third party social media platforms (e.g., Facebook and Twitter), IZEA-hosted community events, paid searches, content marketing, influencer marketing and our corporate websites.
Revenue Model
We derive revenue from three sources: revenue from a marketer when it pays for a social media publisher or influencer such as a blogger or tweeter ("creators") to share sponsored content with their social network audience ("Sponsored Revenue"), revenue when a publisher or company purchases custom branded content for its own use, as well as third party content marketing and native advertising efforts ("Content Revenue") and revenue derived from various service and license fees charged to users of our platforms ("Service Fee Revenue"). 
We earn Sponsored Revenue either on a per post or action basis from opportunities created by marketers using our platforms or on an advertising campaign basis where we manage the entire campaign for our customers, often using multiple platforms to accomplish a full influencer marketing campaign. Marketers may prepay for services by placing a deposit in their account with us.  The deposits are typically paid by the marketer through the use of checks, wire transfers or credit cards. Typically, for each dollar a marketer spends with us for sponsored services, approximately 50% of it goes to our social media content creators. Celebrity creators typically retain a higher percentage of each transaction due to the higher base price associated with these sponsorships. 
Sponsored Revenue is recognized and considered earned after a marketer's sponsored content is posted through IZEAx and shared through a creator's social network for a requisite period of time. The requisite period ranges from 3 days for a tweet to 30 days for a blog, video or other form of custom content. Revenue is only recorded upon successful completion of these actions. If the action was not successful, the marketer's account would not be charged and no revenue would be recorded. IZEAx can be activated and used in a self-service fashion or with the assistance of our account management team. Management fees related to Sponsored Revenue from advertising campaigns managed by us are recognized ratably over the term of the campaign which may range from a few days to months. Sponsored Revenue accounted for 61% and 60% of our total revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Content Revenue is recognized when the content is delivered to and accepted by the customer. Content revenue accounted for 37% and 39% of our total revenue during the twelve months ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Service Fee Revenue is generated when fees are charged to customers primarily related to subscription fees for different levels of service within a platform, licensing fees for white-label use of IZEAx, early cash-out fees if a creator wishes to take proceeds earned for services from their account when the account balance is below certain minimum balance thresholds and inactivity fees for dormant accounts. We set certain minimum cash-out balance thresholds, typically $50, to encourage creators to help us better manage the time, Paypal fees and administrative costs that are associated with each cash-out by creators. Once a creator's account balance exceeds the minimum balance, they can request to be paid without incurring a fee. Service Fee Revenue is recognized immediately when the service is performed or at the time an account becomes dormant or is cashed out. Service Fee Revenue for subscription or licensing fees are recognized straight-line over the term of service. Self-service marketers must prepay for services by placing a deposit in their account with us.  The deposits are typically paid by the marketer via credit card. Marketers who use us to manage their social advertising campaigns or custom content requests may prepay for services or request credit terms. Payments received or billings in advance of services are recorded as unearned revenue until earned as described above. Service Fee Revenue accounted for 2% and 1% of our total revenue during the twelve months ended ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
As IZEAx continues to gain adoption from our marketers, creators and partners in future periods, we anticipate additional forms of revenue streams including subscription fees, listing fees, licensing fees and sponsored search fees as a result of new functionality built into the platform. 
We were able to achieve gross margins on all our products of approximately 48% and 40% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. As part of our commitment to increase shareholder value, we are constantly seeking methods to further increase margins by implementing technology advancements and adjusting our revenue mix to focus on higher margin opportunities. The mix of sales between our higher margin managed services for Sponsored Revenue and our lower margin self-service workflow portion of Content Revenue has a significant affect on our overall gross profit 
6

percentage. As a result of the changes in our sales mix and an increase in managed services, we expect that our margins will average 47% to 48% for the foreseeable future. 
Technology 
IZEAx spans multiple social networks, blogs and YouTube. We aggregate our creators in IZEAx which allows us to create scale and targeting for our marketers. We provide the ability to target our creators based on a variety of software rules and filters. We provide self-service platforms that service all business types and sizes. Unlike traditional public relations, marketers only pay for completed posts. We provide trackable results by automatically embedding tracking links and pixels, as well as support, for third-party tracking (such as DART). We also provide dashboards for real-time reporting, providing immediate feedback. 
Privacy and Security
We are committed to protecting the privacy, reputations and dignity of our marketers and creators. Accordingly, we have invested heavily in many areas to prevent the misuse of information that we collect. We do not misuse personally identifiable information that we collect and we use reasonable and suitable physical, electronic and managerial safeguards to protect such information. 
Product Development
Our product development team is responsible for platform and infrastructure development, application development, user interface and application design, enterprise connectivity, Internet applications and design, quality assurance, documentation and release management. One of our core strengths is our knowledge of and experience in launching and operating scalable influencer marketing marketplaces. Our product development expenses, consisting primarily of salaries paid to development personnel and included in general and administrative expenses, were approximately $2,738,000 and $1,942,000 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
We launched a public beta version of IZEA.com powered by The IZEA Exchange (IZEAx) in March 2014 and unveiled our latest version 2.0 of the platform in February 2017. IZEAx is designed to provide a unified ecosystem that enables the creation of multiple types of content including blog posts, status updates, videos and photos through a wide variety of social channels including blogs, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram and Tumblr, among others. The system is available to our customers and partners via a self-serve portal, as a managed service or as a licensed white label. We continue to add new features and additional functionality to this platform each year. These new features will enable our platform to facilitate the contracting, workflow and delivery of direct content as well as provide for invoicing, collaborating and direct payments for our SaaS customers. We incurred and capitalized software development costs of $471,219 and $452,571 in our balance sheet during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively.
Our team believes that constant innovation is the only way to achieve long-term growth and our intention is to focus all of our engineering resources on the IZEAx platform for the foreseeable future. We intend to continue to invest in the creation of new technology additions that complement our core offerings. 
Competition 
We face competition from multiple companies in the social sponsorship industry. Direct and indirect competitors in the social sponsorship space include Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, BlogHer, TapInfluence and Collective Bias. We also face competition in the content space from companies such as Contently, Newscred and Scripted. In addition, there are a number of agencies, public relations firms and niche consultancies that provide content development and conduct manual influencer outreach programs.
Competition for advertising placements among current and future suppliers of Internet navigational and informational services, high traffic websites and social sponsorship providers, as well as competition with other media for native advertising placements, could result in significant price competition, declining margins and reductions in advertising revenue. In addition, as we continue our efforts to expand the scope of our services with IZEAx, we may compete with a greater number of other companies across an increasing range of different services, including in vertical markets where competitors may have advantages in expertise, brand recognition and other areas. If existing or future competitors develop or offer products or services that provide significant performance, price, creative or other advantages over those offered by us, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively affected. 
7

We also compete with traditional advertising media such as direct mail, television, radio, cable and print for a share of marketers' total advertising budgets. Many current and potential competitors enjoy competitive advantages over us, such as longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases, greater access to advertising space on high-traffic websites, and significantly greater financial, technical, sales and marketing resources. 
Proprietary Rights
Proprietary rights are important to our success and our competitive position. To protect our proprietary rights, we rely on intellectual property and trade secret laws, confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions.
We currently own 31 domestic trademark registrations, 13 foreign registrations, and have 7 total pending applications (3 in the United States and 4 foreign). We have abandoned approximately 20 other U.S. applications. In the United States, we own 31 trademarks registered with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), including "Blogger's Choice Awards," "Champion the Creators," "Connecting Creators and Brands," “ContentAmp,” “Ebyline,” "FanAds," "Get Everyone Talking," “Influence Rank,” "InPostLinks," "IZEA," "IZEA Exchange," "IZEAx," "Native Ad Exchange," "PayPerPost," "Postie," "Selective Syndication," “ShareMonitor,” "SocialSpark," "SoundAmp," "Sponsored Music," "Sponsored Social," “Sponsored Stream,” "Sponsorship Marketplace," "Staree," “The Content Marketplace,” "The Creator Marketplace," "Total Social Value,""Virtual Newsroom," "We Reward (Design)," and have acquired “ZenContent.” We also own foreign trademark registrations for "Izea" on the International Register in Argentina, Australia, Canada, China, Colombia, Cuba, Japan, New Zealand, Norway, Russian Federation, Switzerland, and the European Union.
In addition to these registered marks, we currently have 4 pending foreign applications for the mark "Izea" in Brazil, Iceland, Israel, and Mexico, with the intention of filing additional applications in both the U.S. and foreign countries where we have a bona fide commercial interest.
We also own approximately 470 domain names related to the various aspects of IZEA’s products and services.
We actively protect our intellectual property rights, but have encountered challenges following the U.S. Supreme Court decision in Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank International, 573 U.S. __, 134 S. Ct. 2347 (2014) and Intellectual Ventures I LLC vs. Symantec Corp. (Fed. Cir. 2016),which changed the patent environment for software-based applications. As a result, given the difficulty in overcoming USPTO rejections of certain of the Corporation's pending patent applications, management decided not to actively pursue the remaining patent applications but to let them naturally expire over the coming months. We met with similar resistance in Australia, Canada, and the European Union, and so have abandoned pursuit of those applications as well. However, IZEA has a pending foreign patent application in Brazil which it retains. 
We cannot provide any assurance that our proprietary rights with respect to our products or services will be viable or have value in the future since the validity, enforceability and type of protection of proprietary rights in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.
Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Policing unauthorized use of our products is difficult, and while we are unable to determine the extent to which piracy of our software products exists, software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States, and effective copyright, trademark, trade secret and patent protection may not be available in those jurisdictions. Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate to protect us from the infringement or misappropriation of such rights by others.
Further, in recent years, there has been significant litigation in the United States involving patents and other intellectual property rights, particularly in the software and Internet-related industries. We can and have been subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our products and services overlap with competitive offerings. These claims, even if not meritorious, could be expensive to defend and could divert management's attention from operating our Company. If we become liable to third parties for infringing their intellectual property rights, we could be required to pay a substantial award of damages and to develop non-infringing technology, obtain a license or cease selling the products that contain the infringing intellectual property. We may be unable to develop non-infringing technology or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms, if at all.

Government Regulation
We are subject to a number of foreign and domestic laws and regulations that affect companies conducting business on the Internet, many of which are still evolving and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. In the United States and abroad, laws relating to the liability of providers of online services for activities of their users and other third parties are currently being tested by a number of claims. These regulations and laws may involve taxation, tariffs, creator privacy, data protection, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and other communications, consumer protection, the provision of online payment services and the characteristics and quality of services. It is not entirely clear how existing laws which govern issues such as property ownership, taxation, export or import matters and personal privacy apply to the Internet, as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet or e-commerce. In addition, it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our platforms or may even attempt to completely block access to our platforms. Accordingly, adverse legal or regulatory developments could substantially harm our business.
Many states have passed laws requiring notification to subscribers when there is a security breach of personally identifiable data. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection. In addition, data protection laws in Europe and other jurisdictions outside the United States can be more restrictive than those within the United States, and the interpretation and application of these laws are still uncertain and in flux. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. If so, in addition to the possibility of fines, this could result in an order requiring that we change and/or abandon certain of our then-existing data practices, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has provisions that limit, but do not necessarily eliminate, our liability for linking to third-party websites that contain materials which infringe copyrights or other intellectual property rights of third parties, so long as we comply with the statutory requirements of this act. Complying with these various laws could cause us to incur substantial costs or require us to change our business practices in a manner adverse to our business.
We, as any e-commerce service provider are subject to FTC and various state rules and regulations on advertising and marketing on the Internet. In certain cases, we are retained by marketers to manage their advertising campaigns through our platforms, thereby increasing our exposure as not only the service provider but also the medium through which advertisements are broadcast. In addition to those requirements, the marketers, creators, and agencies that use our platforms are subject to specific guidance and regulations regarding online advertising, such as the FTC's Dot Com Disclosures - Information about Online Advertising, the FTC’s Enforcement Policy Statement on Deceptively Formatted Advertisements, issued in 2015, and its Guides Concerning the Use of Endorsements and Testimonials in Advertising (known as the Guides) that were updated and reissued by the FTC in 2013, and further clarified in 2015. Each of the foregoing are sub-categories that have been taken up by the FTC under the FTC Act to prevent "unfair or deceptive acts and practices" within advertising. These new Guides, for example, significantly extend the scope of potential liability associated with the use of testimonials and endorsements, including injecting endorsement requirements into advertising methods such as blogging and other online posting of sponsored advertisements by a creator. In particular, the Guides provide creators must always disclose the material connection between the creator and the marketer, such as if they received consideration for blogging or posting about a particular product, service, brand or the like, whether the consideration comprises something tangible (i.e., cash, discounts, objects that are provided to them at no cost, even for testing purposes) or intangible (such as accolades and more prominent future blogging or posting opportunities). In addition, the creator must not make claims about the product or service he or she is discussing that go beyond what the marketer could say about the product or service. The Guides further provide that the marketer should ensure that creators speaking on its behalf are provided guidance and training needed to ensure their claims, statements and representations are truthful, transparent and properly substantiated, and monitor the activities of creators speaking on its behalf. In the event a creator, blogger, agency or marketer should fail to comply with the Dot Com Disclosures, the Guides or any other FTC rule, regulation or policy, which may be manifest by making deceptive, misleading or unsubstantiated claims and representations, failing to disclose a sponsorship relationship or otherwise, then various parties related to the advertising campaign (including the service provider of the platform over which the campaign is managed) may be subject to liability as a result of such non-compliance. In the event it was found that we (or an marketer customer) failed to comply with the FTC Act or state advertising rules, it could result in the potential imposition of equitable redress or penalties that could include monetary damages, a modification of certain business practices, or an order to cease certain aspects of our operations.
More generally, if there is negative consumer perception and mistrust of the practice of undisclosed compensation to creators to endorse the marketers' specific products, then this could result in a reduction by marketers in the use of influencer marketing platforms like ours as a means for advertising which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results.

We follow the 1995 European Union Data Protection Directive with regard to data we collect from users located in the European Union and are currently monitoring changes required by the recently adopted General Data Protection Regulation, which will supersede the Data Protection Directive as of May 25, 2018, to ensure that we are compliant with relevant requirements when and to the extent they are implemented.
As a governing member of a leading marketing and advertising industry association, the Word of Mouth Marketing Association (WOMMA), we are committed to promoting ethical social sponsorship practices and have established terms of service for users of our platforms which refer to the FTC Guides and include one or more of the following:
Mandatory Disclosure. We mandate disclosure of the sponsored relationship between the marketer and creator. A sponsorship cannot be published through the platform unless a phrase or paragraph disclosing the sponsored relationship is included. For example, a creator is required to select one of a number of disclosure phrases such as “sponsored,” “advertisement” or “ad” prior to the publication of a tweet or a post. Other social sponsorship forms may be monitored through a Disclosure Audit tool that monitors posts on an ongoing basis to make sure they continue to include disclosure after the initial posts are approved. Failure to disclose the sponsored relationship is a violation of our terms of service, which may result in the withholding of payment for the sponsorship and the creator being removed from our network.
Freedom of Choice. Creators are free to choose which sponsorships to publish. Our platforms do not auto-inject an marketer's message into an influencer's social media network.
Authentic Voice. We encourage honesty of opinion in the selection of sponsorships by a creator and similarly we encourage marketers to create opportunities that allow the creator to write the sponsorship in their own words, provided that a creator always adheres to our terms of service and code of ethics which includes disclosing their sponsored relationships at all times while using any of the platforms.
Transparency of Identity. Our platforms are designed to be open, safe environment for our marketers, creators and users. In fact, we do not cloak the identities of marketers or creators. Both parties involved in a potential transaction can see each other's profiles and make informed decisions before engaging with each other.
Pre-Publication Marketer Review.  Marketers may choose to review their sponsored content before it is published and to request a change to the sponsored content prior to publication in the case of factual inaccuracies.
Reporting Violations.  We have zero tolerance for violations of our terms of service and encourage the reporting of violations directly to IZEA. If violations are reported, we promptly investigate them and in appropriate cases, marketers, creators and users are removed from our network and prohibited from using our sites. In addition, we take an active role in reporting spam accounts to Twitter and Facebook.
We also believe, and have subsequently included requirements within our terms of service, based on positions taken by certain federal courts and the FTC, that communications and messages disseminated by creators through social media networks are subject to and must comply at all times with CAN-SPAM Act (Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act) requirements.
To date, we have not been materially impacted by the rules governing messaging over social media networks and social sponsorship, including the CAN-SPAM Act and the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. However, we cannot predict the impact of future regulations on us, our marketers or our creators that use our platforms or the impact of attempts to circumvent our mechanisms that are designed to ensure compliance.
Employees
As of March 24, 2017, we had a total of 135 full-time employees, including 92 in sales and marketing, 30 in product engineering and 13 in administration and finance. None of our employees are represented by a collective bargaining agreement, nor have we experienced any work stoppage. We consider our relations with our employees to be good. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified engineers, graphic designers, computer scientists, sales and marketing and senior management personnel.
