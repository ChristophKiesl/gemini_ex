Item 1. | Business
--------+---------

Overview
 
Ribbit LEAP, Ltd., which stands for Ribbit Capital Long-Term Equity Acquisition Pool is a blank check company formed in July 2020 as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our initial business combination. To date, our efforts have been limited to our organizational activities and activities related to the Initial Public Offering and the identification and evaluation of prospective acquisition targets for our initial business combination. We have generated no operating revenues to date and we do not expect to generate operating revenues until we consummate our initial business combination.
 
On September 15, 2020, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 40,250,000 units, which included the full exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase an additional 5,250,000 units to cover over-allotments, with each unit consisting of one Class A ordinary share, $0.0001 par value per share, and one-fifth of one redeemable warrant, each whole public warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one Class A ordinary share at an exercise price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to us of $402,500,000.
 
Simultaneous with the Initial Public Offering and the issuance and sale of the units, we consummated the private placement of 1,005,000 Class A ordinary shares at a price of $10.00 per share, generating total proceeds of approximately $10.1 million. The private placement shares are identical to the Class A ordinary shares in the Initial Public Offering, except that if held by the sponsor or its permitted transferees, they are subject to a letter agreement in which they agree to certain restrictions on the transfer of the private placement shares until the earlier of (1) one year after the completion of the initial business combination and (2) the date following the initial business combination on which the company completes a liquidation, merger, share exchange, reorganization or other similar transaction that results in the public shareholders having the right to exchange their ordinary shares.
 
Upon the consummation of the Initial Public Offering and the private placement, a total of $402.5 million was deposited in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company, acting as trustee. Transaction costs of the Initial Public Offering and the private placement amounted to approximately $22.9 consisting of approximately $0.8 million in offering expenses, $8.1 million in underwriting fees and approximately $14.1 million of deferred underwriting fees. Funds held in the trust account have been invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of one hundred and eighty-five (185) days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), which invest only in direct U.S. government obligations. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds in the trust account that may be released to us to pay income taxes, if any, the proceeds from the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement shares held in the trust account will not be released from the trust account (1) to us until the completion of its initial business combination or (2) to our public shareholders, until the earliest of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination, and then only in connection with those Class A ordinary shares that such shareholders properly elect to redeem, subject to certain limitations, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a (i) shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of its obligation to provide holders of its Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with its initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or 27 months from the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (ii) with respect to any other provisions relating to shareholders’ rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares or pre-initial business combination activity and (c) the redemption of all of our public shares if we have not completed our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or 27 months from the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the Initial Public Offering, subject to applicable law.

Simultaneously with the Initial Public Offering, LEAP Ribbit Opportunity VI, LLC, an affiliate of our sponsor, entered into a forward purchase agreement with us that will provide for the purchase by the affiliate of our sponsor of an aggregate of 10,000,000 Class A ordinary shares and 2,000,000 redeemable warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of $100,000,000, or $10.00 per one Class A ordinary share and one-fifth of one redeemable warrant, in a private placement to close substantially concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. The obligations under the forward purchase agreement will not depend on whether any Class A ordinary shares are redeemed by our public shareholders. The Class A ordinary shares and redeemable warrants issuable pursuant to the forward purchase agreement will be identical to the Class A ordinary shares and redeemable warrants included in the units in the Initial Public Offering, respectively, except that the affiliate of our sponsor will have certain registration rights, as described herein.
 
While we may pursue a business combination target in any business, industry, sector or geographical location, we are focusing our search for an initial business combination in the intersection of financial services and technology globally. We may pursue a transaction in which our shareholders immediately prior to the completion of our initial business combination would collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company.
 
Our Sponsor and Guiding Principles
 
Our sponsor is an affiliate of Ribbit Capital, a family of investment funds based in Palo Alto, California, focused on the intersection of financial services and technology. Ribbit Capital was founded in 2012 by Meyer “Micky” Malka, an entrepreneur and investor with over 25 years of experience building and investing in technology and financial services businesses throughout the world. Ribbit Capital manages more than $2.6 billion of committed capital on behalf of its investors, many of which have been with Ribbit Capital since inception. The mission of Ribbit Capital is to change the world of finance by providing capital and guidance to visionary financial services entrepreneurs. To that end, Ribbit Capital has built a portfolio of over 75 private and public company investments across six continents and a multitude of sectors within financial services, including payments, personal finance, investments and wealth, lending, insurance, crypto assets, financial infrastructure, financial software, and home finance. Ribbit Capital’s investments include such leaders in these sectors as Affirm, Inc., Brex Inc., Coalition, Inc., Coinbase, Inc., Credit-Karma, Inc. CRB Group, Inc. (which does business as Cross River Bank), Dhani Services Limited (formerly Indiabulls Ventures Limited) (NSE: DHANI), Figure Technologies, Inc., MercadoLibre, Inc. (NASDAQ:MELI), Next Insurance, Inc., Nu Holdings Ltd. (which does business as Nubank), Revolut Ltd., Robinhood Markets, Inc., Root, Inc., Sea Limited (NYSE:SE), Viva Republica Inc. (which does business as Toss), Upgrade, Inc., and Zillow Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZG).
 
Ribbit Capital strives to be more than a source of financial capital to entrepreneurs. Prior to Ribbit Capital, Mr. Malka was a founder to multiple companies across banking, brokerage, and payments and led them to successful exits. Since founding Ribbit Capital, he and his team have built a robust family of investment funds which has provided the opportunity to invest and partner with several of the top financial technology companies of the past decade. This background allows Ribbit Capital to approach entrepreneurs as collaborators, offering data, perspectives, and lessons learned in innovative financial businesses across geographies and over time. By applying this partnership orientation and operator mentality, Ribbit Capital is able to create meaningful, lasting relationships with entrepreneurs. Ribbit Capital has demonstrated a strong track record as an investment manager for its nine flagship closed-end private funds and its several special purpose vehicles. The compound annual rate of return of its aggregate portfolio—as measured by the ratio of the fair market value of Ribbit Capital’s portfolio and distributions to the aggregate paid in capital of all of the funds it manages—has materially exceeded the upper quartile of its benchmark, the U.S. Venture Capital Index per Cambridge Associates, from the day Ribbit Capital started through December 31, 2020. Ribbit Capital’s performance is consistent across its fund vintages, with each of its flagship funds over two years old delivering a compound annual rate of return to investors of more than 30% before fees and expenses.

The following principles underpin the culture and organization of Ribbit Capital, and serve as the foundation for Ribbit LEAP:
 
We are mission-oriented. We believe that technology has the potential to make finance more transparent and accessible across the world. Driven by this belief, we are focused on helping to build the financial services brands of tomorrow. Consistency allows us to develop informed, data-rich perspectives on industry trends and business models. Our depth in the space leads to stronger relationships with entrepreneurs and investors and to wider visibility into investment opportunities, as evidenced by the more than 5,000 companies that we monitor worldwide across financial technology.
 
We are patient. We believe that enduring financial services companies cannot be built overnight. We underwrite each investment with a decade-plus investment horizon and aspire to invest in assets that we would be willing to hold indefinitely. When working with companies, our focus is on compounding sources of value rather than short-term earnings performance. This mentality aligns with the technology- and customer-centric mentality of the entrepreneurs and management teams with whom we partner and allows us to invest in opportunities that grow exponentially rather than linearly.
 
We align ourselves with our partners. We believe that we succeed when our partners succeed. We aim to act as principals, not agents. We make large financial commitments to the funds we manage; as a result, our team members are among Ribbit Capital’s largest individual limited partners. Similarly, we look to work with management teams with significant ownership in their own companies. We use the products and services offered by our portfolio and invest in people and brands we are proud to recommend to close friends. In our business, and in financial services more broadly, we believe getting the incentives right is half of the battle.
 
We chart our own course. We believe in making principles-based decisions. Historically, this has served us well and contributed to many of the key choices underlying our track record. In structuring Ribbit LEAP, we sought to employ the same independent thinking, designing a structure that we feel provides value both to shareholders and to partners in an initial business combination. We expect that our long-term approach, encapsulated in Ribbit Capital’s track record as well as Ribbit LEAP’s structure, will afford us a substantial competitive advantage relative to other blank check companies.
 
We believe Ribbit LEAP is a natural extension of Ribbit Capital’s mission to invest in visionary financial services entrepreneurs across stages—from initial idea and early stage venture to growth capital and the public markets. Ribbit LEAP intends to partner only with world-class entrepreneurs, providing them with a significant amount of flexible capital and guiding them in their transition from the private to the public markets. Ribbit LEAP is designed to deliver a differentiated combination of private market-style partnership and public market capital.
 
Market Opportunity and the State of Financial Technology
 
Ribbit Capital was founded on the thesis that, in the decades to come, trillions of dollars of market value will shift from the financial services incumbents to their technology-led challengers. Underpinning this thesis is our view that incumbent financial services brands have not kept pace with new technologies and evolving customer expectations. Financial crises across different geographies over the past 12 years created opportunities for consumers to reconsider their trust in traditional financial institutions, and the smartphone provided a new platform through which financial products and services could be delivered directly to willing customers. Since June 2012, we estimate that more than $500 billion of market capitalization has been captured by financial services challengers that have accessed the public markets. While this transition is impressive, we believe it is still in its early days, and Ribbit LEAP is well positioned to take advantage of this trend. 
 
Our conviction in the future growth of financial technology in the public markets is informed by the following factors.
 
• Large and growing addressable market. The financial services sector is one of the largest contributors to GDP worldwide. The 20 largest financial services companies alone generated $335 billion of net income in 2018. This rapid pace of growth has been driven by the increasing digitization of financial services, product innovation, and the broadening application of financial offerings across a range of marketplaces and software companies.

• Business model dynamics give rise to category winners. Financial services and technology are industries that disproportionately benefit from highly scaled brands and platforms, particularly due to the importance of trust. Scale also drives a flywheel effect of increasing efficiency, which allows platforms to pass on savings and deliver differentiated products and services to their end markets. This has given rise to very large players today: of the 102 companies with a market capitalization of $100 billion or more globally as of the third quarter of 2020, 23 of them are technology companies and 20 of them are financial services companies, and together they constitute 56% of the $22 trillion of market value of all companies worth more than $100 billion. This compares to 34% of the $5 trillion of market value of companies that met that same criteria in 1999. Furthermore, since 1999, there have been approximately 18 financial services companies that have grown to a market capitalization of $100 billion or greater and 156 financial services companies that have grown to a market capitalization of $10 billion or greater across the public and private markets. 
 
• Accelerating private market activity creates a pipeline for the public markets. Value created in the private market may be a leading indicator for future investment opportunities in the public markets. Between 2018 and 2019, approximately $75 billion of venture capital was invested into financial technology, or fintech, according to CB Insights. Late-stage fintech fundraising in particular has accelerated, with over $16 billion of capital invested in 2018 and 2019 alone, according to PitchBook. Of the 580 global “unicorns,” or venture-backed businesses with valuations greater than $1 billion, 90 are in fintech. The collective valuation of these fintech unicorns is nearly $500 billion. Many of them have decided to stay private for longer than they otherwise would have given the easy availability of private capital funding. We believe these fintech unicorns—and many high quality, potential unicorns—could benefit from a public listing as an efficient way to increase liquidity, expand access to capital, and improve branding and we are positioned to provide these fintech platforms with an attractive alternative to enter the public markets.
 
• Blurring lines between fintech and software. In recent years, there has been an increase in the number of technology companies developing financial services offerings to complement their existing offerings, expand customer relationships, and bolster monetization. This convergence of financial services and technology is driving disruption and creating opportunities for challengers to build brands from more and less obvious quarters. The dynamic is clearly visible across several sectors reflected in Ribbit Capital’s investments:
 
E-commerce: E-commerce marketplaces such as MercadoLibre and Sea Group are now embedding payments and lending on their platforms while developing mobile wallets for their customers.
 
Real estate portals: Property listing websites such as Zillow are now buying and selling homes as a principal on their own marketplaces, acting as market makers and offering mortgage, insurance, and closing services.
 
Purchase finance: Point of sale lenders such as Affirm are disintermediating incumbent payment networks and card providers by connecting merchants and consumers via attractive financing offers.
 
Software as a service (“SaaS”): SaaS companies such as Juniper Square are leveraging the data, transaction, and customer flows that run through their systems to offer embedded payments, financing, and insurance products to their clients.
 
Ribbit Capital’s focus on the intersection of financial services and technology has helped us to understand the size of the addressable market across regions and subsectors and the potential for outsized outcomes across stages. This perspective, combined with the investments that Ribbit Capital has made in public companies, has given us confidence in the opportunity for patient and focused public market fintech investors to earn high multiples on invested capital.
 
We further believe that some of the circumstances created by the COVID-19 pandemic presents a new dynamic for investors in fintech generally and for Ribbit LEAP in particular. First, stay-at-home orders and quarantines have meaningfully accelerated the already strong consumer trend toward adoption of digital financial products. Second, companies that are positively indexed to digital financial services have an unprecedented opportunity to take market share through marketing and acquisitions, both of which require large injections of new capital. Third, we believe that many of the private market investors that have backed fintech businesses are increasingly focused on liquidity, which could present attractive risk-adjusted returns to investors with more patient capital. Fourth, we expect that many robust and high-quality businesses have suffered temporary shocks to revenue and cash, which may cause them to seek a larger capital raise than typical in private rounds, thereby driving them to further explore the public markets. Notwithstanding the foregoing, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our search for a business combination, and any partner business with which we ultimately consummate a business combination, may be materially adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the status of debt and equity markets” and the other factors described under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” and “Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” for a discussion of factors that may impact the development of the above-described circumstances.

Our Proposition
 
We believe that Ribbit LEAP offers an attractive proposition when compared with other blank check companies and other sources of equity capital. We bring a singular focus and depth of expertise to financial services and technology. In addition to our expertise, reputation, and network, which taken together gives us a competitive advantage in sourcing and consummating one or more business combinations, we have designed Ribbit LEAP’s structure differently from other blank check companies to more closely align it with Ribbit Capital’s core principles. The key elements of our structure are summarized below and are explained further elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 

Attribute | Conventional SPAC | Ribbit LEAP | Why Ribbit LEAP is better 
Founder shares | · 20% of the ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon the consummation of the offering | · 10% of the ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering excluding private placement shares, Class L ordinary shares which are subject to stock performance vesting conditions | · Less dilution for partner companies absent outsized post-business combination share performance 
Performance-based founder shares | · All founder shares vested, no performance-based test | · Class L ordinary shares, which when combined with the 10% founder shares, total to 30% of the ordinary shares issued and outstanding upon the consummation of our Initial Public Offering · Class L ordinary shares vest in four equal tranches upon achieving outsized share performance, at $20.00, $30.00, $40.00, and $50.00 per share (but only following the one-year anniversary of our initial business combination) · Class L ordinary shares also vest upon the consummation of certain strategic transactions following our initial business combination dependent on the effective price per Class A ordinary share | · Downside and upside are shared with investors because sponsor economics only begin to exceed those of a conventional SPAC with 20% founder shares when the stock trades above $30 per ordinary share · High vesting thresholds create long-term commitment

Sponsor at-risk investment | · Purchase of private placement warrants with similar terms to public warrants, in the money with just a 15% increase in stock price | · No warrants; Class A ordinary shares purchased at $10 per share | · Simplifies the transaction and pro forma capital structure 
Rights for founder shares | · 20% of the vote for the initial business combination | · 20% of the vote for the initial business combination | · Creates closer alignment with management teams looking for a partner 
 | · Board rights determined in the initial business combination negotiation | · Right to appoint one-fifth (rounded up to the nearest whole number) of the members of our board of directors following our initial business combination | · Aligns Ribbit LEAP’s governance rights to both performance and “skin in the game” 
Forward purchase agreement | · If included, often structured as an “up to” commitment | · $100 million minimum commitment from an affiliate of our sponsor | · Greater “skin in the game” than a typical offering · Supports confidence in LEAP’s ability to close a transaction 
Term | · 24 months | · 24 months with the ability to extend to an additional 3 months | · Provides greater flexibility to source the most attractive partners 

 
A key tenet of Ribbit Capital’s mantra is that it takes money to change money. We believe that our structure reinforces our value proposition by making Ribbit LEAP a more attractive capital source to companies and a more attractive investment for investors. The combination of our sponsor and our structure provide the following benefits to our partner companies and investors:
 

· | Longevity. We view partnership with management teams as a commitment for a decade or more. Because of this we are focused on long-term value creation, and we seek to partner with investors with the same orientation. Consistent with this posture, we have structured the sponsor economics to be meaningfully weighted to share performance over many years. Furthermore, a substantial majority of the sponsor economics earned will sit within private funds managed by Ribbit Capital (which have an initial term of ten years), rather than being held directly by our management team. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ecosystem: Ribbit Capital’s portfolio includes prominent and innovative fintech platforms and brands globally. Our ideal candidate for a business combination will be able to benefit from connectivity and partnership with this network, which we believe is a key competitive advantage for Ribbit LEAP in consummating a business combination and in the future success of the company. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Alignment. An affiliate of our sponsor has committed a minimum of $100 million of capital in a forward purchase commitment, sitting alongside our investors with “skin in the game.” Traditionally, sponsors of blank check companies purchase 20% of the issued stock at a nominal price that is awarded to the sponsor regardless of performance and solely on the ability to close an initial business combination. We believe this conventional structure creates a misalignment of interest between the sponsor, investors, and the partner in a business combination. We have eschewed this construct to instead earn sponsor economics that better align with price performance. Ribbit Capital will only “break even” with a conventional 20% founder share structure if the stock price trades above $30 per ordinary share, or 200% above the share price of the initial offering. This meaningful capital commitment and performance-based structure will incentivize us to partner with one or more companies that offer the highest quality growth and return potential to investors rather than reward us for merely consummating a business combination. We believe these features will help us attract patient growth-oriented investors, which in turn strengthens the value proposition of Ribbit LEAP.

· | Perspective. Ribbit Capital has a strong track record as a specialist investor and partner at the intersection of financial services and technology. Our focus on fintech provides us with insights and a global network of operators, investors, and regulators that can inform strategic decisions, new product development, and relationship-building with stakeholders. We believe that our hands-on experience as operators and investors in the industry positions us to better evaluate partner companies and to help them maximize value following a business combination.

We believe that Ribbit LEAP offers a structure that is simple, transparent, and fosters alignment for all parties.
 
Our Investment Criteria
 
Our objective is to partner with one or more target companies that we believe will produce the strongest financial returns for our investors over the next decade or longer. In pursuit of this objective, we will measure potential partners against the following business criteria:
 
• World-class management teams. We seek management teams with whom we would be proud to partner for the next decade or more and who have the vision, energy, and execution capability to deliver on our high expectations for growth and franchise value. This is the standard against which Ribbit Capital measures all of the management teams it partners with, whether they are running public or private companies.
 
• Large addressable markets with attractive tailwinds for digital innovators. Financial services profits are large enough in the regions where Ribbit Capital invests to potentially support market capitalizations in the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars for market leaders. Furthermore, across sectors and regions, we see the opportunity for technology to make financial products and services more affordable and accessible for customers. We seek businesses that address these markets.
 
• User adoption suggesting a generational brand is being built. We believe that every new generation of users presents an opportunity to create a defining brand that stretches across multiple sectors within financial services. We seek businesses that show enough traction among their customers where we can see the potential for them to become generational brands.
 
• Significant growth opportunities. In addition to strong organic growth potential, we seek businesses that could meaningfully accelerate growth through new product and technological expertise, business combinations, geographic expansion, and/or a shareholder base that is aligned to long-term growth. We seek businesses for which our capital can fuel this development and growth.
 
• Strong unit economics and profitability visibility. In order to deliver enduring value creation for shareholders, we believe that a business must be profitable or on a clear and easily understood path towards profitability, which is most clearly demonstrated by unit economics that are attractive today. 
 
In addition to these business criteria, any potential acquisition target will be ready or almost ready to operate in the public markets from the perspective of corporate governance, financial reporting, compliance, and anticipated investor receptivity. We believe that evaluating a full universe of companies is important to fulfilling our ultimate objective. As such, we will evaluate companies both in the United States and other regions where we have meaningful relationships, experience, and insight. Furthermore, we will evaluate companies that are new to the Ribbit Capital network, already within the Ribbit Capital network of more than 5,000 companies, and within Ribbit Capital’s portfolio of more than 75 companies.
 
Our Initial Business Combination
 
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) rules and our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require that our initial business combination must be with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount). We refer to this as the 80% net assets test. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the partner business or businesses or we are considering an initial business combination with an affiliated entity, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc., or FINRA, or an independent valuation or accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. Our shareholders may not be provided with a copy of such opinion nor will they be able to rely on such opinion.

14
--

 

While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of a partner business or businesses, it may be unable to do so if the board of directors is less familiar or experienced with the partner company’s business, there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the company’s assets or prospects, including if such company is at an early stage of development, operations or growth, or if the anticipated transaction involves a complex financial analysis or other specialized skills and the board of directors determines that outside expertise would be helpful or necessary in conducting such analysis. Since any opinion, if obtained, would merely state that the fair market value of the partner business meets the 80% of net assets test, unless such opinion includes material information regarding the valuation of a partner business or the consideration to be provided, it is not anticipated that copies of such opinion would be distributed to our shareholders. However, if required under applicable law, any proxy statement that we deliver to shareholders and file with the SEC in connection with a proposed transaction will include such opinion.
 
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-business combination company in which our public shareholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the partner business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-business combination company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the partner business in order to meet certain objectives of the partner management team or shareholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the partner or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the partner sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-business combination company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the partner, our shareholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-business combination company, depending on valuations ascribed to the partner and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a partner. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the partner. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our shareholders immediately prior to the completion of our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a partner business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-business combination company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one partner business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the partner businesses and we will treat the partner businesses together as the initial business combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking shareholder approval, as applicable. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor.
 
We have entered into a forward purchase agreement pursuant to which an affiliate of our sponsor has agreed to subscribe for an aggregate of 10,000,000 forward purchase shares and 2,000,000 forward purchase warrants, for an aggregate purchase price of $100,000,000, or $10.00 per forward purchase share and one-fifth of one forward purchase warrant, in a private placement to close substantially concurrently with the closing of our initial business combination. The capital from such private placement would be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in our initial business combination, and any excess capital from such private placement would be used for working capital in the post-transaction company. The forward purchase shares and the forward purchase warrants are identical to the public shares and public warrants, respectively, except that the holders thereof will have certain registration rights. The forward purchase shares and the forward purchase warrants are subject to the same transfer restrictions as the founder shares. See “Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Shareholder Matters—Transfers of Class B Ordinary Shares, Class L Ordinary Shares, Forward Purchase Securities and Private Placement Shares.”
 
We are not under any obligation to sell any such shares. If we sell shares to our sponsor (or any other investor) in connection with our initial business combination, the equity interest of public investors in the combined company may be diluted and the market prices for our securities may be adversely affected. In addition, if the per share trading price of our ordinary shares is greater than the price per share paid in the private placement, the private placement will result in value dilution to you.

Other Considerations
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with Ribbit Capital, our sponsor, founders, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Ribbit Capital, our sponsor or any of our founders, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent valuation or accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context. 
 
Affiliates of Ribbit Capital and members of our board of directors will directly or indirectly own founder shares, private placement shares and/or Class L ordinary shares following the Initial Public Offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular partner business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers or directors were to be included by a partner business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
 
Ribbit Capital is continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination. We will not consider a business combination with any company that has already been identified to Ribbit Capital as a suitable acquisition candidate for it, unless Ribbit Capital, in its sole discretion, declines such potential business combination or makes available to our company a co-investment opportunity in accordance with Ribbit Capital’s applicable existing and future policies and procedures. Ribbit Capital may manage multiple investment vehicles and raise additional funds and/or successor funds in the future, which may be during the period in which we are seeking our initial business combination. These Ribbit Capital investment entities may be seeking acquisition opportunities and related financing at any time. We may compete with any one or more of them on any given acquisition opportunity.
 
Ribbit Capital or its affiliates, including our sponsor, and our officers and directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an initial business combination. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
 
In addition, certain of our founders, officers and directors presently have, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary and contractual duties to other entities, including without limitation, any future special purpose acquisition companies we expect they may be involved in and investment funds, accounts, co-investment vehicles and other entities managed by affiliates of Ribbit Capital and certain companies in which Ribbit Capital or such entities have invested. As a result, if any of our founders, officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he, she or it has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations (including, without limitation, any future special purpose acquisition companies we expect they may be involved in and any Ribbit Capital funds or other investment vehicles), then, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law, he or she will need to honor such fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, before we can pursue such opportunity. If these funds or investment entities decide to pursue any such opportunity, we may be precluded from pursuing the same. In addition, investment ideas generated within or presented to Ribbit Capital or our founders may be suitable for both us and a current or future Ribbit Capital fund, portfolio company or other investment entity and, subject to applicable fiduciary duties, will first be directed to such fund, portfolio company or other entity before being directed, if at all, to us. None of Ribbit Capital, our founders or any members of our board of directors who are also employed by Ribbit Capital or its affiliates have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware solely in their capacities as officers or executives of Ribbit Capital.

However, we do not expect these duties to materially affect our ability to complete our initial business combination.
 
In addition, our founders, officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. In particular, in the future we expect certain of our officers and directors may be officers and/or directors of other future special purpose acquisition companies.
 
Our Corporate Information
 
Our executive offices are located at 364 University Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94301. We maintain a corporate website at www.ribbitleap.com. The information contained on or accessible through our corporate website or any other website that we may maintain is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equal to or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.

Financial Position
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately $402.6 million held in the trust account, not taking into account $14.1 million of deferred underwriting fees to be paid. With the funds available, we offer a partner business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the partner business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
General
 
We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering, the sale of the private placement shares, our equity, debt or a combination of these as the consideration. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A ordinary shares, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-business combination company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
 
We have reviewed, and continue to review, a number of opportunities to enter into an initial business combination with an operating business, but we are not able to determine at this time whether we will complete an initial business combination with any of the target businesses that we have reviewed or with any other target business. We have not selected any business combination partner. Additionally, we have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate, to conduct any research or take any measures, directly or indirectly, to locate or contact a partner business, other than our officers and directors.
 
Accordingly, there is no current basis for investors to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the partner business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination. Although our founding team will assess the risks inherent in a particular partner business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a partner business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a partner business.
 
We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account, or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. Other than the forward purchase agreement, we are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.
 
Sources of Partner Businesses
 
Our process of identifying acquisition partners will leverage Ribbit Capital’s and our founding team’s industry experiences, proven deal sourcing capabilities and broad and deep network of relationships in numerous industries, including executives and management teams, private equity groups and other institutional investors, large business enterprises, lenders, investment bankers and other investment market participants, restructuring advisers, consultants, attorneys and accountants, which we believe should provide us with a number of business combination opportunities. We expect that the collective experience, capability and network of Ribbit Capital and our founders, directors and officers, combined with their individual and collective reputations in the investment community, will help to create prospective business combination opportunities.

In addition, we anticipate that partner business candidates may be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and private investment funds. Partner businesses may be brought to our attention by such unaffiliated sources as a result of being solicited by us through calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to partner businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read this Annual Report on Form 10-K and know what types of businesses we are pursuing. Our officers and directors, as well as their affiliates, may also bring to our attention partner business candidates of which they become aware through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions.
 
While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our founding team determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our founding team determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of a finder’s fee is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors, or any entity with which they are affiliated, be paid any finder’s fee, consulting fee or other compensation by the company prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). None of our sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder’s fees or consulting fees from a prospective business combination partner in connection with a contemplated acquisition of such partner by us. An agreement to pay the $10,000 per month for office space, secretarial and administrative support to our sponsor was waived in writing between us and our sponsor in September 2020, and therefore no administrative fees are being paid to our sponsor. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-business combination company following our initial business combination.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination or subsequent transaction with a company that is affiliated with Ribbit Capital or its affiliates, including our sponsor, or our founders, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with Ribbit Capital or its affiliates, including our sponsor, or our founders, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent valuation or accounting firm that such initial business combination or transaction is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
Each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities, including any future special purpose acquisition companies we expect they may be involved in and entities that are affiliates of our sponsor, pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity to such entity. Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity which is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such business combination opportunity to such entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Cayman Islands law. See “Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance—Conflicts of Interest.”
 
Evaluation of a Partner Business and Structuring of Our Initial Business Combination
 
In evaluating a prospective partner business, we will conduct a thorough due diligence review which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular partner, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.

19
--

 

The time required to identify and evaluate a partner business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective partner business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our founding team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination. In addition, we have agreed not to enter into a definitive agreement regarding an initial business combination without the prior consent of our sponsor.
 
Lack of Business Diversification
 
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. By completing our initial business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Partner’s Management Team
 
Although we scrutinize the management of a prospective partner business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with that business, our assessment of the partner business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our founding team, if any, in the partner business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our founding team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our initial business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our initial business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our founding team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular partner business.
 
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management, director or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
 
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the partner business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
 
Shareholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve Our Initial Business Combination
 
We may conduct redemptions without a shareholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC subject to the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association. However, we will seek shareholder approval if it is required by applicable law or stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek shareholder approval for business or other legal reasons.
 
Under the NYSE rules and our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, shareholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:
 

• | we issue (other than in a public offering for cash) ordinary shares that will either (a) be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of ordinary shares then issued and outstanding or (b) have voting power equal to or in excess of 20% of the voting power then issued and outstanding;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


20
--


• | any of our directors, officers or substantial security holders (as defined by the rules of the NYSE) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the partner business or assets to be acquired and if the number of ordinary shares to be issued, or if the number of ordinary shares into which the securities may be convertible or exercisable, exceeds either (a) 1% of the number of ordinary shares or 1% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any of our directors and officers or (b) 5% of the number of ordinary shares or 5% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any substantial security holders; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance or potential issuance of ordinary shares will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The Companies Act and Cayman Islands law do not currently require, and we are not aware of any other applicable law that will require, shareholder approval of our initial business combination. The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination in those instances in which shareholder approval is not required by law will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on business and legal reasons, which include a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:
 

• | the timing of the transaction, including in the event we determine shareholder approval would require additional time and there is either not enough time to seek shareholder approval or doing so would place the company at a disadvantage in the transaction or result in other additional burdens on the company;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the expected cost of holding a shareholder vote;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | the risk that the shareholders would fail to approve the proposed business combination;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | other time and budget constraints; and
--+---------------------------------------


• | additional legal complexities of a proposed business combination that would be time-consuming and burdensome to present to shareholders.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases and Other Transactions with Respect to Our Securities
 
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, executive officers, advisors or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event that our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights or submitted a proxy to vote against our initial business combination, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares and any proxy to vote against our initial business combination. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
 

21
--

 

The purpose of any such transactions could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination, (ii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a partner that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met or (iii) reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or vote such warrants or any matter submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
 
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
 
Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates may identify the shareholders with whom our sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated transactions by either the shareholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by shareholders (in the case of Class A ordinary shares) following our mailing of tender offer or proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private transaction, they would identify and contact only potential selling or redeeming shareholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such shareholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the general meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, executive officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which shareholders to purchase shares from based on the negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will be restricted from purchasing shares if such purchases do not comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
 
Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will be restricted from making purchases of shares if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported by such person pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.
 
Redemption Rights for Public Shareholders upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. The redemption rights may include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. There will be no redemption rights upon the completion of our initial business combination with respect to our warrants. Further, we will not proceed with redeeming our public shares, even if a public shareholder has properly elected to redeem its shares, if a business combination does not close. Our sponsor and our founding team entered into agreements with us, pursuant to which they agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in connection with (i) the completion of our initial business combination and (ii) a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or 27 months from the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the Initial Public Offering, or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares or pre-initial business combination activity.

22
--

Limitations on Redemptions
 
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). However, a greater net tangible asset or cash requirement may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the partner or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the partner for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. Furthermore, although we will not redeem shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to fall below $5,000,001, we do not have a maximum redemption threshold based on the percentage of shares sold, as many blank check companies do. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all Class A ordinary shares that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, all Class A ordinary shares submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof, and we may search for an alternate business combination.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a general meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer.
 
The decision as to whether we will seek shareholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek shareholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and share purchases would not typically require shareholder approval, while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our issued and outstanding ordinary shares or seek to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association would typically require shareholder approval. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a shareholder vote unless shareholder approval is not required by applicable law or stock exchange rule or we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other reasons.
 
If we hold a shareholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:
 

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

 
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
 
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if we receive approval pursuant to an ordinary resolution under Cayman Islands law, which requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shareholders who attend and vote at a general meeting of the company. In such case, our sponsor and each member of our founding team have agreed to vote their founder shares and public shares purchased during or after our Initial Public Offering in favor of our initial business combination. Because the founder shares in the aggregate are entitled to 20% of the combined voting power together as a single class, excluding the private placement shares, in addition to our initial shareholders’ founder shares, we would need 14,088,751 or 35%, of the 40,250,000 public shares sold in the Initial Public Offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming all issued and outstanding shares are voted). Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or vote at all. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association require that at least five days’ notice will be given of any such general meeting.
 

23
--

 

If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association:
 

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon the public announcement of our initial business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase Class A ordinary shares in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public shareholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public shareholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.
 
Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares,” without our prior consent, without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our founding to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our founding team at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a partner that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
 
However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our initial business combination.
 
Tendering Share Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
 
Public shareholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” will be required to either tender their certificates (if any) to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, mailed to such holders, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using The Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/ Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option, in each case up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote to approve the business combination. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements, which will include the requirement that a beneficial holder must identify itself in order to validly redeem its shares. Accordingly, a public shareholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights.

Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for shareholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
 
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
 
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the shareholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such shareholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the shareholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s shares in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which shareholders were aware they needed to commit before the general meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming shareholder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.
 
Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination, unless otherwise agreed to by us.
 
Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our initial business combination.
 
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public shareholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
 
If our proposed initial business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different partner until 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering, or 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or 27 months from the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the Initial Public Offering.

Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination
 
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we have only 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering to consummate an initial business combination, or 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate an initial business combination. If we do not consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering, or 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate an initial business combination, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up; (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any); and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering or 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to consummate an initial business combination. Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that, if we wind up for any other reason prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, we will follow the foregoing procedures with respect to the liquidation of the trust account as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, subject to applicable Cayman Islands law.
 
Our sponsor and each member of our founding team have entered into an agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares they hold if we fail to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the Initial Public Offering, or 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the Initial Public Offering (although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the Initial Public Offering, or 27 months from the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the Initial Public Offering).
 
Our sponsor, executive officers and directors have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) that would modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the Initial Public Offering, or 27 months from the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the Initial Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, unless we provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our income taxes, if any, divided by the number of the then-outstanding public shares. However, we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules). If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer or director, or any other person.

We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the proceeds held outside the trust account plus up to $100,000 of funds from the trust account available to us to pay dissolution expenses, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose.
 
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement shares, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by shareholders upon our dissolution would be $10.00. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public shareholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by shareholders will not be less than $10.00. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
 
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (excluding our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective partner businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public shareholders, there is no guarantee that even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our founding team will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if our founding team believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by our founding team to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where our founding team is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. The underwriters will not execute agreements with us waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. In order to protect the amounts held in the trust account, our sponsor agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective partner business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement, reduce the amounts in the trust account to below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and (ii) the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, provided that such liability will not apply to any claims by a third party or prospective partner business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account nor will it apply to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Our sponsor may not be able to satisfy those obligations. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective partner businesses.
 
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of (i) $10.00 per public share and the actual amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account if less than $10.00 per public share due to reductions in the value of the trust assets, in each case net of the interest that may be withdrawn to pay our tax obligations, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.00 per public share.

We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (excluding our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective partner businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of our Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We have access to the proceeds of our Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement shares with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, shareholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors; however such liability will not be greater than the amount of funds from our trust account received by any such shareholder. In the event that these dissolution expenses exceed our available funds held outside the trust account, we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account. In such case, the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount.
 
If we file a bankruptcy or insolvency petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law, and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our shareholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.00 per public share to our public shareholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy or insolvency petition or an involuntary bankruptcy or insolvency petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by shareholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/ creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.”
 
As a result, a bankruptcy or insolvency court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our shareholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public shareholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
 
Our public shareholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the Initial Public Offering, or 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from Initial Public Offering, (ii) in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to provide holders of our Class A ordinary shares the right to have their shares redeemed in connection with our initial business combination or to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the Initial Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A ordinary shares, and (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. Public shareholders who redeem their Class A ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote described in clause (ii) in the preceding sentence shall not be entitled to funds from the trust account upon the subsequent completion of an initial business combination or liquidation if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering, or 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the Initial Public Offering, with respect to such Class A ordinary shares so redeemed. In no other circumstances will a shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek shareholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a shareholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a shareholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such shareholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, like all provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, may be amended with a shareholder vote.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a partner business for our initial business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger partner businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a partner business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who properly exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain partner businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Facilities
 
We currently maintain our executive offices at 364 University Avenue, Palo Alto, California 94301. We consider our current office space adequate for our current operations. An agreement to pay our sponsor a fee of $10,000 for office space and administrative and support services was waived in writing in September 2020, and therefore no fees are being paid to our sponsor for office space or administrative and support services.
Employees
 
We currently have two executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a partner business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
 
We registered our units, Class A ordinary shares and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
 
We will provide shareholders with audited financial statements of the prospective partner business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials, as applicable, sent to shareholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential partner businesses we may acquire because some partners may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of our Initial Public Offering, or 27 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering if we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. We cannot assure you that any particular partner business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential partner business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that these requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed partner business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
 
We are required to evaluate our internal control procedures as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer and no longer qualify as an emerging growth company would we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting. A partner business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.

Prior to the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
 
We are a Cayman Islands exempted company. Exempted companies are Cayman Islands companies conducting business mainly outside the Cayman Islands and, as such, are exempted from complying with certain provisions of the Companies Act. As an exempted company, we have received a tax exemption undertaking from the Cayman Islands government that, in accordance with Section 6 of the Tax Concessions Law (2018 Revision) of the Cayman Islands, for a period of 20 years from the date of the undertaking, no law which is enacted in the Cayman Islands imposing any tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations will apply to us or our operations and, in addition, that no tax to be levied on profits, income, gains or appreciations or which is in the nature of estate duty or inheritance tax will be payable (i) on or in respect of our shares, debentures or other obligations or (ii) by way of the withholding in whole or in part of a payment of dividend or other distribution of income or capital by us to our shareholders or a payment of principal or interest or other sums due under a debenture or other obligation of us.
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A ordinary shares that are held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $250 million as of the prior June 30, and (2) our annual revenues equaled or exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our ordinary shares held by non-affiliates equals or exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30.
 
Legal Proceedings
 
There is no material litigation, arbitration or governmental proceeding currently pending against us or any members of our founding team in their capacity as such.
