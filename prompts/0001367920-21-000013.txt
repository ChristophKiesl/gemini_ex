OVERVIEW
We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that is developing small molecule drugs that we discovered through the application of our deuterated chemical entity platform, or DCE Platform®. Selective incorporation of deuterium into known molecules has the potential, on a case-by-case basis, to provide better pharmacokinetic or metabolic properties, thereby enhancing their clinical safety, tolerability or efficacy. Our lead product candidate is in late-stage development for the treatment of alopecia areata, a serious autoimmune dermatological condition. We are also assessing a number of earlier-stage pipeline candidates.
OUR STRATEGY
Our strategy is to apply our deuterium technology to previously studied molecules, including approved drugs, in which deuterium substitution has the potential to enhance clinical safety, tolerability or efficacy. We select pipeline candidates based on the medical needs of patients, commercial opportunity, regulatory considerations and competitive landscape. We use deuterium technology to develop deuterated product candidates that we believe are promising in view of the known biology of previously studied compounds, including approved drugs, in which deuterium substitution has the potential to enhance clinical safety, tolerability or efficacy. Our strategy includes potential commercialization of product candidates on our own, or with strategic partners.
Deuterium
Due to its natural abundance, the average adult human body contains approximately two grams of deuterium. While essentially identical to hydrogen in size and shape, deuterium differs from hydrogen in that it contains an additional neutron. As a result, deuterium forms a more stable chemical bond with carbon than does hydrogen. The deuterium-carbon bond is typically six to nine times more stable than the hydrogen-carbon bond. This has important implications for drug development because drug metabolism often involves the breaking of hydrogen-carbon bonds.
Because deuterium forms more stable bonds with carbon, deuterium substitution can in some cases alter drug metabolism, including through improved metabolic stability, reduced formation of toxins, increased formation of desired active metabolites or a combination of these effects. At the same time, these improvements in drug metabolism are possible without materially altering the intrinsic biological activity of a compound. Deuterated compounds with enhanced metabolic properties can generally be expected to retain biochemical potency and selectivity similar to their hydrogen analogs. The effects, if any, of deuterium substitution on metabolic properties are highly dependent on the specific molecular positions at which deuterium is substituted for hydrogen. In addition, the metabolic effects of deuterium substitution, if any, are unpredictable, even in compounds that have similar chemical structures.
Potential advantages of product candidates based on our DCE Platform
Using our DCE Platform, we create novel drugs designed to have superior properties - including enhanced clinical safety, tolerability or efficacy - based on compounds that have established pharmacological activity. In many instances, Phase 1 clinical evaluation has the potential to demonstrate whether there will be product differentiation.
Potential advantages of our DCE Platform include the following:
•Improved metabolic profile. An improved metabolic profile may potentially reduce or eliminate unwanted side effects or undesirable drug interactions or increase efficacy. Metabolic profile refers to the relative amounts and exposure profile of the parent drug and its metabolites or metabolic by-products in the body.
•Increased half-life. A longer half-life may decrease the number of doses that a patient is required to take per day or provide more consistent exposure of the compound in comparison to the corresponding non-deuterated compound, potentially improving the drug’s therapeutic profile. Half-life is usually defined as the time it takes for the body to clear half of a given concentration of the drug from the plasma.
•Avoidance of undesirable metabolism. By avoiding first pass metabolism, we may be able to improve oral bioavailability, which could potentially lead to better efficacy at a lower dose of drug. First pass metabolism is metabolism that occurs before the drug reaches the circulatory system.
•Improved biodistribution. Changes in the rate of drug metabolism in a specific organ can alter drug exposure in the organ, relative to plasma concentrations. If a deuterated drug achieves higher organ levels relative to plasma levels than its non-deuterated analog, therapeutically-relevant drug concentrations in that organ may be achieved by administering a smaller amount of the deuterated drug.
OUR PRODUCT CANDIDATES
Our lead product candidate, CTP-543, is in late-stage development for the treatment of alopecia areata, a serious autoimmune dermatological condition. We are also assessing a number of earlier-stage pipeline candidates.
CTP-543
Background on Alopecia Areata
Alopecia areata is a serious, chronic autoimmune disease affecting approximately 700,000 Americans at any given time that results in partial or complete loss of hair on the scalp and/or body. Alopecia areata occurs when the immune system attacks the hair follicles and is characterized as non-scarring hair loss. It presents in a number of patterns including:
•Patchy: coin-sized or larger patch or patches of hair loss;
•Totalis: no hair on the head; and
•Universalis: no hair anywhere on the body.
Onset can occur at any age including childhood, and it affects both women and men equally. The average age of onset is between 25-35 years. The emotional effect of alopecia areata can be considerable and may result in anxiety and depression or affect personal attributes such as self-esteem and confidence. Alopecia areata may also be associated with other autoimmune conditions such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid disease, ulcerative colitis and vitiligo. The most common form of treatment is corticosteroids including intralesional injections or topical application. However, corticosteroids are typically not well tolerated and often provide limited efficacy. There are currently no treatments approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, for alopecia areata.
CTP-543 Opportunity
CTP-543 is an oral selective inhibitor of Janus kinases JAK1 and JAK2 that we are developing for the treatment of moderate to severe alopecia areata. CTP-543 was discovered by applying our deuterium chemistry technology to modify ruxolitinib, a Janus kinase, or JAK, inhibitor, which is commercially available under the name Jakafi® in the United States for the treatment of certain blood disorders and for graft versus host disease. The FDA has granted CTP-543 Breakthrough Therapy designation for the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata and Fast Track designation for the treatment of alopecia areata. CTP-543 is currently in Phase 3 development.
Clinical Development of CTP-543
We have completed multiple Phase 2 trials of CTP-543 for the treatment of moderate to severe alopecia areata to support the advancement of the program into Phase 3 development. In September 2019, we announced results from a Phase 2 double-blind, randomized, dose-ranging trial to evaluate three sequential doses of CTP-543 (4, 8 and 12 mg twice-daily) and a placebo control in 149 patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata. Patients treated with either 8 mg twice-daily or 12 mg twice-daily doses of CTP-543 met the primary efficacy endpoint with statistically significant differences (p <0.001) relative to placebo in the percentage of patients achieving a ≥ 50% relative change from baseline at 24 weeks. The 8 mg twice-daily and 12 mg twice-daily dose groups were also significantly different from placebo in the number of patients achieving ≥ 75% and ≥ 90% relative change in Severity of Alopecia Tool, or SALT, score between baseline at 24 weeks. A numerically but not statistically greater percentage of patients treated with the 4 mg twice-daily dose of CTP-543 met the primary efficacy endpoint. At 24 weeks, patients treated with 8 mg twice-daily and 12 mg twice-daily doses compared to placebo also rated significantly greater improvement in their alopecia areata on the Patient Global Impression of Improvement Scale. Treatment with CTP-543 was generally well tolerated. The most common side effects in the 8 mg or 12 mg twice-daily dose groups were headache, nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, acne, nausea and low-density lipoprotein increase. One serious adverse event of facial cellulitis was reported in the 12 mg twice-daily dose group as possibly related to treatment; however, after a brief interruption, treatment continued and this patient completed the trial. No thromboembolic events were reported during the trial.
In June 2020, we released new data analyses from our Phase 2 dose-ranging trial of CTP-543 supporting the design of our Phase 3 program. The new data analyses revealed that statistically significant results were reported for the 8 mg twice-daily and 12 mg twice-daily doses of CTP-543 at more stringent response thresholds, which may be more clinically meaningful to patients, and positive findings were reported for clinician and patient reported outcome measures of scalp hair loss. At 24 weeks, 26% and 42% of patients who received CTP-543 in the 8 mg twice-daily and 12 mg twice-daily cohorts, respectively, achieved an absolute SALT score ≤ 20 (p <0.05 vs. placebo), indicating a clinically-meaningful 80% or greater scalp hair present. Data from the Clinician Global Impression of Improvement scale showed 75% of clinicians rated the response in the 12 mg twice-daily cohort and 61% of clinicians rated the response in the 8 mg twice-daily cohort as "much improved" or "very much improved" at 24 weeks. For both doses, there was a statistically significant difference from placebo (p <0.001).
In December 2019, we announced that we completed an open label Phase 2 trial evaluating 8 mg twice-daily compared to 16 mg once-daily dosing of CTP-543 in 57 patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata. Results in the 8 mg twice-daily arm were consistent with the previously-reported 8 mg twice-daily results from our Phase 2 dose-ranging trial of CTP-543. The trial measured the relative change in SALT score between baseline and 24 weeks. Treatment was generally well tolerated in both arms of the study. All but one of the patients who completed this trial elected to continue in an ongoing open label, long-term extension study. A second open label Phase 2 trial evaluating 12 mg twice-daily compared to 24 mg once-daily dosing of CTP-543 in patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata was completed in 2020. We are utilizing the 8 mg twice-daily and 12 mg twice-daily doses in our ongoing clinical development program for CTP-543.
We conducted an end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA in March 2020 and initiated a Phase 3 trial of CTP-543, THRIVE-AA1, in November 2020. The THRIVE-AA1 trial is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial of CTP-543 to evaluate hair regrowth using the SALT score after 24 weeks of dosing in approximately 700 adult patients with moderate to severe alopecia areata. The trial will evaluate 8 mg and 12 mg twice-daily doses of CTP-543 compared to placebo at sites in the United States, Canada and Europe. We expect to report topline results from the THRIVE-AA1 trial in 2022. We expect to begin a second Phase 3 trial of CTP-543, THRIVE-AA2, in the first half of 2021.
Eligible patients from our efficacy and safety studies with CTP-543 may also enroll in an open label, long-term extension study that we are conducting.
CTP-692
On February 1, 2021, we announced that our Phase 2 trial to evaluate CTP-692 as an adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia did not meet the primary endpoint or other secondary endpoints. As a result, we have ceased development of CTP-692. CTP-692 is a deuterated form of D-serine, an endogenous amino acid that is a co-agonist of the NMDA receptor. 
In December 2019, we initiated a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of CTP-692 as an adjunctive treatment for schizophrenia. A total of 325 adult patients who are stable on an antipsychotic medication were randomized to receive 1, 2 or 4 grams of CTP-692 or placebo once-daily. The primary outcome measure was the change in the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) total score at 12 weeks compared to baseline. CTP-692 did not show a statistically significant improvement over placebo at any of the doses. In addition, CTP-692 did not meet any of the secondary endpoints, including the positive or negative symptoms subscales of PANSS, at any of the doses. In the Phase 2 trial, 
treatment with CTP-692 was generally well tolerated. The adverse events reported were predominantly mild in severity and equally distributed across the dose groups, including placebo.
Earlier-Stage Pipeline
We are currently assessing a number of earlier-stage pipeline candidates as potential development candidates. 
COLLABORATION PRODUCT CANDIDATES
In addition to our wholly owned development programs, we have entered into collaborative arrangements with companies to develop deuterium-modified versions of their marketed products. Our partners are currently responsible for all development and future commercialization activities under these arrangements. In each of these collaborations, the deuterium-modified compound was independently discovered by us. For example, on February 24, 2012, we entered into a development and license agreement with Avanir Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Avanir, a subsidiary of Otsuka Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd. for the worldwide rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize AVP-786. AVP-786 is a combination of deudextromethorphan hydrobromide (d6-DM) and quinidine sulfate (Q), a CYP2D6 inhibitor, being investigated for the treatment of neurologic and psychiatric disorders. In 2019, Avanir completed two Phase 3 trials evaluating AVP-786 for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer’s type. The second of the Phase 3 trials did not meet its primary or key secondary endpoints; however, following additional data analysis, Avanir decided to continue developing AVP-786 for the treatment of agitation associated with dementia of the Alzheimer's type. Three additional Phase 3 trials and an open label, long-term extension study for Alzheimer’s agitation are ongoing. Additionally, Avanir is conducting a Phase 2/3 trial evaluating AVP-786 for the treatment of negative symptoms of schizophrenia. 
ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH VERTEX PHARMACEUTICALS FOR CTP-656
In July 2017, we completed the sale of worldwide development and commercialization rights to CTP-656 and other assets related to the treatment of cystic fibrosis to Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Vertex. CTP-656, now known as VX-561, is an investigational cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, or CFTR, potentiator that has the potential to be used as part of future once-daily combination regimens of CFTR modulators that treat the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis. We received $160.0 million in cash upon closing, and if VX-561 is approved as part of a combination regimen to treat cystic fibrosis, we are eligible to receive up to $90.0 million in the form of two additional milestones based on marketing approval in the United States and agreement for reimbursement in the first of the United Kingdom, Germany or France.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
We protect our product candidates through the use of patents, trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary know-how. Our patents and patent applications, if they issue as patents, for our lead programs expire between 2028 and 2038. The expected expiration dates are before any patent term extension to which we may be entitled under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 (commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments) or equivalent laws in other jurisdictions where we have issued patents.
CTP-543
We hold various patents and pending applications covering the composition of matter of deuterated analogs of ruxolitinib, including CTP-543, and methods of treating hair loss, including alopecia areata, with certain doses of CTP-543.
We hold U.S. Patent No. 9,249,149, or the '149 patent, covering the composition of matter of deuterated analogs of ruxolitinib, including CTP-543, and we have a corresponding U.S. patent application. We also have a corresponding allowed patent application in Europe and a corresponding patent and allowed patent application in Japan. Such patents and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2033.
We also hold U.S. Patent No. 10,561,659, or the '659 patent, covering methods of treating hair loss, including alopecia areata, with certain doses of CTP-543, and we have a corresponding U.S. patent application. We have corresponding patent applications in Europe and Japan. Such patent and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2037.
In April 2018, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, or PTAB, instituted an inter partes review, or IPR, brought against the '149 patent by Incyte Corporation, or Incyte. In April 2019, the PTAB issued a final written decision in connection with the IPR that held that the claims of the '149 patent were unpatentable as obvious. In January 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or Federal Circuit, granted our motion to vacate and remand the PTAB final written decision in light of the Federal Circuit ruling on the Constitution’s Appointments Clause in Arthrex, Inc. v. Smith & Nephew, Inc., 941 F.3d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2019). As a result, the IPR was remanded for reconsideration by a new panel of PTAB judges. However, the reconsideration is currently on hold while the Supreme Court considers certain questions raised by Arthrex. The '149 patent remains valid and 
enforceable while the IPR is being reconsidered by the PTAB and until any future appeals by us have been exhausted in the event that the PTAB reaches a similar decision to invalidate the '149 patent. 
In addition, in October 2020, Incyte filed a post grant review, or PGR, petition with the PTAB challenging the validity of the '659 patent. We filed our response in February 2021 and expect the PTAB to make a decision on whether to institute the PGR by mid-May 2021. We intend to vigorously defend the '659 patent.
We have retained all of the CTP-543 patent rights.
AVP-786
We hold U.S. patents and pending applications covering the composition of matter and methods of use of deudextromethorphan and other deuterated dextromethorphan analogs. Such U.S. patents and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2028 and 2030. We hold corresponding patents and patent applications in Europe and Japan. Such foreign patents and patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire in 2028. We have granted exclusive licenses under these patent rights to Avanir.
Other Product Candidates
We also have patent portfolios that are related to a number of other programs. These patent portfolios are wholly owned by us. These include issued patents or patent applications that claim deuterated analogs of a number of non-deuterated drugs and drug candidates.
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In the United States and other countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application.
Under U.S. patent law, the patent term may be extended by patent term adjustment due to certain failures of the PTO to act in a timely manner. The patent term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other non-U.S. jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical products receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents that we believe are eligible for such extension. We also intend to seek patent term extensions in other jurisdictions where these are available. However, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
We also rely on trade secrets and careful monitoring of our proprietary know-how to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection, including our DCE Platform.
MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY
We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of product candidates for our clinical trials. We obtain these manufacturing services, including both the manufacture of the active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished drug product, on a purchase order basis and have not entered into long-term supply contracts with any of these third-party manufacturers. We expect to rely on third parties for commercial manufacturing for any of our product candidates that receive marketing approval.
When manufacturing our product candidates, we incorporate deuterium using either deuterium oxide or deuterated chemical reagents (which themselves are derived from deuterium oxide). As a result, we rely on being able to obtain and transport deuterated materials in order to manufacture our product candidates.
We purchase our raw materials on a purchase order basis and have not entered into long-term supply contracts with any of these third-party suppliers. We believe that the raw materials for our product candidates are readily available and that the cost of manufacturing for our product candidates will not preclude us from selling them profitably, if approved for sale.
COMMERCIALIZATION
We have not yet established a sales, marketing or product distribution infrastructure. We plan to use a combination of third-party collaboration, licensing and distribution arrangements and a focused in-house commercialization capability to sell any of our products that receive marketing approval. With respect to the United States, we plan to seek to retain full commercialization rights for products that we can commercialize with a specialized sales force and to retain co-promotion or similar rights when feasible in indications requiring a larger commercial infrastructure. We plan to collaborate with third parties for commercialization in the United States of any products that require a large sales, marketing and product distribution infrastructure. We also plan to collaborate with third parties for commercialization outside the United States.
We plan to build a marketing and sales management organization to create and implement marketing strategies for any products that we market through our own sales organization and to oversee and support our sales force. We expect the responsibilities of the marketing organization would include developing educational initiatives with respect to approved products and establishing relationships with thought leaders in relevant fields of medicine.
COMPETITION
The development and commercialization of new drug products is highly competitive. We expect that we, and our collaborators, will face significant competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide with respect to our product candidates that we, or they, may seek to develop or commercialize in the future. Specifically, there are a number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell products or are pursuing the development of product candidates for the treatment of autoimmune and CNS disorders. Our competitors may succeed in developing, acquiring or licensing technologies and drug products that are more effective, simpler to use, have fewer or more tolerable side effects or are less costly than any product candidates that we are currently developing or that we may develop or acquire, which could render our product candidates obsolete and noncompetitive.
Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we, or our collaborators, may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other marketing approval for their products before we, or our collaborators, are able to obtain approval for ours, which could reduce our ability to utilize expedited regulatory pathways and could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we, or our collaborators, are able to enter the market.
Many of our existing and potential future competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, nonclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining marketing approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs.
Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have begun to cover deuterated analogs of their product candidates in patent applications and may develop these deuterated compounds. Some of these pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, nonclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining marketing approvals and marketing approved products than we do. In some cases, these competitors may be interested in developing deuterated compounds that we may be interested in developing for ourselves. Our competitors may succeed in obtaining patents that dominate our products, preventing our operational freedom. In addition, these competitors may enter into collaborative arrangements or business combinations that result in their ability to research and develop deuterated compounds more effectively than us. Our potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies and other public and private research organizations.
CTP-543 is a deuterated analog of ruxolitinib that we are developing as an oral agent for the treatment of moderate to severe alopecia areata. If CTP-543 receives marketing approval for this indication, it may face competition from a number of other product candidates that are being studied for alopecia areata. Other companies pursuing development of oral JAK inhibitors for the treatment of alopecia areata include Eli Lilly and Company and Pfizer Inc. 
GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS 
Government authorities in the United States, at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries and jurisdictions, including the European Union, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, manufacturing changes, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, sales, distribution, marketing and import and export of pharmaceutical products. The processes for obtaining regulatory approvals in the United States and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
Review and Approval of Drugs in the United States
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval may subject an applicant and/or sponsor to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, including refusal by the FDA to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters and other types of letters, voluntary product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits or civil or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA and the Department of Justice or other governmental entities.
An applicant seeking approval to market and distribute a new drug product in the United States must typically undertake the following:

•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practices, or GLPs;
•production of well-characterized drug substance and drug product, and potentially matching placebos;
•submission to the FDA of an investigational new drug application, or IND application, which allows human clinical trials to begin unless the FDA otherwise informs the drug’s sponsor within 30 days;
•agreement by clinical investigators and their clinical trial sites, followed by approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, representing each clinical site, before the clinical trial may be initiated at that site;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s good clinical practices, or GCPs, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
•preparation and submission to the FDA of a New Drug Application, or NDA;
•review of the NDA by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of one or more FDA inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug product, and the active pharmaceutical ingredient or active ingredients thereof, are produced to assess compliance with the FDA's current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to ensure the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
•payment of user fees and securing FDA approval of the NDA; and
•compliance with any post-approval requirements, including a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, and any post-approval studies required by the FDA.
Nonclinical Studies and an IND
Nonclinical studies can include in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for efficacy and adverse events and, in some cases, to establish a rationale for human therapeutic use. The conduct of nonclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLPs. Other studies include laboratory evaluation of the purity, stability and physical form of the manufactured drug substance or active pharmaceutical ingredient and the physical properties, stability and reproducibility of the formulated drug or drug product. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the relevant nonclinical tests, including all tests conducted under GLPs, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some nonclinical testing, such as longer-term toxicity testing, animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or 
questions related to a proposed clinical trial and places the trial on clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Following commencement of a clinical trial under an IND, the FDA may place a clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. For example, a specific protocol or part of a protocol is not allowed to proceed, while other protocols may do so. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed. The FDA will base that determination on information provided by the sponsor correcting the deficiencies previously cited or otherwise satisfying the FDA that the investigation can proceed.
Human Clinical Studies in Support of an NDA
Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational product to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCPs, which include, among other things, the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing before their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under written study protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the study, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and reapprove the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institute of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 

Phase 1: | The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness. 
Phase 2: | The product candidate is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and dosage for Phase 3 studies. 
Phase 3: | The product candidate is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.

Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggests a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as the data monitoring committee, or DMC, or board. This group provides recommendations for whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on review of certain data from the trial. The FDA will often inspect one or more clinical sites in late-stage clinical trials to assure compliance with GCPs and the integrity of the clinical data submitted.
A manufacturer of an investigational drug for a serious disease or condition is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for individual patient access to such investigational drug. This 
requirement applies on the earlier of the first initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 trial of the investigational drug or, as applicable, 15 days after the drug receives a designation as a Breakthrough Therapy, Fast Track product or regenerative advanced therapy.
Submission of an NDA to the FDA
Assuming successful completion of required clinical testing and other requirements, the results of the nonclinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the drug product for one or more indications. Under federal law, the submission of most NDAs is additionally subject to a user fee.
Under certain circumstances, the FDA will waive the application fee for the first human drug application that a small business, defined as a company with less than 500 employees, or its affiliate submits for review. An affiliate is defined as a business entity that has a relationship with a second business entity if one business entity controls, or has the power to control, the other business entity, or a third party controls, or has the power to control, both entities.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of an NDA within 60 days of its receipt and informs the sponsor by the 74th day after the FDA’s receipt of the submission to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA has agreed to specified performance goals in the review process of NDAs. Most such applications are meant to be reviewed within ten months from the date of filing, and most applications for “priority review” products are meant to be reviewed within six months of filing. The review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMPs and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCPs.
The FDA also may require submission and agreement of a REMS to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks prior to approving an NDA. The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
The FDA may also refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not required. Typically, an advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
The FDA’s Decision on an NDA
On the basis of the FDA’s evaluation of the NDA and accompanying information, including the results of the inspection of the manufacturing facilities and clinical sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing or information in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. If and when those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter. Additionally, the FDA has issued complete response letters or has deferred action on applications where inspections of manufacturing facilities or clinical sites could not be completed during the review cycle due to COVID-19 related restrictions. The FDA has committed to reviewing such resubmissions in two or six months depending on the type of information included. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.
If the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess the drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, including a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. In addition, the FDA could 
require that a “black box” warning be included in the product label at the time of approval of a product or following approval of a product based on the drug class, even if the safety concern is not known to be associated with that specific product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-market studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
The product may also be subject to official lot release, meaning that the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release, the manufacturer must submit samples of each lot, together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot, to the FDA. The FDA may in addition perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products before releasing the lots for distribution. Finally, the FDA will conduct laboratory research related to the safety and effectiveness of drug products.
Expedited development and review programs
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, Breakthrough Therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or facilitate the development and review of new drugs that meet certain criteria and/or provide for approval on the basis of surrogate endpoints.
New drugs are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address an unmet medical need for the condition. Fast Track designation is intended to facilitate early and frequent meetings between the FDA and the sponsor company during development and the FDA may agree to review sections of an NDA on a rolling basis before the complete NDA is submitted. A drug may be eligible for Breakthrough Therapy designation if the drug is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies. Breakthrough Therapy designation provides for frequent meetings between the sponsor and the FDA, involving senior and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-functional review and the assignment of an FDA project lead to facilitate efficient review of the development program and serve as a scientific liaison with the sponsor. Although Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designation do not affect the regulatory standards for approval, the frequent interactions with the FDA may facilitate a more efficient development program. In addition, the NDAs for drugs granted Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy designation may become eligible for priority review. Priority review is designed for drug candidates that offer significant improvements in safety or effectiveness or fill an unmet medical need and provides for an initial review within six months of acceptance of the NDA for filing, as compared to a standard review of ten months after acceptance for filing. Accelerated approval provides an earlier approval of drugs that treat serious diseases, and that fill an unmet medical need, based on a surrogate endpoint that the FDA determines is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that the sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform post-marketing confirmatory clinical trials.
Even if a drug candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the drug no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review will not be shortened. Regardless of any accelerated review period under these programs, the review process may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider new information or clarification provided by the applicant to address an outstanding deficiency identified by the FDA following the original submission.
Section 505(b)(2) NDAs
NDAs for most new drug products are based on two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials which must contain substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the proposed new product. These applications are generally submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. The FDA is, however, authorized to approve an alternative type of NDA under Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA. This latter type of application allows the applicant to rely, in part, on the FDA’s previous findings of safety and efficacy for a similar reference product, or may rely on published literature. Specifically, Section 505(b)(2) applies to NDAs for a drug for which the applicant relies, as part of its application, on investigations made to show whether or not the drug is safe and effective for use “that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted.”
Thus, Section 505(b)(2) authorizes the FDA to approve an NDA based on safety and effectiveness data that were not developed by the applicant. NDAs filed under Section 505(b)(2) may provide an alternate and potentially more expeditious pathway to FDA approval for new or improved formulations or new uses of previously approved products. If the 505(b)(2) applicant can establish that reliance on the FDA’s previous approval is scientifically appropriate, the applicant may eliminate the need to conduct certain nonclinical or clinical studies of the new product. The FDA may also require companies to perform additional 
studies or measurements to support the change from the approved product. The FDA may then approve the new drug candidate for all or some of the label indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
If our partners submit NDAs for approval of deuterated analogs of marketed compounds for which they are the NDA holder, we believe that in certain cases the FDA may allow referencing of data from the non-deuterated compound in support of the application for approval of the deuterated product. Since this referencing by our partners would involve use of their own data and not require the use of another party’s data, it would constitute a Section 505(b)(1) application.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also is an annual prescription drug user fee for any marketed products, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMPs. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMPs and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events or problems with manufacturing processes of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS. Other potential consequences include, among other things:

•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or withdrawal of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs
In 1984, with the passage of the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, Congress authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved by the FDA under the NDA provisions of the statute. To obtain approval of a generic drug, an applicant must submit an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, to the agency. In support of such applications, a generic manufacturer may rely on the nonclinical and clinical testing previously conducted for a drug product previously approved under an NDA, known as the "reference listed drug." To reference that information, however, the ANDA applicant must demonstrate, and the FDA must conclude, that the generic drug does, in fact, perform in the same way as the reference listed drug it purports to copy.
Specifically, in order for an ANDA to be approved, the FDA must find that the generic version is identical to the reference listed drug with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form and the strength of the drug. At the same time, the FDA must also determine that the generic drug is “bioequivalent” to the innovator drug. Under the statute, a generic drug is bioequivalent to a reference listed drug if “the rate and extent of absorption of the generic drug do not show a significant difference from the rate and extent of absorption of the reference listed drug. . .”
Upon approval of an ANDA, the FDA indicates that the generic product is “therapeutically equivalent” to the reference listed drug and it assigns a therapeutic equivalence rating to the approved generic drug in its publication “Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations,” also referred to as the “Orange Book.” Physicians and pharmacists consider the therapeutic equivalence rating to mean that a generic drug is fully substitutable for the reference listed drug. In addition, by operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA’s designation of a therapeutic equivalence rating often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient.
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, the FDA may not approve an ANDA until any applicable period of non-patent exclusivity for the reference listed drug has expired. The FDCA provides a period of five years of data exclusivity for new drug containing a new chemical entity. For the purposes of this provision, a new chemical entity is a drug that contains no active moiety that has been previously approved by the FDA in any other NDA. An active moiety is the molecule or ion responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. In cases where such new chemical entity exclusivity has been granted, an ANDA may not be filed with the FDA until the expiration of five years unless the submission is accompanied by a Paragraph IV certification, in which case the applicant may submit its application four years following the original product approval.
The FDCA also provides for a period of three years of exclusivity if the NDA includes reports of one or more new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability or bioequivalence studies, that were conducted by or for the applicant and are essential to the approval of the application. This three-year exclusivity period often protects changes to a previously approved drug product, such as a new dosage form, route of administration, combination or indication. Three year exclusivity would be available for a drug product that contains a previously approved active moiety, provided the statutory requirement for a new clinical investigation is satisfied. Unlike five year new chemical entity exclusivity, an award of three year exclusivity does not block the FDA from accepting ANDAs seeking approval for generic versions of the drug as of the date of approval of the original drug product.
Hatch-Waxman Patent Certification and the 30 Month Stay
NDA sponsors are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims that cover the applicant’s product or a method of using the product. Each of the patents listed by the NDA sponsor is published in the Orange Book. When an ANDA applicant files its application with the FDA, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the reference product in the Orange Book, except for patents covering methods of use for which the ANDA applicant is not seeking approval.
Specifically, the applicant must certify with respect to each patent that:

•the required patent information has not been filed;
•the listed patent has expired;
•the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or
•the listed patent is invalid, unenforceable or will not be infringed by the new product.
A certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents or that such patents are invalid or unenforceable is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents or indicate that it is not seeking approval of a patented method of use, the ANDA application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
If the ANDA applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA has been accepted for filing by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within 45 days after the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA until the earlier of 30 months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
To the extent that the Section 505(b)(2) applicant is relying on studies conducted for an already approved product, the applicant is required to certify to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the Orange Book to the same extent that an ANDA applicant would. As a result, approval of a 505(b)(2) NDA can be stalled until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired, until any non-patent exclusivity, such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity, listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired and, in the case of a Paragraph IV certification and subsequent patent infringement suit, until the earlier of 30 months, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the Section 505(b)(2) applicant.
Pediatric Studies and Exclusivity
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended, an NDA or supplement thereto must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. Sponsors must also submit pediatric study plans within 60 days of an end of Phase 2 meeting, or as may be agreed between the sponsor and the FDA. Those plans must contain an outline of the proposed pediatric study or studies the applicant plans to conduct, including study objectives and design, any deferral or waiver requests and other information required by regulation. The applicant, the FDA and the FDA’s internal review committee must then review the information submitted, consult with each other and agree upon a final plan. The FDA or the applicant may request an amendment to the plan at any time.
The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after efficacy and safety has been established in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. Generally, the pediatric data requirements do not apply to products with orphan designation.
Pediatric exclusivity is another type of non-patent marketing exclusivity in the United States and, if granted, provides for the attachment of an additional six months of marketing protection to the term of any existing regulatory exclusivity, including the non-patent and orphan exclusivity. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly respond to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied; rather, if the clinical trial is deemed to fairly respond to the FDA’s request, the additional protection is granted. If reports of requested pediatric studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity or patent protection cover the product are extended by six months. This is not a patent term extension, but it effectively extends the regulatory period during which the FDA cannot accept or approve another application.
Patent Term Restoration and Extension
A patent claiming a new drug product may be eligible for a limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. Those Amendments permit a patent restoration of up to five years for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review. The restoration period granted is typically one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and ultimate approval. Patent term restoration cannot be used to extend the remaining term of a patent past a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent in question. The PTO reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration in consultation with the FDA.
Review and Approval of Drug Products in the European Union
In order to market any product outside of the United States, a company must also comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of its products. Whether or not it obtains FDA approval for a product, the company would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before it can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries or jurisdictions. The approval process ultimately varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Pursuant to the European Clinical Trials Directive, a system for the approval of clinical trials in the European Union has been implemented through national legislation of the member states. Under this system, an applicant must obtain approval from the competent national authority of a European Union member state in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. Furthermore, the applicant may only start a clinical trial after a competent ethics committee has issued a favorable opinion. Clinical trial applications must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the European Clinical Trials Directive and corresponding national laws of the member states and further detailed in applicable guidance documents.
To obtain marketing approval of a drug under European Union regulatory systems, an applicant must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either under a centralized or decentralized procedure.
The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid for all European Union member states. The centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for medicines produced by certain biotechnological processes, products designated as orphan medicinal products, advanced therapy products and products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, the centralized procedure may be optional.
Under the centralized procedure, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or the CHMP, established at the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is responsible for issuing an Opinion following the initial assessment of an MAA. Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops, when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated evaluation might be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. In this circumstance, the EMA ensures that the opinion of the CHMP is given within 150 days. Following a positive Opinion by the CHMP, the final authorization is issued by the European Commission.
The decentralized procedure is available to applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union member states where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union member states before. The decentralized procedure provides for approval by one or more other, or concerned, member states of an assessment of an application performed by one member state designated by the applicant, known as the reference member state. Under this procedure, an applicant submits an application based on identical dossiers and related materials to the reference member state and concerned member states. The reference member state prepares a draft assessment report and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. Within 90 days after receiving the reference member state’s assessment report and related materials, each concerned member state must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials.
If a member state cannot approve the assessment report and related materials on the grounds of potential serious risk to public health, the disputed points are subject to a dispute resolution mechanism and may eventually be referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
Data and Market Exclusivity in the European Union
In the European Union, new chemical entities qualify for eight years of data exclusivity upon marketing authorization and an additional two years of market exclusivity. This data exclusivity, if granted, prevents regulatory authorities in the European Union from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic (abbreviated) application for eight years, after which generic marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but not approved for two years. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to their authorization, are held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if a compound is considered to be a new chemical entity and the sponsor is able to gain the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company nevertheless could also market another version of the drug if such company can complete a full MAA with a complete database of pharmaceutical tests, nonclinical tests and clinical trials and obtain marketing approval of its product.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of products approved by the FDA and other government authorities. Sales of products will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors, including government health programs in the United States such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care 
organizations, provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the approved products for a particular indication. In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. A payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
The containment of healthcare costs has also become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products and re-importation of products sold outside of the United States. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, including importation of drugs into the United States from lower-cost countries, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could adversely affect our net revenue and results.
Outside of the United States, ensuring adequate coverage and payment for products remains challenging. Pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals is subject to governmental control in many countries. Pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can extend well beyond the receipt of regulatory marketing approval for a product and may require us to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost effectiveness of our product candidates or products to other available therapies. The conduct of such a clinical trial could be expensive and result in delays in our commercialization efforts.
As a result, the marketability of any product which receives regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, an increasing emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates and drug pricing regulation may change at any time. In particular, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act, or collectively the PPACA, contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products, including, for example, increased rebates for drugs sold to Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products that receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Since enactment of the PPACA, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA, and we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the PPACA in the future. Various portions of the PPACA are currently undergoing legal and constitutional challenges in the U.S. Supreme Court; the Trump Administration issued various Executive Orders that eliminated cost sharing subsidies and various provisions that would impose a fiscal burden on states or a cost, fee, tax, penalty or regulatory burden on individuals, healthcare providers, health insurers or manufacturers of pharmaceuticals or medical devices; and Congress has introduced several pieces of legislation aimed at significantly revising or repealing the PPACA. As implementation of the PPACA is ongoing, the law appears likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, especially under the Medicare program, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs.
At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations that are designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, that are designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing.
In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products, but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on 
healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
Healthcare Law and Regulation
Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of drug products that are granted marketing approval. Arrangements with third-party payors and customers are subject to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, include the following:

•the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation or arranging of, any good or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid;
•the federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the False Claims Act, which imposes civil monetary penalties, and provides for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions, against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;
•the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
•HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms and technical safeguards, with respect to maintaining the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;
•the federal false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services;
•the federal anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program;
•the federal transparency requirements under the PPACA, which requires certain manufacturers of covered drugs to report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (currently defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare providers and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations will extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners; and
•analogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to healthcare items or services that are reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers.
Some state laws require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government in addition to requiring drug manufacturers to report information related to payments to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. State and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, including environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we may be subject to penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of December 31, 2020, we had 71 employees on a full-time or part-time basis, 46 of whom were primarily engaged in research and development activities. A total of 41 employees hold Ph.D., master's or other post-graduate degrees. In addition, we retain expert consultants on an ad-hoc basis as required in connection with our development programs. We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to continue to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. We monitor our compensation programs closely and believe that we offer competitive compensation (including salary, incentive bonus and equity awards) and benefits packages. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we believe that our relations with our employees are good.
FACILITIES
We lease approximately 56,000 square feet of office and laboratory space at our headquarters in Lexington, Massachusetts. The lease expires on January 1, 2029.
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

We have dedicated a significant portion of our resources to our efforts to develop our pipeline and product candidates. We incurred research and development expenses of $61.6 million and $59.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We anticipate that a significant portion of our operating expenses in future periods will continue to be related to research and development as we continue to advance our product candidates through clinical development.
