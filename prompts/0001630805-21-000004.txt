ITEM 1. Business
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, or this “Annual Report”, unless the context otherwise indicates, “B&W,” “we,” “us,” “our” or the “Company” mean Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.
B&W is a growing, globally-focused renewable, environmental and thermal technologies provider with decades of experience providing diversified energy and emissions control solutions to a broad range of industrial, electrical utility, municipal and other customers. B&W’s innovative products and services are organized into three market-facing segments:
•Babcock & Wilcox Renewable: Cost-effective technologies for efficient and environmentally sustainable power and heat generation, including waste-to-energy, biomass energy and black liquor systems for the pulp and paper industry. B&W’s leading technologies support a circular economy, diverting waste from landfills to use for power generation and replacing fossil fuels, while recovering metals and reducing emissions.
•Babcock & Wilcox Environmental: A full suite of best-in-class emissions control and environmental technology solutions for utility, waste to energy, biomass, carbon black, and industrial steam generation applications around the world. B&W’s broad experience includes systems for cooling, ash handling, particulate control, nitrogen oxides and sulfur dioxides removal, chemical looping for carbon control, and mercury control.
•Babcock & Wilcox Thermal: Steam generation equipment, aftermarket parts, construction, maintenance and field services for plants in the power generation, oil and gas, and industrial sectors. B&W has an extensive global base of installed equipment for utilities and general industrial applications including refining, petrochemical, food processing, metals and others.
Our business depends significantly on the capital, operations and maintenance expenditures of global electric power generating companies, including renewable and thermal powered heat generation industries and industrial facilities with environmental compliance policy requirements.. Several factors may influence these expenditures, including:
•climate change initiatives promoting environmental policies which include renewable energy options utilizing waste-to-energy or biomass to meet legislative requirements and clean energy portfolio standards in the United States, European, Middle East and Asian markets;
•requirements for environmental improvements in various global markets;
•expectation of future governmental requirements to further limit or reduce greenhouse gas and other emissions in the United States, Europe and other international climate change sensitive countries; 
•prices for electricity, along with the cost of production and distribution including the cost of fuels within the United States, Europe, Middle East and Asian based countries;
•demand for electricity and other end products of steam-generating facilities;
•level of capacity utilization at operating power plants and other industrial uses of steam production;
•requirements for maintenance and upkeep at operating power plants to combat the accumulated effects of usage;
•overall strength of the industrial industry; and
•ability of electric power generating companies and other steam users to raise capital.
Customer demand is heavily affected by the variations in our customers' business cycles and by the overall economies and energy, environmental and noise abatement needs of the countries in which they operate.
Recent Developments
2021 Common Stock Offering
As described in Note 25, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, on February 12, 2021, we completed a public offering of our common stock, par value $0.01 per share (“Common Stock”). The offering was conducted pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the “Underwriting Agreement”) dated February 9, 2021, between us and B. Riley Securities, Inc., a related party, as representative of the several underwriters (the “Underwriters”). At the closing, we issued 29,487,180 shares of Common Stock, inclusive of 3,846,154 shares of Common Stock issued pursuant to the full exercise of the Underwriter’s option to purchase Common Stock. We received gross proceeds of approximately $172.5 million from the 2021 common stock offering. Net proceeds received were approximately $163 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before expenses.
The net proceeds of the Common Stock offering and the Senior Notes offering, described below, are expected to be used to support our clean energy growth initiatives, to make a prepayment towards the outstanding U.S. Revolving Credit Facility and permanently reduce the commitments under our senior secured credit facilities. 
2021 Senior Notes Offering
As described in Note 25, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, on February 12, 2021, we completed a public offering of $120 million aggregate principal amount of our 8.125% senior notes due 2026 (the “Senior Notes”). The offering was conducted pursuant to an underwriting agreement (the “Notes Underwriting Agreement”) dated February 10, 2021, between us and B. Riley Securities, Inc., a related party, as representative of several underwriters (the “Underwriters”). At the completion, we received gross proceeds of approximately $125 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes, inclusive of $5 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes issued pursuant to the full exercise of the Underwriter’s option to purchase Senior Notes. Net proceeds received were approximately $120 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but before expenses.
In addition to the public offering, we issued $35 million of Senior Notes to B. Riley Financial, Inc., a related party, in exchange for a deemed prepayment of our existing Last Out Term Loan' Tranche A-6 in a concurrent private offering.
On February 12, 2021, we also entered into an indenture (the “Base Indenture”) and a supplemental indenture (the “Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture, the “Indenture”) with The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), among the Company and the Trustee. The Indenture establishes the form and provides for the issuance of the Senior Notes.
The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s other existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Senior Notes are effectively subordinated in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future secured indebtedness and structurally subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness of the Company’s subsidiaries, including trade payables. The Notes bear interest at the rate of 8.125% per annum. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable quarterly in arrears on January 31, April 30, July 31 and October 31 of each year, commencing on April 30, 2021. The Notes will mature on February 28, 2026.
We may, at our option, at any time and from time to time, redeem the Senior Notes for cash in whole or in part (i) on or after February 28, 2022 and prior to February 28, 2023, at a price equal to $25.75 per Senior Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, (ii) on or after February 28, 2023 and prior to February 29, 2024, at a price equal to $25.50 per Senior Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption, (iii) on or after February 29, 2024 and prior to February 28, 2025, at a price equal to $25.25 per Senior Note, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption and (iv) on or after February 28, 2025 and prior to maturity, at a price equal to 100% of their principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the date of redemption. On and after any redemption date, interest will cease to accrue on the redeemed Notes.
The Indenture contains customary events of default and cure provisions. If an uncured default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the holders of at least 25% of the principal amount of the Senior Notes may declare the entire amount of the Senior Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to be immediately due and payable. In the case of an event of default involving the Company’s bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization, the principal of, and accrued and unpaid interest on, the principal amount of the Senior Notes, together with accrued and unpaid interest, if any, will automatically, and without any declaration or other action on the part of the Trustee or the holders of the Senior Notes, become due and payable.
Amendments to the A&R Credit Agreement
As described in Note 25, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, on February 8, 2021, we entered into A&R Amendment No. 2 with Bank of America. A&R Amendment No. 2, among other matters, (i) permits the issuance of the Senior Notes in the 2021 senior notes offering described above, (ii) permits the deemed prepayment of $35 million of our Tranche A term loan with $35 million principal amount of Senior Notes, (iii) provides that 75% of the Senior Notes gross proceeds shall be used to repay outstanding borrowings and permanently reduce the commitments under our senior secured credit facilities, and (iv) provide that $5 million of certain previously deferred facility fees will be paid by the Company.
As described in Note 25, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, on March 4, 2021, we entered into A&R Amendment No. 3 with Bank of America. A&R Amendment No. 3, among other matters, at the date of effectiveness (i) permits the prepayment of certain term loans, (ii) reduces the revolving credit commitments to 
$130 million and removes the ability to obtain revolving loans under the credit agreement, and (iii) amends certain covenants and conditions to the extension of credit. 
On March 4, 2021, effective with the execution of Amendment No. 3, we paid $75 million towards our existing Last Out Term Loans and paid $21.8 million of accrued and deferred fees related to the revolving credit facility. 
2021 Exchange Agreement
As described in Note 25, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report, on February 12, 2021, the Company and B. Riley Financial, Inc. (“B. Riley”), a related party, entered into a letter agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) pursuant to which we agreed to issue to B. Riley $35 million aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes in exchange for a deemed prepayment of $35 million of our existing Tranche A term loan with B. Riley (the “Exchange”). The Exchange Agreement also provides that, promptly following the date of the Exchange Agreement, the parties thereto will negotiate in good faith and use commercially reasonable efforts to enter into an agreement providing B. Riley or its designated affiliates with customary registration rights in respect of the Senior Notes issued to B. Riley in the Exchange.
On February 12, 2021, we issued $35 million of Senior Notes to B. Riley Financial, Inc. in exchange for a deemed prepayment of our existing Last Out Term Loan' Tranche A-6.
COVID-19
In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was identified in Wuhan, China and has subsequently spread globally. This global pandemic has disrupted business operations, trade, commerce, financial and credit markets, and daily life throughout the world. Our business has been, and continues to be, adversely impacted by the measures taken and restrictions imposed in the countries in which we operate and by local governments and others to control the spread of this virus. These measures and restrictions have varied widely and have been subject to significant changes from time to time depending on the changes in the severity of the virus in these countries and localities. These restrictions, including travel and curtailment of other activity, negatively impact our ability to conduct business. The volatility and variability of the virus has limited our ability to forecast the impact of the virus on our customers and our business. The continuing resurgence of COVID-19, including at least one new strain thereof, has resulted in the reimposition of certain restrictions and may lead to other restrictions being implemented in response to efforts to reduce the spread of the virus. These varying and changing events have caused many of the projects we had anticipated would begin in 2020 to be delayed into 2021 and beyond. Many customers and projects require B&W's employees to travel to customer and project worksites. Certain customers and significant projects are located in areas where travel restrictions have been imposed, certain customers have closed or reduced on-site activities, and timelines for completion of certain projects have, as noted above, been extended into 2021 and beyond. Additionally, out of concern for our employees, even where restrictions permit employees to return to our offices and worksites, we have incurred additional costs to protect our employees as well as, advising those who are uncomfortable returning to worksites due to the pandemic that they are not required to do so for an indefinite period of time. The resulting uncertainty concerning, among other things, the spread and economic impact of the virus has also caused significant volatility and, at times, illiquidity in global equity and credit markets. The full extent of the COVID-19 impact on our operational and financial performance will depend on future developments, including the ultimate duration and spread of the pandemic and related actions taken by the U.S. government, state and local government officials, and international governments to prevent disease spread, as well as the availability and effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccinations in the U.S. and abroad, all of which are uncertain, out of our control, and cannot be predicted.
Beginning in April 2020, as part of the Company’s response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business, the Company has taken a number of cash conservation and cost reduction measures, as described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report. 
Contracts
We execute our contracts through a variety of methods, including fixed-price, cost-plus, target price cost incentive, cost-reimbursable or some combination of these methods. Contracts are usually awarded through a competitive bid process. Factors that customers may consider include price, technical capabilities of equipment and personnel, plant or equipment availability, efficiency, safety record and reputation.
Fixed-price contracts are for a fixed selling price to cover all costs and any profit element for a defined scope of work. Fixed-price contracts entail more risk to us because they require us to predetermine both the quantities of work to be performed and the costs associated with executing the work.
We have contracts that extend beyond one year. Most of our long-term contracts have provisions for progress payments. We attempt to cover anticipated increases in labor, material and service costs of our long-term contracts either through an estimate of such changes, which is reflected in the original price, or through risk-sharing mechanisms, such as escalation or price adjustments for items such as labor and commodity prices. In the event of a contract deferral or cancellation without cause, we generally would be entitled to recover costs incurred, settlement expenses and profit on work completed prior to deferral or termination. Significant or numerous cancellations could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
From time to time, we partner with other companies to meet the needs of our customers, which can result in project-related joint venture entities or other contractual arrangements. While we carefully select our partners in these arrangements, they can subject us to risks that we may not be able to fully control and may include joint and several liability. An example of this includes BWL Energy Ltd., which was formed to complete the construction of a waste wood fired boiler contract in the United Kingdom (the fifth European B&W Renewable EPC loss contracts described in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report). This joint venture combined our expertise in waste-to-energy power plant design, engineering, procurement and construction with our partner's civil construction capability to provide a full turnkey product to our customer. 
We generally recognize our contract revenues and related costs over time using the cost-to-cost input method that uses costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligations. Accordingly, we review contractual sales price and cost estimates regularly as the work progresses and reflect adjustments in profit proportionate to the percentage-of-completion in the period when we revise those estimates. To the extent that these adjustments result in a reduction or an elimination of previously reported profits with respect to a contract, we would recognize a charge against current earnings, which could be material.
See further description of risks related to our contracting in Risks Related to Our Operations in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report.
Our arrangements with customers frequently require us to provide letters of credit, bid and performance bonds or guarantees to secure bids or performance under contracts, which may involve providing cash collateral or other contract security that we may not be able to provide.
Other sales, such as parts and certain aftermarket service activities, are not in the form of long-term contracts, and we recognize revenues as goods are delivered and work is performed. See further discussion in Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Foreign Operations
Our operations in Denmark provide comprehensive services to companies in the waste-to-energy and biomass energy sector of the power generation market, currently primarily in Europe. Our operations in Italy provide custom-engineered comprehensive wet and dry cooling solutions and aftermarket parts and services to the power generation industry including natural gas-fired and renewable energy power plants, as well as downstream oil and gas, petrochemical and other industrial end markets in Europe, the Middle East and the Americas. Our operations in Scotland and China primarily provide boiler cleaning technologies and systems (such as sootblowers), primarily to Europe and China, respectively. Our Canadian operations serve the Canadian industrial power, oil production and electric utility markets. We have manufacturing facilities in Mexico to serve global markets. We also own a manufacturing facility in China that produces tube bundles for our cooling solutions.
Our operations are assessed based on three reportable segments which changed in 2020 as part of our strategic, market-focused organizational and re-branding initiative to accelerate growth and provide stakeholders improved visibility into our renewable and environmental growth platforms. The reportable segment change in 2020 also reflects an ongoing integration of our foreign operations services on a worldwide basis, as well as expanding services beyond Europe to meet emerging global demand for these services, including the Americas and the Middle East.
The functional currency of our foreign operating entities is not the United States dollar, and as a result, we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations that impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We do not currently engage in currency hedging activities to limit the risks of currency fluctuations. 
For additional information on the geographic distribution of our revenues, see Note 4 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report.
Customers
We provide our products and services to a diverse customer base that includes utilities and other power producers located around the world. We have no customers that individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019. Refer to Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report for additional information.
Competition
With over 150 years of experience, we have supplied highly engineered energy and environmental equipment in more than 90 countries. We have a competitive advantage in our experience and technical capability to reliably convert a wide range of fuels to steam. Our strong, installed base around the globe also yields competitive advantages, although our markets are highly competitive and price sensitive. We compete with a number of domestic and foreign companies specializing in power generation, environmental, and cooling systems and services. Each segment's primary competitors are summarized as follows:

B&W Renewable segment | B&W Environmental segment | B&W Thermal segment
CNIM Group | Hamon | GE(1) 
Hitachi Zosen | Enexio | MH Power Systems(1)
Martin | Seagull | Babcock Power(1) 
Keppel Seghers | Paharpur | Doosan(1) 
Valmet | Evapco | Clyde Bergemann 
Andritz | SPG Dry | Enerfab 
Steinmuller | Radscan AB | 
 | LAB | 

(1) GE, MH Power Systems, Babcock Power & Doosan are also considered primary competitors of the B&W Environmental Segment.
Across each of our segments, we also compete with a variety of engineering and construction companies related to installation of steam generating systems and environmental control equipment; specialized industrial equipment; and other suppliers of replacement parts, repair and alteration services and other services required to retrofit and maintain existing steam generating systems. The primary bases of competition are price, technical capabilities, quality, timeliness of performance, breadth of products and services and willingness to accept contract risks.
Raw Materials and Suppliers
Our operations use raw materials such as carbon and alloy steels in various forms and components and accessories for assembly, which are available from numerous sources. We do not view ourselves as having any “principal” suppliers because none exceed 10% of the Company’s cost of goods sold. We generally purchase these raw materials and components as needed for individual contracts. We do not depend on a single source of supply for any significant raw materials. Although shortages of some raw materials have existed from time to time, no serious shortage exists at the present time.
Employees
At December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,100 employees worldwide, of which approximately 2,050 were full-time. Approximately 400 of our hourly employees are union-affiliated, covered by four union agreements related to active facilities in Mexico, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Canada. We have one union agreement that expires in 2022 and one that expires in 2023. We are preparing to renegotiate two other agreements that expire in 2021. We consider our relationships with our employees and unions to be in good standing.
Patents and Licenses
We currently hold a large number of United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending. We have acquired patents and technology licenses and granted technology licenses to others when we have considered it advantageous for us to do so. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities and the application thereof, rather than patents and licenses, in the conduct of our various businesses.
Research and Development Activities
Our research and development activities improve our products through innovations to reduce the cost of our products to make them more competitive and through innovations to reduce performance risk of our products to better meet our customer expectations. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.
Permits and Licenses
We are required by various governmental and quasi-governmental agencies to obtain certain permits, licenses and certificates with respect to our operations. The kinds of permits, licenses and certificates required in our operations depend upon a number of factors. We are not aware of any material noncompliance and believe our operations and certifications are currently in compliance with all relevant permits, licenses and certifications.
Environmental
We have been identified as a potentially responsible party at various cleanup sites under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended (“CERCLA”). CERCLA and other environmental laws can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any of the potentially responsible parties, regardless of fault or the lawfulness of the original conduct. Generally, however, where there are multiple responsible parties, a final allocation of costs is made based on the amount and type of wastes disposed of by each party and the number of financially viable parties, although this may not be the case with respect to any particular site. We have not been determined to be a major contributor of wastes to any of these sites. On the basis of our relative contribution of waste to each site, we expect our share of the ultimate liability for the various sites will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations or cash flows in any given year.
