ITEM 1. Business
 
History of our Company

Lazex Inc. (the “Company” or “Slinger”), was formed on July 12, 2015 as a Nevada corporation. From its inception until September 13, 2019, the Company was in the business of providing travel consulting and tour guide services. On September 16, 2019, Slinger Bag Americas Inc. (“Slinger Bag Americas”) acquired 20,000,000 shares of the Company’s common stock from its then shareholders. On September 16, 2019, the Company acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of Slinger Bag Americas when the then owner of Slinger Bag Americas contributed her shares of Slinger Bag Americas to the Company in exchange for 20,000,000 shares of the Company. The result of the foregoing transactions is that Slinger Bag Americas became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. From September 16, 2019 and onward, the Company ceased its performance of travel consulting and tour guide services and has switched its focus to the development of the technologies and products owned by Slinger Bag Americas and its affiliates.
 
On February 10, 2020, Slinger Bag Americas acquired a 100% ownership stake in Slinger Bag Ltd (“SBL”). SBL owns the intellectual property rights pertaining to the Slinger Launcher (described more fully below) and was responsible for the Kickstarter campaign described more fully below.
 
On February 25, 2020, the Company increased the number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 75,000,000 to 300,000,000 and effected a 4-1 forward split of its outstanding shares of common stock. Approval of the Company’s stockholders was not required to be obtained, as authorized by Nevada Revised Statute Section 78.207, et seq. The forward split became effective on February 25, 2020. As a result of the forward stock split, each share of the Company’s common stock outstanding has been split into four shares of the Company’s common stock. All references in this report to numbers of shares reflect the Company’s 4-1 forward split.
 
Through its ownership of Slinger Bag Americas and SBL, Slinger is the owner of the Slinger Launcher and is focused on the Ball Sport Market globally. Slinger has developed and patented a highly portable and affordable ball launcher built into an easy to transport wheeled trolley bag (the “Slinger Launcher”). The Slinger Launcher allows anyone to simply and easily control the speed, frequency and elevation of balls that are launched for practice, training or fitness purposes.
 
Slinger has initially focused all its energies on the Tennis market worldwide, but is in the early stages of developing ball launchers for other ball sports.
 
For the regular tennis player, the Slinger Launcher is much more than a tennis ball launcher. It also functions as a complete tennis bag with ample room for racquets, shoes, towels, water bottles and other accessories and can charge mobile phones and other devices.
 
Tennis Ball machines have been around since the 1950’s when they were introduced by Renne Lacoste. Improvements to performance were made in the 1970’s when Prince started its tennis business on the back of its first product – Little Prince – which was a vacuum operated ball machine. In the 1990’s the first battery operated machines came to the market and since that time very little, if anything, has changed in the structure of ball machines products outside of added computerization. Typically, the machines being marketed by traditional ball machine brands are large, cumbersome and awkward to operate. They are also very expensive – often well above U.S. $1,000. Up until today 99% of all tennis ball machines have sold to tennis facilities, with only a few being sold directly to tennis playing consumers.

According to the Tennis Industry Association (www.tia.org) the single largest challenge facing tennis participation is the fact that 34% of lapsed players cited a “lack of a playing partner” as the reason for them stopping playing tennis. The Slinger Launcher goes a long way to solving this issue.
 
The global tennis market is regarded by industry experts, governing organizations, Tennis brands and tennis-specific market research companies as having 100 million active players globally, with as many consumers again being avid fans of the sport. Of this 100 million tennis player market, 20 million players are regarded as frequent or avid players – players who play regularly - at least 1 time per month. These avid players drive the total tennis industry and account for 80% of all tennis revenues worldwide.
 
It is this avid player market that Slinger is focused on penetrating with its Slinger Launcher and associated tennis accessories.
 
Slinger intends to disrupt this traditional tennis market by creating a new ball machine category – called Slinger Launcher – and marketing portable and affordable Slinger Launchers directly to avid, regular tennis players. Constructed within a wheeled trolley tennis bag, a Slinger Launcher weighs around 15kgs / 34lbs when empty. If stored with 72 balls inside the weight increases to 19kgs / 42lbs. It can easily be stored in a car trunk, wheeled to the court and set up within minutes to use. The Slinger Launcher is powered by a 6.6Ah Lithium battery that can last up to 3.5 hours of play depending on the settings being used and on frequency of use. Slinger Launcher’s convenience as a tennis bag combined with its ease of operation and overall performance as a tennis ball launcher is the basis that the Company will target direct sales to these avid players.
 
While the initial brand focus is clearly on tennis, Slinger is developing similar launchers to address other forms of tennis around the globe that are either rapidly gaining new participants or are already well-established sports in their own right. These include, but are not limited to, Pickleball (USA), Soft Tennis (Japan), Squash (International Markets) and Paddle Tennis (International markets) all of which are currently in either development or testing and planned for introduction in calendar 2022.
 
On December 3, 2020, Slinger signed an exclusive agreement with Flixsense Pty Limited d/b/a Gameface for the development of a tennis specific artificial intelligence (AI) application. Slinger intends to introduce a market disrupting tennis app for players of all ages and abilities. This app will provide a wide range of analytics and other services and include practice and tennis fitness drills and activities, coaching tips and advice and a full suite of AI analytics. Slinger will offer some services free of charge and will build a tiered subscription model for others. The app is expected to be ready to launch to the market later in calendar 2021. 
 
In future years, the Company plans to enter new ball sport markets such as baseball, softball, cricket, badminton and others.
 
Slinger’s manufacturing capacity was initially approximately 2,000 units per month, but with improvements and efficiencies in the manufacturing processes across all vendor partners, the monthly production capacity rose to over 3,000 in the last fiscal quarter and current capacity is now over 5,000 units per month, which will support Slinger’s future sales targets. 
 
Slinger delivers Slinger Launchers directly from the final assembly facility in Xiamen, China to customers either by direct shipment from the port in China, or to third party logistics facilities in Columbia SC (USA) to support our US business, Belleville, Ontario, Canada, Rotterdam, The Netherlands to support smaller distributors in Canada, Europe, Middle East, Africa, and lastly to Israel.
 
Additionally, we ship full containers of our Slinger Triniti Tennis Balls from Wilson (our supplier) in Thailand to the United States for onward distribution.
 
The Company has contracted with exclusive distributors globally. These include Japan, UK, Ireland, Switzerland, Scandinavian markets (covering Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland) Australia, New Zealand, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Singapore, Morocco, Slovenia, Slovkian Republic, Hungary, Croatia, Germany, Austria, France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg, Russia, Middle East GCC markets, Egypt, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Malaysia Czech and Slovak Republics, Greece, Panama, South Africa, Hong Kong, Macau and China and we are in various stages of negotiation with other potential market distribution companies across the globe. Manufacturing production remains at full capacity – currently 5,000 units per month and Slinger has products leaving our production facility in Xiamen, China on a weekly basis en-route to our distribution centers in the United States and Europe and to our key distributor partners. 
 
Our principal executive office is located at 2709 N. Rolling Road, Suite 138, Windsor Mill, MD 21244, and our telephone number is 443-407-7564.

Strategy
 
The Company has an opportunity to disrupt the traditional tennis market globally. The Company expects to drive 80% of its global revenues through its direct-to-consumer go-to-market strategy, whether that be through its on-line e-commerce platform at www.slingerbag.com or through associated e-commerce platforms established and managed by its distribution network. The balance of revenues will be driven through partnerships with leading wholesalers, federations and teaching pro organizations and other transactions across various markets. The Company will operate a third-party distributor structure in all markets with the exception of the United States, the largest tennis market globally, Canada and its founder’s home market of Israel. Distributor partners will have exclusive territories and will have a recognized background within the tennis industry for their market as well as having the financial capacity and service infrastructure to aggressively grow the Slinger brand. Uniquely in the sports industry, all consumer orders received into Slingerbag.com from markets outside the United States will be routed back to our local distribution partners to fulfill and to service their local customers. All distributor partners will purchase with advanced orders, either based on a vendor-direct FOB Asia direct ship or through 1 of our 3 global 3rd party distribution facilities on a duty paid basis and at premium cost price. Currently, the Company has signed a number of exclusive distribution agreements in key markets and has on-going discussions with other key potential distributor partners in other markets around the globe and is looking to close these distribution arrangements in the coming months. 


The United States market will remain a direct-to-consumer market for Slinger. As the largest tennis market in the world with 17.4 million players of which 10.5 million are regular / avid players, the United States is a key market both to establish the Slinger brand and to drive demonstrable growth. Recently the industry reported a significant increase in US tennis participation and overall number of tennis play occasions, something that has been replicated in other key tennis markets around the globe. Direct-to-consumer sales will be supplemented by one or more leading tennis wholesalers who manage large databases of coach, player, college, high school and club clients. This market will be serviced out of a third-party logistics facility in West Columbia, SC and operated by one of Slinger’s preferred global logistics partners, DSV, one of the world’s leading suppliers of freight-forwarding, logistics and warehousing.
 
Brand Marketing
 
As a direct-to-consumer e-commerce brand, all marketing activity and advertising media will be centered around pushing consumers to www.slingerbag.com and converting them to purchases. Slinger has engaged a number of leading agencies to support its global marketing efforts:
 
Brand Nation is a world class influencer marketing agency based in London. Brand Nation will lead all influencer programming globally. Slinger has seeded about 50% of its planned 1,000 global influencers to date. Influencers targeted are wide ranging and include leading sports, tennis, film, TV, music and blogger celebrities all known for the fact that they play tennis regularly and have a fan base in excess of 10,000 followers. All influencer activity is rolled back up to the Slinger social media platforms as a means of generating significant brand awareness and product interest.
 
Ad Venture Media Group is a New York based leading PPC (pay-per-click) agency whose work is grounded in sophisticated scientific analysis of consumer data and consumer trends and they are recognized globally as leaders in paid search and paid social media campaigns. Ad Venture Media will lead all Slinger PPC activity on a performance-based fee structure and is briefed to drive consumer engagement, through bespoke advertising campaigns that are aligned to our product profitability objectives.
 
In the United States market, we have partnered with an organization called Team HQS who will manage an affiliate marketing program across USA based teaching professionals, players, juniors and events. These affiliates will be provided with unique affiliate marketing codes to share with their social media followers and other such communities that they are connected to and each will receive an affiliate marketing fee based on revenues generated by consumers purchasing Slinger products attributable to their unique code.
 
We continue to evaluate each support agency on a monthly basis and at the same time are continually exploring new avenues to expand our reach to our core customers.
 
Each of our distributor partners around the world are establishing their Slinger distribution business as Slinger itself would do if it was establishing a Slinger subsidiary in each market. As such, each distributor will also adopt all forms of Slinger brand marketing programs as well as initiating new local concepts of their own – all aimed at reaching the avid/regular tennis player directly and ensuring that the Slinger brand message is consistent around the globe. Slinger has agreed a local marketing budget structure with each distributor as part of its distribution agreement. This marketing budget will be primarily funded by the distributor partner with an additional contribution coming from Slinger with the contribution being linked to the distributors purchase objectives. Each distributor will execute local grassroots programs including demonstration days, local teaching pro partnerships, specialist tennis network communications, seeding of Slinger product locally as necessary to local key market tennis influencers to further increase the intensity of the influencer effort. Marketing dollars will also be allocated to Google, Facebook, YouTube and other social media advertising spend and, where appropriate, approved and overseen by Ad Venture Media Group.

Research and Development
 
The Company is involved in additional research and development of transportable, affordable and player-enhancing ball launching machines and associated game improvement products for all ball sports. Following a successful launch of its tennis ball launcher, Slinger is currently field testing its new pickleball, padel and soft tennis launchers, which are expected to be introduced to the market in calendar 2022. Slinger plans to introduce similar transportable, versatile and affordable ball launchers for baseball, softball, cricket and other high participation ball sports over the course of the next 3 years. In this connection, on September 10, 2020, Slinger entered into an agreement with Igloo Design, which is the same company that designed the Slinger Launcher for tennis, for a Slinger ball launcher for baseball and softball. This development commenced during the three months ended October 31, 2020 and initial design ideas and further direction have been provided.
 
Slinger retains outside consultants to provide research and product design services and each consultant has a specific expertise (e.g., molding technology, electronics, product design, bag design as examples). We also are working with a select group of highly qualified and resourceful third-party suppliers in Asia. We are continually striving to identify product enhancements, new concepts and improvements to the production process on an on-going daily basis. In respect of any new project, management provides detailed briefs, market data, product cost targets, competitive analysis, timelines and project cost goals to either the product consultants or vendors and manages them to agreed key performance indicators (“KPIs”). These KPI’s include but are not limited to (i) manufacturing to target costs; (ii) agreed development timelines; (iii) established quality criteria; and (iv) defined performance criteria.
 
We also retain specialist trademark and patent attorneys and work with these attorneys on the projects, as needed.
 
Government Regulation
 
Both Slinger Launcher and Slinger Oscillator meet all the United States government requirements for electrical, radio wave and battery standards as well as having all necessary and required certification to facilitate global marketing and sales of these products.
Quality Control
 
Quality control is a critical function within Slinger. As a new brand our business enterprise success will be solely dependent on the quality and consistency of our products. To ensure the highest levels of quality control, Slinger has engaged a QC/Vendor Management partner located in Taiwan with offices in Southern China. The QC partner, Stride-Innovation, has over 30 years of experience working with ball sport companies such as ours and is steeped in knowledge, resources and experience in working with Chinese vendors of sports equipment.
 
In partnership, together, we have created and documented Slinger quality guidelines, testing procedures and warranty processes. We have implemented an agreed Quality Audit process for all product parts being received and used by our product assembly vendor. All products go through a rigorous, statistically valid QC testing approval process before being confirmed as available to be released for shipment to one of our distribution centers or to any of our distribution partners.
 
Slinger offers a limited warranty with all purchases in accordance with local market statutory regulations. This limited warranty can be further extended by the purchaser registering his/her unique product serial number at www.slingerbag.com/warranty.
 
Vendors
 
Slinger only works with and through highly reputable third-party suppliers. We are in the process of finalizing vendor agreements with each of our key vendor partners and with our vendor management partner. Our management and our vendor management partner, Stride-Innovation, regularly visit the vendor facilities and monitor production, employee conditions and welfare and undertake quality control testing. We do not utilize or condone the use of child labor of any kind in the production of our products. We ensure that our vendor partners are providing quality workplace conditions, workplace health and safety, employee care and support programs that meet or exceed all statutory requirements.

Employees
 
We have eight people providing us services on a full-time basis – our chief executive officer, chief financial officer, controller, chief marketing officer and chief operating officer together with two people in global customer service and a global marketing coordinator. Our chief business integration officer, chief innovation officer and general counsel are also employed pursuant to service agreements, but are not providing us services on a full-time basis. As such, our total number of employees is eleven, which consists of eight full-time and three part-time employees.
Advisory Board
 
In October 2020, we appointed our first three representatives to join the newly formed Slinger Advisory Board. George Mackin joined the advisory board as a Media and Smart technology expert having previously owned the Indian Wells Tennis event and Tennis.com media and is currently Chairman of PlaySight Interactive Ltd. (PlaySight) having led PlaySight to a high level of success within the global tennis industry, Rodney Rapson joined our Advisory Board as an experienced smart technology expert and Jeff Angus joined to add support and experience to our marketing team.
Going Concern
 
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes the Company will be able to realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business for the foreseeable future. The Company has an accumulated deficit of $28,823,273 as of April 30, 2021 and more losses are anticipated in the development of the business. Accordingly, there is substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. These financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the Company be unable to continue as a going concern.
 
The ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the Company generating profitable operations in the future and/or being able to obtain the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due. Management intends to finance operating costs over the next twelve months with existing cash on hand, loans from related parties, and/or private placement of debt and/or common stock. 
 
There can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources. The lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the Company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would, therefore, have a material adverse effect on its business. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any such required funds, if available, will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the Company’s existing stockholders.
 
The Company intends to overcome the circumstances that impact its ability to remain a going concern through a combination of the commencement of revenues, with interim cash flow deficiencies being addressed through additional equity and debt financing. The Company anticipates raising additional funds through public or private financing, strategic relationships or other arrangements in the near future to support its business operations; however, the Company may not have commitments from third parties for a sufficient amount of additional capital. The Company cannot be certain that any such financing will be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and its failure to raise capital when needed could limit its ability to continue its operations. The Company’s ability to obtain additional funding will determine its ability to continue as a going concern. Failure to secure additional financing in a timely manner and on favorable terms would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial performance, results of operations and stock price and require it to curtail or cease operations, sell off its assets, seek protection from its creditors through bankruptcy proceedings, or otherwise. Furthermore, additional equity financing may be dilutive to the holders of the Company’s common stock, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants, and strategic relationships, if necessary, to raise additional funds, and may require that the Company relinquish valuable rights.
