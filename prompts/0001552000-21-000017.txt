Item 1. Business
OVERVIEW
We are a diversified, large-cap master limited partnership (“MLP”) formed in 2012 by MPC (as our sponsor) that owns and operates midstream energy infrastructure and logistics assets, and provides fuels distribution services. Our assets include a network of crude oil and refined product pipelines; an inland marine business; light-product, asphalt, heavy oil and marine terminals; storage caverns; refinery tanks, docks, loading racks, and associated piping; crude oil and natural gas gathering systems and pipelines; as well as natural gas and NGL processing and fractionation facilities. The operation of these assets are conducted in our Logistics and Storage (“L&S”) and Gathering and Processing (“G&P”) operating segments. Our assets are positioned throughout the United States as depicted in the map below. Our L&S segment primarily engages in the transportation, storage, distribution and marketing of crude oil, asphalt and refined petroleum products. The L&S segment also includes the operation of our inland marine business, terminals, rail facilities, storage caverns and refining logistics. Our G&P segment primarily engages in the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas as well as the gathering, transportation, fractionation, storage and marketing of NGLs. For more information on these segments, see Our Operating Segments discussion below. The map below and Item 2. Properties provide information about our assets as of December 31, 2020: 
We continue to have a strategic relationship with MPC, which is a large source of our revenues. We have executed numerous long-term, fee-based agreements with minimum volume commitments with MPC which provide us with a stable and predictable revenue stream and source of cash flows. As of December 31, 2020, MPC owned our general partner and approximately 62 percent of our outstanding common units. MPC will continue to be an important source of our revenues and cash flows for the foreseeable future. We also have long-term relationships with a diverse set of producer customers in many crude oil and natural gas resource plays, including the Permian Basin, Marcellus Shale, Utica Shale, STACK Shale and Bakken Shale, among others.

The growth of our business has provided us with the financial flexibility to maintain an investment grade credit profile, fund our organic growth capital plan with operating cash or debt, create the opportunity to execute a unit repurchase program, and achieve excess cash flow after capital investments and distributions. We continue to evaluate opportunities to develop, expand and participate in projects which complement our existing assets in addition to evaluating non-organic growth opportunities through third-party midstream acquisitions to enhance our existing geographic footprint or expand our activities into new areas. We also assess opportunities to optimize our portfolio of assets through strategic dispositions.
2020 RESULTS
The following table summarizes the operating performance for each segment for the year ended December 31, 2020. For further discussion of our segments and a reconciliation to our Consolidated Statements of Income, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations as well as Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 10. 
(1)    Includes impairment expense of $1.3 billion related to three equity method investments within our G&P segment.
(2)    Includes impairment expense for goodwill, equity method investments, intangible assets and property, plant and equipment of $1.8 billion, $1.3 billion, $177 million and $174 million, respectively.
2020 ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS AND OTHER HIGHLIGHTS
•On November 2, 2020, MPLX announced the board authorization of a unit repurchase program for the repurchase of up to $1 billion of MPLX’s outstanding common units held by the public. MPLX may utilize various methods to effect the repurchases, which could include open market repurchases, negotiated block transactions, tender offers, accelerated unit repurchases or open market solicitations for units, some of which may be effected through Rule 10b5-1 plans. The timing and amount of repurchases will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, and repurchases may be initiated, suspended or discontinued at any time. The repurchase authorization has no expiration date. As of December 31, 2020, 1,473,843 common units held by the public have been repurchased and $967 million remained outstanding under the program for future repurchases.
Table of Contents

•On August 18, 2020, MPLX issued $3 billion aggregate principal amount of new senior notes consisting of $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 1.750 percent senior notes due March 2026 and $1.5 billion aggregate principal amount of 2.650 percent senior notes due August 2030. The net proceeds were used to repay the $1.0 billion of outstanding borrowings under the MPLX Term Loan Agreement, to repay the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of floating rate notes due September 2021, to redeem all of the $450 million aggregate principal amount of 6.375 percent senior notes due May 2024, to reduce amounts outstanding under the MPLX Credit Agreement at the time, and to redeem the $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.250 percent senior notes due October 15, 2022. 
•On July 31, 2020, MPLX completed the transfer of Western Refining Wholesale, LLC (“WRW”) to Western Refining Southwest, Inc. (now known as Western Refining Southwest LLC) (“WRSW”), a wholly owned subsidiary of MPC, in exchange for the redemption of 18,582,088 MPLX common units held by WRSW (the “Wholesale Exchange”), valued at $340 million. The transaction effects the transfer to MPC of the Western wholesale distribution business that MPLX acquired as a result of its acquisition of ANDX. 
•During the year, our sponsor progressed certain strategic priorities to lay a foundation for long-term success, including plans to optimize its assets and structurally lower costs in 2021 and beyond, which included an involuntary workforce reduction plan. The workforce reduction plan, together with employee reductions resulting from MPC's indefinite idling of its Martinez, California and Gallup, New Mexico refineries, affected approximately 2,050 employees. All of the employees that conduct MPLX’s business are directly employed by affiliates of MPC, and certain of those employees were affected by MPC’s workforce reductions. During 2020, MPLX reimbursed MPC $37 million related to severance and employee benefits related expenses that MPC recorded in connection with its workforce reductions.
•We previously announced a goal to reduce planned capital spending for 2020 by approximately $700 million from our initial plan, which we were able to achieve.
•The outbreak of COVID-19 and its development into a pandemic in March 2020 resulted in significant economic disruption globally. Actions taken by various governmental authorities, individuals and companies around the world to prevent the spread of COVID-19 through social distancing have restricted travel, many business operations, public gatherings and the overall level of individual movement and in-person interaction across the globe. Although there have been some signs of economic improvement since that time, these events significantly reduced global economic activity and resulted in a decline in the demand for the midstream services we provide beginning with the first quarter of 2020. Macroeconomic conditions and global geopolitical events have also resulted in significant price volatility related to those aforementioned products. We responded to the impacts that these matters had on our business by:
•Taking actions to reduce operating expenses across the business, including the deferral of certain expense projects
•Continuing to evaluate and high-grade our capital portfolio
During the first quarter of 2020, the overall deterioration in the economy and the environment in which MPLX and its customers operate, as well as a sustained decrease in unit price, were considered triggering events resulting in impairments of the carrying value of certain assets. We recognized impairments related to goodwill, certain equity method investments and certain long-lived assets (including intangibles), within our G&P segment. Many of our producer customers refined and updated production forecasts in response to the current environment, which impacted their current and expected future demand for our services, including the future utilization of our assets. Additionally, certain of our contracts have commodity price exposure, including NGL prices, which have experienced increased volatility as noted above. 
•On March 18, 2020, MPC announced the unanimous decision of its board of directors to maintain MPC’s current midstream structure, with MPC remaining the general partner of MPLX. This was a result of a comprehensive evaluation by a special committee formed by MPC’s board of directors, which included extensive input from multiple external advisors and significant feedback from investors.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
•In line with previously announced efforts around portfolio optimization, the company closed on the sale of its Javelina plant in Corpus Christi, Texas, on February 12, 2021.
•On January 28, 2021, we announced the board of directors of our general partner had declared a distribution of $0.6875 per common unit that was paid on February 12, 2021 to common unitholders of record on February 8, 2021. 
•On December 29, 2020, MPLX announced the redemption of all the $750 million outstanding aggregate principal amount of 5.250 percent senior notes due January 15, 2025, including approximately $42 million aggregate principal amount of senior notes issued by Andeavor Logistics LP and Tesoro Logistics Finance Corp. The notes were redeemed on January 15, 2021 at a price equal to 102.625 percent of the principal amount.
BUSINESS STRATEGIES 
Enhance Cash Flow Stability: We are focused on growing our fee-based services through long-term contracts which provide through-cycle cash flow stability. Planned investments in long-haul pipelines are expected to connect supply to demand markets while adding a source of stable cash flow to the company and expanding our export capabilities to enhance our ability to meet significant growing market needs both domestically and globally. 
Continued Capital Discipline and Focus on Lowering Cost Structure: We are focused on lowering our overall cost structure and being disciplined in capital allocation. This means lowering our costs in all aspects of our business and challenging ourselves to be disciplined in every expense dollar we spend across our organization. We look to high-grade our portfolio of investment opportunities to ensure efficient deployment of capital focusing on projects with the highest returns.
Generate Excess Cash: We maintain our goal to achieve excess free cash flow, net of both capital investments and distributions, for 2021. We expect to achieve this through a combination of continued earnings growth and capital discipline. We believe generating excess cash flow will broaden our value-creation options for our unit holders and enhance our long-term financial flexibility.
Maintain Safe and Reliable Operations: We believe that providing safe, reliable and efficient services is a key component in generating stable cash flows. We are committed to maintaining and improving the safety, reliability and efficiency of our operations. Our intent is to continue promoting high standards for safety and environmental stewardship.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
As of December 31, 2020, our diversified services in the midstream sector are across the hydrocarbon value chain. The types of services provided by the midstream sector, broken down by our segments, are as follows:
L&S:
The midstream sector plays a crucial role in the oil and gas industry by providing transportation, storage and marketing services across the hydrocarbon value chain as depicted below. 
Table of Contents

Crude oil is the primary raw material for transportation fuels and the basis for many products, including plastics, petrochemicals and heating oil for homes. Pipelines bring advantaged North American crude oil from the upper Great Plains, Louisiana, Texas, Canada and West Coast to numerous refineries throughout the United States. Terminals provide for the receipt, storage, blending, additization, handling and redelivery of refined petroleum products via pipeline, rail, marine and over-the-road modes of transportation. This network of logistics infrastructure also allows for export opportunities by connecting supply to global demand markets. The hydrocarbon market is often volatile and the ability to take advantage of fast-moving market conditions is enhanced by the ability to store crude oil and other hydrocarbon-based products at tank farms, caverns, and tanks at refineries and terminals. The ability to store both crude and refined petroleum products provides flexibility and logistics optionality which allows participants within the industry to take advantage of changing market conditions. 
G&P:
The midstream natural gas industry is the link between the exploration for, and production of, natural gas and the delivery of its hydrocarbon components to end-use markets. The components of this value chain are graphically depicted and further described below:
•Gathering. The natural gas production process begins with the drilling of wells into gas-bearing rock formations. At the initial stages of the midstream value chain, a network of pipelines known as gathering systems directly connect to wellheads in the production area. These gathering systems then transport raw, or untreated, natural gas to a central location for treating and processing. 
•Processing. Natural gas has a widely varying composition depending on the field, formation reservoir or facility from which it is produced. Processing removes the heavier and more valuable hydrocarbon components, which are extracted as a mixed NGL stream that includes ethane, propane, butanes and natural gasoline (also referred to as “y-grade”). Processing aids in allowing the residue gas remaining after extraction of NGLs to meet the quality specifications for long-haul pipeline transportation and commercial use.
•Fractionation. Fractionation is the separation of the mixture of extracted NGLs into individual components for end-use sale. Fractionation systems typically exist either as an integral part of a gas processing plant or as a central fractionator.
•Storage, transportation and marketing. Once the raw natural gas has been treated or processed and the raw NGL mix has been fractionated into individual NGL components, the natural gas is delivered to downstream transmission pipelines and NGL components are stored, transported and marketed to end-use markets. 
Due to advances in well completion technology and horizontal drilling techniques, unconventional sources, such as shale and tight sand formations, have become a source of current and expected future natural gas production. The industry as a whole is characterized by regional competition, based on the proximity of gathering systems and processing/fractionating plants to producing natural gas wells, or to facilities that produce natural gas as a byproduct of refining crude oil. Due to the shift in the source of natural gas production, midstream providers with a significant presence in the shale plays will likely have a competitive advantage. Well-positioned operations allow access to all major NGL markets and provide for

the development of export solutions for producers. This proximity is enhanced by infrastructure build-out and pipeline projects.
OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH MPC
One of our competitive strengths is our strategic relationship with MPC, which is the largest crude oil refiner in the United States in terms of refining capacity. MPC owns and operates 13 refineries in the West Coast, Gulf Coast and Mid-Continent regions of the United States and distributes refined products through transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services provided by its midstream segment, which primarily consists of MPLX. MPLX, through its fuels distribution services, distributes refined products under the Marathon brand through an extensive network of retail locations owned or operated by independent entrepreneurs across the United States.
MPC retains a significant interest in us through its non-economic ownership of our general partner and holding approximately 62 percent of the outstanding common units of MPLX as of December 31, 2020. Given MPC’s significant interest in us, we believe MPC will promote and support the successful execution of our business strategies.
OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS
We conduct our operations in two segments, which include L&S and G&P. As of December 31, 2020, our assets and operations in each of these segments are described below.
L&S:
The L&S segment includes transportation, storage and marketing of crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products. These assets consist of a network of wholly and jointly-owned common carrier crude oil and refined product pipelines and associated storage assets, terminals, storage caverns, tank farm assets including rail and truck racks, an inland marine business, an export terminal and a fuels distribution business. Our pipeline network includes pipelines throughout the continental United States and Alaska. Our storage caverns consist of butane, propane, and liquefied petroleum gas storage with locations in Neal, West Virginia; Woodhaven, Michigan; Robinson, Illinois; and Jal, New Mexico. Our terminal facilities for the receipt, storage, blending, additization, handling and redelivery of refined petroleum products are also located throughout the continental United States and Alaska. We also own tank farm assets at certain MPC refineries in addition to stand-alone tank farms. Our network of terminals and refinery assets also includes rail and truck loading lanes/racks in addition to barge docks which support the transportation of hydrocarbon products via rail, over the road or marine. Our marine business owns and operates boats and barges, including third-party chartered equipment, and includes a Marine Repair Facility (“MRF”), which is a full-service marine shipyard located on the Ohio River adjacent to MPC’s Catlettsburg, Kentucky refinery. We also have ownership in various joint-interests, including LOOP LLC, the only U.S. deep-water oil port, located offshore of Louisiana, which is used to import and export crude oil. Our fuels distribution business provides MPC with a broad range of scheduling and marketing services. For additional information related to our L&S assets, please see Item 2. Properties - Logistics and Storage. Our L&S assets are integral to the success of MPC’s operations. We continue to evaluate projects and opportunities that will further enhance our existing operations and provide valuable services to MPC and third parties. The following table summarizes projects and expansions that are expected to be completed in upcoming years.

Projects | New or expanded capacity | Expected in-service of expansion capacity
Wink to Webster Pipeline-crude oil pipeline | 1,500 mbpd | 2021 
Whistler Pipeline-natural gas pipeline | 2,000 MMcf/d | 2021 
NGL Takeaway System-NGL pipeline | 150 mbpd | 2021 

We generate revenue in the L&S segment primarily by charging tariffs for crude gathering, transporting crude oil, refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products through our pipelines and at our barge docks delivering to domestic and international destinations, and fees for storing crude oil and refined products at our storage facilities. Our marine business generates revenue under a fee-for-capacity contract 
Table of Contents

with MPC. Our fuels distribution business provides services related to the scheduling and marketing of products on behalf of MPC, for which it generates revenue based on the volume of MPC’s products sold each month. Up to July 31, 2020, our wholesale business included the operations of several bulk petroleum distribution plants and a fleet of refined product delivery trucks that distribute commercial wholesale petroleum products. On July 31, 2020, this business was transferred to MPC through the Wholesale Exchange. We are also the operator of additional crude oil and refined product pipelines owned by MPC and third parties for which we are paid operating fees. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 92 percent of L&S segment revenues was generated from MPC. 
G&P:
We operate several natural gas gathering systems with the scope of gathering services that we provide dependent upon the producers’ need and the composition of the raw or untreated gas at our producer customers’ wellheads. For dry gas, we gather and, if necessary, treat the gas and deliver it to downstream transmission systems. For wet gas that contains heavier and more valuable hydrocarbons, we gather the gas for processing at a processing complex. Our natural gas processing complexes remove the heavier and more valuable hydrocarbon components from natural gas. This allows the residue gas remaining after extraction of the NGLs to meet the quality specifications for long-haul pipeline transportation or commercial use. The capacities of our gathering systems and processing complexes are supported by long-term, fee-based agreements with certain major producers and a number of these agreements include acreage dedications. Once natural gas has been processed at a natural gas processing complex, the heavier and more valuable hydrocarbon components, which have been extracted as a mixed NGL stream, can be further separated into their component parts through the process of fractionation. Our NGL fractionation facilities separate the mixture of extracted NGLs into individual purity product components for end-use sale. Our fractionation facilities for propane and heavier NGLs are also supported by long-term, fee-based agreements with certain major producers. 

As a result of natural gas production, we recover ethane from the natural gas stream for certain producer customers, which allows them to meet residue gas pipeline quality specifications and downstream pipeline commitments. Depending on market conditions, producer customers may also benefit from the potential price uplift received from the sale of their ethane. We have connections to several downstream ethane pipelines from many of our systems that benefit our customers. 
As production in geographic regions and market demand continues to evolve, so do our planned capital expenditures. The following table summarizes our properties that are expected to be constructed or have planned expansions in upcoming years. As of December 31, 2020, our gathering and processing assets include approximately 9.2 Bcf/d of gathering capacity, 11.8 Bcf/d of natural gas processing capacity and 911 mbpd of fractionation and stabilization capacity. For a summary of our gas processing facilities, fractionation facilities, natural gas gathering systems, NGL pipelines and natural gas pipelines see Item 2. Properties - Gathering and Processing. The following table summarizes projects and expansions that are expected to be completed in upcoming years.

Plant | Existing capacity | New or expanded capacity | | Expected in-service of expansion capacity | Geographic Region

(2)    Commitments for our transportation services agreements refer to throughput in thousands of barrels per day and, for crude oil transportation services agreements, are adjusted for crude viscosities. Commitments for our cavern storage services agreements refer to thousands of barrels. Commitments for our terminal services agreements refer to quarterly terminal throughput or stipulated volumes in thousands of barrels. Commitments for the fuels distribution services agreements refers to millions of gallons per year. Minimum commitments on some agreements are reduced by any third-party throughput volumes.
(3)    MPC has committed to utilize 100 percent of our available capacity of boats and barges.
(4)    Volume shown represents total shell capacity in thousands of barrels (includes refining logistics tanks). 
(5)    Some terminal services agreements also contain minimum commitments for activities such as blending, additives, on-loading and off-loading, and storage.
Under transportation services agreements containing minimum volume commitments, if MPC fails to transport its minimum throughput volumes during any period, then MPC will pay us a deficiency payment equal to the volume of the deficiency multiplied by the tariff rate then in effect. Under these transportation services agreements, the amount of any deficiency payment paid by MPC may be applied as a credit for any volumes transported on the applicable pipeline in excess of MPC’s minimum volume commitment during a limited number of succeeding periods, after which time any unused credits will expire. 
We have crude oil and asphalt trucking transportation services agreements with MPC. Under these trucking transportation services agreements, we receive a service fee per barrel for gathering barrels and providing trucking, dispatch, delivery and data services.
Under most of our terminal services agreements, if MPC fails to meet its minimum volume commitment during any period, then MPC will pay us a deficiency payment equal to the volume of the deficiency multiplied by the contractual fee then in effect. Some of our terminal services agreements contain minimum commitments for various additional services such as storage and blending.
We have a fuels distribution service agreement with MPC in which MPC pays MPLX a tiered monthly fee based on the volume of MPC’s products sold by MPLX each month, subject to a maximum annual volume. MPLX has agreed to use commercially reasonable efforts to sell not less than a minimum quarterly volume of MPC’s products during each calendar quarter. If MPLX sells less than the minimum quarterly volume of MPC’s products during any calendar quarter despite its commercially reasonable efforts, MPC will pay MPLX a deficiency payment equal to the volume deficiency multiplied by the applicable tiered fee. The dollar amount of actual sales volume of MPC’s products that exceeds the minimum quarterly volume (an “Excess Sale”) for a particular quarter will be applied as a credit, on a first-in-first-out basis, against any future deficiency payment owed by MPC to MPLX during the four calendar quarters immediately following the calendar quarter in which the Excess Sale occurs.
Pipeline Operating Agreements with MPC
We operate various pipelines owned by MPC under operating services agreements. Under these operating services agreements, we receive an operating fee for operating the assets, which include certain MPC wholly owned or partially owned crude oil, natural gas, and refined product pipelines, and for providing various operational services with respect to those assets. We are generally reimbursed for all direct and indirect costs associated with operating the assets and providing such operational services. These agreements vary in length and automatically renew with most agreements being indexed for inflation.
Pipeline Operating Agreements with Third Parties
We maintain and operate six pipelines through our joint interests in Andeavor Logistics Rio Pipeline LLC, BANGL LLC, Capline Pipeline Company LLC, Centennial Pipeline LLC, Louisville-Lexington Operation and Muskegon Pipeline LLC. We receive an operating fee for each of these pipelines, which is subject to adjustment for inflation. In addition, we are reimbursed for specific costs associated with operating each pipeline. The length and renewal terms for each agreement vary.
Transportation and Terminal Services Agreements with Third Parties
We have multiple transportation and terminal services agreements with third parties under which we provide use of pipelines and tank storage, and provide services, facilities and other infrastructure related to the receipt, storage, throughput, blending and delivery of commodities. Some of these agreements are subject to prepaid throughput volumes under which we agree to handle a certain amount of product throughput each month in exchange for a predetermined fixed fee, with any excess throughput or ancillary 
Table of Contents

services subject to additional charges. Under the remaining agreements we receive an agreed upon fee based on actual product throughput following the completion of services.
Marine Services Agreements with MPC
MPLX has a management services agreement and a loss control agreement with MPC under which it provides management and loss control services to assist MPC in the oversight and management of the marine business. MPLX receives fixed annual fees for providing the required services, which are subject to predetermined annual escalation rates. These agreements are subject to an initial terms of five years and automatically renew for one additional five-year renewal period unless terminated by either party.
Other Agreements with MPC
We have omnibus agreements with MPC that address our payment of a fixed annual fee to MPC for the provision of executive management services by certain executive officers of our general partner and our reimbursement to MPC for the provision of certain services to us, as well as MPC’s indemnification of us for certain matters, including certain environmental, title and tax matters. In addition, we indemnify MPC for certain matters under these agreements.
We also have various employee services agreements and a secondment agreement under which we reimburse MPC for the provision of certain operational and management services to us. All of the employees that conduct our business are directly employed by affiliates of our general partner.
Additionally, we have certain indemnification agreements with MPC under which MPC retains responsibility for remediation of known environmental liabilities due to the use or operation of the assets prior to our ownership, and indemnifies us for any losses we incurred arising out of those remediation obligations. The indemnification for unknown pre-closing remediation liabilities is generally limited to five years. 
OUR G&P CONTRACTS WITH MPC AND THIRD PARTIES
The majority of our revenues in the G&P segment are generated from natural gas gathering, transportation and processing; NGL gathering, transportation, fractionation, exchange, marketing and storage; and crude oil gathering and transportation. MPLX enters into a variety of contract types including fee-based, percent-of-proceeds, keep-whole and purchase arrangements in order to generate service revenue and product sales. See Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2 for a further description of these different types of arrangements.
In many cases, MPLX provides services under contracts that contain a combination of more than one of the arrangements described above. The terms of MPLX’s contracts vary based on gas quality conditions, the competitive environment when the contracts are signed and customer requirements. In addition, minimum volume commitments may create contract liabilities or deferred credits if current period payments can be used for future services. These are recognized into service revenue in instances where it is probable the customer will not use the credit in future periods.
MPLX’s contract mix and exposure to natural gas and NGL prices may change as a result of changes in producer preferences, MPLX expansion in regions where some types of contracts are more common and other market factors, including current market and financial conditions which have increased the risk of volatility in oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Any change in mix may influence our long-term financial results.
Keep-whole agreement with MPC
MPLX has a keep-whole commodity agreement with MPC under which MPC pays us a processing fee for NGLs related to keep-whole agreements and delivers shrink gas to the producers on our behalf. We pay MPC a marketing fee in exchange for assuming the commodity risk. The pricing structure under this agreement provides for a base volume subject to a base rate and incremental volumes subject to variable rates, which are calculated with reference to certain of our costs incurred as processor of the volumes. The pricing for both the base and incremental volumes are subject to revision each year.

Within our L&S segment, our competition primarily comes from independent terminal and pipeline companies, integrated petroleum companies, refining and marketing companies, distribution companies with marketing and trading arms and from other wholesale petroleum products distributors. Competition in any particular geographic area is affected significantly by the volume of products produced by refineries in the area, and in areas where no refinery is present, by the availability of products and the cost of transportation to the area from other locations.
As a result of our contractual relationship with MPC under our transportation and storage services agreements, our terminal services agreement, and our physical asset connections to MPC’s refineries and terminals, we believe that MPC will continue to utilize our assets for transportation, storage, distribution and marketing services. If MPC’s customers reduced their purchases of refined products from MPC due to increased availability of less expensive refined product from other suppliers or for other reasons, MPC may only receive or deliver the minimum volumes through our terminals (or pay the shortfall payment if it does not deliver the minimum volumes), which could decrease our revenues.
In our G&P segment, we face competition for natural gas gathering and in obtaining natural gas supplies for our processing and related services; in obtaining unprocessed NGLs for gathering, transportation and fractionation; and in marketing our products and services. Competition for natural gas supplies is based primarily on the location of gas gathering systems and gas processing plants, operating efficiency and reliability, residue gas and NGL market connectivity, the ability to obtain a satisfactory price for products recovered and the fees charged for services supplied to the customer. Competition for oil supplies is based primarily on the price and scope of services, location of gathering/transportation and storage facilities and connectivity to the best priced markets. Competitive factors affecting our fractionation services include availability of fractionation capacity, proximity to supply and industry marketing centers, the fees charged for fractionation services and operating efficiency and reliability of service. Competition for customers to purchase our natural gas and NGLs is based primarily on price, credit and market connectivity.
Our competitors include:
•natural gas midstream providers, of varying financial resources and experience, that gather, transport, process, fractionate, store and market natural gas and NGLs;
•major integrated oil companies and refineries;
•independent exploration and production companies;
•interstate and intrastate pipelines; and
•other marine and land-based transporters of natural gas and NGLs.
Some of our competitors operate as MLPs or are owned by infrastructure funds and may enjoy a cost of capital comparable to and, in some cases, lower than ours. Other competitors, such as major oil and gas and pipeline companies, have capital resources and contracted supplies of natural gas substantially greater than ours. Smaller local distributors may enjoy a marketing advantage in their immediate service areas. 
We believe that our customer focus, demonstrated by our ability to offer an integrated package of services and our flexibility in considering various types of contractual arrangements, allows us to compete more effectively. This includes having access to both NGL and natural gas markets to allow for flexibility in our gathering and processing in addition to having critical connections to a strong sponsor and key market outlets for NGLs and natural gas. Our strategic gathering and processing agreements with key producers enhances our competitive position to participate in the further development of our resource plays. The strategic location of our assets, including those connected to MPC, and the long-term nature of many of our contracts also provide a significant competitive advantage.
INSURANCE
Our assets may experience physical damage as a result of an accident or natural disaster. These hazards can also cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and business interruption. We are insured under MPC and other third-party insurance policies. The MPC policies are subject to shared deductibles.

SEASONALITY
The volume of crude oil and refined products transported and stored utilizing our assets is directly affected by the level of supply and demand for crude oil and refined products in the markets served directly or indirectly by our assets. Any effects of seasonality on the L&S segment’s revenues will be mitigated through the use of our fee-based transportation and storage services agreements with MPC that include minimum volume commitments.
In our G&P segment we experience minimal impacts from seasonal fluctuations which impact the demand for natural gas and NGLs and the related commodity prices caused by various factors including variations in weather patterns from year to year. We are able to manage the seasonality impacts through the execution of our marketing strategy and via our storage capabilities. Overall, our exposure to the seasonality fluctuations is declining due to our growth in fee-based business. 
REGULATORY MATTERS 
Our operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including those relating to the protection of the environment. Such laws and regulations include, among others, the Interstate Commerce Act (“ICA”), the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), the Clean Water Act (“CWA”) with respect to water discharges, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) with respect to solid and hazardous waste treatment, storage and disposal, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) with respect to releases and remediation of hazardous substances and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 (“OPA-90”) with respect to oil pollution and response. New laws are being enacted and regulations are being adopted on a continuing basis, and the costs of compliance with such new laws and regulations are very difficult to estimate until finalized.
For a discussion of environmental capital expenditures and costs of compliance, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Environmental Matters and Compliance Costs. For additional information regarding regulatory risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Pipeline Regulations
Common Carrier Liquids Pipeline Operations 
We have liquids pipelines that are common carriers subject to regulation by various federal, state and local agencies. FERC regulates interstate transportation on liquids pipelines under the ICA, Energy Policy Act of 1992 (“EPAct 1992”) and the rules and regulations promulgated under those laws. The ICA and FERC regulations require that tariff rates for interstate pipelines that transport crude oil, NGLs (including purity ethane) and refined petroleum products (collectively referred to as “petroleum pipelines”), be just and reasonable and the terms and conditions of service must not be unduly discriminatory or confer any undue preference upon any shipper. 
The ICA requires that interstate petroleum pipeline transportation rates and terms and conditions of service be filed with the governing agency, which is FERC, and posted publicly. Under the ICA, persons with a substantial economic interest in a petroleum pipeline’s rate or service may challenge that rate or service before FERC. FERC is authorized to investigate such challenges and may suspend the effectiveness of a newly filed rate or term or condition of service for up to seven months. A successful protest to a new rate or term of condition of service could result in a petroleum pipeline paying refunds, together with interest, for the period that the rate or term or condition of service was in effect. A successful protest could also result in FERC disallowing the rate or service. A successful complaint to an existing rate or service could result in a petroleum pipeline paying refunds, together with interest, for the period beginning two years prior to the date of the filing of the complaint until the just and reasonable rate or service was established. FERC may also investigate, upon complaint, protest, or on its own motion, newly proposed rates and terms of service, existing rates and related rules, and may order a pipeline to change them prospectively or may bar a pipeline from implementing the proposed new or changed rates or terms of service.
EPAct 1992 deemed certain interstate petroleum pipeline rates then in effect to be just and reasonable under the ICA. These rates are commonly referred to as “grandfathered rates.” Our rates for interstate transportation service in effect for the 365-day period ending on the date of the passage of EPAct 1992 
Table of Contents

were deemed just and reasonable and therefore are grandfathered. Subsequent changes to those rates are not grandfathered. New rates have since been established after EPAct 1992 for certain pipelines, and the rates for certain of our refined products pipelines have subsequently been approved as market-based rates. 
EPAct 1992 required FERC to establish a simplified and generally applicable ratemaking methodology for interstate petroleum pipelines. As a result, FERC adopted an indexed rate methodology which, as currently in effect, allows petroleum pipelines to change their rates within prescribed ceiling levels that are tied to annual changes in the producer price index-finished goods (“PPI-FG”). FERC’s indexing methodology is subject to review every five years. During the five-year period commencing July 1, 2016 and ending June 30, 2021, petroleum pipelines charging indexed rates are permitted to adjust their indexed ceilings annually by the change in the PPI-FG plus an adder that is currently set at 1.23 percent. The current adder will be in effect until June 30, 2021 or until revised by a formal rulemaking by FERC. The indexing methodology is applicable to existing rates, including grandfathered rates, with the exclusion of market-based rates and settlement rates (unless permitted under the settlement). A pipeline is not required to raise its rates up to the index ceiling, but it is permitted to do so, and rate increases made under the index are presumed to be just and reasonable unless a protesting party can demonstrate that the portion of the rate increase resulting from application of the index is substantially in excess of the pipeline’s costs. However, FERC is currently evaluating how indexed adjustments to rates can be challenged as well as how pipelines must demonstrate their annual costs and incomes. Therefore, we cannot guarantee FERC will not make changes to its current policy regarding challenges in the future. Under the indexing rate methodology, in any year in which the index is negative, a pipeline must lower the rate ceiling and file to lower rates if any of the pipelines’ rates would otherwise be above the new rate ceiling, unless the pipeline makes a filing attesting that all shippers that pay the rate have approved the pipeline not lowering the rate or the pipeline can demonstrate substantial divergence between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rate resulting from application of the index. 
While petroleum pipelines often use the indexing methodology to change their rates, petroleum pipelines may elect to support proposed rates by using other methodologies such as cost-of-service ratemaking, market-based rates and settlement rates. A pipeline can follow a cost-of-service approach when seeking to increase its rates above the rate ceiling provided that the pipeline can establish that there is a substantial divergence between the actual costs experienced by the pipeline and the rate resulting from application of the index. A pipeline can charge market-based rates if it establishes that it lacks significant market power in the affected markets. In addition, a pipeline can establish rates under settlement if agreed upon by all current shippers. At various times, we have used index rates, settlement rates and market-based rates to change the rates for our different FERC-regulated petroleum pipelines.
Intrastate services provided by certain of our liquids pipelines are subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities. Much of the state regulation is complaint-based, both as to rates and priority of access. Not all state regulatory bodies allow for changes based on an index method similar to that used by FERC. In those instances, rates are generally changed only through a rate case process. The state regulators could limit our ability to increase our rates or to set rates based on our costs or could order us to reduce our rates and could, if permitted under state law, require the payment of refunds to shippers.
FERC and state regulatory agencies generally have not investigated rates on their own initiative when those rates are not the subject of a protest or a complaint by a shipper. FERC or a state commission could investigate our rates on its own initiative or at the urging of a third party if the third party is either a current shipper or is able to show that it has a substantial economic interest in our tariff rate level.
Our liquids pipelines are also subject to safety regulation by the DOT under 49 C.F.R. Part 195 for operators of hazardous liquid pipelines. In October 2019, PHMSA finalized rulemaking reviewing the scope and applicability of 49 C.F.R. Part 195, including, among other things, expansion of reporting obligations, additional inspection requirements, emergency order authority, expansion of integrity management principles and expansion of the use of leak detection systems. These changes became effective in 2020 and could have an impact upon MPLX LP and other pipeline operators. Our liquids pipelines and operations may also be or become subject to state public utility or related jurisdiction, which could impose additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, siting, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of liquids gathering facilities.

FERC-Regulated Natural Gas Pipelines
Our natural gas pipeline operations are subject to federal, state and local regulatory authorities. Under the NGA, FERC has authority to regulate natural gas companies that provide natural gas pipeline transportation services in interstate commerce. FERC’s authority to regulate those services includes the rates charged for the services, terms and conditions of service, certification and construction of new facilities, the extension or abandonment of services and facilities, the maintenance of accounts and records, the acquisition and disposition of facilities, the initiation and discontinuation of services and various other matters. Natural gas companies may not charge rates that have been determined to be unjust and unreasonable, or unduly discriminatory by FERC. In addition, FERC prohibits FERC-regulated natural gas companies from unduly preferring, or unduly discriminating against, any person with respect to pipeline rates or terms and conditions of service or other matters. The rates and terms and conditions for the Hobbs Pipeline and the Arkoma Connector Pipeline can be found in their respective FERC-approved tariffs and in negotiated rate agreements entered into under those tariffs. Rendezvous Pipeline Company has authority to charge market-based rates, and its tariffs and pertinent operational information can be found on its website. Pursuant to FERC’s jurisdiction, existing rates and/or other tariff provisions may be challenged (e.g., by complaint) and rate increases proposed by the pipeline or other tariff changes may be challenged (e.g., by protest). We also cannot be assured that FERC will continue to pursue its approach of pro-competitive policies as it considers matters such as pipeline rates and rules, rights of access, capacity and other issues that impact natural gas facilities. Any successful complaint or protest related to our services or facilities could have an adverse impact on our revenues.
Energy Policy Act of 2005
Under the Domenici-Barton Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“2005 EPAct”), FERC may impose civil penalties for violations of statutory and regulatory requirements. The 2005 EPAct also amends the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision, which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior in contravention of rules and regulations to be prescribed by FERC. FERC issued Order No. 670 to implement the anti-market manipulation provision of the 2005 EPAct. This order makes it unlawful for gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services to: (i) directly or indirectly, use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC; (ii) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (iii) engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person.
Standards of Conduct
FERC has adopted affiliate standards of conduct applicable to interstate natural gas pipelines and certain other regulated entities, defined as “Transmission Providers.” Under these rules, a Transmission Provider becomes subject to the standards of conduct if it provides service to affiliates that engage in marketing functions (as defined in the standards). If a Transmission Provider is subject to the standards of conduct, the Transmission Provider’s transmission function employees (including the transmission function employees of any of its affiliates) must function independently from the Transmission Provider’s marketing function employees (including the marketing function employees of any of its affiliates). The Transmission Provider must also comply with certain posting and other requirements.
Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline Regulation
Some of our intrastate gas pipeline facilities are subject to various state laws and regulations that affect the rates we charge and terms of service. Although state regulation is typically less onerous than FERC, state regulation typically requires pipelines to charge just and reasonable rates and to provide service on a non-discriminatory basis. The rates and service of an intrastate pipeline generally are subject to challenge by complaint. Additionally, FERC has adopted certain regulations and reporting requirements applicable to intrastate natural gas pipelines (and Hinshaw natural gas pipelines) that provide certain interstate services subject to FERC’s jurisdiction. We are subject to such regulations and reporting requirements to the extent that any of our intrastate pipelines provide, or are found to provide, such interstate services.
Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry periodically arise before Congress, FERC and the courts. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these or the above regulatory 
Table of Contents

changes to our natural gas operations. We do not believe that we would be affected by any such action materially differently than other midstream natural gas companies with whom we compete.
Natural Gas Gathering Pipeline Regulation
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas production and gathering from the jurisdiction of FERC. There is, however, no bright-line test for determining the jurisdictional status of pipeline facilities. Rather, FERC looks at a number of factors, including length and diameter of pipeline facilities, extension beyond the central point of the field, geographic configuration, location of compressors and processing plants, location of wells along all or part of the facility and operating pressure of the facilities. We own a number of facilities that we believe qualify as production and gathering facilities not subject to FERC jurisdiction. The distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services is the subject of litigation from time to time, so we cannot provide assurance that FERC will not at some point assert that these facilities are within its jurisdiction or that such an assertion would not adversely affect our results of operations and revenues. In such a case, we would possibly be required to file a tariff with FERC, potentially provide a cost justification for the transportation charge and obtain certificate(s) of public convenience and necessity for the FERC-regulated pipelines, and comply with additional FERC reporting requirements.
In the states in which we operate, regulation of gathering facilities and intrastate pipeline facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, open access, non-discriminatory take requirement and complaint-based rate regulation. For example, some of our natural gas gathering facilities are subject to state ratable take and common purchaser statutes and regulations. Ratable take statutes and regulations generally require gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, common purchaser statutes and regulations generally require gatherers to purchase gas without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. Although state regulation is typically less onerous than at FERC, these statutes and regulations have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or gather natural gas.
Our gathering operations could be adversely affected should they be subject in the future to the application of state or federal regulation of rates and services or regulated as a public utility. Our gathering operations also may be or become subject to safety and operational regulations and permitting requirements relating to the design, siting, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of gathering facilities. Additional rules and legislation pertaining to these matters are considered or adopted from time to time. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such changes might have on our operations, but the industry could be required to incur additional capital expenditures and increased costs depending on future legislative and regulatory changes.
On January 11, 2021, PHMSA published a Final Rule amending the gas pipeline safety regulations at 49 C.F.R. Parts 191 and 192. The effective date of the Final rule is March 12, 2021, with a deferred compliance date of October 1, 2021 for the new amendments. We do not anticipate that we would be impacted by these regulatory initiatives to any greater degree than other similarly situated companies.
Natural Gas Processing
Our natural gas processing operations are not presently subject to FERC or state rate regulation. There can be no assurance that our processing operations will continue to be exempt from rate regulation in the future. In addition, although the processing facilities may not be directly related, other laws and regulations may affect the availability of natural gas for processing, such as state regulation of production rates and maximum daily production allowances from gas wells, which could impact our processing business.
NGL Pipelines
We have constructed various NGL product pipelines to transport NGL products, some of which are regulated by FERC, and we may elect to construct additional such pipelines in the future that may be subject to these same regulatory requirements. Pipelines providing transportation of NGLs in interstate commerce are subject to the same regulatory requirements as common carrier petroleum pipelines. See “Common Carrier Liquids Pipeline Operations” above. 
Table of Contents

Our NGL pipelines are also subject to safety regulation by the DOT under 49 C.F.R. Part 195 for operators of hazardous liquid pipelines. In October 2019, PHMSA finalized rulemaking reviewing the scope and applicability of 49 C.F.R. Part 195, including, among other things, expansion of reporting obligations, additional inspection requirements, emergency order authority, expansion of integrity management principles and expansion of the use of leak detection systems. These changes became effective in 2020 and could have an impact upon MPLX LP and other pipeline operators. Our NGL pipelines and operations may also be or become subject to state public utility or related jurisdiction which could impose additional safety and operational regulations relating to the design, siting, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of NGL gathering facilities.
Marine Transportation 
Our marine transportation business is subject to regulation by the USCG, federal laws, including the Jones Act, state laws and certain international conventions, as well as numerous environmental regulations. The majority of our vessels are subject to inspection by the USCG and carry certificates of inspection. The crews employed aboard the vessels are licensed or certified by the USCG. We are required by various governmental agencies to obtain licenses, certificates and permits for our vessels.
Our marine transportation business competes principally in markets subject to the Jones Act, a federal cabotage law that restricts domestic marine transportation in the United States to vessels built and registered in the United States, and manned and owned by United States citizens. We presently meet all of the requirements of the Jones Act for our vessels. The loss of Jones Act status could have a significant negative effect on our marine transportation business. The requirements that our vessels be United States built and manned by United States citizens, the crewing requirements and material requirements of the USCG, and the application of United States labor and tax laws increases the cost of United States flag vessels when compared with comparable foreign flag vessels. Our marine transportation business could be adversely affected if the Jones Act were to be modified so as to permit foreign competition that is not subject to the same United States government imposed burdens.
The Secretary of Homeland Security is vested with the authority and discretion to waive the Jones Act to such extent and upon such terms as the Secretary may prescribe whenever the Secretary deems that such action is necessary in the interest of national defense. For example, the Secretary has waived the Jones Act generally or with respect to the transportation of certain petroleum products for limited periods of time and in limited areas following the occurrence of certain natural disasters such as hurricanes. Waivers of the Jones Act, whether in response to natural disasters or otherwise, could result in increased competition from foreign tank vessel operators, which could negatively impact our marine transportation business.
Security
Certain of our facilities have been preliminarily classified as subject to the Department of Homeland Security Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards. In addition, we have several facilities that are subject to the United States Coast Guard’s Maritime Transportation Security Act, and a number of other facilities that are subject to the Transportation Security Administration’s Pipeline Security Guidelines and are designated as “Critical Facilities.” The Transportation Security Administration Security Guidelines are subject to change without formal regulatory proposal and review. We have an internal inspection program designed to monitor and ensure compliance with all of these requirements. We believe that we are in material compliance with all applicable laws and regulations regarding the security of our facilities.
ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION 
We believe it is likely that the scientific and political attention to greenhouse gas emissions, climate change and climate adaptation will continue, with the potential for further regulations that could affect our operations. Currently, legislative and regulatory measures to address greenhouse gas emissions are in various phases of review, discussion or implementation. Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls at our facilities, (iii) capture the emissions from our facilities and (iv) administer and manage any greenhouse gas emissions programs, including acquiring emission credits or allotments.
Table of Contents

General
Our processing and fractionation plants, storage facilities, pipelines and associated facilities are subject to multiple obligations and potential liabilities under a variety of federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection. Such environmental laws and regulations may affect many aspects of our present and future operations, including for example, requiring the acquisition of permits or other approvals to conduct regulated activities that may impose burdensome conditions or potentially cause delays, restricting the manner in which we handle or dispose of our wastes, limiting or prohibiting construction or other activities in environmentally sensitive areas such as wetlands or areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species, requiring us to incur capital costs to construct, maintain and/or upgrade processes, equipment and/or facilities, restricting the locations in which we may construct our compressor stations and other facilities and/or requiring the relocation of existing stations and facilities, and requiring remedial actions to mitigate any pollution that might be caused by our operations or attributable to former operations. Spills, releases or other incidents may occur in connection with our active operations or as a result of events outside of our reasonable control, which incidents may result in non-compliance with such laws and regulations. Any failure to comply with these legal requirements may expose us to the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial or corrective actions and the issuance of orders enjoining or limiting some or all of our operations.
We believe that our operations and facilities are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and the cost of continued compliance with such laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition. We cannot assure, however, that existing environmental laws and regulations will not be reinterpreted or revised or that new environmental laws and regulations will not be adopted or become applicable to us. Generally speaking, the trend in environmental law is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may be perceived to adversely affect the environment, which may cause significant delays in obtaining permitting approvals for our facilities, result in the denial of our permitting applications, or cause us to become involved in time consuming and costly litigation. Thus, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for compliance with environmental laws and regulations, permits and permitting requirements or remedial actions pursuant to such laws and regulations, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. Revised or additional environmental requirements may result in increased compliance and mitigation costs or additional operating restrictions, particularly if those costs are not fully recoverable from our customers, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. We may not be able to recover some or any of these costs from insurance. Such revised or additional environmental requirements may also result in substantially increased costs and material delays in the construction of new facilities or expansion of our existing facilities, which may materially impact our ability to meet our construction obligations with our producer customers.
Remediation
A comprehensive framework of environmental laws and regulations governs our operations as they relate to the possible release of hazardous substances or non-hazardous or hazardous wastes into soils, groundwater and surface water and measures taken to mitigate pollution into the environment. CERCLA, also known as the “Superfund” law, as well as comparable state laws, impose liability without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include current and prior owners or operators of a site where a release occurred and companies that transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of the hazardous substances released from the site. Under CERCLA, these persons may be subject to strict joint and several liability for the costs of removing or remediating hazardous substances that have been released into the environment and for restoration costs and damages to natural resources. RCRA and similar state laws may also impose liability for removing or remediating releases of hazardous or non-hazardous wastes from impacted properties. 
We currently own or lease, and have in the past owned or leased, properties that have been used over the years for natural gas gathering, processing and transportation, for NGL fractionation, for the storage, gathering and transportation of crude oil, or for the storage and transportation of refined products. During the normal course of operation, whether by us or prior owners or operators, releases of petroleum hydrocarbons or other non-hazardous or hazardous wastes have or may have occurred. We could be required to remove or remediate previously disposed wastes or property contamination, including 
Table of Contents

groundwater contamination, or to perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. We do not believe that we have any current material liability for cleanup costs under such laws or for third-party claims.
Hazardous and Solid Wastes
We may incur liability under RCRA, and comparable or more stringent state statutes, which impose requirements relating to the handling and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous wastes. In the course of our operations, we generate some amount of ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents and waste oils that may be regulated as hazardous wastes. It is possible that some wastes generated by us that are currently classified as non-hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as hazardous wastes, resulting in the wastes being subject to more rigorous and costly transportation, storage, treatment and disposal requirements.
Water
We maintain numerous discharge permits as required under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program of the CWA and have implemented systems to oversee our compliance with these permits. In addition, we are regulated under OPA-90, which, among other things, requires the owner or operator of a tank vessel or a facility to maintain an emergency plan to respond to releases of oil or hazardous substances. OPA-90 also requires the responsible company to pay resulting removal costs and damages and provides for civil penalties and criminal sanctions for violations of its provisions. We operate tank vessels and facilities from which spills of oil and hazardous substances could occur. We have implemented emergency oil response plans for all of our components and facilities covered by OPA-90 and we have established Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasures plans for all facilities subject to such requirements. Some coastal states in which we operate have passed state laws similar to OPA-90, but with expanded liability provisions, that include provisions for cargo owner responsibility as well as ship owner and operator responsibility.
Construction or maintenance of our plants, compressor stations, pipelines, barge dock and storage facilities may impact wetlands or other surface water bodies, which are also regulated under the CWA by the EPA, the United States Army Corps of Engineers and state water quality agencies. Regulatory requirements governing wetlands and other surface water bodies (including associated mitigation projects) may result in the delay of our projects while we obtain necessary permits and may increase the cost of new projects and maintenance activities. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the CWA and analogous state laws. However, there is no assurance that we will not incur material increases in our operating costs or delays in the construction or expansion of our facilities because of future developments, the implementation of new laws and regulations, the reinterpretation of existing laws and regulations, or otherwise, including, for example, increased construction activities, potential inadvertent releases arising from pursuing borings for pipelines, and earth slips due to heavy rain and/or other causes.
In April 2020, the U.S. District Court in Montana vacated Nationwide Permit 12 (“NWP 12”), which authorizes the placement of fill material in “waters of the United States” for utility line activities as long as certain best management practices are implemented. The decision was ultimately appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which partially reversed the district court’s decision, temporarily reinstating NWP 12 for all projects except the Keystone XL oil pipeline. The United States Army Corps of Engineers subsequently reissued its nationwide permit authorizations on January 13, 2021, by dividing the NWP that authorizes utility line activities (NWP 12) into three separate NWPs that address the differences in how different utility line projects are constructed, the substances they convey, and the different standards and best management practices that help ensure those NWPs authorize only those activities that have no more than minimal adverse environmental effects. The 2021 authorization may be challenged in court or the Biden Administration may repeal or replace the 2021 authorization in a subsequent rulemaking. Repeal or replacement of the rule could impact pipeline maintenance activities. 
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state laws restrict the emission of air pollutants from many sources, including processing plants and compressor stations, and also impose various monitoring and reporting requirements. These laws and any implementing regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or 
Table of Contents

significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements, utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions, or aggregate two or more of our facilities into one application for permitting purposes. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with applicable air permitting and control technology requirements. However, we may be required to incur capital expenditures in the future for installation of air pollution control equipment and encounter construction or operational delays while applying for, or awaiting the review, processing and issuance of new or amended permits, and we may be required to modify certain of our operations which could increase our operating costs. 
In 2015, the EPA finalized a revision to the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (“NAAQS”) for ozone. The EPA lowered the primary ozone NAAQS from 75 parts per billion to 70 parts per billion. In December 2020, the EPA published a rule maintaining this standard. Designation as a nonattainment area could result in increased costs associated with, or result in cancellation or delay of, capital projects at our or our customers’ facilities, or could require nitrogen oxides and/or volatile organic compound reductions that could result in increased costs to us or our customers. We cannot predict the effects of the various state implementation plan requirements at this time.
Climate Change
As a consequence of an EPA administrative conclusion that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) into the ambient air endangers public health and welfare, the EPA adopted regulations establishing the Prevention of Significant Deterioration (“PSD”) construction and Title V operating permit programs for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that already are potential major sources of certain principal, or criteria, pollutant emissions. Although the EPA’s PSD and Title V permit programs are limited to large stationary sources of criteria pollutant emissions, states may seek to adopt their own permitting programs under state laws that require permit reviews of large stationary sources emitting only GHGs. If we were to become subject to Title V and PSD permitting requirements due to non-GHG criteria pollutants, or if the EPA implemented more stringent permitting requirements relating to GHG emissions without regard to non-GHG criteria pollutants, or if states adopt their own permitting programs that require permit reviews based on GHG emissions, we may be required to install “best available control technology,” to the extent such technology is available, to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that we may seek to construct in the future. In addition, we may experience substantial delays or possible curtailment of construction or projects in connection with applying for, obtaining or maintaining preconstruction and operating permits, we may encounter limitations on the design capacities or size of facilities, and we may incur material increases in our construction and operating costs. We are monitoring GHG emissions from certain of our facilities in accordance with current GHG emissions reporting requirements in a manner that we believe is in substantial compliance with applicable reporting obligations.
Also, Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs, and it is possible that such legislation could be enacted in the future. In the absence of federal climate legislation in the United States, a number of state and regional efforts have emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to acquire and surrender emission allowances in return for emitting those GHGs. Although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address GHG emissions would impact our business, any such future laws and regulations could require us to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, to acquire emission allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements including the imposition of a carbon tax. In 2020, the EPA rescinded regulation of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry as originally adopted in the EPA’s 2016 New Source Performance Standards (“NSPS”), which were aimed at minimizing fugitive emissions and establishing methane emission standards for new and modified oil and gas production and natural gas processing and transmission facilities. The EPA’s rescission of the methane emission regulations is being challenged in court. Further, President Biden’s Executive Order on climate change calls for the federal government to reduce methane emissions from the oil and gas industry as quickly as possible. Any such legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost of consuming, and thereby reduce demand for, oil and natural gas produced by our exploration and production customers that, in turn, could reduce the demand for our services and thus adversely affect our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.

Under the National Environmental Policy Act, environmental assessments must be performed for certain projects, including construction of certain new pipelines. On July 16, 2020, the Council on Environmental Quality published a rule updating the regulations implementing the procedural provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act. This update rule sought to modernize and clarify environmental assessment requirements. This rule is being challenged in court and could be revisited by the new administration. It is uncertain the extent to which an environmental assessment must consider direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from a new project. This uncertainty can result in delay and increased costs in completing new projects. 
Endangered Species Act and Migratory Bird Treaty Act Considerations
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) and analogous state laws regulate activities that may affect endangered or threatened species, including their habitats. If protected species are located in areas where we propose to construct new gathering or transportation pipelines, processing or fractionation facilities, or other infrastructure, such work could be prohibited or delayed in certain of those locations or during certain times, when our operations could result in a taking of the species or destroy or adversely modify critical habitat that has been designated for the species. We also may be obligated to develop plans to avoid potential takings of protected species and provide mitigation to offset the effects of any unavoidable impacts, the implementation of which could materially increase our operating and capital costs. Existing laws, regulations, policies and guidance relating to protected species may also be revised or reinterpreted in a manner that further increases our construction and mitigation costs or restricts our construction activities. Additionally, construction and operational activities could result in inadvertent impact to a listed species and could result in alleged takings under the ESA, exposing MPLX to civil or criminal enforcement actions and fines or penalties. The existence of threatened or endangered species in areas where we conduct operations or plan to construct pipelines or facilities may cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in delays in, or prohibit, the construction of our facilities or limit our customer’s exploration and production activities, which could have an adverse impact on demand for our midstream operations.
The Migratory Bird Treaty Act implements various treaties and conventions between the United States and certain other nations for the protection of migratory birds. In accordance with this law, the taking, killing or possessing of migratory birds covered under this act is unlawful without authorization. If there is the potential to adversely affect migratory birds as a result of our operations or construction activities, we may be required to seek authorization to conduct those operations or construction activities, which may result in specified operating or construction restrictions on a temporary, seasonal, or permanent basis in affected areas and thus have an adverse impact on our ability to provide timely gathering, processing or fractionation services to our exploration and production customers.
Safety Matters
We are subject to oversight pursuant to the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended, as well as comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. We believe that we have conducted our operations in substantial compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record-keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.
We are also subject at regulated facilities to the OSHA’s Process Safety Management and EPA’s Risk Management Program requirements, which are intended to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals. The application of these regulations can result in increased compliance expenditures.
In general, we expect industry and regulatory safety standards to become stricter over time, resulting in increased compliance expenditures. While these expenditures cannot be accurately estimated at this time, we do not expect such expenditures will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.
The DOT has adopted safety regulations with respect to the design, construction, operation, maintenance, inspection and management of our pipeline assets. These regulations contain requirements for the development and implementation of pipeline integrity management programs, which include the inspection and testing of pipelines and the correction of anomalies. These regulations also require that pipeline 
Table of Contents

operation and maintenance personnel meet certain qualifications and that pipeline operators develop comprehensive spill response plans. These regulations are discussed more fully below.
PHMSA Regulation
We are subject to regulation by the DOT under the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, also known as the HLPSA. The HLPSA delegated to the DOT the authority to develop, prescribe and enforce minimum federal safety standards for the transportation of hazardous liquids by pipeline. Congress also enacted the Pipeline Safety Act of 1992, also known as the PSA, which added the environment to the list of statutory factors that must be considered in establishing safety standards for hazardous liquid pipelines, required regulations be issued to define the term “gathering line” and establish safety standards for certain “regulated gathering lines,” and mandated that regulations be issued to establish criteria for operators to use in identifying and inspecting pipelines located in High Consequence Areas (“HCAs”), defined as those areas that are unusually sensitive to environmental damage, that cross a navigable waterway, or that have a high population density. In 1996, Congress enacted the Accountable Pipeline Safety and Partnership Act, also known as the APSPA, which limited the operator identification requirement mandate to pipelines that cross a waterway where a substantial likelihood of commercial navigation exists, required that certain areas where a pipeline rupture would likely cause permanent or long-term environmental damage be considered in determining whether an area is unusually sensitive to environmental damage, and mandated that regulations be issued for the qualification and testing of certain pipeline personnel. In the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006, also known as the PIPES Act, Congress required mandatory inspections for certain U.S. crude oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in HCAs and mandated that regulations be issued for low-stress hazardous liquid pipelines and pipeline control room management. We are also subject to the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, which reauthorized funding for federal pipeline safety programs through 2015, increased penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of certain safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements for existing pipelines. Additionally, we are subject to the Protecting our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016, which required PHMSA to develop underground gas storage standards within two years and provided PHMSA with significant new authority to issue industry-wide emergency orders if an unsafe condition or practices results in an imminent hazard.
The DOT has delegated its authority under these statutes to the PHMSA, which administers compliance with these statutes and has promulgated comprehensive safety standards and regulations for the transportation of natural gas by pipeline (49 C.F.R. Part 192), as well as hazardous liquids by pipeline (49 C.F.R. Part 195), including regulations for the design and construction of new pipelines or those that have been relocated, replaced or otherwise changed (Subparts C and D of 49 C.F.R., Part 195); pressure testing of new pipelines (Subpart E of 49 C.F.R. Part 195); operation and maintenance of pipelines, including inspecting and reburying pipelines in the Gulf of Mexico and its inlets, establishing programs for public awareness and damage prevention, managing the integrity of pipelines in HCAs and managing the operation of pipeline control rooms (Subpart F of 49 C.F.R. Part 195); protecting steel pipelines from the adverse effects of internal and external corrosion (Subpart H of 49 C.F.R. Part 195); and integrity management requirements for pipelines in HCAs (49 C.F.R. 195.452). PHMSA has undertaken a number of initiatives to reevaluate its pipeline safety regulations. We do not anticipate that we would be impacted by these regulatory initiatives to any greater degree than other similarly situated competitors.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, PHMSA and one or more state regulators have, in isolated circumstances in the past, sought to expand the scope of their regulatory inspections to include certain in-plant equipment and pipelines found within NGL fractionation facilities and associated storage facilities in order to assess compliance with hazardous liquids pipeline safety requirements. If any of these actions were made broadly enforceable as part of a rule-making process or codified into law, they could result in additional capital costs, possible operational delays and increased costs of operation.
Product Quality Standards
Refined products and other hydrocarbon-based products that we transport are generally sold by us or our customers for consumption by the public. Various federal, state and local agencies have the authority to prescribe product quality specifications for products. The EPA established sulfur specifications for natural gasoline sold as certified ethanol denaturant effective January 1, 2017. The EPA has proposed product quality specifications for natural gasoline used for blendstock in ethanol flex fuel. The EPA has also 
Table of Contents

established product quality specifications related to blending gasoline with blendstocks and ethanol, which we perform at certain of our light products storage facilities. Changes in product quality specifications or blending requirements could reduce our throughput volumes, require us to incur additional handling costs or require capital expenditures. For example, different product specifications for different markets affect the fungibility of the products in our system and could require the construction of additional storage. In addition, changes in the product quality of the products we receive on our product pipelines could reduce or eliminate our ability to blend products.
Tribal Lands 
Various federal agencies, including the EPA and the Department of the Interior, along with certain Native American tribes, promulgate and enforce regulations pertaining to oil and gas operations on Native American tribal lands where we operate. These regulations include such matters as lease provisions, drilling and production requirements, and standards to protect environmental quality and cultural resources. In addition, each Native American tribe is a sovereign nation having the right to enforce certain laws and regulations and to grant approvals independent from federal, state and local statutes and regulations. These laws and regulations may increase our costs of doing business on Native American tribal lands and impact the viability of, or prevent or delay our ability to conduct, our operations on such lands.
HUMAN CAPITAL
We are managed and operated by the board of directors and executive officers of MPLX GP LLC (“MPLX GP”), our general partner. Our general partner has the sole responsibility for providing the employees and other personnel necessary to conduct our operations. All of the employees that conduct our business are directly employed by affiliates of our general partner. We believe that our general partner and its affiliates have a satisfactory relationship with those employees. 
MPC believes its employees are its greatest source of strength, and the culture reflects the quality of individuals across its workforce. Its collaborative efforts to foster an inclusive environment, provide broad-based development and mentorship opportunities, recognize and reward accomplishments, and offer benefits that support the well-being of its employees and their families contribute to increased engagement and fulfilling careers. Empowering people and prioritizing accountability also are key components for developing a high-performing culture, which is critical to achieving our strategic vision. 
Employee Profile
As of December 31, 2020, MPC had approximately 57,900 regular full-time and part-time roles. Excluding employees of Speedway, which is targeted to be sold in the first quarter of 2021, MPC employs approximately 18,600 people in full-time and part-time roles. Our general partner and its affiliates have approximately 5,700 full-time employees that provide services to us under our employee services agreements.
Talent Management 
Executing MPC’s strategic vision requires that it attracts and retains the best talent. Recruiting and retention success requires that it effectively nurtures new employees, providing opportunities for long-term engagement and career advancement. MPC also must appropriately reward high-performers and offer competitive benefits. MPC’s Talent Acquisition team consists of three segments: Executive Recruiting, Experienced Recruiting and University Recruiting. The specialization within each group allows those groups to specifically address MPC’s broad range of current and future talent needs, as well as devote time and attention to candidates during the hiring process. MPC values diverse perspectives in the workforce, and accordingly seeks candidates with a variety of backgrounds and experience. MPC’s primary source of full-time, entry-level new hires is its intern/co-op program. Through its university recruiters, MPC offers college students who have completed their freshman year the opportunity to participate in its hands-on programs focused in areas of finance and accounting, marketing, engineering and IT.
MPC provides a broad range of leadership training opportunities to support the development of leaders at all levels. Those programs, which are offered across the organization are a blended approach of business and leadership content, with many featuring external faculty. MPC utilizes various learning modalities, such as visual, audio, print, tactile, interactive, kinesthetic, experiential and leader-teaching-leader to 
Table of Contents

address and engage different learning styles. MPC believes networking and access to executives are key leadership success factors, and MPC incorporates these opportunities into all of its programs.
Compensation and Benefits
To ensure MPC is offering competitive pay packages in its recruitment and retention efforts, it annually benchmarks compensation, including base salaries, bonus levels and equity targets. MPC’s annual bonus program is a critical component of its compensation, as it provides individual rewards for achievement against preset financial and sustainability goals, encouraging a sense of employee ownership. Employees in officer-level pay grades, as well as senior leaders and most mid-level leaders, are eligible to receive long-term equity incentive awards as part of their compensation.
MPC offers comprehensive benefits, including medical, dental and vision insurance for employees, their spouses or domestic partners, and their dependents. MPC also provides retirement programs, life insurance, education assistance, family assistance, short-term disability and paid vacation and sick time. Following MPC’s acquisition of Andeavor, MPC enhanced several of its benefits programs. MPC increased the maximum accrual cap for vacation banks and doubled the number of college and trade school scholarships offered to the high school senior children of employees through the Marathon Petroleum Scholars Program. In addition, MPC increased its paid parental leave benefit to eight weeks for birth mothers and four weeks for nonbirth parents, including adoptive and foster parents. Both full-time and part-time employees are eligible for this benefit. Parents who both work for MPC or its affiliates are each eligible for a parental pay benefit.
Inclusion
MPC’s company-wide Diversity and Inclusion (“D&I”) program is managed by a dedicated D&I Office team and supported by leadership. The program is based on MPC’s three-pillar D&I strategy of building awareness, increasing representation and ensuring success. The strategy focuses on understanding the benefits of diverse perspectives, increasing diversity across the organization and recognizing that cultural inclusion is an ongoing process. MPC has employee networks focusing on six populations: Asian, Black, Hispanic, Veterans, Women and LGBTQ+. All networks encourage ally membership. This broad support extends also to leaders throughout MPC, with each employee network represented by two active executive sponsors. The sponsors form several counsels that meet regularly to share updates, gain alignment, build deeper connections across networks and pursue collaboration ideas. The employee networks not only provide opportunities for employees to make meaningful and supportive connections, but they also serve a significant role in MPC’s D&I strategy.
Safety 
MPC is committed to safe operations to protect the health and safety of its employees, contractors and communities. MPC’s commitment to safe operations is reflected in its safety systems design, its well-maintained equipment and by learning from its incidents. Part of MPC’s effort to promote safety includes a management system based on the principles of RC14001®, the Plan-Do-Check-Act continual improvement cycle, and its Operational Excellence Management System. Together, these components of MPC’s safety management system provide it with a comprehensive approach to managing risks and preventing incidents, illnesses and fatalities. Additionally, MPC’s annual cash bonus program metrics includes several employee, process and environmental safety metrics.
The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for MPC the importance of keeping its employees safe and healthy. In March 2020, MPC activated its Corporate Emergency Response Team to ensure a consistent and aggressive response across all facets of MPC and MPLX. The safety and health of employees, including essential personnel, were top priorities for MPC and MPLX. As part of MPC’s existing pandemic plan, MPC had a central inventory of N95 respirators, surgical masks, and nitrile gloves to supply to employees and contractors when the pandemic began. MPC implemented a number of protective measures to ensure employee and contractor safety as they continued to keep our critical operations running safely. MPC continues to monitor the situation and adapt its practices as appropriate.
