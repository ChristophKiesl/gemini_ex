ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
General
DICK’S Sporting Goods, Inc. (together with its subsidiaries, referred to as “the Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” unless specified otherwise) is a leading omni-channel sporting goods retailer offering an extensive assortment of authentic, high-quality sports equipment, apparel, footwear and accessories. As of January 30, 2021, we operated 728 DICK’S Sporting Goods locations across the United States, serving and inspiring our customers, whom we refer to as athletes, to achieve their personal best through interactions with our dedicated employees, whom we refer to as our teammates, in-store experiences and unique specialty shop-in-shops. We also own and operate Golf Galaxy and Field & Stream specialty stores, as well as GameChanger, a youth sports mobile app for video streaming, scorekeeping, scheduling and communications. In addition, we offer our products through an eCommerce platform that is integrated with our store network, providing our athletes with expertise as well as the convenience of a 24-hour storefront. 
We were founded and incorporated in 1948 in New York under the name Dick’s Clothing and Sporting Goods, Inc. when Richard “Dick” Stack, the father of Edward W. Stack, our Executive Chairman and Chief Merchandising Officer, opened his original bait and tackle store in Binghamton, New York. Edward W. Stack joined his father's business full-time in 1977 and in 1984 became President and Chief Executive Officer of the then two-store chain. In November 1997, we reincorporated as a Delaware corporation, and in April 1999 we changed our name to DICK’S Sporting Goods, Inc. Mr. Stack transitioned from the role of Chief Executive Officer to Executive Chairman and Chief Merchandising Officer effective February 1, 2021, at which time Lauren Hobart became our Chief Executive Officer, in addition to continuing to serve as our President.
Our executive office is located at 345 Court Street, Coraopolis, Pennsylvania 15108 and our phone number is (724) 273-3400. Our website is located at dicks.com. The information on our website does not constitute a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We include on our website, free of charge, copies of our Annual and Quarterly Reports on Forms 10-K and 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
When used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the context otherwise requires or unless otherwise specified, any reference to “year” is to the Company’s fiscal year.
Business Strategy 
Our Company is built on the belief that sports make people better. With this belief as our foundation, our common purpose is to create confidence and excitement by personally equipping all athletes to achieve their dreams. Driven by this common purpose and our commitment to all athletes, our mission is to: 
•Create an environment where passionate and skilled teammates thrive;
•Create and build leading brands that serve and inspire athletes;
•Make a lasting impact on communities through sport; and,
•Deliver shareholder value through growth and relentless improvement.
We believe that through our mission and the following key elements of our business strategy, we can continue to build one of the best omni-channel experiences in retail.
Reimagining the Athlete Experience 
We put our athletes at the center of everything we do, and we are committed to creating a differentiated shopping experience for them. We seek to proactively manage our in-stock merchandise positions and elevate our merchandise presentation to provide a clear point of view for in-demand items, such as our premium full-service footwear departments. We plan to add premium full-service footwear departments in over 100 stores in fiscal 2021, which will take this experience to over 60% of our DICK’S Sporting Goods stores upon completion. We offer a wide range of in-store support services and incorporate experiential elements and technology into our stores to better engage and serve our athletes, including our introduction of HitTrax® baseball simulators in nearly 200 stores and our currently planned investment in Trackman technology to enhance the fitting and lesson experience in our Golf Galaxy stores in 2021. We also plan to open our first experiential prototype store in 2021, which will focus on service and community and innovate and deliver elevated experiences to our athletes, serving as a test and learn center for our business.
We continue to improve our service and selling culture, and recently introduced new standards to better serve our athletes, which included providing robust training to increase our teammates’ product knowledge. We equip our teammates with current technology to improve their productivity and enhance the athlete experience, including providing real-time product information, detailed product descriptions, inventory availability and alternative product recommendations as well as other metrics and communications while on the sales floor. 
Our marketing program is focused on building loyalty to DICK’S Sporting Goods through brand-building campaigns and the expansion of our ScoreCard Rewards loyalty program, which has over 20 million active members that account for over 70% of total sales. In October 2019 we launched ScoreCard Gold, providing our top-tier athletes with more ways to earn ScoreCard points and member-only benefits, including early access to sales and product launches.
We leverage the robust data from our ScoreCard Rewards loyalty program to enhance the athlete experience by engaging our athletes through digital marketing and providing them with personalized offers and communications. We also use data science to improve the speed at which we deliver products to our athletes through optimized order routing and to enhance our in-stock and merchandise availability positions. 
Optimizing Our Assortment to Meet the Needs of All Athletes
We carry a full range of products within each category, including premium items for the sports enthusiast. We believe that the breadth of our product selections in each category of sporting goods offers our athletes a wide range of good, better and best price points and enables us to address the needs of our athletes, from the beginner to the sports enthusiast, which distinguishes us from other large format sporting goods stores. We focus on those growth categories in which we believe an opportunity to gain market share exists. We support these categories with greater quantities of enthusiast product and improved presentation and in-stock positions, which included the apparel, fitness, footwear, golf and baseball categories in 2020 and will include the soccer category in 2021.
We deliver a differentiated multi-brand experience to our athletes through our offering of national and vertical brands.
 National brands
Our key partners invest in our stores to showcase their brands. We carry a wide variety of well-known brands, including adidas, Asics, Brooks, Callaway Golf, Columbia, Easton, Nike, Patagonia, TaylorMade, The North Face, Titleist, Under Armour and Yeti. We seek to leverage our partnerships to offer authenticity and credibility to our athletes, while differentiating ourselves from our competitors. Our brand partnerships also provide us with access to exclusive products and allow us to differentiate our athletes’ shopping experience through initiatives such as our brand shops, which provide our athletes with a wider and deeper selection of products from key brands.
Vertical brands
We also offer our athletes a wide variety of products that are not available from other retailers. Our vertical brands include brands that we own and are available exclusively in our stores such as Alpine Design, CALIA, DSG, ETHOS, Field & Stream, Fitness Gear, Lady Hagen, MAXFLI, Nishiki, Quest, Tommy Armour, Top-Flite, VRST and Walter Hagen, as well as brands that we license from third parties including adidas (baseball and football), Slazenger (golf) and Prince (tennis). These brands offer high-quality, on-trend products with compelling technical and performance attributes to our athletes while providing differentiation in our merchandise assortment at higher gross margins as compared to sales of similar products from national brands. We consider our vertical brand strategy to be a key area of opportunity to increase productivity in our stores and online, and we have invested in a research, development and procurement staff to support its growth. Collectively, our vertical brands comprise our second largest brand category in terms of sales, representing approximately 15% and 14%, respectively, of our consolidated net sales during fiscal 2020 and 2019. Looking forward, we intend to provide our vertical brands with improved space in-store, increased marketing and expansion into additional product categories. Additionally, we plan to augment our men’s apparel selection by launching VRST, our new premium and versatile brand that serves the modern athletic male. 
Our Improving Omni-channel Platform and Fulfillment Capabilities 
We believe that when our athletes connect with the DICK’S Sporting Goods brand, they expect a seamless shopping experience, regardless of the manner in which they choose to shop with us. Like our athletes, we view retail as an omni-channel experience, where the distinctions between stores and online are becoming increasingly seamless.
Our stores remain at the core of our omni-channel platform. We believe our store base gives us a competitive advantage over our online-only competitors, as our physical presence allows us to better serve our athletes by creating strong engagement through interactive in-store elements, offering the convenience of accepting in-store returns or exchanges and expediting fulfillment of eCommerce orders, the ability to place online orders in our stores if we are out of stock in the retail store, buy-online, pick-up in store capabilities, and giving direct, live access to well-trained and knowledgeable teammates. In addition, we implemented curbside pickup and returns in fiscal 2020 as additional alternatives for our athletes in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In fiscal 2020, approximately 70% of online sales were fulfilled directly by our stores, which serve as localized points of distribution, and they enabled 90% of our fiscal 2020 sales through online fulfillment and in-person sales. 
We continually improve the functionality and performance of our eCommerce site, which has included building a faster and more convenient checkout process, greater visibility and accuracy of delivery dates, improved page responsiveness, enhancing integration of our ScoreCard loyalty program, new content development through our Pro Tips platform and localized website experiences. Other recent improvements we’ve made to our eCommerce business included curbside pickup capabilities, the opening of additional fulfillment centers in New York and California, which along with our delivery partnership with FedEx, helped reduce our estimated delivery date by over 10% in fiscal 2020. 
Merchandising
The following table sets forth the approximate percentage of our sales attributable to the following categories for the fiscal years presented:

 | Fiscal Year
Category | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Hardlines (1) | 46 | % | | 42 | % | 43 | %
Apparel | 33 | % | | 35 | % | 35 | %
Footwear | 19 | % | | 21 | % | 20 | %
Other (2) | 2 | % | | 2 | % | 2 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %


(1)Includes items such as sporting goods equipment, fitness equipment, golf equipment and hunting and fishing gear.
(2)Includes our non-merchandise sales categories, including in-store services, shipping revenues, software subscription revenues and credit card processing revenues.
Additional information about our sales categories is included within Part IV. Item 15. Exhibits and Financial Statement Schedules, Note 1–Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Selling Channels
We offer products to our athletes through our retail stores and online, and although we sell through both of these channels, we believe that sales in one channel are not independent of the other. Regardless of the sales channel, we seek to provide our athletes with a seamless omni-channel shopping experience.
Retail Stores:
Our DICK’S Sporting Goods, Golf Galaxy and other specialty concept stores are designed to create an exciting and interactive shopping environment for the sporting enthusiast that highlights our extensive product assortments and value-added services. Each of our DICK’S Sporting Goods stores unites several sports specialty stores under one roof and typically contains the following specialty shops: Team Sports, Athletic Apparel, Golf, Fitness and Footwear. We believe our “store-within-a-store” concept creates a unique shopping environment by combining the convenience, broad assortment and competitive prices of large format stores with the brand names, differentiated product selection and customer service of a specialty store. We monitor and evaluate store performance on an ongoing basis and reallocate space in our stores to categories and products that we believe can drive sales growth. For example, we have undergone a project over the last couple of years to remove the hunt department from many of our stores and reallocate the space in these stores to a localized product or category assortment in an effort to drive growth. When the project is completed during fiscal 2021, the hunt department will remain in approximately 100 DICK’S Sporting Goods and Field & Stream stores.
We seek to expand our presence through the opening of new stores and believe that growing our store network and eCommerce business simultaneously will enable us to profitably grow the business by delivering an omni-channel shopping experience for our athletes. Approximately two-thirds of our DICK’S Sporting Goods stores will be up for lease renewal at our option over the next five years, which provides us with the opportunity to relocate, close, or renegotiate lease terms for these stores. We plan to opportunistically open new stores in under-served and under-penetrated markets and leverage the significant flexibility within our existing real estate portfolio to capitalize on future real estate opportunities over the near and intermediate terms as these leases come up for renewal. We anticipate that we will open approximately six new DICK’S Sporting Goods stores and relocate 11 more in fiscal 2021. We also plan to open two new Golf Galaxy stores and convert two former Field & Stream stores into Public Lands stores, a new outdoor concept we recently announced. In addition, we operate outlet stores that offer our athletes apparel and footwear at discounted prices. Excluding temporary locations, we operated six stores as of January 30, 2021 and plan to open another four new outlet stores in fiscal 2021. 
eCommerce: 
Through our websites, we seek to provide our athletes with in-depth product information and the ability to shop with us at any time. As the lines between in-store and online become increasingly seamless, we continue to innovate our eCommerce sites and applications with customer experience enhancements, new releases of our mobile and tablet apps, and the development of omni-channel capabilities that further integrate our online presence with our brick and mortar stores to provide our athletes with an omni-channel shopping experience. Currently, we have return-to-store capabilities for online orders, the ability to place online orders in our stores if we are out of stock in the retail store, buy-online, pick-up in store or curbside pickup capabilities. Our websites also give us the ability to ship online orders from our retail locations, which reduces delivery times for online orders and improves inventory productivity and availability. In fiscal 2020 and 2019, eCommerce accounted for approximately 30% and 16%, respectively, of our total net sales. In addition, we experienced significant growth in our curbside and buy-online, pick-up in store businesses in fiscal 2020, which more than tripled when compared to fiscal 2019. 
Purchasing, Distribution and Customer Fulfillment
During fiscal 2020, we purchased merchandise from approximately 1,300 vendors, with Nike, our largest vendor, representing approximately 19% of our merchandise purchases. No other vendor represented 10% or more of our fiscal 2020 merchandise purchases. We do not have long-term purchase contracts with any of our vendors; all of our purchases from vendors are made on a short-term purchase order basis. 
We currently operate five regional distribution centers which enable us to supply stores with merchandise. Vendors ship floor-ready merchandise to our distribution centers, where it is processed and allocated directly to our stores or stored temporarily. Our distribution centers are responsible for consolidating damaged or defective merchandise from our stores that is being returned to vendors. We have contracted with common carriers to deliver merchandise from all of our distribution centers to our stores, which generally facilitates prompt and efficient distribution to our stores to enhance in-stocks, minimize freight costs and improve inventory turnover. During fiscal 2020, our stores received over 90% of their merchandise through our distribution network; the remaining merchandise was shipped directly to our stores from our vendors.
We leverage our store and distribution center network, three eCommerce fulfillment centers (one owned and two operated by a third-party) and direct shipping capabilities from our vendors to ensure merchandise delivery speed to our athletes and to minimize shipping costs. 
Competition
The competition among retailers that sell sporting goods is highly fragmented and intensely competitive. We compete with many retailing formats, including large format sporting goods stores, traditional sporting goods stores, specialty and vendor stores, mass merchants and department stores, internet and catalog-based retailers, and vendors selling directly to consumers. We seek to attract athletes by offering a wide range of products that enables us to address the needs of all athletes, from beginner to enthusiast, and by utilizing distinctive merchandise presentation in stores to create a unique shopping environment. We also offer superior service both in-store and via a seamless omni-channel experience which includes buy-online, pick-up in store and curbside pickup. 
Seasonality
Our business is subject to seasonal influences, including the success of holiday selling season and the impact of unseasonable weather conditions. Although our highest sales and operating income results have historically occurred in the second and fourth fiscal quarters, our business has increasingly been less affected by seasonal fluctuations in recent years. However, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the fiscal year.
Proprietary Rights
We have a number of service marks and trademarks registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, including various versions of the following: “Alpine Design”, “CALIA”, “DICK’S”, “DICK’S Sporting Goods”, “DSG”, “ETHOS”, “Field & Stream”, “Fitness Gear”, “Golf Galaxy”, “Golfsmith”, “Lady Hagen”, “MAXFLI”, “Nishiki”, “Primed”, “Public Lands”, “Quest”, “ScoreCard”, “ScoreCard Rewards”, “Tommy Armour”, “Top-Flite”, “VRST” and “Walter Hagen”. We also have a number of registered domain names, including “dickssportinggoods.com”, “dicks.com”, “golfgalaxy.com”, “fieldandstreamshop.com”, “calia.com”, “vrst.com”, and “gamechanger.com”. Our service marks, trademarks and other intellectual property are subject to risks and uncertainties that are discussed within Item 1A. “Risk Factors”. 
We have also entered into licensing agreements for names that we do not own, which provide for exclusive and non-exclusive rights to use names such as “adidas” (baseball and football), “Prince” (tennis), and “Slazenger” (golf) for specified product categories or certain products and, in some cases, specified sales channels. These licenses are long-term business relationships and contain customary termination provisions at the option of the licensor including, in some cases, termination upon our failure to purchase or sell a minimum volume of products and may include early termination fees. Our licenses are also subject to general risks and uncertainties common to licensing arrangements that are described within Item 1A. “Risk Factors”. 
Governmental Regulations
We must comply with various federal, state and local regulations, including regulations relating to consumer products and consumer protection, advertising and marketing, labor and employment, data protection and privacy, intellectual property, the environment and tax. In addition, in connection with the sale of firearms in our stores, we must comply with a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, related to the sale of firearms and ammunition. Ensuring our compliance with these various laws and regulations, and keeping abreast of changes to the legal and regulatory landscape present in our industry, may cause us to expend considerable resources. 
Social Responsibility 
We are committed to supporting our teammates professionally and personally, readying our athletes to achieve their personal bests, and saving and rebuilding youth sports in local communities. We sponsor thousands of teams in various sports and support the philanthropic efforts of our private corporate foundation, The DICK’S Sporting Goods Foundation. In partnership with The DICK’S Sporting Goods Foundation, we launched our Sports Matter initiative, a philanthropic effort singularly focused on supporting youth sports in 2014. Through Sports Matter, we remain committed to raising awareness of the importance of playing sports, while also providing financial support to keep our kids playing the sports they love. Since the establishment of the Sports Matter initiative, the Company and The DICK’S Sporting Goods Foundation have committed over $100 million to keep kids playing sports, helping to save thousands of youth sports teams and giving more than one million young athletes across all 50 states the chance to play. In addition, we donated $30 million to The DICK’S Sporting Goods Foundation in fiscal 2020 to help jump-start youth sports programs struggling to come back from the COVID-19 pandemic.
Human Capital Management
As of January 30, 2021, we employed approximately 16,800 full-time and 33,300 part-time teammates. Due to the seasonal nature of our business, total employment figures fluctuate throughout the year and typically peak during the fourth quarter. None of our teammates are covered by a collective bargaining agreement.
As stated in our mission, we strive to create an environment where passionate and skilled teammates thrive. We believe our teammates’ dedication to creating a positive experience for our athletes is what drives our success as a company, and we’re committed to creating a great place to work for our teammates through competitive wages and benefits, promoting teammate safety, health and well-being, providing learning and career development opportunities and promoting inclusion and diversity.
Wages and Benefits
In addition to offering our teammates competitive salaries and wages, we offer comprehensive health and retirement benefits to those eligible, which include all full-time hourly and salaried teammates. We are committed to equal pay for equal work independent of gender and race when establishing and maintaining wages. We achieved a 100% female-to-male unadjusted median pay ratio in fiscal 2020, which we intend to maintain going forward. From an average pay perspective, female pay was at 94% of males across our 50,100 teammates.
Safety, Health and Well-Being
Our most important commitment to our teammates is ensuring their safety, health and well-being. We have robust policies, procedures and training in place to ensure a safe environment across our organization, including a comprehensive crisis management plan that allows us to respond immediately to critical incidents involving people, company assets, our business or our reputation. We provide support to our teammates to enable them to maintain and improve their professional and personal lives, which includes an employee assistance plan, an onsite health club and new childcare facility, which will be completed in fiscal 2021, at our corporate headquarters, which we refer to as our Customer Support Center (“CSC”). We also provide opportunities for volunteerism through our DICK’S Day of Giving program. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented additional safety and cleaning protocols at our stores, distribution centers and CSC, in addition to providing a 15% pay premium to our store and distribution center teammates through the end of fiscal 2020. We also created a monthly at-home resource called DSG Cares, which includes online trainings, strategies for working remotely and balancing work and childcare, as well as other mental and emotional health resources. As a result of these and other actions we took to prioritize the health and well-being of our teammates and athletes, we incurred pre-tax teammate compensation and safety costs of approximately $175 million in fiscal 2020.
Training and Development 
We empower our teammates to develop their careers and provide tools that are necessary for them to reach their personal and professional goals. We offer various live and recorded training programs across the organization based on job role and function that include safety, compliance, leadership or other skills, onboarding to our store managers and have created rotational development programs in various functional disciplines. We also provide tuition reimbursement programs for all eligible teammates to pursue a job-related degree at an accredited college or university, and in partnership with a local university, we offer a part-time MBA program at our CSC. 
Inclusion and Diversity
We are committed to creating a workplace environment and culture that supports, celebrates and honors each individual and to promoting inclusion and diversity for all teammates. Doing so strengthens our ability to serve all of our athletes, drives innovation and growth, and enables us to attract and retain the best talent. In 2019, we created the DICK’S Sporting Goods Inclusion and Diversity Council, which is comprised of a group of teammates from across our organization who represent diverse backgrounds, roles, experiences and communities, to help steer and support our inclusion and diversity efforts. Teammates with shared interests have come together in various resource groups to discuss shared issues, increase awareness and communicate with senior management. We use the feedback provided by our Inclusion and Diversity Council, various resource groups, and engagement and other surveys provided to our teammates to foster an inclusive workplace. 
We have committed to increasing diversity at all levels of our organization, which has included increasing representation of people of color and women on our Board of Directors in fiscal 2020.
