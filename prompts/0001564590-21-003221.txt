Item 1.  Business
General
 Malvern Bancorp, Inc. (the “Company” or “Malvern Bancorp”), a Pennsylvania corporation, is a bank holding company registered under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended (the “Holding Company Act”).  Malvern Bancorp is the holding company for Malvern Bank, National Association (“Malvern Bank” or the “Bank”), a national bank that was originally organized in 1887 as a federally-chartered savings bank.
 The Company’s primary business is the ownership and operation of the Bank.  The Bank’s principal business consists of attracting deposits from businesses and the general public and investing those deposits, together with borrowings and funds generated from operations, in commercial and multi-family real estate loans, one- to four-family residential real estate loans, construction and development loans, commercial business loans, home equity loans and lines of credit and other consumer loans. We also invest in and maintain a portfolio of investment securities, primarily comprised of corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, U.S. agency and bank qualified municipal obligations. Malvern Bank is one of the oldest banks headquartered on the Philadelphia Main Line.  For more than a century, the Bank has been committed to helping people build prosperous communities as a trusted financial partner, forging lasting relationships through teamwork, respect and integrity. The Bank’s primary market niche is providing personalized service to its client base.
 We derive substantially all of our income from our net interest income (i.e., the difference between the interest we receive on our loans and securities and the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings). The Bank’s revenues are derived principally from interest on loans and investment securities, loan commitment and customer service fees and our mortgage banking operation. We also generate non-interest revenue through insufficient funds fees, stop payment fees, safe deposit rental fees, card income, including credit and debit card interchange fees, gift card fees, borrowings (including from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh), and other miscellaneous fees. In addition, the Bank generates non-interest revenue associated with residential loan origination and sale, back to back customer swaps, loan servicing, late fees and merchant services.

 Our primary sources of funds are deposits, borrowings and principal and interest payments on loans and securities, as well as the sale of residential loans in the secondary market.  The Bank’s primary expenses are interest expense on deposits and borrowings, provisions for loan losses and general operating expenses. 
 The Bank conducts business from its headquarters in Paoli, Pennsylvania, a suburb of Philadelphia, and through its nine other banking locations in Chester and Delaware counties, Pennsylvania, Morristown, New Jersey, its New Jersey regional headquarters and Palm Beach, Florida. The Bank also maintains representative offices in Wellington, Florida and Allentown, Pennsylvania.  
 The Bank has the following subsidiary interests:
  
• | The Bank owns 100 percent of Malvern Insurance Associates, LLC (“Malvern Insurance”), a Pennsylvania limited liability company. Malvern Insurance is a licensed insurance broker under Pennsylvania and New Jersey law. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Certain mortgage-backed securities of the Bank are held through Delaware statutory trusts, 5 percent of which are owned by the Bank and 95 percent of which are owned by Coastal Asset Management Co., a Delaware corporation which is wholly owned by the Bank.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Business Strategy
 Our strategy is to compete for business by providing high quality, personal service to customers, enhanced local presence and customer access to our decision-makers, rapid decision-making, and competitive interest rates and fees. We develop business relationships by increasing our profile in our communities through the involvement of our management team and Board of Directors. We believe we will continue to drive growth and increase profitability, while maintaining our high levels of asset quality, by doing the following: 
Expand Relationships in Our Communities
      We emphasize household relationship banking by maintaining and growing our customers and contacts with personal interaction by our Board and management team in the communities that we serve.  We will continue to do so by offering a full suite of competitive banking products through efficient and varied delivery channels tailored to the needs and successes of our customers and potential customers.

Measured Loan Portfolio Growth while Aiding Borrowers Impacted by COVID-19
 Our loan growth strategy is to originate high quality loans with strong sponsors on the commercial side and favorable credit metrics on the retail side in order to achieve measured growth and a balance of commercial and residential loans.
 We think it is critical to have as a strategic initiative a plan to work with our customers, in the short and medium terms, in navigating the impact of COVID-19 on both a personal and business level. As part of this plan, we are focused on the inevitable changing needs and preferences of such customers in a post-COVID-19 environment, including but not limited to the offering and delivery of products and services.  We plan to use the resources at our disposal, including loan modifications and payment deferrals, to proactively aid such borrowers in remaining current on their loan payments.
 As of September 30, 2020, the Company had 43 COVID-19 loan modification agreements with respect to $147.9 million representing 14.2 percent of loans outstanding.  The COVID-19 loan modifications do not classify as TDRs as they fall under the CARES Act Section 4013, and further details regarding these modifications are provided in the table on page 28.  At January 15, 2020, the Company had 15 COVID-19-related modified loan deferrals totaling $71.3 million or 7.1% of total loans. Of the remaining $71.3 million deferrals, approximately $37.3 million or 52.3% of the deferrals are paying the contractual interest payments.  For loans subject to the program, each borrower is required to resume making regularly scheduled loan payments at the end of the modification period and the deferred amounts will be moved to the end of the loan term. Management anticipates this activity will continue beyond fiscal year 2020.
 Core Deposit Growth 
 We plan to continue to focus on growing and diversifying our core, retail, non-maturity deposit base with an emphasis on household relationship banking.  Our business model includes using industry best practices for community banks, including personalized service, technology and extended hours.  We believe that these generate deposit accounts with larger average balances than might be attracted otherwise.  From time to time we also use pricing techniques in our efforts to attract banking relationships having larger than average balances.  During fiscal 2020 we successfully shifted our funding mix away from brokered, wholesale funding and time deposits and will work to continue this trend  in fiscal 2021 and thereafter. 
Leverage Our Residential Mortgage Banking Infrastructure
 We leverage our mortgage banking infrastructure to support the origination of residential mortgage loans for sale into the secondary market. Mortgage loan originations and sales activity are strategies utilized to support growth in our non-interest income, while also serving to help manage the Company’s exposure to interest rate risk through the sale of longer-duration, fixed-rate loans into the secondary market. 
Improve Our Operating Efficiency 
 Expense discipline is a key strategy to improve operating efficiency and contribute to earnings growth.  We also strive to operate more efficiently by incorporating technology into our client offerings.
Maintain Robust Capital and Liquidity Levels 
 The Company’s capital position provides a source of strength and continues to significantly exceed all regulatory capital guidelines, as demonstrated by the September 30, 2020 Tier 1 Leverage ratios of the Company and the Bank of 11.87 percent and 13.03 percent, respectively. We plan to continue to maintain robust capital reserves, in part due to the risks and uncertainties associated with the COVID-19 pandemic. 
 In addition to our robust capital levels, we maintain significant sources of both on- and off-balance sheet liquidity and plan to continue to do so.  At September 30, 2020, our liquid assets included $61.4 million of short-term cash and equivalents supplemented by $31.5 million of investment securities classified as available for sale which can be readily sold or pledged as collateral, if necessary. In addition, we had the capacity to borrow additional funds totaling $128.0 million via unsecured lines of credit and $364.9 million, without pledging additional collateral, from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh.

Ensure the Adequacy of Our Allowance for Credit Losses
 The economic implications of the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impact on our asset quality remain unclear at this time. Notwithstanding this uncertainty reserve levels remained adequate with total allowance amounting to $11.6 million at September 30, 2020. 
Market Area and Competition
 At September 30, 2020, our primary market area consisted of the counties in which we currently operate branches, private banking offices and representative offices, including Chester, Delaware and Lehigh counties in Pennsylvania, Morris County New Jersey and Palm Beach County Florida.  Our lending is concentrated in these markets and our predominant sources of deposits are the communities in which our offices are located as well as the neighboring communities.  
 The banking business is highly competitive. We face substantial competition both in attracting deposits and in originating loans. We compete with numerous commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations. Other competitors include money market mutual funds, mortgage bankers, insurance companies, stock brokerage firms, unregulated small loan companies, credit unions and issuers of commercial paper and other securities. Many of our competitors have greater assets, capital, lending limits, and financial resources to, among other things, invest in technology and finance wide-ranging advertising campaigns.
 Products and Services 
 We offer a broad range of deposit and loan products and other banking services. These include personal and business checking accounts, retirement accounts, money market accounts, time and savings accounts, safe deposit boxes, credit cards, wire transfers, access to automated teller services, internet banking, ACH origination, telephone banking, and mobile banking. The Bank also offers remote deposit capture banking for both retail and business customers, providing the ability to electronically scan and transmit checks for deposit. 
 Time deposits consist of certificates of deposit, including those held in IRA accounts. Reciprocal deposits are offered through the Bank’s participation in Promontory Interfinancial Network, LLC (the “Network”) and Impact Deposit Corp. Customers who are Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”) insurance sensitive are able to place large dollar deposits with the Bank and the Bank uses either outlet to place those funds into certificates of deposit or money markets issued by other banks in the Network. This occurs in increments of less than the FDIC insurance limits so that both the principal and interest are eligible for complete FDIC insurance coverage. The FDIC currently considers these funds as brokered deposits.
 We offer personal and commercial business loans on a secured and unsecured basis, revolving lines of credit, commercial mortgage loans, and residential mortgages on both primary and secondary residences, home equity loans, bridge loans and other personal purpose loans. However, we are not and have not historically been a participant in the sub-prime lending market.
 Commercial loans are loans made for business purposes and are primarily secured by collateral such as cash balances with the Bank, marketable securities held by or under the control of the Bank, business assets including accounts receivable, inventory and equipment, and liens on commercial and residential real estate.
 Commercial construction loans are loans to finance the construction of commercial or residential properties secured by first liens on such properties. Commercial real estate loans include loans secured by first liens on completed commercial properties, including multi-family properties, to purchase or refinance such properties. Residential mortgages include loans secured by first liens on residential real estate to purchase or refinance primary and secondary residences. Home equity loans and lines of credit include loans secured by first or second liens on residential real estate for primary or secondary residences.
 Consumer loans are made to individuals who qualify for auto loans, cash reserve, credit cards and installment loans.  Our consumer loan portfolio includes unsecured overdraft lines of credit and personal loans as well as loans secured by savings accounts and certificates of deposit on deposit with the Bank.
 Our portfolio lending activities include the origination of one- to four-family first mortgage loans, primarily in our designated market area. The fixed-rate residential mortgage loans that we originate for portfolio generally meet the secondary mortgage market standards. As a complement to our residential one- to four-family portfolio lending activities, we operate a mortgage banking platform which supports the origination of one- to four-family mortgage

loans for sale into the secondary market.  The loans we originate for sale generally meet the secondary mortgage market standards.  Such loans are generally originated by and sourced from the same resources and markets as those loans originated and held in our portfolio.
 Through our Private Banking division and our affiliation with Bell Rock, an SEC Registered Investment Advisor, we offer investment advisory services to individuals, families, businesses and non-profits with personalized investment management, 401(k) advisory services for employers, financial planning, trust services, and tailored lending.
 We offer a broad range of risk and insurance solutions including life and health insurance, long term care, automobile, homeowners and liability insurance through Malvern Insurance.
 
Human Capital Resources
 
At September 30, 2020, we employed a total of 82 full-time equivalent employees spanning across 4 states and 9 offices.  It is through our employees, and their ties to the local community, that we are able to dutifully support the communities we serve.  Working within, and giving back to, the local community is the hallmark of a true community bank, and we believe that the strength and commitment of our workforce to our communities is what sets us apart from other community banks.
 
We have long been committed to comprehensive and competitive compensation and benefits programs as we recognize that we operate in intensely competitive environments for talent.  Retention of skilled and highly trained employees is critical to our strategy of being a trusted resource to our communities and strengthening relationships with our clients through our employees.  Furthering our philosophy to attract and retain a pool of talented and motivated employees who will continue to advance our purpose and contribute to our overall success, our compensation and benefits programs include: an Employees’ Savings & Profit Sharing Plan, with matching contributions, for all employees; a performance-based Executive Achievement Incentive Compensation Plan for executives; a Loan Incentive Plan for our lending officers; and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan for all employees.  Our Employee Stock Ownership Plan fosters a tangible sense of ownership for our entire workforce and does not require a monetary contribution by employees.
 
We invest in our employees’ future by sponsoring and prioritizing continued education throughout the Company’s employee ranks.  Three employees every year are enrolled into the American Bankers Association, Stonier School of Banking.  All of our employees are able to participate in regular educational seminars run by outside parties, including but not limited to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the American Bankers Association.
 
In order to develop a workforce that aligns with our corporate values, we regularly sponsor local community events so that our employees can better integrate themselves in our communities.  We believe that our employees’ well-being and personal and professional development is fostered by our outreach to the communities we serve.  Our employees’ desire for active community involvement enables us to sponsor a number of local community events and initiatives, including quarterly food drives with local food banks in each of our markets, an annual back-to-school supply drive, an annual book drive that supports the Children’s Scholarship Fund Philadelphia and Great Philly Schools school fair, new home buyer seminars, and financial awareness and cyber threat awareness seminars for local senior citizens.
 
We strive to place the health and well-being of our employees above all else.  Never has this been more necessary than during the COVID-19 pandemic.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken significant steps to protect the health and well-being of our employees and clients, including implementing a work-from-home policy for over 60% of employees, limiting lobby hours throughout our branch offices, and prioritizing drive-thru and appointment banking.  
 Supervision and Regulation 
 The banking industry is highly regulated. Earnings of the Company are affected by state and federal laws and regulations and by policies of various regulatory authorities. Changes in applicable law or in the policies of various regulatory authorities could affect materially the business and prospects of the Company and the Bank. The following discussion of supervision and regulation is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutory and regulatory provisions discussed.

Regulation of Malvern Bancorp, Inc. 
 Malvern Bancorp is a bank holding company within the meaning of the Holding Company Act.  As a bank holding company, Malvern Bancorp is supervised by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (the “FRB”) and is required to file reports with the FRB and provide such additional information as the FRB may require.
 The Holding Company Act prohibits Malvern Bancorp, with certain exceptions, from acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than five percent of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank and from engaging in any business other than that of banking, managing and controlling banks or furnishing services to subsidiary banks, except that it may, upon application, engage in, and may own shares of companies engaged in, certain businesses found by the FRB to be so closely related to banking “as to be a proper incident thereto.”  The Holding Company Act requires prior approval by the FRB of the acquisition by Malvern Bancorp of more than five percent of the voting stock of any other bank.  Satisfactory capital ratios, Community Reinvestment Act ratings, and anti-money laundering policies are generally prerequisites to obtaining federal regulatory approval to make acquisitions.  The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“the Dodd-Frank Act”) requires a bank holding company where so directed by the FRB to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary bank and to commit resources to support its subsidiary bank in circumstances in which it might not be otherwise inclined to do so. Acquisitions by Malvern Bank require approval of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”). 
 The Holding Company Act does not place territorial restrictions on the activities of non-bank subsidiaries of bank holding companies.  
 The Riegle-Neal Interstate Banking and Branching Efficiency Act of 1994 enables bank holding companies to acquire banks in states other than the bank holding company’s home state and to open branches of such banks in other states, subject to certain restrictions. The Dodd-Frank Act, discussed below, authorized interstate de novo branching regardless of state law.
 Regulation of Malvern Bank
 As a national bank, Malvern Bank is subject to the supervision of, and to regular examination by the OCC.  Various laws and the regulations applicable to Malvern Bancorp and Malvern Bank impose restrictions and requirements in many areas, including capital requirements, the maintenance of reserves, establishment of new offices, the making of loans and investments, consumer protection, employment practices, bank acquisitions and entry into new types of business. There are various legal limitations, including Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act, that govern the extent to which a bank subsidiary may finance or otherwise supply funds to or engage in certain other types of transactions with its holding company or its holding company’s non-bank subsidiaries. Under federal law, no bank subsidiary may, subject to certain limited exceptions, make loans or extensions of credit to, or investments in the securities of, its parent or the non-bank subsidiaries of its parent (other than direct subsidiaries of such bank which are not financial subsidiaries) or take their securities as collateral for loans to any borrower. Each bank subsidiary is also subject to collateral security requirements for any loans or extensions of credit permitted by such exceptions.
Capital Requirements
 Pursuant to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act of 1991 (“FDICIA”), each federal banking agency has promulgated regulations specifying the levels at which a financial institution would be considered “well capitalized,” “adequately capitalized,” “undercapitalized,” “significantly undercapitalized,” or “critically undercapitalized,” and authorizing certain mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions based on the capital level of the institution. 
 In July 2013, the FRB and the OCC published final rules establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U.S. banking organizations, referred to as the Basel III rules.  Basel III (i) introduced a new capital measure called “Common Equity Tier 1,” or CET1, (ii) specified that Tier 1 capital consists of CET1 and “Additional Tier 1 capital” instruments meeting specified requirements, (iii) applied most deductions/adjustments to regulatory capital measures to CET1 and not to the other components of capital, thus potentially requiring higher levels of CET1 in order to meet minimum ratios, and (iv) expanded the scope of the reductions/adjustments from capital as compared to existing regulations. 
 -9-


Under Basel III, the minimum capital ratios for Malvern Bancorp and Malvern Bank are as follows: 
  
• | 4.5 percent CET1 to risk-weighted assets
--+-----------------------------------------


• | 6.0 percent Tier 1 capital (i.e., CET1 plus Additional Tier 1) to risk-weighted assets
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 8.0 percent Total capital (i.e., Tier 1 plus Tier 2) to risk-weighted assets
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 4.0 percent Tier 1 capital to average consolidated assets as reported on consolidated financial statements (known as the “leverage ratio”).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Basel III also requires Malvern Bancorp and Malvern Bank to maintain a 2.5 percent “capital conservation buffer”, composed entirely of CET1, on top of the minimum risk-weighted asset ratios, effectively resulting in minimum ratios of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets of at least 7.0 percent, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 8.5 percent, and (iii) total capital to risk-weighted assets of at least 10.5 percent.  The capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress.  Banking institutions with a ratio of (i) CET1 to risk-weighted assets, (ii) Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets or (iii) total capital to risk-weighted assets above the respective minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends, equity repurchases and discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on the amount of the shortfall. The implementation of the capital conservation buffer began to be phased in on January 1, 2016 at the 0.625 percent level and increased by 0.625 percent on each subsequent January 1st, until it became fully implemented at 2.5 percent on January 1, 2019.  
 Basel III provides for a number of deductions from and adjustments to CET1. These include, for example, the requirement that mortgage servicing rights, deferred tax assets (“DTAs”) dependent upon future taxable income and significant investments in common equity issued by nonconsolidated financial entities be deducted from CET1 to the extent that any one such category exceeds 10 percent of CET1 or all such categories in the aggregate exceed 15 percent of CET1.  The deductions and other adjustments to CET1 were being phased in incrementally between January 1, 2015 and January 1, 2018.  However, in November 2017, banking regulators announced that the phase in of certain of these adjustments for non-advanced approaches banking organizations, such as Malvern Bank, was frozen.
 Under current capital standards, the effects of accumulated other comprehensive income items included in capital are excluded for the purposes of determining regulatory capital ratios.  Under Basel III, the effects of certain accumulated other comprehensive items are not excluded; however, non-advanced approaches banking organizations, including Malvern Bancorp and Malvern Bank, were permitted to make a one-time permanent election to continue to exclude these items effective as of January 1, 2015. We made this one-time election in the applicable bank regulatory reports as of March 31, 2015.
 With respect to Malvern Bank, Basel III also revised the “prompt corrective action” regulations pursuant to Section 38 of FDICIA, by (i) introducing a CET1 ratio requirement at each capital quality level (other than critically undercapitalized); (ii) increasing the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for each category; and (iii) requiring a leverage ratio of 5 percent to be well-capitalized. The OCC’s regulations implementing these provisions of FDICIA provide that an institution will be classified as “well capitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of at least 10.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of at least 8.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of at least 6.5 percent, (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of at least 5.0 percent, and (v) meets certain other requirements. An institution will be classified as “adequately capitalized” if it meets the aforementioned minimum capital ratios under Basel III. An institution will be classified as "undercapitalized" if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 8.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of less than 4.5 percent or (iv) has Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 4.0 percent. An institution will be classified as “significantly undercapitalized” if it (i) has a total risk-based capital ratio of less than 6.0 percent, (ii) has a Tier 1 risk-based capital ratio of less than 4.0 percent, (iii) has a CET1 ratio of less than 3.0 percent or (iv) has a Tier 1 leverage ratio of less than 3.0 percent. An institution will be classified as “critically undercapitalized” if it has a tangible equity to total assets ratio that is equal to or less than 2.0 percent. An insured depository institution may be deemed to be in a lower capitalization category if it receives an unsatisfactory examination rating.  Similar categories apply to bank holding companies. The capital ratios applicable to depository institutions under Basel III currently exceed the ratios to be considered well-capitalized under the prompt corrective action regulations. See “—Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act” below.
 Basel III prescribes a standardized approach for calculating risk-weighted assets that expand the risk-weighting categories from the four Basel I-derived categories (0 percent, 20 percent, 50 percent and 100 percent) to a much larger and more risk-sensitive number of categories, depending on the nature of the assets.

In November 2019, the federal banking regulators published final rules implementing a simplified measure of capital adequacy for certain banking organizations that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets. Under the final rules, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, depository institutions and depository institution holding companies that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and meet other qualifying criteria, including a leverage ratio of greater than 9%, off-balance-sheet exposures of 25% or less of total consolidated assets and trading assets plus trading liabilities of 5% or less of total consolidated assets, are deemed “qualifying community banking organizations” and are eligible to opt into the “community bank leverage ratio framework.” A qualifying community banking organization that elects to use the community bank leverage ratio framework and that maintains a leverage ratio of greater than 9% is considered to have satisfied the generally applicable risk-based and leverage capital requirements under the Basel III rules and, if applicable, is considered to have met the “well capitalized” ratio requirements for purposes of its primary federal regulator’s prompt corrective action rules, discussed below. The final rules include a two-quarter grace period during which a qualifying community banking organization that temporarily fails to meet any of the qualifying criteria, including the greater-than-9% leverage capital ratio requirement, is generally still deemed “well capitalized” so long as the banking organization maintains a leverage capital ratio greater than 8%. A banking organization that fails to maintain a leverage capital ratio greater than 8% is not permitted to use the grace period and must comply with the generally applicable requirements under the Basel III rules and file the appropriate regulatory reports. We do not have any immediate plans to elect to use the community bank leverage ratio framework but may make such an election in the future.
 As indicated in the following tables, as of September 30, 2020 Malvern Bank’s and Malvern Bancorp’s current capital levels exceed the required capital amounts to be considered “well capitalized” and also meet the fully-phased in minimum capital requirements, including the related capital conservation buffers, as required by the Basel III capital rules.
 Malvern Bank’s capital ratios as of September 30, 2020 are as follows:
 
 
 | Actual | | Required for Capital Adequacy Purposes | | To Be Well Capitalized Under Prompt Corrective Action Provisions | | Excess Over Well-Capitalized Provision

Failure to meet any of the capital requirements could result in enforcement actions by the regulators, including a capital directive, a cease and desist order, civil money penalties, the establishment of restrictions on the institution's operations, termination of federal deposit insurance and the appointment of a conservator or receiver.

The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010
 On July 21, 2010, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Act which has significantly changed the bank regulatory structure and impacted the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act required various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. The discussion below generally discusses the material provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act applicable to the Company and the Bank and is not complete or meant to be an exhaustive discussion.
 The following aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are related to the operations of the Bank:
  
• | A new independent consumer financial protection bureau was established within the FRB, empowered to exercise broad regulatory, supervisory and enforcement authority with respect to both new and existing consumer financial protection laws. Financial institutions with assets of $10 billion or less, such as the Bank, are subject to the supervision and enforcement of their primary federal banking regulator with respect to the federal consumer financial protection laws.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Tier 1 capital treatment for “hybrid” capital items like trust preferred securities was eliminated subject to various grandfathering and transition rules.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The prohibition on payment of interest on demand deposits was repealed.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | State consumer financial law is preempted only if it would have a discriminatory effect on a national bank, prevents or significantly interferes with the exercise by a national bank of its powers or is preempted by any other federal law. The OCC must make a preemption determination on a case-by-case basis with respect to a particular state law or another state law with substantively equivalent terms.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Deposit insurance has been permanently increased to $250,000.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | The deposit insurance assessment base calculation equals the depository institution’s total assets minus the sum of its average tangible equity during the assessment period.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund increased to 1.35 percent of estimated annual insured deposits or assessment base; however, FDIC was directed to “offset the effect” of the increased reserve ratio for insured depository institutions with total consolidated assets of less than $10 billion.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act are related to the operations of the Company:
  
• | The Federal Deposit Insurance Act was amended to direct federal regulators to require depository institution holding companies to serve as a source of strength for their depository institution subsidiaries.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Public companies are required to provide their shareholders with a non-binding vote: (i) at least once every three years on the compensation paid to executive officers, and (ii) at least once every six years on whether they should have a “say on pay” vote every one, two or three years.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | A separate, non-binding shareholder vote is required regarding golden parachutes for named executive officers when a shareholder vote takes place on mergers, acquisitions, dispositions or other transactions that would trigger the parachute payments.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Securities exchanges are required to prohibit brokers from using their own discretion to vote shares not beneficially owned by them for certain “significant” matters, which include votes on the election of directors, executive compensation matters, and any other matter determined to be significant.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stock exchanges, which includes The Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC (“Nasdaq”), will be prohibited from listing the securities of any issuer that does not have a policy providing for (i) disclosure of its policy on incentive compensation payable on the basis of financial information reportable under the securities laws, and (ii) the recovery from current or former executive officers, following an accounting restatement triggered by material noncompliance with securities law reporting requirements, of any incentive compensation paid erroneously during the three-year period preceding the date on which the restatement was required that exceeds the amount that would have been paid on the basis of the restated financial information. See “—Incentive Compensation” below. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Disclosure in annual proxy materials will be required concerning the relationship between the executive compensation paid and the financial performance of the issuer.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Transactions with Affiliates, Directors, Executive Officers and Shareholders
 
Sections 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act and FRB Regulation W generally:
 
 
• | limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with any one affiliate;


• | limit the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in “covered transactions” with all affiliates; and


• | require that all such transactions be on terms substantially the same, or at least as favorable to the bank or subsidiary, as those provided to a non-affiliate.

 
An affiliate of a bank is any company or entity which controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the bank. The term “covered transaction” includes the making of loans to the affiliate, the purchase of assets from the affiliate, the issuance of a guarantee on behalf of the affiliate, the purchase of securities issued by the affiliate, and other similar types of transactions.
 
A bank’s authority to extend credit to executive officers, directors and greater than 10 percent shareholders, as well as entities such persons control, is subject to Sections 22(g) and 22(h) of the Federal Reserve Act and Regulation O promulgated thereunder by the FRB. Among other things, these loans must be made on terms (including interest rates charged and collateral required) substantially the same as those offered to unaffiliated individuals or be made as part of a benefit or compensation program and on terms widely available to employees and must not involve a greater than normal risk of repayment. In addition, the amount of loans a bank may make to these persons is based, in part, on the bank’s capital position, and specified approval procedures must be followed in making loans which exceed specified amounts.
 Incentive Compensation
 The Dodd-Frank Act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the SEC to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentive-based payment arrangements at specified regulated entities with at least $1 billion in total assets, such as Malvern Bancorp and the Bank, that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive 
 -13-


officer, employee, director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation, fees, or benefits or that could lead to material financial loss to the entity. In addition, these agencies must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentive-based compensation arrangements. The agencies proposed such regulations in April 2011 and subsequently proposed revised regulations in May 2016, but the revised regulations have not been finalized. If the revised regulations are adopted in the form proposed, they will impose limitations on the manner in which Malvern Bancorp may structure compensation for its executives and employees.
 In 2010, the FRB, OCC and FDIC issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risk-taking. The guidance, which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization, either individually or as part of a group, is based upon the key principles that a banking organization’s incentive compensation arrangements should (i) provide incentives that do not encourage risk-taking beyond the organization’s ability to effectively identify and manage risks, (ii) be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management, and (iii) be supported by strong corporate governance, including active and effective oversight by the organization’s board of directors. These three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act.
 The FRB will review, as part of its regular, risk-focused examination process, the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations, such as Malvern Bancorp, that are not “large, complex banking organizations.” These reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organization’s activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements. The findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination. Deficiencies will be incorporated into the organization’s supervisory ratings, which can affect the organization’s ability to make acquisitions and take other actions. Enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements, or related risk-management control or governance processes, pose a risk to the organization’s safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies.
 Dividend Limitations
 Malvern Bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries. Malvern Bancorp’s revenues (on a parent company only basis) result in substantial part from dividends paid by the Bank. The Bank’s dividend payments, without prior regulatory approval, are subject to regulatory limitations. Under the National Bank Act, dividends may be declared only if, after payment thereof, capital would be unimpaired and remaining surplus would equal 100 percent of capital. Moreover, a national bank may declare, in any one year, dividends only in an amount aggregating not more than the sum of its net profits for such year and its retained net profits for the preceding two years. However, declared dividends in excess of net profits in either of the preceding two years can be offset by retained net profits in the third and fourth years preceding the current year when determining the Bank’s dividend limitation. In addition, the bank regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the Bank from paying dividends or otherwise supplying funds to Malvern Bancorp if the supervising agency determines that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice. 
Loans to Related Parties
 Malvern Bank’s authority to extend credit to its directors, executive officers and 10 percent shareholders, as well as to entities controlled by such persons, is currently governed by the requirements of the National Bank Act, Sarbanes-Oxley Act and Regulation O of the FRB thereunder. Among other things, these provisions require that extensions of credit to insiders (i) be made on terms that are substantially the same as, and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than, those prevailing for comparable transactions with unaffiliated persons and that do not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features and (ii) not exceed certain limitations on the amount of credit extended to such persons, individually and in the aggregate, which limits are based, in part, on the amount of the Bank’s capital. In addition, extensions of credit in excess of certain limits must be approved by the Bank’s Board of Directors. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Malvern Bancorp and its subsidiaries, other than the Bank under the authority of Regulation O, may not extend or arrange for any personal loans to its directors and executive officers.
Lending Limits
 As a national bank, the Bank’s lending limit to any one borrower is 15 percent of the Bank’s capital and surplus (defined as Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital calculated under the risk-based capital standards applicable to the Bank plus the allowance for loan losses (“ALLL”, “allowance”) not included in the Bank’s Tier 2 capital) for most loans ($25.5 million at September 30, 2020) and 25 percent of the Bank’s capital and surplus for loans secured by readily 
 -14-


marketable collateral ($42.6 million at September 30, 2020).  At September 30, 2020, the Bank’s largest committed relationship totaled $23.1 million.
 Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief and Consumer Protection Act
 
         On May 24, 2018, President Trump signed into law the first major financial services reform bill since the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (the “Regulatory Relief Act”) modifies or eliminates certain requirements on community and regional banks and nonbank financial institutions.  For instance, under the Reform Act and related rule making:

• | banks that have less than $10 billion in total consolidated assets and total trading assets and trading liabilities of less than five percent of total consolidated assets are exempt from Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act, known as the “Volcker Rule”, which prohibits “proprietary trading” and the ownership or sponsorship of private equity or hedge funds that are referred to as “covered funds”;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the asset threshold for bank holding companies to qualify for treatment under the “Small Bank Holding Company and Savings and Loan Holding Company Policy Statement” was raised from $1 billion to $3 billion, which exempts these institutions (including the Company) from certain regulatory requirements including the Basel III capital rules;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a new “community bank leverage ratio” was adopted, which is applicable to certain banks and bank holding companies with total assets of less than $10 billion (as described above under “Capital Requirements”); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | banks with up to $3 billion in total consolidated assets may be examined by their federal banking regulator every 18 months (as opposed to every 12 months).
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Community Reinvestment
 Under the Community Reinvestment Act (“CRA”), as implemented by OCC regulations, a national bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation consistent with its safe and sound operation to help meet the credit needs of its entire community, including low and moderate-income neighborhoods. The CRA does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution’s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community. The CRA requires the OCC, in connection with its examination of a national bank, to assess the institution’s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such association. The CRA also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their CRA ratings. Malvern Bank received an overall “satisfactory” CRA rating in its most recent examination. A bank which does not have a CRA program that is deemed satisfactory by its regulator will be prevented from making acquisitions. 
 In December 2019, the OCC and the FDIC proposed changes to the regulations implementing the CRA, which, if adopted will result in changes to the current CRA framework. The FRB did not join the proposal.
 Corporate Governance
 The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 added new legal requirements for public companies affecting corporate governance, accounting and corporate reporting, to increase corporate responsibility and to protect investors. Among other things, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002:

• | required our management to evaluate our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting, and required our auditors to issue a report on our internal control over financial reporting;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | imposed on our chief executive officer and chief financial officer additional responsibilities with respect to our external financial statements, including certification of financial statements within the Annual Report on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q by the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established independence requirements for audit committee members and outside auditors;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | created the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board which oversees public accounting firms; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | increased various criminal penalties for violations of securities laws.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

Nasdaq, where Malvern Bancorp’s common stock is listed, has corporate governance listing standards, including rules strengthening director independence requirements for boards, as well as the audit committee and the compensation committee, and requiring the adoption of charters for the nominating, corporate governance, compensation and audit committees.
 Privacy and Data Security Laws 
 The federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act includes limitations on financial institutions’ disclosure of nonpublic personal information about a consumer to nonaffiliated third parties, in certain circumstances requires financial institutions to limit the use and further disclosure of nonpublic personal information by nonaffiliated third parties to whom they disclose such information, and requires financial institutions to disclose certain privacy policies and practices with respect to information sharing with affiliated and nonaffiliated entities as well as to safeguard personal customer information. We have a detailed privacy policy, which is accessible from every page of our website. We maintain consumers’ personal information securely, and only share such information with third parties for marketing purposes in accordance with our privacy policy and with the consent of the consumer. In addition, we take measures to safeguard the personal information of our borrowers and investors and protect against unauthorized access to this information.
 USA PATRIOT Act
 As part of the USA PATRIOT Act, Congress adopted the International Money Laundering Abatement and Financial Anti-Terrorism Act of 2001 (the “Anti Money Laundering Act”). The Anti Money Laundering Act authorizes the Secretary of the U.S. Treasury, in consultation with the heads of other government agencies, to adopt special measures applicable to financial institutions such as banks, bank holding companies, broker-dealers and insurance companies. Among its other provisions, the Anti Money Laundering Act requires each financial institution: (i) to establish an anti-money laundering program; (ii) to establish due diligence policies, procedures and controls that are reasonably designed to detect and report instances of money laundering in United States private banking accounts and correspondent accounts maintained for non-United States persons or their representatives; and (iii) to avoid establishing, maintaining, administering, or managing correspondent accounts in the United States for, or on behalf of, a foreign shell bank that does not have a physical presence in any country.
 Regulations implementing the due diligence requirements require minimum standards to verify customer identity and maintain accurate records, encourage cooperation among financial institutions, federal banking agencies, and law enforcement authorities regarding possible money laundering or terrorist activities, prohibit the anonymous use of “concentration accounts,” and require all covered financial institutions to have in place an anti-money laundering compliance program.
 The OCC, along with other banking agencies, have strictly enforced various anti-money laundering and suspicious activity reporting requirements using formal and informal enforcement tools to cause banks to comply with these provisions.
 A bank which is issued a formal or informal enforcement requirement with respect to its Anti Money Laundering program will be prevented from making acquisitions.
 Insurance of Accounts
The deposits of the Bank are insured to the maximum extent permitted by the Deposit Insurance Fund and are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government. As insurer, the FDIC is authorized to conduct examinations of, and to require reporting by, insured institutions. It also may prohibit any insured institution from engaging in any activity determined by regulation or order to pose a serious threat to the FDIC. The FDIC also has the authority to initiate enforcement actions against national banks, after giving the OCC an opportunity to take such action.
 -16-


The FDIC’s risk-based premium system provides for quarterly assessments.  Each insured institution is placed in one of four risk categories depending on supervisory and capital considerations. Within its risk category, an institution is assigned to an initial base assessment rate which is then adjusted to determine its final assessment rate based on its brokered deposits, secured liabilities and unsecured debt. To implement the Dodd-Frank Act, the FDIC amended its deposit insurance regulations (1) to change the assessment base for insurance from domestic deposits to average assets minus average tangible equity and (2) to lower overall assessment rates. The revised assessments rates are between 2.5 to 9 basis points for banks in the lowest risk category and between 30 to 45 basis points for banks in the highest risk category. 
 In addition, all institutions with deposits insured by the FDIC are required to pay assessments to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the Financing Corporation, or FICO, a mixed-ownership government corporation established to recapitalize the predecessor to the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Bank paid these assessments until the FICO bonds matured in 2019 and the FICO assessments ended.
 The FDIC may terminate the deposit insurance of any insured depository institution, including the Bank, if it determines after a hearing that the institution has engaged or is engaging in unsafe or unsound practices, is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations, or has violated any applicable law, regulation, order or any condition imposed by an agreement with the FDIC. It also may suspend deposit insurance temporarily during the hearing process for the permanent termination of insurance, if the institution has no tangible capital. If insurance of accounts is terminated, the accounts at the institution at the time of the termination, less subsequent withdrawals, shall continue to be insured for a period of six months to two years, as determined by the FDIC. Management is not aware of any existing circumstances which could result in termination of the Bank’s deposit insurance. 
 As noted above, the Dodd-Frank Act raises the minimum reserve ratio of the Deposit Insurance Fund from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent and requires the FDIC to offset the effect of this increase on insured institutions with assets of less than $10 billion (small institutions). The FDIC has adopted a rule to accomplish this by imposing a surcharge on larger institutions commencing when the reserve ratio reaches 1.15 percent and ending when it reaches 1.35 percent.  The reserve ratio reached 1.15 percent on June 30, 2016.  Accordingly, surcharges began on July 1, 2016.  Small institutions will receive credits for the portion of their regular assessments that contributed to growth in the reserve ratio between 1.15 percent and 1.35 percent. The credits will apply for each quarter the reserve ratio is above 1.38 percent, in amounts as determined by the FDIC.
 Federal Home Loan Bank System.  
 Malvern Bank is a member of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Pittsburgh, which is one of 12 regional Federal Home Loan Banks (“FHLB”). Each FHLB serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region.  It is funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the FHLB System. It makes loans to members (i.e., advances) in accordance with policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the FHLB. At September 30, 2020, the Bank had $130.0 million of FHLB advances and $150.0 million available on its line of credit with the FHLB.
 As a member, the Bank is required to purchase and maintain stock in the FHLB of Pittsburgh in an amount equal to at least 1.0 percent of its aggregate unpaid residential mortgage loans or similar obligations at the beginning of each year.  At September 30, 2020, Malvern Bank had $6.9 million in FHLB stock, which was in compliance with this requirement.
 Federal Reserve System.  
 The FRB requires all depository institutions to maintain reserves against their transaction accounts (primarily NOW and Super NOW checking accounts) and non-personal time deposits. Because required reserves must be maintained in the form of vault cash or a noninterest-bearing account at a Federal Reserve Bank, the effect of this reserve requirement is to reduce an institution’s earning assets. At September 30, 2020, the Bank had met its reserve requirement.
Federal Securities Laws.  
 Malvern Bancorp has registered its common stock with the SEC under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act.  Accordingly, Malvern Bancorp is subject to the proxy and tender offer rules, insider trading reporting requirements and restrictions, and certain other requirements under the Exchange Act.

Other Regulations.  
 Malvern Bank is subject to federal consumer protection statutes and regulations promulgated under those laws, including, but not limited to, the:
  
• | Truth-In-Lending Act and Regulation Z, governing disclosures of credit terms to consumer borrowers;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (“RESPA”) and Regulation X, which governs certain mortgage loan origination activities and practices and the actions of servicers related to escrow accounts, loan servicing transfers, lender-placed insurance, loss mitigation, error resolution and other customer communications and
