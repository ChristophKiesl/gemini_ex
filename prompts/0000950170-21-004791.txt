 ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 Unless the context suggests otherwise, the terms “Beacon,” the “Company,” “we,” “our” or “us” are referring to Beacon Roofing Supply, Inc.
 Overview
 Beacon is the largest publicly traded distributor of roofing materials and complementary building products in North America. We have served the building industry for over 90 years and as of September 30, 2021, operated 446 branches throughout all 50 states in the U.S. and six provinces in Canada. We offer an extensive range of high-quality professional grade exterior products comprising over 100,000 SKUs, and we serve over 80,000 residential and non-residential customers who trust us to help them save time, work more efficiently, and enhance their businesses.
 We differentiate ourselves in the industry by providing our customers with seamless execution, practical innovation, and a hands-on approach that allows us to serve each of our individual customer’s specific needs. We also work closely with our suppliers, who rely on us to position their products advantageously in the market, supporting advances in products and services that ultimately benefit our customers.
 Interior Products Divestiture
 On February 10, 2021, we completed the sale of our interior products and insulation businesses (“Interior Products”) to Foundation Building Materials Holding Company LLC (“FBM”) for approximately $850 million in cash (subject to a working capital and certain other adjustments as set forth in the Purchase Agreement). As of September 30, 2021, the adjusted purchase price for Interior Products was $842.7 million. We used the proceeds from the divestiture of our Interior Products business to reduce net debt leverage and strengthen our balance sheet, which provides us the financial flexibility to pursue strategic growth initiatives in our core exterior products business. Beginning with the condensed consolidated financial statements for the three months ended December 31, 2020, we have reflected Interior Products as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Unless otherwise noted, amounts and disclosures relate to our continuing operations. For additional information, see Note 3 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Our Industry
 Roofing and complementary product distributors serve the important role of facilitating the supply chain relationships between a small number of manufacturers and thousands of local, regional, and national contractors. Distributors can maintain localized inventories, extend trade credit, give product advice, and provide delivery and logistics services.
 The exterior products industry experienced constrained supply chain dynamics in 2021. As a result, we experienced cost increases and, at times, a limited ability to purchase enough product to meet consumer demand. We took proactive measures to actively increase our inventory, price efficiently and deliver high-value solutions to our customers’ critical building material needs. These trends, caused in large part from global disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic, may persist in the near-term. As a leading distributor of essential building materials, we will continue to react quickly to market and supply chain developments and ensure high-quality service for our customers.
 Market Size
 Based on management’s estimates, we believe the roofing distribution market in the United States and Canada represents more than $28 billion in annual sales with roughly 70% of the market in residential roofing and 30% in non-residential. We also distribute complementary building products, including siding, plywood/oriented strand board (OSB), windows and doors, and waterproofing. Collectively, we believe these other building products have an addressable market opportunity nearly as large as our primary roofing distribution business.
Demand Drivers
 We believe the majority of roofing demand is driven by re-roofing activity (estimated at 80%) with the remaining demand tied to new construction. Re-roofing projects are typically related to necessary maintenance and repairs and are therefore less likely to be postponed during periods of recession or slower economic growth. As a result, demand for roofing products historically has been less volatile than overall demand for construction products.
 Our complementary building products demand comes from both the residential and non-residential sectors. These products allow us to be the supplier of choice to exteriors-focused customers and possess relatively greater end-market exposure to new construction compared to roofing products.


In addition to our domestic operations, we also operate in six provinces across Canada. These international locations represented approximately 3.3% of our total net sales for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021. For further geographic information, see Notes 4 and 15 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Competition
 Our competition is primarily composed of national, regional and local specialty roofing distributors and, to a lesser extent, other building supply distributors and big box retailers. Among distributors, we compete against a small number of large distributors and many small, privately-owned distributors. Given significant consolidation in the past decade, Beacon and two other distributors now represent over 50% of the roofing distribution industry in North America. Although we are the largest publicly traded distributor of roofing materials and complementary building products in North America, the industry remains highly competitive. The principal competitive factors in our business include, but are not limited to, the availability of materials and supplies; technical product knowledge and advisory expertise; delivery and other services including digital capabilities; pricing of products; and the availability of credit and capital.
Our Customers
 Our mission is to empower our customers to build more for their customers, businesses and communities. Our project lifecycle support helps our customers find projects, land the job, do the work and close it out with guidance that allows them to deliver on project specifications and timelines that are critical to their success. Using an omni-channel approach and our PRO+ digital suite, we differentiate our services and drive customer retention.
Our customer base is composed of professional contractors, home builders, building owners, lumberyards and retailers across the United States and Canada who depend on reliable local access to building products for residential and non-residential projects. Our customers vary in size, ranging from relatively small contractors to large contractors and builders that operate on a national scale. A significant number of our customers have relied on us as their vendor of choice for decades. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021, no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our net sales.
 Our Strategic Initiatives
Our objective is to be the preferred supplier of exterior building products across markets in the United States and Canada. Our four strategic priorities, as outlined below, are focused on driving top-line growth and bottom-line efficiency. These strategies are central to achieving sales growth, improving operational performance, and increasing profitability. Most importantly, our customers benefit from these initiatives as they are designed to make us more efficient and easier to do business with, differentiating our service from competitors.
Growth
 Our history has been strongly influenced by significant acquisition-driven growth, highlighted by the acquisitions of Allied Building Products Corp. (“Allied”) for $2.88 billion in 2018 (the “Allied Acquisition”) and Roofing Supply Group, LLC for $1.17 billion in 2016. These strategic acquisitions expanded our geographic footprint, enhanced our market presence and diversified our product offerings. The scale we have achieved from our expansion efforts serves as a competitive advantage, allowing us to use our assets more efficiently and control our expenses to drive operating leverage.
We have also pursued and finalized numerous smaller acquisitions in key markets to complement the expansion of our geographic footprint, such as our recently announced acquisition of Midway Sales & Distributing, Inc., a leading Midwest distributor of residential and commercial exterior building and roofing supplies with 10 branches across Kansas, Missouri and Nebraska and annual sales of approximately $130 million. We will continue to pursue strategic acquisitions to grow our business, and we remain heavily focused on improving our operations and continuing to identify additional opportunities for organic growth.
To achieve organic growth, we are investing in sales models and channels that add value to our customers. Further development and facilitation of relationships between our local sales teams and contractors give us considerable opportunities to differentiate our service offerings. We are focused on additional training for our sales organization, helping our sales team build on existing customer relationships, leading to higher productivity. In addition, we supplement the sales team’s outreach efforts with branch personnel, digital platform engagement, centralized sales, marketing and pricing support and call center support. Our customer relationship management (CRM) software elevates customer contact efficiency and provides coaching metrics to our sales team, while additional tools and analytics are being employed to enhance the sales team’s pricing proficiency.
 We are also pursuing organic growth via new greenfield locations to expand service to customers in key markets. In 2021 we opened three branches in North Port, Florida, Denton, Texas and San Marcos, Texas.


Digital
 We provide the most complete digital offering in building products distribution and continue to expand our capabilities. Beacon PRO+ is our proprietary digital account management suite which allows customers to manage their business with us online, and Beacon 3D+ is our roofing estimating tool for our residential customers. Our digital platform enables customers to order online from our catalog of over 100,000 products, have 24/7 access to view real-time pricing, process and review the status of orders, track deliveries, monitor local storm activity and vendor promotions, request and approve quotes, and pay their bills online. We are further enhancing PRO+ through partner integrations to help our customers improve estimating, project management and the homeowner experience. Beacon PRO+ provides us with additional opportunities to engage with our customers and helps them save time, work more efficiently, and grow their businesses.
By expanding and promoting our digital solutions, we intend to meet our customers’ changing needs and improve our returns through e-commerce. We will also build strong relationships with suppliers who rely on us to position their products advantageously in the market.
Beacon OTC® Network
 Our On Time & Complete (OTC) Network is an operating model in which networked branches share inventory, fleet, equipment, employees and systems for an optimal customer delivery experience. Customers benefit with improved service levels, delivery times and product availability, while we gain efficiencies in staffing, fleet and inventory. We are transitioning to this model in our markets containing an appropriate level of branch density, which we believe will drive shared success for our teams. As of September 30, 2021, our OTC Networks are operational in 58 markets, consisting of over 250 branches.
Branch Performance
 We are a learning organization intent on continuous improvement. In particular, we maintain an intensified focus on our branches falling in the bottom quintile of our operating performance metrics in order to determine the appropriate actions to improve the profitability of these locations. Using extensive data from our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system and a regular management reporting cadence, we are able to diagnose issues and make sustainable improvements. We will continue to focus on driving sales and operating improvements to bring these branches up to their potential.
Our Products & Services
 Our product lines are designed to meet the requirements of our residential, non-residential and complementary building products customers. We carry one of the most extensive arrays of high-quality branded products in the industry, including our private label brand, TRI-BUILT. Our TRI-BUILT products offer a high-quality and superior-value alternative for our customers while delivering higher margins and brand exclusivity in the marketplace. We fulfill the vast majority of our warehouse orders with inventory on hand because of the breadth and depth of the inventories at our branches.
In the residential market, asphalt shingles comprise the largest share of the products we sell. In the non-residential market, single-ply membranes, insulation, and accessories comprise the largest share of our product offering. In the area of complementary building products, siding, plywood/OSB, windows and doors, and waterproofing comprise the largest share of the products in our portfolio.
 During the year ended September 30, 2021, our distribution infrastructure served more than 1.4 million customer deliveries. We maintained a fleet of 1,667 straight trucks, 605 tractors and 893 trailers. Nearly all of our delivery vehicles are equipped with specialized equipment, including 2,225 truck-mounted forklifts, cranes, hydraulic booms and conveyors, which are necessary to deliver products to job sites in an efficient and safe manner and in accordance with our customers’ requirements.
Beyond product delivery, we emphasize superior value-added services to our customers. We employ a knowledgeable sales force that possesses an in-depth understanding of roofing and the building products we provide. Our sales force provides guidance to our customers throughout the lifecycles of their projects, including training, technical support and access to Beacon PRO+ and 3D+, where they can find leads, track storms, order online, track deliveries, view order history, participate in promotions and pay invoices.
Our Supply Chain
 We are a key distributor for our suppliers due to our industry expertise, scale, track record of growth, financial strength, and the substantial volume of products that we distribute. We maintain strong relationships with numerous manufacturers of roofing materials and complementary building products in order to reduce the dependence on any single company, maintain purchasing leverage and ensure breadth of product availability. This has been particularly relevant as the building materials industry has experienced constrained supply chain dynamics both domestically and internationally. Our largest suppliers include companies such as Atlas Roofing, Berger
Building Products, Carlisle Syntec, CertainTeed Roofing, CertainTeed Siding, Firestone Building Products, GAF, IKO Manufacturing, Johns Manville Roofing, Malarkey, Owens Corning Roofing, Ply Gem, and TAMKO Building Products.
 We manage the procurement of products through our national headquarters, regional offices and local branches, allowing us to take advantage of both scale and local market conditions to purchase products more economically than most of our competitors. Product is shipped by the manufacturers either to our branches, our OTC Network hubs, or directly to our customers.
Our Values – Environment, Social and Governance (ESG)
 Beacon was founded on a set of principles that have guided our business practices and growth philosophy for over 90 years. Through growth, geographic expansion, and acquisition of building supply brands throughout the United States and Canada, we have sustained a values-based company culture. Our values continue to be the foundation of being a preferred provider for our customers, employees, suppliers and communities.
Environmental
 We believe that protection of the environment is important to the long-term success of our business, and we are committed to sustainable business practices. We are continually looking for ways to run our business successfully while safeguarding natural resources for future generations. We also expect our suppliers to preserve natural resources and continuously improve the environmental impact of their products and services as we have expressed in our Supplier Code of Conduct.
 We recognize that our greatest impact on the environment is through fleet emissions, and we have committed to using the Beacon OTC® Network strategy to minimize our average gallons of fuel per delivery. OTC focuses on transforming multi-branch markets into a holistic market model that optimizes customer deliveries by shipping from the closest branch to the customer’s delivery address. Further, we continually invest in modernizing our fleet to reduce emissions and improve safety for our drivers. In 2021, we became an EPA SmartWay Partner to benchmark with and learn from companies that have similar large fleets and are seeking to minimize emissions.
Social – Human Capital
 We value putting people first and strive to help our employees, customers, and suppliers reach their full potential. We emphasize our core values to all our employees, establishing shared expectations of respect and inclusivity, work ethic, collaboration, and a commitment to deliver quality results.
 We are committed to a culture of safety, including a focus on the overall health and wellness of our employees. We maintain a comprehensive safety tracking and companywide scorecard program. We track and closely manage overall workers’ compensation and auto claims, OSHA recordable incidents, lost time rates, Department of Transportation compliance, and other internally established safety prevention elements in an effort to make every workday safe. We conduct new hire and annual training to promote compliance and continuously raise safety awareness. In 2021, we continued to implement COVID-19 protocols across all locations in response to the pandemic to encourage both the safety of our employees and compliance with all federal and local ordinances.
 We conduct a comprehensive annual organization and talent review process, culminating with a report to the Board of Directors covering key elements such as: executive succession and development, organizational structure, diversity, talent pipelines and workforce planning requirements. We maintain a broad suite of e-learning courses to deliver new hire, professional development, and annual training on subjects such as management skills, product knowledge, and operational proficiency.
Our Total Rewards program encompasses compensation, benefits and employee development. We track voluntary and involuntary turnover and conduct exit interviews to gain relevant information and adapt our engagement and retention strategy as appropriate.
 We are taking steps to expand our role as an employer that champions diversity, inclusion and equality of opportunity. We have a Diversity and Inclusion framework and a companywide council composed of thirteen diverse team members. Julian Francis, our Chief Executive Officer, has signed the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion pledge and we have provided e-learning courses on unconscious bias for our branch leaders and corporate staff. In 2021, we took a leadership role in our industry by providing LGBTQ+ introductory training at the National Women in Roofing conference and have partnered with INROADS to provide internships for racially and ethnically diverse students. We measure demographics, including gender and diversity, by business and function and are placing a more targeted focus on our incoming college graduate pipeline and branch operations roles to improve overall representation. In addition, we are a founding sponsor of National Women in Roofing, a volunteer-based organization that supports and advances the careers of women roofing professionals, and in 2021 we inaugurated our North American Female Roofing Professional of the Year contest.
We promote a culture of charitable giving and other community support, highlighted by our annual Beacon of Hope contest that was created to give back to distinguished military veterans by providing roofing replacements or repairs. To date, the contest has helped

deliver new or repaired roofs for 32 former service people facing adversity in the years following their military service. In 2021 we launched Beacon CaReS, an employee assistance fund to support team members who are impacted by unexpected financial crisis. The fund is supported by donations from both us and our employees. In addition, an inaugural group of outstanding students whose parents work at Beacon were awarded Robert R. Buck Scholarships totaling $25,000 to pursue post-secondary education.
 As of September 30, 2021, we had 6,676 active employees. We have 356 employees that are represented by labor unions and there are no material outstanding labor disputes.
 Governance
 Our employees, managers and officers conduct our business under the direction of our CEO and the oversight of our Board of Directors (our Board) to enhance our long-term value for our stockholders. The core responsibility of our Board is to exercise its fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of our company and our stockholders. In exercising this obligation, our Board and committees perform a number of specific functions, including risk assessment, review and oversight. While management is responsible for the day-to-day management of risk, our Board retains oversight of risk management for our company as a whole, assisting management by providing guidance on strategic risks, financial risks, and operational risks.
 Maintaining our leadership position in the building products distribution industry requires that our information technology deliver against our goal to help our customers build more. Our information security team deploys an array of cybersecurity capabilities to protect our various business systems and data. We continually invest in protecting against, monitoring, and mitigating risks across the enterprise including, as one of our risk mitigation controls, an information security risk insurance policy.
 Our information security and privacy policies are in place and regularly updated based on business, compliance, and any other needs. Our Chief Information Officer briefs the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors quarterly regarding information security matters.
 We provide new hire and annual security awareness and privacy training to all online employees. In addition, targeted training is conducted for key departments dealing with sensitive data types. Beacon conducts monthly phishing assessment exercises to ensure employees are aware and educated about phishing threats and are trained to identify and report them.
 External and internal resources perform assessments and penetration testing throughout the year on Beacon applications, networks, and environments. We perform an annual review to verify our compliance with the Payment Card Industries Data Security Standards (PCI DSS).
 In the event of a security issue, we have an incident response plan and trusted experts to quickly triage, contain and understand the issue, as well as protect against it going forward. We had no material publicly reportable information security incidents in the fiscal year ended September 30, 2021.
 Government Regulations
 We are subject to regulation by various federal, state, provincial and local agencies. These agencies include the Environmental Protection Agency, Department of Transportation, Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Department of Labor and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. We believe we comply, in all material respects, with applicable statutes and regulations affecting environmental issues and our employment, workplace health and workplace safety practices, and compliance with such statutes and regulations has no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.
Seasonality and Quarterly Fluctuations
 The demand for building materials is closely correlated to both seasonal changes and unpredictable weather patterns, therefore demand fluctuations are expected. In general, sales and net income are highest during our first, third and fourth fiscal quarters, which represent the peak months of construction and re-roofing. We typically experience a build-up of product inventories and increased cash usage in the second and third fiscal quarters of the year in anticipation of the peak selling season, followed by increased accounts receivable, accounts payable, and cash collections during the third and fourth fiscal quarters of the year, when sales volumes are generally at their highest.
 At times, we experience fluctuations in our financial performance that are driven by factors outside of our control, including the impact that severe weather events and unusual weather patterns may have on the timing and magnitude of demand and material availability.
 The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused and may continue to cause fluctuations in our financial results and working capital that are not aligned with the seasonality we generally experience.
