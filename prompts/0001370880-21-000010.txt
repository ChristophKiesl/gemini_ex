Item 1. Business
General
FireEye, Inc. is a global cybersecurity company with a mission to protect our customers from cyber attacks using innovative technology, intelligence and expertise from the front lines. 
We provide intelligence-based cybersecurity control products, software-as-a-service (SaaS) solutions, managed services and professional services that allow organizations to prepare for, prevent, investigate, respond to and remediate cyber attacks, including attacks targeting on-premise, remote, cloud, hybrid and critical infrastructure environments. 
We have evolved our business from a focus on appliance-based detection and prevention of stealthy and targeted cyber attacks, known as advanced persistent threats (“APTs”) in customers’ on-premise networks by expanding our portfolio of products, technologies, and services to help customers address today’s cybersecurity challenges. These challenges include a constantly evolving threat environment, expanding attack surfaces, digital transformation, and an acute shortage of cybersecurity talent. 
We accomplish this through the integration of our core competitive advantages across our portfolio of security control products, SaaS solutions and professional services. Our core competitive advantages include:
•our accumulated security expertise derived from responding to thousands of significant breaches over the past 15 years,
•our intelligence on threats and threat actors based on our experience responding to thousands of significant security incidents every year, as well as threat intelligence gathered by our security analysts, consultants and the continuous flow of machine-based threat data from our global network of threat sensors and virtual machines and,
•our technologies, including artificial intelligence-based extended detection and response ("XDR") technologies, our security validation technology, our machine-learning, behavioral-based, and rules-based threat detection, analysis and correlation technologies, our cloud visibility capabilities, our proprietary Multi-vector Virtual Execution ("MVX") engine, and our security orchestration, automation and response ("SOAR") technology. 
We design our cybersecurity products and solutions to rapidly incorporate the latest threat intelligence as the threat environment evolves. Through our work on the front lines, we learn the tactics, techniques and procedures attackers are using to circumvent current security safeguards. Our expertise and threat intelligence fuels our detection, validation, and automated response capabilities and becomes an integral component of our technologies in a cycle of intelligence-driven innovation. We also offer managed and consulting services to our customers to augment their internal security resources, to aid in the deployment and management of our solutions and to provide expertise on-demand when needed. 
We believe that the combination of our technologies, threat intelligence and security expertise allows us to deliver more effective cybersecurity control products and SaaS solutions, help customers improve the effectiveness of their security investments, and enables us to build long-term relationships with our customers.
We market our products, solutions and services under two brands: FireEye products and Mandiant solutions. 
FireEye products provide security control by detecting, blocking and analyzing advanced, targeted and other evasive attacks, including ransomware and phishing attacks in customers' on-premise, remote, cloud and critical infrastructure environments. Our security-control products include our network, email, endpoint, and cloud security products and use our patented MVX engine, a virtual machine-based threat detection and analysis engine that works in conjunction with our machine-learning and behavioral analysis technologies. Our security control products are complemented by our Helix security operations platform. Helix aggregates and enriches data and security alerts from our products, as well as data from the products of other vendors, and serves as an investigative and security incident and event management (SIEM) platform for security analysts. 
Mandiant solutions help customers improve their resilience to cyber attacks by automating and operationalizing our intelligence and expertise in software, and by augmenting internal resources with managed services, expertise on demand and consulting services. Our Mandiant solutions include our controls-agnostic threat intelligence, validation, and XDR SaaS solutions, as well as our portfolio of managed services and consulting services. We are developing the Mandiant Advantage platform to be a single portal for customers to access all Mandiant solutions.
In January 2020, we acquired Cloudvisory LLC, a provider of cloud visibility and control solutions.
In November 2020, we acquired Respond Software, Inc., a cybersecurity investigation automation company. 
In December 2020, we issued and sold 400,000 shares of a newly designated 4.5% Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.0001 per share, at a price of $1,000 per share, for an aggregate purchase price of $400.0 million.
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 9,900 end-customers, including more than 50% of the Forbes Global 2000. Our customers include leading enterprises in a diverse set of industries, including telecommunications, technology, financial services, public utilities, healthcare and oil and gas, as well as leading U.S. and international governmental agencies.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our revenue was $940.6 million, $889.2 million and $831.0 million, respectively, representing year-over-year growth of 6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 7% for the year ended December 31, 2019, and our net losses were $207.3 million, $257.4 million and $243.1 million, respectively.
Impact of COVID-19 on our Business
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) a global pandemic. We operate in geographic locations that have been impacted by COVID-19. The pandemic has impacted, and could further impact, our operations and the operations of our customers as a result of quarantines, various local, state and federal government public health orders, facility and business closures, and travel and logistics restrictions. While we instituted a global work-from-home policy and restricted employee travel to essential, business-critical trips toward the end of the first quarter of 2020, we were able to maintain strong customer relationships and deliver our technology-enabled managed and professional services to customers without interruption. As a result, we did not incur significant disruptions to our operations during the year ended December 31, 2020. 
We anticipate governments and businesses will likely take additional actions or extend existing actions to respond to the risks of the COVID-19 pandemic. We continue to actively monitor the impacts and potential impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in all aspects of our business. Although we are unable to predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources at this time, we expect we may be negatively affected if the pandemic and related public health measures result in substantial manufacturing or supply chain problems, disruptions in local and global economies, volatility in the global financial markets, overall reductions in demand, delays in payment, restrictions on the shipment of our products, or other ramifications from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
For a further discussion of the uncertainties and business risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, see the section entitled “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

intelligence, case management tools and AI-based XDR engine to enable rapid, prioritized responses to critical alerts. Our SOAR tools and technologies integrate with Helix and our XDR solutions to extend security processes and response activities across the IT infrastructure. 
Customers
Our customer base has grown to approximately 9,900 end-customers as of December 31, 2020, including more than 50% of the Forbes Global 2000. We provide security control products, SaaS solutions and services to customers of varying sizes, including enterprises, governmental agencies and educational and nonprofit organizations. Our customers include leading enterprises in a diverse set of industries, including telecommunications providers, financial services entities, software, technology and Internet companies, stock exchanges, electrical grid operators, networking vendors, oil and gas companies, healthcare and pharmaceutical companies and leading U.S. and international governmental agencies. 
Our business is not dependent on any particular end-customer as no end-customer represented more than 10% of our total revenue for any of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 or 2018. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, one distributor represented 13% and 20%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue, but did not represent 10% or greater of the Company's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020, and one reseller represented 15%, 14% and 15%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Additionally, another distributor represented 12% and 10%, respectively, of the Company's total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, but did not represent 10% or greater of the Company's total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2018. 
Backlog 
Orders for our appliances products are typically shipped and billed in their entirety shortly after receipt of the order, even when the delivery term for the subscription or service extends over multiple periods. These amounts are included in deferred revenue, although the timing of revenue recognition for subscriptions and services may vary depending on the contractual service period or when services are rendered. 
In certain instances, a customer may request periodic billing on a multi-period subscription or service contract or we may not have a contractual right to bill at period end. In these instances, the amount billed is included in deferred revenue and the amount to be billed in the future periods is included in backlog. Subscription and services backlog has historically represented less than 5% of our annual deferred revenue and revenue. As a result, we do not believe that our backlog at any particular time is meaningful because it does not represent a material component of future revenue in any given period.
We expect that the amount of backlog relative to the total value of our contracts will change from year to year due to several factors, including the amount invoiced early in the contract term, the timing and duration of customer agreements, varying invoicing cycles of agreements and changes in customer financial circumstances. Accordingly, we believe that fluctuations in backlog are not a reliable indicator of future revenues and we do not utilize backlog internally as a key management metric.
Sales and Marketing
Sales. Our sales organization consists of in-house sales teams who work in collaboration with external channel partners to identify new sales prospects, sell additional products, subscriptions and services, and provide post-sale support. Our field sales team is organized by territory and is responsible for enterprise and government accounts within their region. Our inside sales organization is responsible for sales to medium-sized and smaller organizations, and for renewal of existing subscriptions.
We also have a dedicated team focused on channel sales who manage the relationships with our value-added reseller and distributor partners and work with these channel partners to win and support customers. We believe this hybrid direct/channel sales approach allows us to leverage the benefits of broader market coverage provided by a reseller channel while maintaining a direct connection with many of our customers, including key enterprise and government accounts.
We have also cultivated alliances with non-traditional partners to generate customer referrals and extend our technologies, services and sales coverage to new market segments. These relationships include relationships with technology companies, insurance providers, large systems integrators, and managed service providers, and we have engaged in joint solution development with leading providers of software engineering services, payment systems, and public cloud platforms.
As part of our FireEye product sales strategy, we often provide prospective customers with our on-premise and cloud security control products for a short-term evaluation period, typically ranging from one week to several months. During this period, the prospective customer conducts evaluations with the assistance of our sales engineers and members of our security research team. We believe that by providing proof of concept evaluations to potential customers, we are able to demonstrate the effectiveness of our solutions by identifying suspicious and potentially malicious content in their actual IT environments. For our cloud-based email security and endpoint security solutions, we allow customers to submit emails and other content previously scanned by their existing security provider for analysis by our advanced detection technologies. 
As part of our strategy to increase adoption of our threat intelligence and the Mandiant Advantage platform and modules, we offer free access to publicly available threat intelligence enhanced with Mandiant threat scoring and other contextual information. The availability of additional information and features included with a paid subscription is shown to users within the platform to encourage paid upgrades.
Additionally, our Mandiant consultants use FireEye products and our validation and XDR solutions in their incident response and security consulting engagements, providing de facto proof of concept evaluations in the customer’s environment and often resulting in follow-on sales of our solutions. 
Our sales cycle varies by industry and can be long and unpredictable, but is typical of large, complex enterprise sales cycles that can last several months or more. However, some transactions can close in a few weeks when an active breach is discovered. 
Our sales organization is supported by sales engineers with deep technical domain expertise who are responsible for pre-sales technical support, solutions engineering for our customers, proof of concept work and technical training for our channel partners. Our sales engineers also act as the liaison between customers and our marketing and product development organizations. Our Customer Success organization is focused on improving our customers’ post-sales experience to increase customer satisfaction, retention and cross-selling.
Marketing. Our marketing is focused on fostering our thought leadership in cybersecurity, building our brand reputation and market awareness for our solutions, driving customer demand and a strong sales pipeline, and working with our channel and technology alliance partners around the globe. Our marketing team consists primarily of corporate marketing, product marketing, channel marketing, account/lead development, marketing operations, and corporate communications. 
Marketing activities include demand generation, advertising, product pricing and launch activities, managing our corporate website and partner portal, trade shows and conferences, press and analyst relations, and customer awareness. We are also actively engaged in driving global thought leadership programs through blogs, media appearances, and social media and developing rich digital content such as our annual M-Trends report, our Vision digital magazine, and our webinars, podcasts and threat reports.

Our visibility into the threat landscape, knowledge of threat actors' activities, and thought leadership in defending against cyber threats has helped to shape legislative, regulatory, and policy frameworks to enhance governments’ individual and collective cyber posture. As part of this effort, we contribute to the evolving standard-making processes, help define best practices in various jurisdictions, and help organizations of all sizes and at all levels of government better understand the cyber threat landscape. We also help governments identify future needs and requirements and consider actionable policy recommendations to address critical cybersecurity challenges, from establishing international norms in cyberspace to defending critical infrastructure. Through these and related activities, we engage on the front lines of emerging cybersecurity-related public policy and use our knowledge and insight to improve the cybersecurity of our government and industry customers.
Manufacturing
The manufacturing of our security appliances is outsourced to principally one third-party contract manufacturer. This approach allows us to reduce our costs as it reduces our manufacturing overhead and inventory and also allows us to adjust quickly to changing customer demand. Our manufacturing partner assembles our products using design specifications, quality assurance programs, and standards that we establish, and it procures components and assembles our products based on our demand forecasts. These forecasts represent our estimates of future demand for our products based upon historical trends and analysis from our sales and product management functions as adjusted for overall market conditions.
Our primary contract manufacturer is Flex Ltd. ("Flex"). The manufacturing agreement we entered into with Flex does not provide for any minimum purchase commitments and had an initial term of one year, which automatically renews for one-year terms, 
unless either party gives written notice to the other party not less than 90 days prior to the last day of the applicable term. Additionally, this agreement may be terminated by either party (i) with advance written notice provided to the other party, subject to certain notice period limitations, or (ii) with written notice, subject to applicable cure periods, if the other party has materially breached its obligations under the agreement.
Research and Development
We invest substantial resources in research and development to develop new solutions, enhance our detection, analysis and correlation engines, expand our threat intelligence, build add-on functionality to our products, and improve our core technologies. We believe that adapting our hardware, software and cloud-based technologies to changes in the threat environment is critical to maintaining and expanding our leadership in the cybersecurity industry. We have prioritized investments in higher growth opportunities, including security validation, automated extended detection and response, and machine learning capabilities to provide threat intelligence, security effectiveness testing, unified reporting, and automated response features to customers in the Mandiant Advantage platform.
Our engineering teams have deep networking, security and data management expertise and work closely with our customers and our Mandiant consultants to identify current and future needs. Our Mandiant consultants use our products in their incident response and security assessment engagements and provide continual feedback to our engineering, product management and product marketing teams on product performance, detection efficacy, evasion techniques and attack trends. This continuous feedback mechanism allows us to adapt our security control products and SaaS solutions as the threat environment evolves.
In addition to our focus on platform development and enhancement, our research and development teams are focused on developing automation technologies using artificial intelligence and machine learning techniques to create learning systems that adapt to changes in the threat environment and generate efficiencies across our product and services offerings. 
We maintain research and development activities across the globe with teams located in India, Ireland, Singapore and the United States.

•ease of use and customer experience; and
•price and total cost of ownership.
We believe we compete favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors as a result of our intelligence and expertise from the frontlines, as well as the features and performance of our products, the ease of integration of our products in diverse IT environments, the breadth of our services, the integration of our SaaS solution offerings in our platform, the measurement and reporting capabilities of our validation technologies, and the reputation of our Mandiant consulting organization. However, many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources, greater name recognition, larger sales and marketing budgets, deeper customer relationships, broader distribution, and larger and more mature intellectual property portfolios.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our core technologies and intellectual property. We rely on, among other things, patents, trademarks, copyrights, database rights and trade secret laws, confidentiality safeguards and procedures, and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. We file patent applications to protect our intellectual property and believe that the duration of our issued patents is sufficient when considering the expected lives of our products. We cannot assure you whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will result in patents of valuable breadth or applicability. In addition, any patents that may be issued may be contested, circumvented, found unenforceable or invalidated, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing them. We also license software from third parties for integration into our products, including open source software and other software available on commercially reasonable terms.
We control access to and use of our proprietary software, technology and other proprietary information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections with employees, contractors, end-customers and partners, and our software is protected by U.S. and international copyright, patent and trade secret laws. Despite our efforts to protect our software, technology and other proprietary information, unauthorized parties may still copy or otherwise obtain and use our software, technology and other proprietary information. In addition, we intend to expand our international operations, and effective patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be available or may be limited in foreign countries.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents and frequent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. If we become more successful, we believe that competitors will be more likely to try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our proprietary rights. It may also be more likely that competitors or other third parties will claim that our products infringe their proprietary rights. In particular, large and established companies in the cybersecurity industry have extensive patent portfolios and are regularly involved in both offensive and defensive litigation. From time-to-time, third parties, including certain of these large companies and non-practicing entities, may assert patent, copyright, 
trademark, and other intellectual property rights against us, our channel partners, our cloud platform providers, or our end-customers, whom our standard license and other agreements obligate us to indemnify against such claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third party, if any, could prevent us from distributing certain products or performing certain services, require us to expend time and money to develop non-infringing solutions, or force us to pay substantial damages (including, in the United States, treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed patents), royalties or other fees. We cannot assure you that we do not currently infringe, or that we will not in the future infringe, upon any third-party patents or other proprietary rights. See “Risk Factors— Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Technology Licensing— Claims by others that we infringe their proprietary technology or other rights could harm our business” for additional information.

Employees and Human Capital Management
We believe our ability to attract, engage and retain talent is necessary to drive achievement of our business objectives and ultimately realize our mission and vision. Doing the right thing for our customers and employees is a core value of our culture that we believe creates value for our shareholders. There are many things that define the culture of an organization – heritage, reputation, attitude, approach to execution, work ethic, and, most importantly, people. We seek out employees with qualities that facilitate high-quality results – those traits that give personal meaning to work and elevate our customers’ experiences. We believe that employees who feel appreciated create more satisfied customers, and we focus on improving and elevating our employees’ experiences at work. This means we are committed to providing a sense of belonging across our company that inspires everyone to respectfully speak-up, contribute their ideas, take action and be accountable. Our fundamental employee experience philosophies are: 
–We emphasize our ONE TEAM culture of respect and inclusiveness. 
–We make recognition an integral part of our culture. 
–We care about our employees and their overall well-being.
–We reward extraordinary performance and results.
Employee demographics. As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 3,400 employees, reflecting a global diversity of identity, background and experience. 
Diversity, inclusion and belonging. We believe that diverse teams maximize their potential and bring with them diverse views, experiences and perspectives. We seek to integrate diversity and inclusion into the employee lifecycle, and are committed to providing a work environment that is free of discrimination and harassment, where our employees can do their best work, bring their full self to work, feel supported and in turn support others. We strive to create a working environment where everyone feels included and respected and has an equal opportunity to contribute and to maximize their potential. We have established a framework to drive diverse representation and inclusive behaviors across our company that includes actions to ensure equality of opportunity, increase diversity in our employee base, promote equality of pay across gender and ethnicity, and provide anti-bias training and education. We also seek to promote diversity and inclusion in our communities by supporting organizations that champion diversity and inclusion initiatives. In addition, we continue to invest in FireEye-sponsored programs such as Elevate, which offers training, mentoring and other resources to women leaders in cybersecurity, and partnerships with military and veterans organizations. 
Compensation and benefits. We are committed to providing employees and their families with benefits packages that support physical, mental and financial well-being. Our intent is that any benefit plans offered by FireEye worldwide are regionally appropriate 
and competitive with other high-tech companies.  In addition to the foundational rewards like competitive pay and benefits, we provide cash incentives, equity-based compensation and employee stock purchase programs where possible, generous paid time-off, including paid parental leave, professional development opportunities, and many other employee perks. We constantly review our pay practices and benefits to ensure we can hire the best employees possible. We also believe that equal pay is important to further advance diversity, inclusion and belonging in the workplace. In addition, we conduct an internal pay equity review each year which currently encompasses compensation analysis across gender globally as well as race and ethnicity categories in the U.S.
Our response to COVID-19. As part of our efforts to keep our employees safe and support efforts to slow the spread of COVID-19, we instituted a mandatory work-from-home policy for all but a small number of onsite essential personnel and we restricted travel to essential, “business-critical” needs. With the support and commitment of our employees, we were able to seamlessly pivot to a work-from-home model and continue protecting our customers without interruption. We believe open and on-going communications have been critical to maintaining our culture and productivity during the pandemic, and we hosted weekly update calls and created an internal website designed for this purpose. We also instituted multiple measures to maintain the health and well-being of our employees, while continuing to deliver our essential cybersecurity solutions to customers around the world. Specific measures included regular employee surveys to assess employee attitudes toward work location, “self-care days” to enable rest, volunteering, or family time, online training, wellness and support programs, and a stipend to office-based employees to assist in the functional set-up of their remote working environment. Our Pandemic Response Team continues to monitor conditions and mandates globally to ensure safe practices as the pandemic evolves.
Professional development and training. We believe that a culture that encourages continued learning and development creates an environment where great people want to work and contribute their best efforts. We also believe that great leadership is how organizations endure and excel. To help our leaders, individual contributors and teams reach their full potential, we offer extensive training and career development resources internally through our Learning and Development organization. These include leadership, soft skills, and technical training, coaching, and development consulting via traditional and non-traditional learning events, as well as free access to online learning platforms such as LinkedIn Learning. We also offer tuition reimbursement program for employees who wish to further their formal education. To reinforce our corporate culture of respect, diversity and inclusion, each employee is required to complete anti-harassment and privacy awareness training annually. In 2020, we added a course on Breaking Bias: The Neuroscience of Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging, to build awareness of cognitive bias and how it impacts day-to-day interactions, people, business and life decisions. We are investigating additional training resources to support our diversity, inclusion and belonging programs we expect to implement in 2021. 
Communication and engagement. We strongly believe that our culture depends on our employees’ engagement and understanding of their contribution to the achievement of our strategic imperatives, vision and mission. Communicating powerfully and prolifically is a core competency in our ONE TEAM framework, and our senior leaders communicate regularly through a variety of channels, including quarterly all-hands meetings that are broadcast globally, weekly CEO updates, a monthly newsletter and regular “FireEye on a Mission” updates. We also enabled Yammer, the community and social interaction tool available in Office365, company-wide to address the need for more social and community interaction in our globally diverse workforce. We have many active Yammer communities, including communities hosted by our employee resource groups Eye on Veterans, Eye on Pride, and BOLD: Black Organization for Leadership and Development. In addition to prioritizing regular communications, we conduct regular employee surveys to seek feedback on what is going well and where we can focus our efforts to do more. Our annual company survey continues to surpass 80 percent participation rate each year, representing a wide cross segment of our employee population.
