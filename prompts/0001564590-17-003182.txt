 Item 1. Business 
 W&T Offshore, Inc. is an independent oil and natural gas producer, active in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and natural gas properties in the Gulf of Mexico.  W&T Offshore, Inc. is a Texas corporation originally organized as a Nevada corporation in 1988, and successor by merger to W&T Oil Properties, Inc., a Louisiana corporation organized in 1983.  Our interest in fields, leases, structures and equipment are primarily owned by the parent company, W&T Offshore, Inc. and our wholly-owned subsidiary, W & T Energy VI, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.    
 The Gulf of Mexico is an area where we have developed significant technical expertise and where high production rates associated with hydrocarbon deposits have historically provided us the best opportunity to achieve a rapid return on our invested capital.  We have leveraged our experience in the conventional shelf (water depths of less than 500 feet) to develop higher impact capital projects in the Gulf of Mexico in both the deepwater (water depths in excess of 500 feet) and the deep shelf (well depths in excess of 15,000 feet and water depths of less than 500 feet).  We have acquired rights to explore and develop new prospects and acquired existing oil and natural gas properties in both the deepwater and the deep shelf, while at the same time continuing our focus on the conventional shelf.  Over the last several years, we have increased our exploration and development activities in the deepwater, which has led to a greater percentage of our total production coming from deepwater wells.
 As of December 31, 2016, we have interests in offshore leases covering approximately 750,000 gross acres (450,000 net acres) spanning across the Outer Continental Shelf (“OCS”) off the coasts of Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Alabama.  On a gross acreage basis, the conventional shelf constitutes approximately 490,000 gross acres and deepwater constitutes approximately 260,000 gross acres of our offshore acreage.  
 Based on a reserve report prepared by Netherland, Sewell & Associates, Inc. (“NSAI”), our independent petroleum consultants, our total proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were 74.0 million barrels of oil equivalent (“MMBoe”) or 444.0 billion cubic feet of gas equivalent (“Bcfe”).  Approximately 64% of our proved reserves as of such date were classified as proved developed producing, 23% as proved developed non-producing and 13% as proved undeveloped.  Classified by product, our proved reserves at December 31, 2016 were 44% crude oil, 11% natural gas liquids (“NGLs”) and 45% natural gas.  These percentages were determined using the energy-equivalent ratio of six thousand cubic feet (“Mcf”) of natural gas to one barrel (“Bbl”) of crude oil, condensate or NGLs.  This energy-equivalent ratio does not assume price equivalency, and the energy-equivalent prices for crude oil, NGLs and natural gas may differ significantly.  Our total proved reserves had an estimated present value of future net revenues discounted at 10% (“PV-10”) of $755 million before consideration of cash outflows related to asset retirement obligations (“ARO”).  Our PV-10 after considering future cash outflows related to ARO was $478 million, and our standardized measure of discounted future cash flows was also $478 million as of December 31, 2016, as no future income taxes were estimated to be paid due to our current tax position.  Neither PV-10 nor PV-10 after ARO is a financial measure defined under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”).  For additional information about our proved reserves and a reconciliation of PV-10 and PV-10 after ARO to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, see Properties – Proved Reserves under Part I, Item 2 in this Form 10-K. 
 We seek to increase our reserves through acquisitions, exploratory and infill drilling, recompletions and workovers.  With respect to acquisitions, we have focused on acquiring properties where we can develop an inventory of drilling prospects that will enable us to add reserves, production and cash flow post-acquisition.  Although the current economic environment has caused us to take a conservative approach towards acquisitions, our acquisition team continues to identify and evaluate properties that will fit our profile and that we believe will add strategic and financial value to our Company.  During 2016 and 2015, we did not consummate any material acquisitions and we reduced our capital expenditures.  In 2015, we sold our interest in the Yellow Rose field discussed below.

In September 2016, we consummated a transaction whereby we exchanged approximately $710.2 million principal amount, or 79%, of our 8.500% Senior Notes due 2019 (the “Unsecured Senior Notes”) for $301.8 million principal amount of new secured notes and 60.4 million shares of our common stock.  In conjunction with the transaction, we closed on a new $75.0 million, 11.00%, 1.5 Lien Term Loan (the “1.5 Lien Term Loan”), and two amendments were made effective under our Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, as amended (the “Credit Agreement”) (collectively, the “Exchange Transaction”).  See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7, and in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data –  Note 2 – Long-Term Debt under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for a full description of the transaction, the new debt instruments and the accounting for the transaction. 
 From time to time, as part of our business strategy, we sell various properties.  In October 2015, we sold our ownership interests in the Yellow Rose onshore field to Ajax Resources, LLC (“Ajax”).  The field is located in the Permian Basin, West Texas, and covers approximately 25,800 net acres.  In addition to the cash purchase price, we were assigned a non-expense bearing overriding royalty interest (“ORRI”) equal to a variable percentage in production from the working interests assigned to Ajax, which percentage varies on a sliding scale from one percent for each month that the prompt month New York Mercantile Exchange (“NYMEX”) trading price for light sweet crude oil is at or below $70.00 per barrel to a maximum of four percent for each month that such NYMEX trading price is greater than $90.00 per barrel.  Our internal estimate of the assigned proved reserves at the date of the sale to Ajax was 19.0 MMBoe, consisting of approximately 71% oil, 11% NGL and 18% natural gas.  In 2016 and 2014, we did not have any significant property sales.  
 In September 2014, we acquired an additional ownership interest in the Mobile Bay blocks 113 and 132 located in Alabama state waters (the “Fairway Field”) and the associated Yellowhammer gas processing plant (collectively “Fairway”), which increased our ownership interest from 64.3% to 100%.  
  In May 2014, we acquired from Woodside Energy (USA) Inc. (“Woodside”) certain oil and gas leasehold interests in the Gulf of Mexico (the “Woodside Properties”).  The Woodside Properties consist of a 20% non-operated working interest in the producing Neptune field (deepwater Atwater Valley blocks 574, 575 and 618), along with an interest in the Neptune tension-leg platform, associated production facilities and various interests in 24 other deepwater lease blocks. 
 Under current commodity pricing conditions, we expect to continue to focus on conserving capital and maintaining liquidity.   We expect 2017 production to be slightly higher than 2016, but factors such as natural production declines, unplanned downtime and well performance could lead to lower production in 2017.  In addition, our capital expenditure plan for 2017 allocates approximately $125 million to projects in producing fields that we believe are low-risk and will provide a high rate of return.  While we will continue to evaluate opportunistic acquisitions, we expect that our acquisition activities may be reduced until the outlook for the future commodity pricing environment improves or unless financing is available on reasonable terms that would not significantly impair our available liquidity.
 Additional information on acquisitions and divestitures can be found under Properties in Part I, Item 2, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7, and in Financial Statements and Supplementary Data –  Note 7 – Acquisitions and Divestitures under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K.  
 Our exploration efforts have historically been in areas in reasonably close proximity to known proved reserves, but starting in 2012, some of our exploration projects were higher risk deepwater projects with potentially higher returns than our previous risk/reward profile.  The investment associated with drilling an offshore well and future development of an offshore project principally depends upon water depth, the depth of the well, the complexity of the geological formations involved and whether the well or project can be connected to existing infrastructure or will require additional investment in infrastructure.  Deepwater and deep shelf drilling projects can be substantially more capital intensive than those on the conventional shelf.  Certain risks are inherent in our business specifically and in the oil and natural gas industry generally, any one of which can negatively impact our rate of return on invested capital if it occurs.  When projects are extremely capital intensive and involve substantial risk, we often seek participants to share the risk.  We completed one, five and six offshore wells (gross) in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
 2


We generally sell our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas at the wellhead at current market prices or transport our production to “pooling points” where it is sold.  We are required to pay gathering and transportation costs with respect to a majority of our products.  Our products are marketed several different ways depending upon a number of factors including the availability of purchasers at the wellhead, the availability and cost of pipelines near the well or related production platforms, the availability of third-party processing capacity, market prices, pipeline constraints and operational flexibility. 
 Due to the substantially lower commodity price environment experienced since the first half of 2014 and the outlook for the remainder of 2017, we have set our 2017 capital expenditure budget at $125 million.  Although this is an increase from the $49 million of capital expenditures incurred in 2016, our current plan for 2017 is still a significant reduction from 2015 and 2014 investment levels of $231 million and $630 million, respectively.  We have flexibility in our 2017 capital expenditure budget because we have no long term rig commitments and no current pressure from co-owners to drill or complete a well.  Some of our expenditures planned for 2017 are expected to impact production in 2017, while most are expected to impact production in 2018 and beyond.  We expect 2017 production to be slightly higher than 2016, but factors such as natural production declines, timing of well completions, unplanned downtime and well performance could lead to flat or even lower production in 2017.  In addition, our plans include spending $78 million in 2017 for ARO, compared to $72 million spent on ARO in 2016.  We continue to closely monitor current and forecasted prices to assess if changes are needed to our plans. See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K for additional information. 
 Business Strategy 
 Our business strategy is to acquire, explore and develop oil and natural gas reserves on the OCS, the area of our historical success and technical expertise, which we believe will yield desirable rates of return commensurate with our perception of risks.  The rapid and extended decline in crude oil, NGLs and natural gas prices that commenced in the second half of 2014 created more uncertainty about future exploration and development.  Although commodity prices stabilized at higher levels during the second half of 2016 compared to the first half of 2016, prices are still low from historical levels and price volatility occurring in the last three years continues to affect our evaluation of potential returns and risks of our drilling projects.  We believe attractive acquisition opportunities will continue to become available in the Gulf of Mexico as the major integrated oil companies and other large independent oil and gas exploration and production companies continue to divest properties to focus on larger and more capital-intensive projects that better match their long-term strategic goals.  Also, we expect opportunities will arise as producers seek to divest their properties for short-term cash flow needs.   Our plans for the short-term include operating within cash flow, maintaining liquidity, meeting our financial obligations, and pursuing acquisitions meeting our criteria.
    Our business strategy may need to be significantly altered to comply with financial assurance requirements and other regulatory hurdles, which may have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.  See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 19 – Subsequent Events under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for additional information on this significant risk to our business and recent events.    
 We believe a portion of our Gulf of Mexico acreage has exploration potential below currently producing zones, including deep shelf reserves at subsurface depths greater than 15,000 feet.  Although the cost to drill deep shelf wells is significantly higher than shallower wells, the reserve targets are typically larger, and the use of existing infrastructure, when available, can increase the economic potential of these wells.  Pursuit of acquisition opportunities in the Gulf of Mexico will be dependent on a number of factors, including commodity prices, access to capital markets, financial assurance requirements, other regulatory challenges, possible debt covenant restrictions, ARO and other cash needs of the business.  We plan to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities and financing options.

Competition 
 The oil and natural gas industry is highly competitive.  We currently operate in the Gulf of Mexico and compete for the acquisition of oil and natural gas properties primarily on the basis of price for such properties.  We compete with numerous entities, including major domestic and foreign oil companies, other independent oil and natural gas companies and individual producers and operators.  Many of these competitors are large, well established companies that have financial and other resources substantially greater than ours and greater ability to provide the extensive regulatory financial assurances required for offshore properties.  Our ability to acquire additional oil and natural gas properties and to discover reserves in the future will depend upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment and to finance acquisitions without compromising our ability to continue as a going concern.  For a more thorough discussion of how competition could impact our ability to successfully complete our business strategy, see Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K.
 Oil and Natural Gas Marketing and Delivery Commitments
  We sell our crude oil, NGLs and natural gas to third-party customers.  We are not dependent upon, or contractually limited to, any one customer or small group of customers.  However, in 2016, approximately 43% of our sales were to Shell Trading (US) Co. and 20% were to Vitol Inc., with no other customer comprising greater than 10% of our 2016 revenues.  Due to the free trading nature of the oil and natural gas markets in the Gulf of Mexico, we do not believe the loss of a single customer or a few customers would materially affect our ability to sell our production.  We do not have any agreements which obligate us to deliver material quantities to third parties.
Regulation  
 General.  Various aspects of our oil and natural gas operations are subject to extensive and continually changing regulations as legislation affecting the oil and natural gas industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion.  Numerous departments and agencies, both federal and state, are authorized by statute to issue, and have issued, rules and regulations binding upon the oil and natural gas industry and its individual members.  The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management (“BOEM”) and the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (“BSEE”) regulations, pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (“OCSLA”), apply to our operations on Federal leases in the Gulf of Mexico.  
 The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) regulates the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce pursuant to the Natural Gas Act of 1938 (“NGA”) and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978 (“NGPA”).  In 1989, Congress enacted the Natural Gas Wellhead Decontrol Act, which removed all remaining price and nonprice controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas, effective January 1, 1993.  Sales by producers of natural gas and all sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices. 
 The Federal Trade Commission, the FERC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) hold statutory authority to monitor certain segments of the physical and futures energy commodities markets.  These agencies have imposed broad regulations prohibiting fraud and manipulation of such markets.  We are required to observe the market-related regulations enforced by these agencies with regard to our physical sales of crude oil or other energy commodities, and any related hedging activities that we undertake.  
 These departments and agencies have substantial enforcement authority and the ability to grant and suspend operations, and to levy substantial penalties for non-compliance.  Failure to comply with such regulations, as interpreted and enforced, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.  See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A in this Form 10-K for certain risks related to these and other regulations.

 Federal leases.  Most of our offshore operations are conducted on federal oil and natural gas leases.  These leases are awarded based on competitive bidding and contain relatively standardized terms.  These leases require compliance with BOEM, BSEE, and other government agency regulations and orders that are subject to interpretation and change.  The BOEM and BSEE also regulate the plugging and abandonment of wells located on the OCS and, following cessation of operations, the removal or appropriate abandonment of all production facilities, structures and pipelines on the OCS (collectively, these activities are referred to as “decommissioning”).  
 Decommissioning and financial assurance requirements.  The BOEM requires that lessees demonstrate financial strength and reliability according to its regulations or provide acceptable financial assurances to assure satisfaction of lease obligations, including decommissioning activities on the OCS.  In July 2016, the BOEM issued Notice to Lessees #2016-N01 (“NTL #2016-N01”) to clarify the procedures and guidelines that BOEM Regional Directors use to determine if and when additional financial assurances may be required for OCS leases, rights of way (“ROWs”) and rights of use and easement (“RUEs”).  This NTL became effective in September 2016 and supersedes and replaces NTL #2008-N07.  Under the new NTL, qualifying operators may self-insure for an amount up to 10% of their tangible net worth.  In addition, the NTL implements a phase-in period for establishing compliance with additional security obligations for certain categories of properties covered under the NTL, whereby a lessee may seek compliance with its additional security requirements under a “tailored plan” that is approved by the BOEM and would require securing phased in compliance in three approximately equal installments during a one-year period from the date of the BOEM approval of the tailored plan.  In January 2017, in a notice to stakeholders, the BOEM announced that it was extending the implementation timeline for providing financial assurance under NTL #2016-N01 by an additional six months (the “January 2017 Extension”).  However, the January 2017 Extension did not apply to “sole liability properties.”  “Sole liability properties” are leases, ROWs or RUEs for which the holder is the only liable party, i.e., there are no co-lessees, operating rights owners and/or other grant holders, and no prior interest holders liable to meet the lease and/or grant obligations.  In February 2017, the BOEM withdrew orders affecting “sole liability properties” issued in December 2016 to allow time for the new President’s administration to review the complex financial assurance program.  The February 2017 notice stated that any implementation issues associated with those sole liability orders will be discussed as part of the ongoing, six-month interactive process BOEM had initiated to gather input on other components of NTL #2016-N01 pursuant to the January 2017 Extension.  However, the BOEM reserved the right to re-issue sole liability orders before the end of the six-month period if it determines there is a substantial risk of nonperformance of the interest holder’s decommissioning sole liabilities.  See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in Part II, Item 7 and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data under Part II, Item 8 in this Form 10-K for more discussion on decommissioning and financial assurance requirements. 
 Reporting of decommissioning expenditures.  During December 2015, the BSEE issued a final rule requiring lessees to submit summaries of actual expenditures for decommissioning of wells, platforms, and other facilities required under the BSEE’s existing regulations.  The BSEE has reported that it will use this summary information to better estimate future decommissioning costs, and the BOEM typically relies upon the BSEE’s estimates to set the amount of required bonds or other forms of financial security in order to minimize the government’s perceived risk of potential decommissioning liability.
 “Unbundling.”  The Office of Natural Resources Revenue (the “ONRR”) has publicly announced an “unbundling” initiative to revise the methodology employed by producers in determining the appropriate allowances for transportation and processing costs that are permitted to be deducted in determining royalties under Federal oil and gas leases.  The ONRR’s initiative requires re-computing allowable transportation and processing costs using revised guidance from the ONRR going back 84 months for every gas processing plant utilized during that period.

Regulation and transportation of natural gas.  Our sales of natural gas are affected by the availability, terms and cost of transportation.  The price and terms for access to pipeline transportation are subject to extensive regulation.  The FERC has undertaken various initiatives to increase competition within the natural gas industry.  As a result of initiatives like FERC Order No. 636, issued in April 1992, the interstate natural gas transportation and marketing system allows non-pipeline natural gas sellers, including producers, to effectively compete with interstate pipelines for sales to local distribution companies and large industrial and commercial customers.  The most significant provisions of Order No. 636 require that interstate pipelines provide firm and interruptible transportation service on an open access basis that is equal for all natural gas supplies.  In many instances, the results of Order No. 636 and related initiatives have been to substantially reduce or eliminate the interstate pipelines’ traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas in favor of providing only storage and transportation services.  The rates for such storage and transportation services are subject to FERC ratemaking authority, and FERC exercises its authority either by applying cost-of-service principles or granting market based rates.  Similarly, the natural gas pipeline industry is subject to state regulations, which may change from time to time.  
 The OCSLA, which is administered by the BOEM and the FERC, requires that all pipelines operating on or across the OCS provide open access, non-discriminatory transportation service.  One of the FERC’s principal goals in carrying out OCSLA’s mandate is to increase transparency in the OCS market, to provide producers and shippers assurance of open access service on pipelines located on the OCS, and to provide non-discriminatory rates and conditions of service on such pipelines.  The BOEM issued a final rule, effective August 2008 that implements a hotline, alternative dispute resolution procedures, and complaint procedures for resolving claims of having been denied open and nondiscriminatory access to pipelines on the OCS. 
 In December 2007, the FERC issued rules (“Order 704”) requiring that any market participant, including a producer such as us, that engages in wholesale sales or purchases of natural gas that equal or exceed 2.2 million British thermal units (“MMBtu”) during a calendar year must annually report such sales and purchases to the FERC to the extent such transactions utilize, contribute to, or may contribute to the formation of price indices.  It is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of Order 704.  Order 704 also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers, and if so, whether their reporting complies with FERC’s policy statement on price reporting.  These rules are intended to increase the transparency of the wholesale natural gas markets and to assist the FERC in monitoring such markets and in detecting market manipulation. 
 Additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before Congress, the FERC, state legislatures, state commissions and the courts.  The natural gas industry historically has been very heavily regulated.  As a result, there is no assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach pursued by the FERC, Congress and the states will continue. 
 While these federal and state regulations for the most part affect us only indirectly, they are intended to enhance competition in natural gas markets.  We cannot predict what further action the FERC, the BOEM or state regulators will take on these matters; however, we do not believe that any such action taken will affect us differently, in any material way, than other natural gas producers with which we compete. 
 Oil and NGLs transportation rates.  Our sales of crude oil, condensate and NGLs are not currently regulated and are transacted at market prices.  In a number of instances, however, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to FERC jurisdiction under the Interstate Commerce Act.  The price we receive from the sale of crude oil and NGLs is affected by the cost of transporting those products to market.  Interstate transportation rates for crude oil, NGLs and other products are regulated by the FERC.  In general, interstate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipeline rates must be cost-based, although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances. The FERC has established an indexing system for such transportation, which generally allows such pipelines to take an annual inflation-based rate increase. 
 6


In other instances, the ability to transport and sell such products is dependent on pipelines whose rates, terms and conditions of service are subject to regulation by state regulatory bodies under state statutes and regulations.  As it relates to intrastate crude oil, condensate and NGL pipelines, state regulation is generally less rigorous than the federal regulation of interstate pipelines.  State agencies have generally not investigated or challenged existing or proposed rates in the absence of shipper complaints or protests, which are infrequent and are usually resolved informally.  We do not believe that the regulatory decisions or activities relating to interstate or intrastate crude oil, condensate or NGL pipelines will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they affect other crude oil, condensate and NGL producers or marketers. 
 Regulation of oil and natural gas exploration and production.  Our exploration and production operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.  Such regulations include requiring permits, bonds and pollution liability insurance for the drilling of wells, regulating the location of wells, the method of drilling, casing, operating, plugging and abandoning wells, and governing the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled.  Many states also have statutes or regulations addressing conservation of oil and gas resources, including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties, the establishment of maximum rates of production from oil and natural gas wells and the regulation of spacing of such wells. 
 Hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico can have a significant impact on oil and gas operations on the OCS.  The effects from past hurricanes have included structural damage to fixed production facilities, semi-submersibles and jack-up drilling rigs.  The BOEM and the BSEE continue to be concerned about the loss of these facilities and rigs as well as the potential for catastrophic damage to key infrastructure and the resultant pollution from future storms.  In an effort to reduce the potential for future damage, the BOEM and the BSEE have periodically issued guidance aimed at improving platform survivability by taking into account environmental and oceanic conditions in the design of platforms and related structures.  
 Environmental Regulations
General.  We are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local environmental laws.  These laws, among other things, govern the issuance of permits to conduct exploration, drilling and producing operations, the amounts and types of materials that may be released into the environment, the discharge and disposal of waste materials, the remediation of contaminated sites and the reclamation and abandonment of wells, sites and facilities.  Numerous governmental departments issue rules and regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which are often costly to comply with, and a failure to comply may result in substantial administrative, civil and even criminal penalties or the suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas.  Some laws, rules and regulations relating to protection of the environment may, in certain circumstances, impose strict liability for environmental contamination, rendering a person liable for environmental damages and cleanup costs without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person.  Other laws, rules and regulations may restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise exist or even prohibit exploration and production activities in sensitive areas.  In addition, state laws often require various forms of remedial action to prevent and address pollution, such as the closure of inactive oil and gas waste pits and the plugging of abandoned wells.  The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases our cost of doing business and consequently affects our profitability.  The cost of remediation, reclamation and abandonment of wells, platforms and other facilities in the Gulf of Mexico is significant.  These costs are considered a normal, recurring cost of our on-going operations.  Our competitors are subject to the same laws and regulations.  
  Hazardous Substances and Wastes.  The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) imposes liability, without regard to fault, on certain classes of persons that are considered to be responsible for the release of a “hazardous substance” into the environment.  These persons include the current or former owner or operator of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances.  Under CERCLA, such persons are subject to joint and several liability for the cost of investigating and cleaning up hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the cost of certain health studies.

The Federal Solid Waste Disposal Act, as amended by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (“RCRA”), regulates the generation, transportation, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous wastes and can require cleanup of hazardous waste disposal sites.  RCRA currently excludes drilling fluids, produced waters and certain other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of oil and natural gas from regulation as “hazardous waste,” and the disposal of such oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes is usually regulated by state law.  From time to time, however, various environmental groups have challenged the Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) exemption of certain oil and gas wastes from RCRA.  For example, following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency’s failure to timely assess its RCRA Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, the EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016.  Under the decree, the EPA must propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination that revision of the regulations is not necessary.  If the EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the consent decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021.  In addition, legislation is frequently proposed in Congress that would revoke or alter the current exclusion of exploration, development and production wastes from the RCRA definition of “hazardous wastes.”  A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could potentially subject such wastes to more stringent handling, disposal and cleanup requirements.  Other wastes handled at exploration and production sites or generated in the course of providing well services may not fall within the RCRA exclusion.  Moreover, stricter standards for waste handling and disposal may be imposed on the oil and natural gas industry in the future.  Additionally, Naturally Occurring Radioactive Materials (“NORM”) may contaminate minerals extraction and processing equipment used in the oil and natural gas industry.  The waste resulting from such contamination is regulated by federal and state laws.  Standards have been developed for: worker protection; treatment, storage, and disposal of NORM and NORM waste; management of NORM-contaminated waste piles, containers and tanks; and limitations on the relinquishment of NORM contaminated land for unrestricted use under RCRA and state laws.  We do not anticipate any material expenditures in connection with our compliance with RCRA and applicable state laws related to NORM waste. 
 Air Emissions and Climate Change.  Air emissions from our operations are subject to the Federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”) and comparable state and local requirements.  We may be required to incur certain capital expenditures in the future for air pollution control equipment in connection with obtaining and maintaining operating permits and approvals for air emissions.  In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources.   Moreover, the U.S. Congress and the EPA, in addition to some state and regional efforts, have in recent years considered legislation or regulations to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.  These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, and greenhouse gas monitoring and reporting programs.  In the absence of federal greenhouse gas limitations, the EPA has determined that greenhouse gas emissions present a danger to public health and the environment, and it has adopted regulations that, among other things, restrict emissions of greenhouse gases under existing provisions of the CAA and may require the installation of control technologies to limit emissions of greenhouse gases.  For example, in June 2016, the EPA published new source performance standards that require new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce methane gas and volatile organic compound emissions.  These regulations would apply to any new or significantly modified facilities that we construct in the future that would otherwise emit large volumes of greenhouse gases together with other criteria pollutants.  Also, certain of our operations are subject to EPA rules requiring the monitoring and annual reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from specified offshore production sources.  See Risk Factors under Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K for further discussion.

Water Discharges.  The primary federal law for oil spill liability is the Oil Pollution Act (the “OPA”) which amends and augments oil spill provisions of the federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”).  OPA imposes certain duties and liabilities on “responsible parties” related to the prevention of oil spills and damages resulting from such spills in or threatening United States waters, including the OCS or adjoining shorelines.  A liable “responsible party” includes the owner or operator of an onshore facility, vessel or pipeline that is a source of an oil discharge or that poses the substantial threat of discharge or, in the case of offshore facilities, the lessee or permittee of the area in which a discharging facility is located.  OPA assigns joint and several, strict liability, without regard to fault, to each liable party for all containment and oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages including, but not limited to, the costs of responding to a release of oil and natural resource damages and economic damages suffered by persons adversely affected by an oil spill.  Although defenses exist to the liability imposed by OPA, they are limited.  In addition, the BOEM has raised OPA’s damages liability cap to $134 million.  OPA requires owners and operators of offshore oil production facilities to establish and maintain evidence of financial responsibility to cover costs that could be incurred in responding to an oil spill, and to prepare and submit for approval oil spill response plans.  These oil spill response plans must detail the action to be taken in the event of a spill; identify contracted spill response equipment, materials, and trained personnel; and identify the time necessary to deploy these resources in the event of a spill.  In addition, OPA currently requires a minimum financial responsibility demonstration of between $35 million and $150 million for companies operating on the OCS.  We are currently required to demonstrate, on an annual basis, that we have ready access to $150 million that can be used to respond to an oil spill from our facilities on the OCS.  
 The Clean Water Act and comparable state laws impose restrictions and strict controls regarding the monitoring and discharge of pollutants, including produced waters and other natural gas wastes, into federal and state waters.  The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or the state.  The EPA has also adopted regulations requiring certain onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production facilities to obtain individual permits or coverage under general permits for storm water discharges.  The treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans, as well as for monitoring and sampling the storm water runoff from our onshore gas processing plant may have significant costs.  Obtaining permits has the potential to delay the development of oil and natural gas projects.  These same regulatory programs also limit the total volume of water that can be discharged, hence limiting the rate of development, and require us to incur compliance costs.  Pursuant to these laws and regulations, we may be required to obtain and maintain approvals or permits for the discharge of wastewater or storm water and are required to develop and implement spill prevention, control and countermeasure plans, also referred to as “SPCC plans,” in connection with on-site storage of significant quantities of oil.  
 Protected and Endangered Species.  Executive Order 13158, issued in May 2000, directs federal agencies to safeguard existing Marine Protected Areas (“MPAs”) in the United States and establish new MPAs.  The order requires federal agencies to avoid harm to MPAs to the extent permitted by law and to the maximum extent practicable.  It also directs the EPA to propose new regulations under the Clean Water Act to ensure appropriate levels of protection for the marine environment.  In addition, Federal Lease Stipulations include regulations regarding the taking of protected marine species (sea turtles, marine mammals, Gulf sturgeon and other listed marine species).  
 Certain flora and fauna that have been officially classified as “threatened” or “endangered” are protected by the Endangered Species Act (“ESA”).  This law prohibits any activities that could “take” a protected plant or animal or reduce or degrade its habitat area.  We conduct operations on leases in areas where certain species that are listed as threatened or endangered are known to exist and where other species that potentially could be listed as threatened or endangered under the ESA may exist.  We own a non-producing platform in the Gulf of Mexico located in a National Marine Sanctuary.  As a result, we are subject to additional federal regulation, including regulations issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.  Unique regulations related to operations in a sanctuary include prohibition of drilling activities within certain protected areas, restrictions on the types of water and other substances that may be discharged, required depths of discharge in connection with drilling and production activities and limitations on mooring of vessels.

Other statutes that provide protection to animal and plant species and which may apply to our operations include, but are not necessarily limited to, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Coastal Zone Management Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Marine Protection, Research and Sanctuaries Act, the Fish and Wildlife Coordination Act, the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act, the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and the National Historic Preservation Act.  These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit or other authorization before construction or drilling commences and may limit or prohibit construction, drilling and other activities on certain lands lying within wilderness or wetlands.  These and other protected areas may require certain mitigation measures to avoid harm to wildlife, and such laws and regulations may impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from our operations.  The permits required for our various operations are subject to revocation, modification and renewal by issuing authorities.
