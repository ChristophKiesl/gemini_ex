Acquisitions and Joint Ventures
Maison Companies Acquisition
On December 2, 2019, the Company closed its acquisition from 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“PIH”), of PIH’s insurance operations conducted through MIC, MMI and ClaimCor (collectively, “Maison Companies”). The results of operations of the Maison Companies are included herein only from the acquisition date forward.
Refer to Note 3 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report, for additional information regarding the acquisition.
Monarch National Insurance Company 
In March 2015, we organized MNIC and obtained its certificate of authority to write homeowners property and casualty insurance in Florida from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (the “Florida OIR”). We and Crosswinds Investor Monarch LP (“Crosswinds Investor”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Crosswinds Holdings Inc. (“Crosswinds Holdings”), a private equity firm and asset manager, each invested $14.0 million for a 42.4% membership interest (each holding 50.0% of the voting interests in Monarch Delaware). Transatlantic Reinsurance Company (“TransRe”), an international property and casualty reinsurance company, invested $5.0 million for a 15.2% non-voting membership interest in Monarch Delaware. TransRe also provided a loan represented by a six-year promissory note in the principal amount of $5.0 million bearing annual interest of 6.0% payable by Monarch National Holding Company (“Monarch Holding”), the direct parent of MNIC and wholly-owned subsidiary of Monarch Delaware (together with MNIC and Monarch Holding, the “Monarch Entities”). 
On February 21, 2018, we purchased Crosswinds Investor’s 42.4% Class A membership interest and 50.0% voting interest for $12.3 million, and TransRe’s 15.2% non-voting membership interest in Monarch Delaware for $4.4 million. We also repaid the outstanding principal balance and interest due on the $5.0 million promissory note to TransRe. Following the closing, Monarch Delaware and Monarch Holdings were merged into MNIC. With the completion of these transactions, FNIC owns 100% of MNIC.

INSURANCE OPERATIONS AND RELATED SERVICES
Business Strategy
We expect that in 2021 we will advance our enterprise value through:
•increasing rates on our policies in all states, where warranted, based on claims experience and the increased cost of catastrophe and quota-share reinsurance, with a focus on generating an overall sustainable underwriting profit, irrespective of competitive pricing pressures within the markets where we operate, in all cases subject to required regulatory approvals;
•continuing to non-renew, within all relevant regulatory parameters, policies that no longer meet our underwriting and/or profitability standards as we continuously update our view of risk based on emerging trends and information; 
•applying rigorous underwriting standards on all new and renewal business, even if that limits growth in our Florida book of business, due to the challenging claims environment;
•continued, controlled growth in our non-Florida markets;
•focusing on operational efficiencies to reduce expenses in conjunction with our continued investment in, and use of, technology;
•leveraging MNIC by developing and implementing a plan to expand upon MNIC’s pricing and product offerings in 2021 to increase market share in the risk-adjusted portion of the Florida homeowners market;
•enhancing our property analytical metrics, such as an increased geographical dispersion of risks, while managing our underwriting appetite, whether new or renewal, to ensure a balanced book of business;
•maintaining our commitment to provide high quality customer service to our agents and insureds;
•continued focus of our marketing efforts by retaining key personnel and utilizing multiple distribution strategies;
•offering competitive compensation to our agents to place quality business with our companies;
•continuing with our comprehensive catastrophe reinsurance programs to reduce our exposure to risks;
•continuing our execution of the strategic review process initiated by our board of directors, as announced on November 4, 2020, which could result in, among other things, changes in our strategy or operations, a strategic business combination or other possible transactions, possible joint ventures or dispositions of assets, or continuing to execute on our current business plan; and
•optimizing the free cash flow generated by our managing general agencies and other insurance services businesses.
Refer to Note 18 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report, for information regarding recent developments. The Company will use the net proceeds of approximately $15.2 million from its March 15, 2021 sale of the common stock for general corporate purposes, including to provide additional liquidity in its holding company to be available for future capital contributions to its insurance company subsidiaries, if necessary. This offering was part of our ongoing execution of the strategic review process initiated by the Company’s Board of Directors announced in November 2020. 
Overview of Insurance Lines of Business
Homeowners Property and Casualty Insurance
FNIC, MIC and MNIC underwrite homeowners insurance in Florida and FNIC and MIC also underwrites homeowners insurance in Louisiana and Texas, while FNIC also underwrites homeowners in South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi. Homeowners insurance generally protects an owner of real and personal property against covered causes of loss to that property. As of December 31, 2020, the total homeowners policies in-force was 361,000, of which 207,000 were in Florida and 154,000 were outside of Florida. As of December 31, 2019, the total homeowners policies in-force was 374,000, of which 241,000 were in Florida and 133,000 were outside of Florida. 
Florida
Our homeowners insurance products provide maximum dwelling coverage of approximately $3.6 million, with the aggregate maximum policy limit being approximately $6.3 million. We currently offer dwelling coverage “A” up to $4.0 million with an aggregate total insured value of $6.5 million. We continually review and update these limits. The approximate average premium on the policies currently in-force is $2,100, as compared with $1,940 for 2019. The typical deductible is either $2,500 or $1,000 for non-hurricane-related claims and generally 2% of the coverage amount for the structure for hurricane-related claims.
Premium rates charged to our homeowners insurance policyholders are continually evaluated to assure that they meet the expectation that they are actuarially sound and produce a reasonable level of profit (neither excessive, inadequate or discriminatory). Premium rates 
-- 


in Florida and other states are regulated and approved by the respective states’ office of insurance regulation. We continuously monitor and seek appropriate adjustment to our rates in order to remain competitive and profitable.
Through MIC, we have assumed Florida policies through the state-run insurer Citizens Property Insurance Corporation ("Citizens").
The following are our recent approved rate actions that we have taken across our three insurance subsidiaries:
•In late 2019, FNIC applied for a reinsurance-related statewide average increase of 2.8% for Florida homeowners multiple-peril insurance policies only, which was approved by the Florida OIR, and became effective for new polices on January 15, 2020 and effective for renewal policies on March 15, 2020.
•In 2019, FNIC applied for a statewide average rate increase of 3.6% for Florida dwelling fire insurance policies, which was approved by the Florida OIR, and became effective for new and renewal policies on June 1, 2019. Also in 2019, FNIC applied for a reinsurance-related statewide average rate increase of 4.1% for Florida dwelling fire insurance policies, and became effective for new policies on February 25, 2020 and for renewal policies on April 1, 2020.
•In 2020, FNIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 7.4% for Florida homeowners multiple-peril insurance policies, which was approved by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulations ("Florida OIR") and became effective for new and renewal policies on June 15, 2020.
•In 2020, FNIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 14.9% for Florida dwelling fire insurance policies, which was approved by the Florida OIR and became effective for new and renewal policies on July 15, 2020.
•In 2020, FNIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 5.6% for Florida homeowners multiple-peril insurance policies, which was approved by the Florida OIR and became effective for new policies on October 12, 2020 and for renewal policies on November 12, 2020.
•In 2020, FNIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 4.3% for Florida dwelling fire insurance policies, which was approved by the Florida OIR and became effective for new policies on October 12, 2020 and for renewal policies on November 12, 2020.
•Other rate filings have been filed with the Florida OIR and are pending approval in early 2021.
Non-Florida
Our FNIC non-Florida homeowners insurance products, produced through our partnership with SageSure, provide maximum dwelling coverage “A” up to $1.8 million, with the aggregate maximum policy limit being approximately $3.5 million. The approximate average premium on the policies currently in-force is $1,761, as compared with $1,753 for 2019. The typical deductible is either $2,500 or $1,000 for non-hurricane-related claims and generally 2% of the coverage amount for the structure for hurricane-related claims. 
As part of our partnership with SageSure, previously we entered into a profit share agreement, whereby we shared 50% of net profits of this line of business through June 30, 2020, as calculated per the terms of the agreement, subject to limitations, which included limits on the net losses that SageSure could realize. The profit share cost was reflected in commissions and other underwriting expenses on our consolidated statement of operations. Effective July 1, 2020, FNIC entered into a quota-share treaty with Anchor Re, Inc. ("Anchor Re"), an Arizona captive that is an affiliate of SageSure, the non-affiliated managing general underwriter that writes FNIC’s non-Florida homeowners business. The treaty provides 50% quota-share reinsurance protection on claims incurred subsequent to July 1, 2020 on in-force, new and renewal business through June 30, 2021, subject to certain limitations. The treaty arrangement is fully collateralized through Anchor Re. The financial economics of this treaty substantially mirror the 50% profit-sharing arrangement that was previously in place. Thus, this treaty is not expected to have any impact on the pre-tax operating results of the Company, though the components of the combined ratio will be affected by the ceding of premiums, claims and commissions. On November 3, 2020, FNIC increased its cession percentage in this treaty from 50% to 80%, effective December 1, 2020, on claims incurred subsequent to December 1, 2020 on in-force, new and renewal basis.
Our MIC non-Florida insurance products include homeowners insurance, manufactured home insurance and dwelling fire insurance. MIC writes both full peril property policies as well as wind/hail only exposures.
The following are our recent approved rate actions that we have taken across FNIC and MIC:
•In 2020, MIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 14.5% for Texas manufactured home insurance policies, which was approved by the Texas Department of Insurance ("TDI") and became effective for new policies on May 15, 2020 and renewal policies on June 15, 2020.
•In 2020, MIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 15.5% for Texas homeowners voluntary wind-only insurance policies, which was approved by the TDI and became effective for new policies on April 15, 2020 and renewal policies on June 1, 2020.
•In 2020, MIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 9.8% for Texas homeowners takeout wind-only insurance policies, which was approved by the TDI and became effective for new and renewal policies on June 15, 2020.
-- 


•In 2020, FNIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 6.9% for South Carolina homeowners insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new policies on July 16, 2020 and effective for renewal policies on September 1, 2020.
•In 2020, FNIC applied for a statewide-average rate increase of 9.5% for Texas homeowners insurance policies, which was approved by the respective regulatory agency and became effective for new policies on July 16, 2020 and effective for renewal policies on November 16, 2020.
•Additional rate filings have been applied for by FNIC and MIC and are pending to be approved by the respective regulatory agency.
Other Lines of Business
Flood:  FNIC writes flood insurance through the National Flood Insurance Program (“NFIP”). We write the policy for the NFIP, which assumes 100% of the flood risk while we retain a commission for our service. FNIC offers this line of business in Florida, Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, South Carolina and Mississippi. FNIC plans to file an admitted flood endorsement as an alternative to the NFIP program. MIC writes flood insurance through a partnership with Bintech who assumes 100% of the risk, in Louisiana only.
MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION
Our independent agents and general agents have the authority to sell and bind insurance coverage in accordance with procedures established by FNU and MMI. FNU and MMI generally accept all coverage that falls within stated underwriting criteria. For all policies issued, FNU and MMI also have the right, within a period that varies by state between 60 days and 120 days from a policy’s inception, to cancel any policy, upon an advanced notice provided in accordance with statutory specific guidelines, even if the risk falls within our underwriting criteria. We are focusing our marketing efforts on continuing to expand our distribution network while maintaining our commitment to long-term relationships. We market our products and services throughout Florida by establishing relationships with independent agents and general agents, and in other states, through our partnership with SageSure. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals to offer additional insurance products or expand into other states.
We believe that our integrated computer systems, which allow for rapid automated premium quotation and policy issuance by our agents, are key elements in providing quality service to both our agents and insureds for our various lines of business.
LIABILITY FOR LOSS AND LOSS ADJUSTMENT EXPENSE RESERVES
We are directly liable for loss and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) payments under the terms of the insurance policies that are underwritten by our insurance companies. In many cases, there may be a time lag between the occurrence and reporting of an insured loss and our payment of that loss. As required by insurance regulations and accounting rules, we reflect the liability for the ultimate payment of all incurred losses and LAE by establishing a liability for those unpaid losses and LAE for both reported and unreported claims, which represent estimates of future amounts needed to pay claims and related expenses.
When a claim involving a probable loss is reported, we establish a liability for the estimated amount of our ultimate loss and LAE payments. We based our estimate upon such factors as the type of loss, jurisdiction of the occurrence, knowledge of the circumstances surrounding the claim, severity of injury or damage, potential for ultimate exposure, estimate of liability on the part of the insured, past experience with similar claims and the applicable policy provisions.
We also establish a liability on an aggregate basis to provide for incurred but not reported (“IBNR”). The estimates of the liability for loss and LAE reserves are subject to the effect of trends in claims severity and frequency and are continually reviewed. As part of this process, we review historical data and consider various factors, including known and anticipated legal developments, inflation and economic conditions. As experience develops and other data becomes available, these estimates are revised, as required, resulting in an increase or decrease of the existing liability for loss and LAE reserves. Adjustments are reflected in results of operations in the period in which they are made and the liability may deviate substantially from prior estimates.
Among our classes of insurance, the automobile and homeowners liability and claims historically tend to have longer time lapses between the occurrence of the event, the reporting of the claim and the final settlement, than do automobile physical damage and homeowners property claims. These liability claims often involve parties filing suit and therefore may result in litigation. By comparison, property damage claims tend to be reported in a relatively shorter period of time and settled in a shorter time frame with less occurrence of litigation.

REINSURANCE
Reinsurance is used to mitigate the insurance loss exposure related to certain events such as natural and man-made catastrophes, manage overall capital adequacy and protect capital resources. We reinsure (cede) a portion of written premiums on an excess of loss or a quota-share basis in order to limit our loss exposure. To the extent that reinsuring companies are unable to meet their obligations assumed under these reinsurance agreements, we remain primarily liable to our policyholders. 
Reinsurance markets include:
•Traditional local and global reinsurance markets including those in the United States (“U.S.”), Bermuda, London and Europe, accessed directly and through reinsurance intermediaries;
•Capital markets through insurance-linked securities and collateralized reinsurance transactions, such as catastrophe bonds, sidecars and similar vehicles;
•Other insurers that engage in both direct and assumed reinsurance; and
•Other entities, including unrated reinsurance captives, to facilitate the sharing of the financial results of certain programs.
The form of reinsurance that we may choose from time to time will generally depend on whether we are seeking:
•Proportional reinsurance, whereby we cede a specified percentage of premium and losses to reinsurers;
•Non-proportional or excess of loss reinsurance, whereby we cede all or a specified portion of losses in excess of a specified amount on a per risk, per occurrence (including catastrophe reinsurance) or aggregate basis; or
•Facultative contracts that reinsure individual policies.
Significant Reinsurance Contracts
FNIC, MIC and MNIC operate primarily by underwriting and accepting risks for their direct accounts on a gross basis and reinsuring a portion of the exposure on either an individual risk or an aggregate basis to the extent those exceed the desired retention level. We continually evaluate the relative attractiveness of different forms of reinsurance contracts and different markets that may be used to achieve our risk and profitability objectives. Our reinsurance contracts do not relieve FNIC, MIC or MNIC from their direct obligations to the insured. 
While it is not always possible to reinsure every known and unknown risk to our company, an effective reinsurance program substantially mitigates our exposure to potentially significant losses. There is a credit risk exposure with respect to ceded losses to the extent that any reinsurer is unable or unwilling to meet the obligations assumed under the reinsurance contracts. The collectability of reinsurance is subject to the solvency of the reinsurers, interpretation of contract language and other factors. The availability and amount of ceded premiums and losses associated with the acquisition of reinsurance will vary year to year. Our reinsurance program is subject to approval primarily by the Florida OIR and other regulators in states where we do business, and subject to review by Demotech, Inc. (“Demotech”). Demotech provides Financial Stability Ratings (“FSR”) for property and casualty insurance companies throughout the United States.
We are selective in choosing reinsurers and consider numerous factors, the most important of which are the financial stability of the reinsurer or capital specifically pledged to uphold the contract, its history of responding to claims and its overall reputation. In an effort to minimize our exposure to the insolvency of a reinsurer, we evaluate the acceptability and review the financial condition of the reinsurer at least annually with the assistance of our reinsurance broker. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had over 70 reinsurance companies on our program which are required to have at least an “A-” or better rating by A.M. Best Company (“A.M. Best”) or the agreement would need to be fully collateralized. In addition, FNIC has a quota-share reinsurance treaty on a collateralized basis with Anchor Re, which is an affiliate of SageSure that does not have an AM Best rating.
Refer to Note 6 of the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Part II, Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Annual Report, for further information regarding our reinsurance programs.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
As an insurance holding company, the Company relies on its employees to perform a substantial portion of the insurance- and support-related services for our insurance subsidiaries, including policy underwriting, marketing, risk management and claims management. As of December 31, 2020, we had 377 employees. 
The Company considers its employees to be critical to accomplishing its corporate goals, which are focused on providing unparalleled service to its insureds. In addition to providing competitive compensation and benefits, the Company believes that providing a 
-- 


compelling work environment for its employees is important to its success. To that end, the Company provides a variety of employee-focused benefits, including:
•The Company has for the past several years provided eligible employees with opportunities for remote work. Having an existing infrastructure for remote work allowed the Company to seamlessly transition to an entirely remote work environment during the Covid-19 pandemic. The Company provides varied support options for eligible employees, including Company-issued computers and monitors, IT support and flexible scheduling.
•The Company reimburses eligible employees who are required to maintain licenses or certifications as part of their job responsibilities all associated fees to maintain these licenses and certifications, and provides a Company-paid platform for all required continuing education.
•The Company encourages all of its employees to continue their education to improve knowledge, responsibility and growth in their professional careers. The Company has established, for the benefit of its employees, an Education Assistance Program, through which the Company provides stipends to eligible employees for collegiate degree programs and professional industry designations at approved institutions.
•In 2019, the Company adopted an environmental policy to promote social responsibility by integrating environmental concerns into the Company’s business operations. The Company has provided resources and technology to its employees to reduce their use of consumables, including virtual printing and electronic document collaboration, file storage, signature collection and forms. These measures have enabled the Company to substantially reduce its use of paper and printer toner. 
Our business depends on adequate levels of staff to service our new business and policies in force, manage and resolve reported claims, and provide support services to the Company. These support services include technology, human resources, finance and internal audit teams. We anticipate staffing needs and make changes to our staff as needed to meet the needs of our operations and regulatory requirements, and to achieve our service standards to our insureds. We are able to expand our workforce as needed in connection with weather events through relationships with trusted subcontractors. We continue our support of diversity to create an inclusive culture to enhance performance and broaden perspectives. None of our employees are represented by a labor union.
COMPETITION
We face competition from national, regional and residual market insurance companies in the homeowners and flood insurance markets in which we operate. Our competitors include companies that market their products through agents and companies that sell insurance directly to their customers. Large national captive writers may have certain competitive advantages over independent agency writers, including increased name recognition, increased loyalty of their customer base, and reduced policy acquisition costs. Adverse loss experience and increasing catastrophe reinsurance costs in recent years could also potentially disrupt smaller competitors that lack adequate scale.
Three of our larger competitors in Florida currently are Citizens, Universal Property and Casualty Insurance Company, and Heritage Property and Casualty Insurance Company. As the legislatively created insurance company in Florida, Citizens is free of many of the constraints on private carriers, such as minimum surplus, financial ratio requirements, income tax and reinsurance expense. Other states in which we operate have similar mechanisms to provide insurance to consumers who are not able to obtain coverage in the private market.
REGULATION
Overview
Our current insurance operations are subject to the laws and regulations of Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi. We are subject to employment regulations of Florida and potentially to other states in which we may seek to conduct business in the future. The regulations cover all aspects of our business and are generally designed to protect the interests of insurance policyholders, as opposed to the interests of shareholders. Such regulations relate to authorized lines of business, capital and surplus requirements, allowable rates and forms, investment parameters, underwriting limitations, transactions with affiliates, dividend limitations, changes in control, market conduct, maximum amount allowable for premium financing service charges and a variety of other financial and non-financial components of our business. Our failure to comply with certain provisions of applicable insurance laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, any changes in such laws and regulations, including the adoption of consumer initiatives regarding rates charged for coverage, could materially and adversely affect our operations or our ability to expand.
Most states’ laws restrict an insurer’s underwriting discretion, such as the ability to terminate policies, terminate agents or reject insurance coverage applications, and many state regulators have the power to reduce, or to disallow, increases in premium rates. In 
-- 


addition, state laws generally require that rate schedules and other information be filed with the state’s insurance regulatory authority, either directly or through a rating organization with which the insurer is affiliated. The regulatory authority may disapprove a rate filing if it finds that the rates are inadequate, excessive or unfairly discriminatory. Rates, which are not necessarily uniform for all insurers, vary by class of business, hazard covered, and size of risk. Certain states, including Florida, as discussed above, have adopted laws or are considering proposed legislation which, among other things, limit the ability of insurance companies to effect rate increases or to cancel, reduce or non-renew insurance coverage with respect to existing policies, particularly personal automobile insurance.
Most states require licensure or regulatory approval prior to the marketing of new insurance products. Typically, licensure review is comprehensive and includes a review of a company’s business plan, solvency, financial projections, reinsurance, character of its officers and directors, rates, forms and other financial and non-financial aspects of a company. The regulatory authorities may prohibit entry into a new market by not granting a license or by withholding approval.
All insurance companies must file quarterly and annual statements with certain regulatory agencies and are subject to regular and special examinations by those agencies. We may be the subject of additional special examinations or analysis. These examinations or analysis may result in one or more corrective orders being issued by the Florida OIR or Louisiana Department of Insurance ("LDI"). The Florida OIR is working on its regularly scheduled statutory examination of MNIC for the period ending December 31, 2019, which included an examination of FNIC for the same period. Additionally, the LDI is performing its regularly scheduled statutory examination of MIC for the five years ended December 31, 2019. 
Various states routinely require deposits of assets for the protection of policyholders either in those states or for all policyholders. As of December 31, 2020, FNIC, MIC and MNIC held investment securities with a fair value of approximately $11.5 million, as deposits with the state of Florida, Texas, Georgia, South Carolina, Alabama and Mississippi.
On July 1, 2019, Florida legislation to address Assignments of Benefits ("AOB") took effect. AOB is the assignment of benefits for a claim where a service provider agrees to make a repair that may be covered by an insurance policy in exchange for the policyholder's right to sue the insurance carrier directly. AOB has substantially increased over the last few years, leading to material adverse losses, particularly from our Florida homeowners insurance policies, due to inflated claims, attorney's fees and costs. Provisions and limitations in the new legislation are expected to reduce inflated claims as well as offset negative claims trends. Since AOB reform was enacted, the Company has seen a decrease in AOB-related lawsuits. Additionally, incremental adverse non-AOB claim trends are currently offsetting any initial favorable impact of the AOB legislation.
COVID-19 Impact
To slow and limit the COVID-19 outbreak and protect individuals and the health care systems worldwide, local and Federal governments have taken containment actions, including travel restrictions, testing, contact tracing and lockdowns. Companies have required working from home and in many cases laid off employees. These factors among others have caused global financial markets to experience extreme volatility and disruptions to capital and credit markets. In advance of government mandates, we implemented procedures to help reduce the spread of the outbreak, including having most of our employees work remotely, that are intended to prioritize the safety and health of our employees. In addition, we remained focused on the needs of our insureds and independent agents and fulfilling regulatory requirements and guidelines. During 2020, we did not see a material impact of COVID-19 to our operations, financial condition and results. We cannot at this time determine the comprehensive effect of the outbreak for the remainder of 2021. We currently believe, however, that we have limited, if any, exposure to the pandemic based on our product offerings and contractual coverages, although possible actions that our regulators or other governmental or judicial entities may take may materially adversely impact our coverages in both a retrospective and go-forward manner. We continue our focus on maintaining the safety, security and health of all our stakeholders, including policyholders, employees, partner agents, vendors and shareholders, and monitoring the impacts of the pandemic on our operations, financial condition and results. Based on the Company's already existing business continuity plan, which we have implemented to address local catastrophes events, and based on our financial condition and anticipated operating cash flows, we currently expect to continue to meet our working capital and operating expenditure requirements, even if there is further economic downturn from the pandemic.
Insurance Holding Company Regulation
FNHC, as the parent holding company, is subject to laws governing insurance holding companies in Florida where FNIC and MNIC are domiciled or Louisiana where MIC is domiciled. Among other things, these laws: (i) require us to file periodic information with the Florida OIR, including information concerning our capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations; (ii) regulate certain transactions between us and our affiliates, including the amount of dividends and other distributions, the terms of surplus notes and amounts that our affiliates can charge the holding company for services such as management fees or commissions; and (iii) restrict the ability of any one person to acquire certain levels of our voting securities without prior regulatory approval. Any

purchaser of 10% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock will be presumed to have acquired control of FNIC, MIC or MNIC and is required to file an application with the Florida OIR or LDI to obtain approval of such acquisition.
Restrictions in Payments of Dividends by Domestic Insurance Companies
Under Florida law, a domestic insurer may not pay any dividend or distribute cash or other property to its shareholders except out of that part of its available and accumulated capital surplus funds which is derived from realized net operating profits on its business and net realized capital gains. A Florida domestic insurer may not make dividend payments or distributions to shareholders without prior approval of the Florida OIR if the dividend or distribution would exceed the larger of (i) the lesser of (a) 10.0% of its surplus or (b) net income, not including realized capital gains, plus a two-year carryforward, (ii) 10.0% of surplus with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus 25.0% of unrealized capital gains or (iii) the lesser of (a) 10.0% of surplus or (b) net investment income plus a three-year carryforward with dividends payable constrained to unassigned funds minus 25.0% of unrealized capital gains.
Alternatively, a Florida domestic insurer may pay a dividend or distribution without the prior written approval of the Florida OIR: (i) if the dividend is equal to or less than the greater of: (a) 10.0% of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders derived from realized net operating profits on its business and net realized capital gains or (b) the insurer’s entire net operating profits and realized net capital gains derived during the immediately preceding calendar year; (ii) the insurer will have policy holder surplus equal to or exceeding 115.0% of the minimum required statutory surplus after the dividend or distribution; (iii) the insurer files a notice of the dividend or distribution with the Florida OIR at least ten business days prior to the dividend payment or distribution; and (iv) the notice includes a certification by an officer of the insurer attesting that, after the payment of the dividend or distribution, the insurer will have at least 115.0% of required statutory surplus as to policyholders. Except as provided above, a Florida domiciled insurer may only pay a dividend or make a distribution: (i) subject to prior approval by the Florida OIR; or (ii) 30 days after the Florida OIR has received notice of such dividend or distribution and has not disapproved it within such time.
Under Louisiana law, a domestic insurer may not declare or pay any dividend to its stockholders unless its capital is fully paid in cash and is unimpaired and it has a surplus beyond its capital stock and the initial minimum surplus required and all other liabilities equal to fifteen percent of its capital stock, provided that this restriction does not apply when an insurer's paid-in capital and surplus exceeds the minimum required by Louisiana law by one hundred percent or more. No extraordinary dividend or other extraordinary distribution to its shareholders may be made until 30 days after the Louisiana Commissioner of Insurance has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not within that period disapproved the payment, or has approved the payment within the thirty-day period. An extraordinary dividend or distribution includes any dividend or distribution of cash or other property, whose fair market value together with that of other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months exceeds the lesser of (a) 10.0% percent of the insurer's surplus as regards policyholders as of the 31st day of December next preceding; or (b) the net income, not including realized capital gains, for the twelve-month period ending the 31st day of December next preceding, but shall not include pro rata distributions of any class of the insurer's own securities. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extraordinary, an insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out as dividends. This carryforward shall be computed by taking the net income from the second and third preceding calendar years, not including realized capital gains, less dividends paid in the second and immediate preceding calendar years. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an insurer may declare an extraordinary dividend or distribution which is conditional upon regulatory approval. and the declaration shall confer no rights upon shareholders until either the payment is approved or has not been disapproved within the 30 day period referred to above.
No dividends were paid by FNIC or MNIC in 2020, 2019 and 2018, and none are anticipated in 2021. No dividends were paid by MIC since the acquisition date, and none are anticipated in 2021. Although we believe that amounts required to meet our financial and operating obligations will be available from sources other than dividends from our insurance subsidiaries, there can be no assurance in this regard. Further, there can be no assurance that, if requested, the Florida OIR or LDI will allow any dividends to be paid by FNIC, MIC or MNIC to FNHC, the parent company, in the future. The maximum dividends permitted by state law are not necessarily indicative of an insurer’s actual ability to pay dividends or other distributions to a parent company, which also may be constrained by business and regulatory considerations, such as the impact of dividends on surplus, which could affect an insurer’s competitive position, the amount of premiums that can be written and the ability to pay future dividends. Further, state insurance laws and regulations require that the statutory surplus of an insurance company following any dividend or distribution by it be reasonable in relation to its outstanding liabilities and adequate for its financial needs.
While the non-insurance company subsidiaries (FNU and any other affiliate) are not subject directly to the dividend and other distribution limitations, insurance holding company regulations govern the amount that any affiliate within the holding company structure may charge any of the insurance companies for services (e.g., management fees and commissions).

Underwriting and Marketing Restrictions
During the past several years, various regulatory and legislative bodies have adopted or proposed new laws or regulations to address the cyclical nature of the insurance industry, catastrophic events and insurance capacity and pricing. These regulations include: (i) the creation of “market assistance plans” under which insurers are induced to provide certain coverages; (ii) restrictions on the ability of insurers to rescind or otherwise cancel certain policies in mid-term; (iii) advance notice requirements or limitations imposed for certain policy non-renewals; and (iv) limitations upon or decreases in rates permitted to be charged.
National Association of Insurance Commissioners Risk-Based Capital Requirements
In order to enhance the regulation of insurer solvency, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), established risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for insurance companies that are designed to assess capital adequacy and to raise the level of protection that statutory surplus provides for policy holders. These requirements measure four major areas of risk facing property and casualty insurers: (i) underwriting risks, which encompass the risk of adverse loss development and inadequate pricing; (ii) declines in asset values arising from credit risk; (iii) other business risks from investments; and (iv) catastrophe risk. Insurers having less statutory surplus than required will be subject to varying degrees of regulatory action, depending on the level of capital inadequacy. The Florida OIR and LDI, which follows these requirements, could require FNIC, MIC or MNIC to cease operations in the event they fail to maintain the required statutory capital.
Based upon the 2020 and 2019 statutory financial statements for FNIC, MIC and MNIC, statutory surplus exceeded the regulatory action levels established by the NAIC’s RBC requirements.
Based on RBC requirements, the extent of regulatory intervention and action increases as the ratio of an insurer’s statutory surplus to its Authorized Control Level (“ACL”), as calculated under the NAIC’s requirements, decreases. The first action level, the Company Action Level, requires an insurer to submit a plan of corrective actions to the insurance regulators if statutory surplus falls below 200% of the ACL amount. The second action level, the Regulatory Action Level, requires an insurer to submit a plan containing corrective actions and permits the insurance regulators to perform an examination or other analysis and issue a corrective order if statutory surplus falls below 150% of the ACL amount. The third action level, ACL, allows the regulators to rehabilitate or liquidate an insurer in addition to the aforementioned actions if statutory surplus falls below the ACL amount. The fourth action level is the Mandatory Control Level, which requires the regulators to rehabilitate or liquidate the insurer if statutory surplus falls below 70% of the ACL amount. FNIC’s ratio of statutory surplus to its ACL was 303% and 324% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. MNIC’s ratio of statutory surplus to its ACL was 736% and 1,129% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. MIC's ratio of statutory surplus to its ACL was 348% and 306% as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Industry Ratings Services
Third-party rating agencies assess and rate the ability of insurers to pay their claims. The insurance industry uses financial strength ratings to assess the financial strength and quality of insurers. Ratings are based upon criteria established by the rating agencies and reflect evaluations of each insurer’s profitability, debt and cash levels, customer base, adequacy and soundness of reinsurance, quality and estimated market value of assets, adequacy of reserves and management. Ratings are also based upon factors of concern to agents, reinsurers and policyholders and are not directed toward the protection of investors, such as purchasers of our common stock.
As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, FNIC, MIC and MNIC are rated by Demotech as “A” (“Exceptional”), which is the third of seven ratings, and defined as “Regardless of the severity of a general economic downturn or deterioration in the insurance cycle, insurers earning an FSR of “A” possess “Exceptional” financial stability related to maintaining surplus as regards to policyholders.” Demotech’s ratings are based upon factors of concern to agents, reinsurers and policyholders and are not primarily directed toward the protection of investors. Our Demotech rating could be jeopardized by factors including adverse development and various surplus related ratio exceptions.
