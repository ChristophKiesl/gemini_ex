Rights to such intellectual property, when acquired by us, are usually exclusive and the agreements require us to pay the licensor a royalty on our net sales of the item. These license agreements, in some cases, also provide for advance royalties and minimum guarantees to maintain technical rights and exclusivity.
 
GasPT® 
 Through an exclusive licensing contract with DNV GL, CUI Global owns exclusive rights to manufacture, sell and distribute a gas quality inferential measurement device designed by DNV GL on a worldwide basis, now marketed as the GasPT. The Company has minimum commitments, including royalty payments, under this licensing contract.
 
The GasPT, is a low-cost solution for measuring natural gas quality. The customary method for determining the properties of Natural Gas has traditionally been Gas Chromatography (GC). This time-tested methodology is a versatile and historically established technology, however, its conservative format has rooted a number of issues and problems. GasPT’s unique combination of features enables it to eliminate the anachronisms found in traditional gas properties analyzers to provide:

When connected to a natural gas system GasPT provides a fast, accurate, close to real time measurement of the physical properties of the gas, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content. From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising five components: methane, ethane, propane, nitrogen, and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD), and compression factor (Z). An ISO, International Organization for Standardization, is a documented agreement containing technical specifications or other precise criteria to be used consistently as rules, guidelines or definitions of characteristics to ensure that materials, products, processes and services are fit for their purpose.
 
This innovative technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom, the Polish Oil & Gas Company Department of Testing and Calibration in Warsaw, NOVA Chemical/TransCanada in Canada, the Pipeline Research Counsel International (PRCI) in the US, ENGIE (the French energy giant), and NMi & The International Organization of Legal Metrology (‘‘OIML’’). There is no equivalent product competition. There are instruments like gas chromatographs (‘‘GC’’) that technically can be considered competition, but they are slow, complicated to use and as much as five times the installed price of the GasPT.
 
VE Technology®
 During the year ended 2019, Orbital held exclusive worldwide rights to manufacture, sell, design, and otherwise market the VE-Probe, VE sample system, VE thermowell and VE Technology® from its United Kingdom-based inventor, EnDet Ltd. The agreement, which included certain royalty commitments and provided Orbital exclusive and sole control of all technology related to its revolutionary GasPT natural gas metering systems.  On January 1, 2020, Orbital Gas Systems purchased the VE Technology related intellectual property for 1.5 million British Pounds, approximately $2 million dollars. The acquisition of the VE Technology intellectual property requires no ongoing royalties or other fees, providing CUI Global full control of the technology.
 
The VE sampling probe and sample system are designed for the representative measurement of calorific value and trace elements such as moisture, H2S and mercury faster, more simply and more efficiently. VE sample systems are simple, optimized systems to deliver representative samples to any analyzer with no dead volume, threaded connections or components in the sample pathway.

GasPTi - combined GasPT and VE Technology Solution
 The GasPTi, combines the two patented technologies of GasPT and VE Technology which provides a completely re-engineered approach to Natural gas sampling and analysis. Through the combination of the fast and accurate measurement of the physical properties of Natural Gas utilizing the GasPT technology with the equally unique VE Technology that can provide a gas sample from a high-pressure transmission line in less than two seconds, Orbital has created the GasPTi metering system.
 
The GasPTi metering system can accurately provide nearly real-time data to the natural gas operator in a total cycle-time of less than five seconds. It provides this analysis at a fraction of the installation cost of current technology with none of the associated maintenance, carrier gas, calibration gas, or other ancillary costs associated with traditional technology.
 
The GasPTi is a complete, compact, low cost, integrated solution that can be flange mounted directly to the pipeline or onto a nearby wall or post to provide continuous measurement, requiring no carrier or calibration gases or maintenance. By design, GasPTi removes the need for expensive conditioning equipment, filters, pressure and flow control systems, long heated sample lines and a large cabinet/cubicle with HVAC with few hazardous areas limitations (certified for Zone 1 applications) and no specially trained personnel required for installation or technical support required onsite. The GasPT technology measures and analyzes the VE gathered samples, calculating thermal conductivity, speed of sound and CO2 in the natural gas, providing end users the Calorific Value need to control their systems. Typical appliatons for GasPTi include:
 

• | Analysis of Natural Gas in power plants for quality control and turbine optimization;

BioMethane
 From its inception Orbital has been involved in the control of BioMethane, or Renewable Natural Gas to grid. In fact our background in environmental and renewables analysis goes back more than 30 years to protecting basic landfill gas generators.
 
BioMethane gas (produced wherever organic material is decaying) can be, and is a significant source of environmentally-friendly, carbon neutral energy throughout the world. The specific advantages of BioMethane as a source of energy is that it uses already-existing pipeline infrastructure to quickly and efficiently deliver energy to the end-user, who, in most cases, is already connected to the grid.

Competitive Business Conditions
 The natural gas inferential metering device, the GasPT along with our VE Technology, competes in a mature industry with established competitors. There are significant investments being made globally into the natural gas extraction and transportation infrastructure. Our natural gas quality measurement system is a comparably low-cost solution to measuring natural gas quality as compared to our best competition. It can be connected to a natural gas system to provide a fast, accurate, close to real-time measurement of the physical properties, such as thermal conductivity, speed of sound and carbon dioxide content. From these measurements it infers an effective gas mixture comprising five components: methane, ethane, propane, nitrogen and measured carbon dioxide and then uses ISO6976 to calculate the gas quality characteristics of calorific value (CV), Wobbe index (WI), relative density (RD) and compression factor (Z). This technology has been certified for use in fiscal monitoring by Ofgem in the United Kingdom and ARERA in Italy. There is no equivalent product competition. There are instruments like gas chromatographs that are technically competition, but they are slower and more complicated to use and as much as five times the installed price of the GasPT system. Our integrated solutions and services focused on the natural gas and LNG industries face significant competition from local as well as multinational competitors.
