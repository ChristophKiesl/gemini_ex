ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

Energy Focus, Inc. and its subsidiaries engage in the design, development, manufacture, marketing, and sale of energy-efficient lighting systems. We operate in a single industry segment, developing and selling our energy-efficient light-emitting diode (“LED”) lighting products into the military maritime market, and general commercial markets. Recently, we have aligned our resources and focused our efforts on the sale of our LED lighting products, in particular our military and commercial tubular LED (“TLED”) lines of products, into targeted vertical markets. Our goal is to become a trusted leader in the LED lighting retrofit market by replacing fluorescent lamps in institutional buildings and high-intensity discharge (“HID”) lighting in low-bay and high-bay applications with our innovative, high-quality TLED products.

In order to focus on this business opportunity, we have exited non-core businesses. In 2013, we sold our pool lighting products division. During 2014, we shifted our focus away from the turnkey solutions business operated through our subsidiary, Energy Focus LED Solutions, LLC, which had historically incurred lower gross margins. We completed all outstanding solutions-based projects in the first quarter of 2015 and fully exited this business as of September 2015. In August 2015, we sold our United Kingdom subsidiary, Crescent Lighting Limited (“CLL”). As a result of exiting the turnkey solutions, CLL, and the pool products business, we have eliminated all net sales and expenses associated with both businesses from the Consolidated Statements of Operations and have reported the net loss as discontinued operations. Please refer to Note 3, “Discontinued Operations,” for more information on our disposition of these businesses.

The Company was founded in 1985 as Fiberstars, Inc., a California corporation, and reincorporated in Delaware in November 2006. In May 2007, Fiberstars, Inc. merged with and became Energy Focus, Inc., also a Delaware corporation. Our principal executive offices are located at 32000 Aurora Road, Suite B, Solon, Ohio 44139. Our telephone number is 440.715.1300. Our website address is www.energyfocus.com. Information on our website is not part of this Annual Report.

Our industry

We are committed to developing and bringing our high-quality, energy-efficient, long-lived and mercury-free LED, and particularly TLED, products to our targeted military maritime and commercial markets to replace existing linear fluorescent lamps in general purpose lighting applications and HID lamps in low-bay and high-bay lighting applications, which we believe represent a dominant portion of the LED lighting market and energy savings potential. According to the Department of Energy (“DOE”) research report, “Energy Saving Forecast of Solid-State Lighting in General Illumination Applications,” published in September 2016, the linear fixture and low and high-bay submarkets combined represent 80 percent and 92 percent of the 2015 general illumination energy consumption in the commercial and industrial sectors, respectively.
The DOE report also estimated that the LED penetration of all general illumination installed base at the end of 2015 was approximately six percent, and the LED penetration rates of the linear fixture and low and high-bay installed bases were only at three percent and six percent, respectively. Therefore, we believe there is a significant growth opportunity for our business as the lighting market continues its transition to LED lighting, driven by constant and rapid technological improvements, utility and government incentives, rising sustainability standards, and emerging regulatory requirements surrounding energy efficiency.
As the efficiency and cost of LED lighting continue to improve, we believe that market adoption will accelerate, particularly in commercial and industrial applications, where energy usage for lighting is the highest. The DOE report forecasted LED penetration rates of all general illumination, linear fixture, and low and high-bay installed bases to rise rapidly in the coming years to reach 30 percent, 16 percent, and 38 percent, respectively, by the end of 2020, and to reach 59 percent, 47 percent, and 68 percent, respectively, by the end of 2025.

Our products

We produce, source, and/or market a wide variety of LED lighting technologies to serve our primary end markets, including the following:

Military maritime LED lighting products to serve the U.S. Navy and allied foreign navies: 

• | Military Intellitube®;


• | Military globe lights;


• | Military berth lights; and

• | expand selectively into geographical markets.

Targeted vertical markets
We are focusing on markets where the economic benefits and technical specifications of our lighting product offerings are most compelling. To do so, we are currently targeting specific vertical and geographic segments within two markets: military maritime and commercial. 
Over the past three years, our military maritime business primarily consisted of sales of our military Intellitube® product, as the U.S. Navy embarked on a fleet-wide LED retrofit project and we achieved substantial growth in this market during 2014 and 2015. Sales of our products to the U.S. Navy or distributors for the U.S. Navy slowed considerably and were approximately 43 percent of total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, compared to approximately 80 percent of total net sales for the year ended December 31, 2015. Through December 31, 2016, we believe approximately 35 percent of the Navy’s potentially replaceable fluorescent tubes have been retrofitted with our military Intellitube® product.
The competitive landscape began to change in late 2016 with opportunities for lower cost structures, and we are no longer the only qualified provider for the U.S. Navy for this product. Due to our expectations as to how this will impact our sales and the current supply with our distributors, we are not presently expecting sales of significance of our military Intellitube® product going forward. As a result, we have made corresponding adjustments to our related equipment and inventory values and our restructuring actions undertaken in 2017 reflect the continued repositioning of our business to focus on other sales opportunities.
We are continuing to diversify our military maritime business, as in addition to retrofit LED products, we were recently awarded our first win for LED fixtures in new ship construction. In early 2016, we saw expanded sales beyond the U.S. Navy into foreign navies, the military sealift command, U.S. Coast Guard, commercial shipping companies, and military bases.
In the commercial market, we are currently targeting the following verticals in the United States: healthcare, education, industrial, and national retail.
In healthcare, we have been working with an increasing number of hospital systems to introduce our products and demonstrate our technology. Given the 24/7 lighting requirements of hospital systems and their acute attention to minimizing a building’s adverse impact on human health, we believe the quality, performance, and value of our products are particularly attractive. We are expanding our sales efforts in the healthcare vertical, which is currently our primary targeted vertical market, to increase penetration. In 2015, we announced a supply agreement with a major northeast Ohio hospital system to retrofit the system’s main campus. 
According to the 2012 DOE report, “2010 U.S. Lighting Market Characterization,” there were approximately 151 thousand healthcare buildings occupying 3.7 billion square feet of space in the U.S. In addition, according to the “Energy Efficient Lighting for Commercial Applications” report published by Navigant Research in the fourth quarter of 2014, the number of lamps per square feet in healthcare facilities to meet lighting requirements is three percent, which we believe translates into approximately 110 million fluorescent sockets to be retrofitted.
In education, we are gaining traction and have received orders to retrofit school districts, as well as colleges and universities, in various states. In addition, we are working to build awareness and adoption of our LED lighting technology in schools initially within our current geographic markets. As we advocate for the benefits of LED lighting in schools, both in terms of energy-efficiency and in creating a healthy, flicker-free learning environment, we believe additional opportunities to penetrate the market will arise. 
According to the 2012 DOE report, there were approximately 454 thousand educational buildings occupying 11.6 billion square feet of space in the U.S. Furthermore, according to the 2014 report by Navigant Research, the number of lamps per square feet in educational facilities to meet lighting requirements is two percent, which we believe translates into approximately 230 million fluorescent sockets to be retrofitted.

We are also in the early stages of our efforts in the industrial and national retail vertical markets, which are large addressable markets and provide an attractive opportunity for us. In the industrial market in particular, due to the usage of HID lighting, the energy savings that can be achieved by switching to our LED products could be substantial and we believe we have attractive product offerings in this space.
According to the 2012 DOE report, there were approximately 455 thousand industrial buildings occupying 9.8 billion square feet of space and 772 thousand retail buildings occupying 13.1 billion square feet of space in the U.S. Additionally, according to the 2014 report by Navigant Research, the number of lamps per square feet in industrial and retail facilities to meet lighting requirement is three percent and four percent, respectively, which we believe translates into approximately 290 million and 520 million fluorescent sockets to be retrofitted, respectively.
Sales and marketing

Our products are sold through a combination of direct sales employees, electrical and lighting contractors, and distributors.
During 2015 and 2016, we sold the majority of our products for the U.S. Navy through distributor and sales representative arrangements. Until the third quarter of 2015, our primary distributor was LED Lighting Solutions Global, LLC (an affiliate of Energy Management Products, LLC) (“LLS”), which now serves as a sales representative with respect to our U.S. Navy business and a distributor for foreign navies and the U.S. Navy Military Sealift Command. In the third quarter of 2015, we entered into exclusive distribution agreements for 2016 with Atlantic Diving Supply, Inc. (“ADS”) and LLS, under which ADS and LLS purchase our products under minimum commitment requirements for supply to the U.S. Navy, and to foreign navies and the U.S. Navy Military Sealift Command, respectively. Sales of our products for the U.S. Navy through ADS were $11.3 million during 2016, or 36 percent of our net sales for the period. Total sales of our products for the U.S. Navy were $13.4 million, or 43 percent of our net sales for the period. The remainder of our sales of products for the U.S. Navy in the year ended December 31, 2016 were made pursuant to an indefinite duration, indefinite quantity (“IDIQ”) supply contract we were awarded in 2011. This IDIQ contract expired on August 1, 2016. Our exclusive distributor agreement with ADS continues through March 31, 2017, at which point we expect ADS to have remaining inventory. Our sales representative agreement with LLS ended in November 2016, but our distribution agreement continues until November 2017.
Within the commercial market, we continue to focus on direct corporate accounts, general contractors, and lighting retrofit companies (“LRCs”) especially in the healthcare, education, industrial, and retail verticals. We intend to continue to expand our business development capabilities, sales organizations, and geographic markets to support our efforts in these areas.

Concentration of sales

In 2016, sales of our products to the U.S. Navy or to distributors for the U.S. Navy accounted for approximately 43 percent of net sales from continuing operations. Customers accounting for greater than 10 percent of our net sales from continuing operations included ADS, which accounted for approximately 36 percent, and one of the largest global healthcare systems located in Northeast Ohio, which accounted for approximately 11 percent. No other customers accounted for greater than 10 percent of our net sales.
As previously discussed, due to developments during the fourth quarter of 2016, we expect no sales of the military Intellitube® product for the U.S. Navy in 2017 and limited future sales thereafter.
Competition

Our LED lighting products compete against a variety of lighting products, including conventional light sources such as compact fluorescent lamps and HID lamps, as well as other TLEDs and full fixture lighting products. Our ability to compete depends substantially upon the superior performance and lower lifecycle cost of our products. Principal competitors in our markets include large lamp manufacturers and lighting fixture companies based in the U.S., as well as TLED manufacturers mostly based in Asia, whose financial resources may substantially exceed and cost structure may be well below ours. These competitors may introduce new or improved products that may reduce or eliminate some of the competitive advantage of our products. We anticipate that the competition for our products will also come from new technologies that offer increased energy efficiency, lower maintenance costs, and/or advanced features. We compete with LED systems produced by large lighting companies such as Royal Philips, CREE, Inc., Osram Sylvania, and GE, Inc., as well as, smaller manufacturers or distributors such as LED Smart and Revolution Lighting Technologies. Some of these competitors offer products with performance characteristics similar to those of our products. For example, we are no longer the only company whose LED products are certified for the retrofit of U.S. Navy vessels and competing products may be available at a lower cost.

Manufacturing and suppliers
We produce our lighting products and systems through a combination of internal manufacturing and assembly at our Solon, Ohio facility, and sourced finished goods. Our internal lighting system manufacturing consists primarily of final assembly, testing, and quality control. We have worked with several vendors to design custom components to meet our specific needs. Our quality assurance program provides for testing of all sub-assemblies at key stages in the assembly process, as well as testing of finished products produced both internally and sourced through third parties.
Manufacturing costs are managed through the balance of internal production and an outsourced production model for certain parts and components, as well as finished goods in specific product lines, to a small number of vendors in various locations throughout the world, primarily in the United States, Taiwan, and China. In some cases, we rely upon a single supplier to source certain components, sub-assemblies, or finished goods. We continually attempt to improve our global supply chain practices to satisfy client demands in terms of quality and volumes, while controlling our costs and achieving targeted gross margins.
Product development

Product development is a key area of operating focus and competitive differentiation for us. Our product development team is dedicated to developing and designing leading LED lighting products, and in 2015, we opened a product development and quality control center in Taiwan.

Gross product development expenses for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 were $3.7 million, $3.0 million, and $1.7 million respectively. As we previously announced, in 2014 we curtailed our efforts on bidding on research contracts and grants in order to focus our resources exclusively on projects and contracts that support LED technologies.

Intellectual property

We have a policy of seeking to protect our intellectual property through patents, license agreements, trademark registrations, confidential disclosure agreements, and trade secrets as management deems appropriate. We have approximately 10 patents that we consider key to our current product lines. Additionally, we have various pending United States patent applications, and various pending Patent Cooperation Treaty patent applications filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization that serve as the basis for national patent filings in countries of interest. Our issued patents expire at various times through July 2032. Generally, the term of patent protection is twenty years from the earliest effective filing date of the patent application. There can be no assurance; however, that our issued patents are valid or that any patents applied for will be issued, and that our competitors or clients will not copy aspects of our lighting systems or obtain information that we regard as proprietary. There can also be no assurance that others will not independently develop products similar to ours. The laws of some foreign countries in which we sell or may sell our products do not protect proprietary rights to products to the same extent as the laws of the United States.

Insurance

All of our properties and equipment are covered by insurance and we believe that such insurance is adequate. In addition, we maintain general liability and workers’ compensation insurance in amounts we believe to be consistent with our risk of loss and industry practice.
Employees

At December 31, 2016, we had 131 full-time employees, 7 of whom were located in Taiwan and 124 in the United States. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.

Business segments

During the third quarter of 2015, we completed the exit of our turnkey solutions business and reported the historical results of that business as discontinued operations. We currently operate in a single business segment that includes the marketing and sale of commercial and military maritime lighting products. Our products are sold primarily in North America through a combination of direct sales employees, independent sales representatives, and distributors.
