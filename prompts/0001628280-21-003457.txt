Item 1. Business
General
Envestnet, through its subsidiaries, is transforming the way financial advice and wellness are delivered. Its mission is to empower advisors and financial service providers with innovative technology, solutions and intelligence to make financial wellness a reality for everyone. Envestnet has been a leader in helping transform wealth management, working towards its goal of building a holistic financial wellness ecosystem to improve the financial lives of millions of consumers.
Over 106,000 advisors and more than 5,100 companies, including 17 of the 20 largest U.S. banks, 47 of the 50 largest wealth management and brokerage firms, over 500 of the largest registered investment advisers (“RIAs”) and hundreds of internet services companies, leverage Envestnet technology and services that help drive better outcomes for enterprises, advisors and their clients.
Through a combination of platform enhancements, partnerships and acquisitions, Envestnet uniquely provides a financial network connecting technology, solutions and data, delivering better intelligence and enabling its customers to drive better outcomes. 
Envestnet, a Delaware corporation originally founded in 1999, serves clients from its headquarters based in Chicago, Illinois, as well as other locations throughout the United States, India and other international locations. 
Segments
Envestnet is organized around two primary, complementary business segments. Financial information about each business segment is contained in Part II, Item 8, “Note 19—Segment Information”. Our business segments are as follows:
•Envestnet Wealth Solutions – a leading provider of unified wealth management software and services to empower financial advisors and institutions.
•Envestnet Data & Analytics – a leading data aggregation and data intelligence platform powering dynamic, cloud-based innovation for digital financial services.
Envestnet Wealth Solutions Segment
Envestnet Wealth Solutions empowers financial advisors at broker-dealers, banks and RIAs with the tools they require to deliver holistic wealth management to their end clients. In addition, the firm provides advisors with practice management support so that they can grow their practices and operate more efficiently. At the end of 2020, Envestnet Wealth Solutions’ platform assets grew to approximately $4.6 trillion in more than 13.4 million accounts overseen by more than 106 thousand advisors. 
Services provided to advisors include: financial planning, risk assessment tools, investment strategies and solutions, asset allocation models, research, portfolio construction, proposal generation and paperwork preparation, model management and account rebalancing, account monitoring, customized fee billing, overlay services covering asset allocation, tax management and socially responsible investing, aggregated multi‑custodian performance reporting and communication tools, plus data analytics. We have access to a wide range of leading third‑party asset custodians.
We offer these solutions principally through the following product and service suites:
•Envestnet | Enterprise – provides an end-to-end open architecture wealth management platform, through which advisors can construct portfolios for clients. It begins with aggregated household data which then leads to a financial plan, asset allocation, investment strategy, portfolio management, rebalancing and performance reporting. Advisors have access to over 21,000 investment products. Envestnet | Enterprise also offers data aggregation and reporting, data analytics and digital advice capabilities to customers.
•Envestnet | Tamarac™ provides leading trading, rebalancing, portfolio accounting, performance reporting and client relationship management software, principally to high‑end RIAs.

•Envestnet | MoneyGuide provides leading goals-based financial planning solutions to the financial services industry. The highly adaptable software helps financial advisors add significant value for their clients using best-in-class technology with enhanced integrations to generate financial plans.
•Envestnet | Retirement Solutions (“ERS”) offers a comprehensive suite of services for advisor-sold retirement plans. Leveraging integrated technology, ERS addresses the regulatory, data, and investment needs of retirement plans and delivers the information holistically.
•Envestnet | PMC®, or Portfolio Management Consultants (“PMC”) – provides research and consulting services to assist advisors in creating investment solutions for their clients. These solutions include nearly 4,700 vetted third party managed account products, multi-manager portfolios, fund strategist portfolios, as well as over 900 proprietary products, such as quantitative portfolios and fund strategist portfolios. PMC also offers portfolio overlay and tax optimization services.
As the tables below indicate, Envestnet Wealth Solutions has experienced steady and significant growth over the last several years. We believe this growth is attributable to secular trends in the wealth management industry, the uniqueness and comprehensiveness of our products, as well as acquisitions. Periodically clients have chosen to change the way they pay for our solution, whereby they switch from an asset-based pricing model to a subscription-based model, which has increased our subscription-based metrics. 
The following charts show growth in the number of advisors, accounts and assets supported by Envestnet Wealth Solutions, distinguishing those metrics between assets under management or administration (“AUM/A”) and subscription:

Envestnet Data & Analytics Segment
Envestnet Data & Analytics is a leading data aggregation and data intelligence platform. As an artificial intelligence (“AI”) and data specialist, Envestnet Data & Analytics gathers, refines and aggregates a massive set of end-user permissioned transaction level data, and combines them with financial applications, reports, market research analysis, and application programming interfaces (“APIs”) for its customers.
Over 1,400 financial institutions, financial technology innovators and financial advisory firms, including 15 of the 20 largest U.S. banks, subscribe to the Envestnet Data & Analytics platform to underpin personalized financial apps and services for over 35 million paid subscribers.
Envestnet Data & Analytics serves two main customer groups: financial institutions (“FI”) and financial technology innovators, which we refer to as Yodlee Interactive (“YI”) customers.
•The Financial Institutions group provides customers with secure access to open APIs, end-user facing applications powered by our platform and APIs (“FinApps”), and reports. Customers receive end user-permissioned transaction data elements that we aggregate and cleanse. Envestnet Data & Analytics also enables customers to develop their own applications through its open APIs, which deliver secure data, money movement solutions, and other functionality. FinApps can be subscribed to individually or in combinations that include personal financial management, wealth management, credit card, payments and small-medium business solutions. They are targeted at the retail financial, wealth management, small business, credit card, lenders, and other financial services sectors. These FinApps help consumers and small businesses simplify and manage their finances, review their financial accounts, track their spending, calculate their net worth, and perform a variety of other activities. For example, Yodlee Expense and Income Analysis FinApp helps consumers track their spending, and a Payroll FinApp from a third party helps small businesses process their payroll. The suite of reports is designed to supplement traditional credit reports by utilizing consumer permissioned aggregated data from over 17,000 sources, including banking, investment, loan, and credit card information.
•The Yodlee Interactive group enables customers to develop new applications and enhance existing solutions. These customers operate in a number of sub-vertical markets, including wealth management, personal financial management, small business accounting, small business lending and authentication. They use the Envestnet Data & Analytics platform to build solutions that leverage our open APIs and provide access to a large end user base. In addition to aggregated transaction-level account data elements, we provide YI customers with secure access to account verification, money movement and risk assessment tools via our APIs. We play a critical role in transferring innovation from financial technology innovators to financial institutions. For example, YI customers use Envestnet Data & Analytics applications to provide working capital to small businesses online; personalized financial management, planning and advisory services; e-commerce payment solutions; and online accounting systems for small businesses. We provide access to our solutions across multiple channels, including web, tablet and mobile.
Both FI and YI channels benefit customers by improving end-user satisfaction and retention, accelerating speed to market, creating technology savings and enhancing their data analytics solutions and market research capabilities. End users receive better access to their financial information and more control over their finances, leading to more informed and personalized decision making. For customers who are members of the developer community, Envestnet Data & Analytics solutions provide access to critical data and payments solutions, faster speed to market and enhanced distribution.
We believe that our brand leadership, innovative technology and intellectual property, large customer base, and unique data gathering and enrichment provide us with competitive advantages that have enabled us to grow.
Market Opportunity
The wealth management industry has experienced significant growth in terms of assets invested by retail investors in the past several years. According to the Federal Reserve, U.S. household financial assets totaled approximately $98 trillion as of September 30, 2020, representing a sizeable wealth management opportunity. According to Boston Consulting Group's Global Wealth Report 2020, North American wealth could potentially grow by approximately 2.0% - 3.7% each year between 2019 and 2024, which would take wealth from $100 trillion in 2019 to $110 - $120 trillion by 2024. Based on data from Cerulli Associates, as of September 30, 2020, investable assets comprised 49% of overall U.S. household financial assets in 2019, advisor-directed assets totaled $22.7 trillion and advisors had discretion over 59% of managed account assets.

In the next 5-10 years, we believe the wealth management industry will continue to consolidate with fewer firms and fewer advisors managing more assets, making scale and operational efficiency increasingly important. This will require firms to integrate technology into all areas of their business. 
The following trends are impacting Envestnet’s business and creating a large and growing market opportunity for technology‑enabled investment solutions and services like ours:
•Financial Wellness: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, there is increased focus on financial wellness. The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted investors’ savings and planning goals across all wealth and age tiers. The pandemic has also highlighted the need for advice. According to a study from Northwestern Mutual, only 35% of employers have financial wellness programs in place for their employees, so there is significant opportunity for growth here.
•Ease of Access: As investors are demanding more integrated solutions across their financial lives combined with a simpler, more personal experience with which they interact with their technology providers, wealth management providers will need to prioritize making interactions easy, fast, comprehensive and safe as a positive client experience helps to retain current clients and attract new clients. According to a 2019 InvestmentNews Advisor Technology Study, top-performing advice firms evaluate their technology more frequently and focus more on the impact that technology has on productivity and profitability.
•Sharing of Data: Ecosystem collaboration, which is characterized by a seamless exchange of data and resources, is enabling financial services firms to augment their overall capabilities. Traditional financial services firms and FinTech players have complementary strengths, so collaboration leads to benefits for each partner and the end client. The power of an ecosystem is that it brings together a diverse group of people—consumers, product manufacturers, advisors—to create a network where value can be created and distributed at scale.
•Underserved segments: Underserved segments present a growth opportunity to wealth management firms. In the U.S., 69% of households have less than $100 thousand in investable assets. Another 19% of households have between $100 and $500 thousand in investable assets. Historically, these segments did not represent attractive target markets to broker-dealers and RIAs. With today’s technology, it is possible for wealth management firms to serve these segments, which constitute a market opportunity that exceeds $7 trillion. 
Business Model
Envestnet’s business model lends itself to a high degree of recurring and predictable revenues. Envestnet provides asset-based, subscription-based and professional services on a business-to-business-to-consumer basis to financial services clients, whereby customers offer solutions based on our platform to their end users. On a business-to-business basis, we deliver an open platform to customers and third-party developers through an open API framework. We believe that a number of characteristics contribute to the success of our business model, including:
•Favorable trends with respect to growth in fee-based assets and need for advanced technology; 
•Recurring and resilient revenue base; and
•Strong customer retention.
Our revenues are generated in the following manners:
Asset-based recurring revenues
Asset-based recurring revenues primarily consist of fees for providing customers continuous access to platform services through the Company’s uniquely customized platforms. These platform services include investment manager research, portfolio diagnostics, proposal generation, investment model management, rebalancing and trading, portfolio performance reporting and monitoring solutions, billing and back office and middle-office operations and administration and are made available to customers throughout the contractual term from the date the customized platform is launched. 
The asset-based fees the Company earns are generally based upon variable percentages of assets managed or administered on our platforms. The fee percentage varies based on the level and type of services the Company provides to its customers, as well as the values of existing customer accounts. The values of the customer accounts are affected by inflows or outflows of customer funds and market fluctuations.
In approximately 75% of asset‑based fee arrangements, customers are billed at the beginning of each quarter based on the market value of customer assets on our wealth management platforms as of the end of the prior quarter, providing for a high 
Table of Contents

degree of revenue visibility in the current quarter. Revenue may fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on changes in asset values, fee rates on those asset values and asset flows. 
Subscription-based recurring revenues
Subscription-based recurring revenues primarily consist of fees for providing customers continuous access to the Company’s platform for wealth management and financial wellness. The subscription-based fees generally include fixed fees and or usage-based fees.
Subscription fees vary based on the scope of technology solutions and services being used, and are priced in a variety of constructs based on the size of the business, number of users or number of accounts, and in many cases can increase over time based on the growth of these factors.
Despite this potential variance, we believe that Envestnet’s subscription fees are also highly predictable because they are generally established in multi‑year contracts providing longer‑term visibility regarding that portion of total revenues.
Professional Services and Other
Envestnet also generates revenue from professional services for client onboarding, technology development and other project related work.
 Growth Strategy
Envestnet intends to increase revenue and profitability by continuing to pursue the following strategies:
•Add new enterprise clients;
•Increase our advisor base;
•Extend the account base within a given advisor relationship;
•Expand the services utilized by each advisor or enterprise client, including the cross selling of services across Envestnet’s business lines where applicable;
•Continue to invest in our technology platforms and data analytics capabilities; and
•Continue to pursue strategic transactions and other relationships.
Technology Platforms
Our technology platforms feature a three‑tier architecture integrating a web‑based user interface, an application tier that houses the business logic for all of the platforms’ functionality and SQL Server databases. The application tier resides behind load balancers which distribute the workload demands across our servers. We believe our technology design allows for significant scalability.
Envestnet currently undergoes an annual SSAE 16 SOC 2 Type II audit to validate the continued operation of our internal controls on three of its main technology platforms; the Unified Managed Platform, Yodlee Platform and Tamarac platforms. The SOC reports confirm design and operating effectiveness of internal controls. We maintain multiple redundancies, back up our databases and safeguard technologies and proprietary information consistent with industry best practices. We also maintain a comprehensive business continuity plan and company‑wide risk assessment program that is consistent with industry best practices and that complies with applicable regulatory requirements.
We have historically made significant investments in platform development in order to enhance and expand our technology platforms and expect to continue to make significant investments in the future. In the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we incurred technology development costs totaling approximately $72,120, $59,850 and $52,840, respectively. Of these costs, we capitalized approximately $55,000, $34,000 and $24,000, respectively, as internally developed software. We expect to continue focusing our technology development efforts principally on adding features to increase our market competitiveness, enhancements to improve operating efficiency, address regulatory demands and reduce risk and client‑driven requests for new capabilities.
Our proprietary web‑based platforms provide financial advisors with access to investment solutions and services that address in one unified, centrally‑hosted platform, based on our knowledge of the industry, the widest range of front‑, middle‑ and back‑office needs in our industry. The “open architecture” design of our technology platforms provide financial advisors with flexibility in terms of the investment solutions and services they access, and configurability in the manner in which the 
Table of Contents

financial advisors utilize particular investment solutions and services. The multi‑tenant platform architecture ensures that this level of flexibility and customization is achieved without requiring us to create unique applications for each client, thereby reducing the need for additional technology personnel and associated expenses. In addition, though our technology platforms are designed to deliver a breadth of functions, financial advisors are able to select from the various investment solutions and services we offer, without being required to subscribe to or purchase more than what they believe is necessary.
Our data aggregation platform collects a wide variety of end user-permissioned transaction-level data from over 17,000 sources, including banking, investment, loan and credit card information, and puts this data in a common repository. Envestnet Data & Analytics has developed robust proprietary technology and processes and established relationships that allows us to curate these data sources and expand our access to new data sources. Over 60% of this data is collected through structured feeds from our FI customers and other FIs. These structured feeds, which consist of either batch files pushed to us or real-time access, provide this critical data efficiently and at scale. Where we do not have direct connections, we capture data using our proprietary information-gathering techniques.
Beyond collecting data, our data aggregation platform performs a data refining process and augments the data with additional information from a variety of other sources. We enrich the data with a proprietary twelve-step process, adding such elements as categorization and merchant identification for bank or credit card account data and security identification, classification and normalization for investment data. As our platform usage grows and is exposed to more users and use cases, the system benefits from machine learning algorithms to better normalize, categorize and process large amounts of data, allowing our network to become more effective, efficient and valuable to our customers. Utilizing this enhanced data, including consolidated data from within our FI customers and account data regarding accounts at other FIs, our data intelligence organizes, analyzes and presents it in a manner that helps our customers offer personalized solutions that enable their consumers to achieve better financial outcomes.
Our analytics platform provides a highly scalable cloud-based environment that supports a cost effective and secure way of handling very large data sets, permitting us to develop and test new machine learning algorithms and transform these data sets using the resulting models. The results of the computations can be accessed interactively, as files, or via API access through our data aggregation platform.
Customers
•Financial advisors that are working alone or as part of financial advisory firms. Our principal value proposition aimed at financial advisors working alone or as part of financial advisory firms is that our technology platforms allow them to compete effectively with financial advisors employed by large financial institutions. Envestnet can provide these advisors with access to as many or more of the investment solutions and services that are typically available to financial advisors working at the largest firms.
•Enterprise clients in wealth management. We provide enterprise clients with customized, private‑labeled technology platforms that enable them to support their affiliated financial advisors with a broad range of investment solutions and services. Our contracts with enterprise clients establish the applicable terms and conditions, including pricing terms, service level agreements and basic platform configurations. 
•Financial institutions. We serve global banks through financial applications. Envestnet Data & Analytics Retail Banking solution is a set of innovative FinApps providing consumers with a clear picture and greater insight into their financial lives. It enables customers to consolidate all their financial account information in one place, giving them a better handle on their money. Personalized tools allow them to manage, and meet their financial goals – which in turn makes them more engaged and more loyal customers.
•Other financial technology providers. We work with a variety of firms who provide technology to the financial services industry. We provide FinApps, personal financial management tools and data aggregation capabilities to companies in online lending, e-commerce and payments, digital advice and wealth management and other web development firms.

Sales and Marketing
Our sales teams are organized based on our customers.
•Our advisor-facing sales teams are field sales professionals supported by internal consultants, organized regionally, responsible for supporting firms and investment advisors who are customers of Envestnet. They help advisors create investment proposals, navigate Envestnet’s wealth management platform and facilitate new business. Our Platform Consulting Group helps advisors utilize Envestnet’s wealth management platform effectively and efficiently. They are subject matter experts on advisor managed programs, unified managed accounts (“UMA”), proposal guidance and site navigation. They provide consulting services to a number of large clients. Envestnet’s PMC Consulting team of investment professionals provide a variety of portfolio and investment management consulting services to RIAs and broker-dealer advisors using Envestnet’s wealth management platform. 
•Enterprise Consultants are the main point of contact for enterprise clients with respect to day-to-day platform matters as well as contractual and pricing efforts. This includes support for advisors and firm management with regard to the overall relationship. The enterprise consultant is essentially the client’s relationship manager who serves as the liaison between the firm and Envestnet.
•We have a direct sales and pre-sales team servicing the leading global financial institutions. The FI sales team is divided geographically. Each regional sales and pre-sales team is responsible for acquiring new FI customers. Within the North America region, direct sales and pre-sales representatives are further divided into teams that focus on specific accounts, on a named-account basis, depending on size, location, product specialization and/or brand. These sales teams are supported by customer advocacy teams who specialize in customer account management and expansion. Together, sales, pre-sales and customer advocacy representatives are responsible for growing our customer relationships in terms of account penetration (cross-selling additional products and services into the same or additional groups within a FI) and expanding use of existing products and services (increasing usage).
•We have a direct sales and technical pre-sales team covering financial technology providers in each region. Each regional sales and technical pre-sales team is responsible for acquiring new customers and channel partners. From time to time, we assign specific accounts based upon sales or domain expertise. These teams are supported by a customer success and developer relations team who specialize in customer API integration, and account management and expansion, including services to our channel partners. Together, sales, technical pre-sales, customer success and developer relations representatives are responsible for growing our direct customer and channel partner relationships in terms of account penetration and API usage.
Our marketing efforts are focused on initiatives to drive global company, brand and solutions awareness and significant lead generation and sales acceleration across our whole business. These initiatives include educating the market about our solutions, achieving recognition as the industry leader through awards, speaking engagements, thought leadership articles, data trends and metrics and high profile interviews. We use advertising and public relations to communicate our message to our target markets.
To implement our marketing efforts, we generally employ paid print and online advertisements in a variety of industry publications, as well as promotions that include e-blast campaigns and sponsored webinars for financial advisors. We also partner with independent broker‑dealers on direct mail campaigns targeting such firms’ financial advisors to describe the investment solutions and services that we offer, produce brochures and presentations for financial advisors to use with their clients and we create internet pages or sites to promote our investment solutions and services. Envestnet Data & Analytics employs a variety of integrated sales and marketing initiatives, including hosted demand generation webinars, sponsorship and partnership of key industry conferences, customer and developer-focused events and programs, incubator efforts and other high-profile activities designed to demonstrate thought leadership and engage new audiences in actionable and measurable ways. We employ many tools, including web and social properties, integrated creative campaigns consisting of online advertising, digital content marketing, direct mail and blogs. Envestnet Data & Analytics also supports industry analyst relations and media relations activities. In addition, our marketing efforts develop FI customer best practices tools to drive deeper consumer activity and engagement.
Competition
Our competitors offer a variety of products and services that compete with one or more of the investment solutions and services provided through our technology platforms; although, based on our industry experience, we believe that none offers a more comprehensive set of products and services than we do.
Table of Contents

Within Envestnet Wealth Solutions, we compete on the basis of several factors, including:
•The breadth and quality of investment solutions and services to which we provide access through our technology platform;
•The number of custodians that are connected through our technology platforms;
•The price of our investment solutions and services;
•The ease of use of our technology platforms; and
•The nature and scope of investment solutions and services that each wealth management provider believes are necessary to address their needs.
Our Envestnet Data & Analytics group competes with other financial technology companies, credit bureaus and data and analytic providers. Based on our industry experience, we do not believe any other single company in the data aggregation and data intelligence space offers a diverse, comprehensive platform with features such as ours.
Within Envestnet Data & Analytics, we compete on the basis of several factors, including:
•Reputation;
•Cloud-based delivery model;
•Data aggregation capability;
•Access to data through direct structured data feeds to FI’s;
•Scale (size of customer base and level of user adoption);
•Security;
•Time to market;
•Breadth and depth of application functionality user experience;
•Access to third-party applications;
•Ease of use, ease of integration, flexibility and configurability; and
•Competitive pricing.
We believe that we compete favorably with respect to all of these factors. 
Regulation
Overview
The financial services industry is among the most extensively regulated industries in the United States. We operate investment advisory and mutual fund advisory businesses, each of which is subject to a specific regulatory scheme, including regulation at the federal and state level, as well as regulation by self-regulatory organizations and non-U.S. regulatory authorities. In addition, we are subject to numerous laws and regulations of general application.
Our subsidiaries Envestnet Asset Management, Inc. (“EAM”), Envestnet Portfolio Solutions, Inc. (“EPS”), FDX Advisors, Inc., Quantitative Research Group, Inc. (“QRG”), and ERS operate investment advisory businesses. These subsidiaries are registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) as “investment advisers” under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Advisers Act”), and are regulated thereunder. They may also provide fiduciary services as defined in Section 3(21)(A)(ii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), including acting as an “investment manager” (as defined in Section 3(38) of ERISA). As described further below, many of our investment advisory programs are conducted pursuant to the non-exclusive safe harbor from the definition of an “investment company” provided for under Rule 3a-4 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). If Rule 3a-4 were to cease to be available, or if the SEC were to modify the rule or its interpretation of how the rule is applied, it could have a substantial effect on our business. EAM serves as the investment adviser to two mutual funds. Mutual funds are registered as “investment companies” under the Investment Company Act. The Advisers Act, Investment Company Act and ERISA, together with related regulations and interpretations of the SEC and the Department of Labor (the “DOL”), impose numerous obligations and restrictions on investment advisers and mutual funds, including recordkeeping requirements, limitations on advertising, disclosure and reporting obligations, prohibitions on fraudulent activities and the requirement that conflicts of interest be monitored, mitigated, and disclosed. The fiduciary obligations of investment advisers to their clients require advisers to, among other things, consider the suitability of the investment products and advice they provide, seek “best execution” for their clients’ securities transactions, conduct due diligence on third-party products offered to clients, consider the appropriateness of the adviser’s fees and provide extensive and ongoing disclosure to clients. The SEC is authorized to institute proceedings and impose fines and sanctions for violations of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act and has the power to restrict or prohibit an investment adviser from carrying on its business in the event that it fails to comply with 
Table of Contents

applicable laws and regulations. Although we believe we are in compliance in all material respects with the requirements of the Advisers Act and the Investment Company Act and the rules and interpretations promulgated thereunder, our failure to comply with such laws, rules and interpretations could have a material adverse effect on us.
Envestnet Data & Analytics is examined on a periodic basis by various regulatory agencies. For example, Envestnet Data & Analytics is a supervised third-party technology service provider subject to multi-agency supervisory examinations in a wide variety of areas based on published guidance by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council. These examinations include reviews of Envestnet Data & Analytics’ management, acquisition and development activities, support and delivery, IT and disaster preparedness and business recovery planning. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (the “OCC”) is the agency in charge of these examinations.
Either as a result of direct regulation or obligations under customer agreements, our subsidiaries are required to comply with certain provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, related to the privacy of consumer information and may be subject to other privacy and data security laws because of the solutions we provide. In addition, numerous regulations continue to be proposed and promulgated that necessitate the implementation of additional controls of companies like ours.
Our subsidiaries are subject to various federal and state laws and regulations that grant supervisory agencies, including the SEC, DOL and OCC, broad administrative powers. In the event of a failure to comply with these laws and regulations, the possible sanctions that may be imposed include the suspension of individual employees, limitations on the permissibility of our regulated subsidiaries and our other subsidiaries to engage in business for specified periods of time, censures, fines and the revocation of registration as an investment adviser, as applicable. Additionally, the securities laws and other regulations applicable to us and our subsidiaries provide for certain private rights of action that could give rise to civil litigation. Any litigation could have significant financial and non-financial consequences including monetary judgments and the requirement to take action or limit activities that could ultimately affect our business.
Many of the laws and regulations to which our subsidiaries are subject are evolving, unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions, and ensuring compliance with them is difficult and costly. We continually develop improvements to our existing products and services as well as new products and services. Many of these improvements or new products and services may implicate regulations to which we may not already be subject or with which we may not have experience. New laws or regulations, or changes in existing laws or regulations or interpretations of existing laws and regulations, including those relating to the activities of our investment adviser, broker-dealer and financial institution clients, may occur that could increase our compliance and other costs of doing business, require significant changes to our systems or solutions or substantially change the way that our clients operate their businesses. Compliance with any new or revised regulatory requirements may divert internal resources, be expensive and time-consuming and may require increased investment in compliance functions or new technologies. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations to which we and our subsidiaries are subject could result in fines, penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our business, or federal or state actions, any of which could significantly harm our reputation, and could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.
Investment Advisory Program Conducted Under Rule 3a-4
Under the Investment Company Act, an issuer that is engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities may be deemed an “investment company,” in which case the issuer may be subject to registration requirements and regulation as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. In order to provide assurance that certain discretionary investment advisory programs would not be considered investment companies, the SEC adopted Rule 3a-4 under the Investment Company Act, which provides a non-exclusive safe harbor from the definition of an investment company for programs that meet the requirements of the rule. We conduct and support the following programs pursuant to the Rule 3a-4 safe harbor:
•Separately managed accounts;
•Unified managed account portfolios;
•Mutual fund portfolios and exchange-traded fund portfolios; and
•Advisor as portfolio manager.
Human Capital Resources
We value the creative ideas, innovative thinking and broader perspectives that come with a diverse workforce. We believe that engaging, developing and supporting our employees is critical to our mission of providing the technology, solutions and intelligence to make financial wellness a reality for everyone. 
Table of Contents

At Work
Our employee population is primarily located in the United States and India. Our global workforce increased 1% in 2020 from approximately 4,190 in 2019 to approximately 4,250 full-time employees, with 39% and 38%, respectively, based in the United States. No employee is represented by a collective bargaining agreement.
In Our Community
The Envestnet Cares program empowers our employees to engage in their local communities with paid time off for volunteer activities, charitable donation matching, and partnerships with several non-profit organizations. U.S. employees receive a match up to $3 thousand annually. In 2019, our regular charitable giving was approximately $850 and in 2020, our regular charitable giving was approximately $1,170. We also made a one-time $5,000 charitable contribution in 2020 in memory of our former chief executive officer.
In 2020, our employees received three paid Volunteer Days for use when volunteering for a non-profit organization of their choice during the workweek, or as part of a Company-organized volunteering event. In 2019, our employees volunteered 4,712 hours through 66 in-person, company-sponsored events in 7 cities. In 2020, our employees volunteered 127 hours and participated in 4 company-sponsored events in 3 cities prior to March 13, 2020. We cancelled in-person events for the rest of the year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Equity, Diversity & Inclusion (“EDI”)
We are committed to providing an equitable, diverse and inclusive work culture, where everyone is treated fairly, feels a sense of belonging and value, and has the resources and support they need to achieve their full potential. As part of this commitment, in 2020 we created a new position, Manager of Diversity & Inclusion, focused solely on our efforts to foster a sense of community and belonging for all. This includes partnering with employees as well as independent organizations to facilitate an array of EDI programs, affinity groups, internships, and mandatory training for all U.S. based employees.

Learning & Development
Through our global Learning Management System, employees have access to over 2,300 learning courses, including management and skills development; and U.S. based employees receive reimbursement for training, certifications, and degrees. During 2020, our employees completed over 32,000 courses.
The Envestnet Institute on Campus is a program for motivated university students designed to bridge the gap between academic knowledge and the application of this knowledge in the Wealth and Asset Management industries. Many of our employees have graduated from this key Learning and Development program.

as well as additional family medical coverage, an internet stipend, and free transportation home from late shifts. Envestnet supports our employees’ physical and mental health with a no-cost Wellness Program; and provides legal, financial, and work-life solutions with our Employee Assistance Program.
Pandemic Response
We care about our colleagues and anyone who enters our workplace. Our continuing focus on the health and well-being of our colleagues has enabled us to preserve business continuity without sacrificing our commitment to keeping our employees and workplace visitors safe during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our Pandemic Response Team, which includes our CEO, President, and other senior members of management, meet weekly to assess the risks and status for each office location and to ensure business continuity.
All of our employees began working remotely in March 2020, and the majority of our offices remain closed both in the U.S. and India, with limited employee presence based on business requirements. Our Pandemic Response Team has established protocols to ensure the safety of our employees while working remotely and upon return to our office locations. This includes mandatory COVID-19 training, advanced cleaning protocols for all offices, modified work spaces and communication planning to provide employees with regular updates regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our operations.
During the pandemic, our employees also received additional benefits to support home-office set-up (U.S. and India), parental stipend (U.S.), additional health insurance (India), and utility stipend (India), as well as multiple initiatives and organized activities to support mental wellness, morale and team-building.
In a recent employee survey, 94% of respondents strongly agreed with the statement, “My organization responded to the Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak in a way that demonstrates care for its employees’ well-being.”
