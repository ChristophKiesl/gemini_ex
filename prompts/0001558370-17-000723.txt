     Item 1 Business
     General
     Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and Subsidiaries (the “Company,” “us,” “we,” or “our”) is an information technology (“IT”) channel company. We distribute software and hardware developed by others through resellers indirectly to customers worldwide. We also resell computer software and hardware developed by others and provide technical services directly to customers in the United States of America (“USA”) and Canada. In addition we operate a sales branch in Europe to serve our customers in this region of the world. We offer an extensive line of products from leading publishers of software and tools for virtualization/cloud computing, security, networking, storage and infrastructure management, application lifecycle management and other technically sophisticated domains as well as computer hardware.
     Wayside Technology Group, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in 1982. Our Common Stock is listed on The NASDAQ Global Market under the symbol “WSTG”. Our main web site address is www.waysidetechnology.com, and the other web sites maintained by our business include www.lifeboatdistribution.com, and www.techxtend.com.  Reference to these “uniform resource locators” or “URLs” is made as an inactive textual reference for informational purposes only. Information on our web sites should not be considered filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, and is not, and should not be deemed to be, a part of this report.
     The Company operates through two reportable operating segments.  The “Lifeboat Distribution” segment distributes technical software and hardware to corporate resellers, value added resellers (VARs), consultants and systems integrators worldwide.  The “TechXtend” segment is a value-added reseller of software, hardware and services for corporations, government organizations and academic institutions in the USA and Canada. For each of our segments, sales from unaffiliated customers, income and total assets, among other financial information, is presented in Note 9 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
         Competition
     The software market is highly competitive. Pricing is very aggressive in both software distribution and reselling.  The Company expects pricing pressure to continue. The Company faces competition from a wide variety of sources. In the Lifeboat Distribution segment, we compete against much larger broad-line distributors, as well as specialty distributors and, in some cases, the direct sales teams of the vendors we represent also sell directly to the end-customers.  In the TechXtend segment, we also compete against vendors who sell directly to customers, as well as software resellers, superstores, e-commerce vendors, and other direct marketers of software and hardware products. In both segments, some of our competitors are significantly larger and have substantially greater resources than the Company. Many of our competitors compete principally on the basis of price, product availability, customer service and technical support.
     There can be no assurance that the Company can compete effectively against existing competitors or new competitors that may enter the market or that it can generate profit margins which represent a fair return to the Company. In addition, price is an important competitive factor in the personal computer software market and there can be no assurance that the Company will not be subject to increased price competition. An increase in the amount of competition faced by the Company, or its failure to compete effectively against its competitors, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial condition and results of operations.
     The Company competes to attract prospective buyers and in sourcing new products from software developers and publishers, as well as in marketing its current product line to its customers. The Company believes that its ability to offer software developers and IT professionals easy access to a wide selection of the right IT products at reasonable prices with prompt delivery and high customer service levels, along with its good relationships with vendors and suppliers, allows it to compete effectively in acquiring prospective buyers and marketing its current product line to its

customers. The Company competes to gain distribution rights for new products primarily on the basis of its reputation for successfully bringing new products to market and its relationships with software publishers.
     The market for the software products we sell is characterized by rapid changes in technology, user requirements, and customer specifications. The manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand. Software developers and publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users. The continuing evolution of the Internet as a platform in which to conduct e-commerce business transactions has both lowered the barriers for competition and broadened customer access to products and information, increasing competition and reducing prices. From time to time, certain software developers and publishers have instituted programs for the direct sale of large order quantities of software to certain major corporate accounts. These types of programs may continue to be developed and used by various developers and publishers. While some software developers and publishers currently sell new releases or upgrades directly to end users, they have not attempted to completely bypass the distribution and reseller channels. There can be no assurances, however, that software developers and publishers will continue using distributors and resellers to the same extent they currently do. Future efforts by software developers and publishers to bypass third- party sales channels could materially and adversely affect the Company’s business operations and financial conditions.
     In addition, resellers and publishers may attempt to increase the volume of software products distributed electronically through ESD (Electronic Software Distribution) technology, through subscription services, and through on-line shopping services. Any of these competitive programs, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, results of operations and financial condition. For a description of additional risks relating to competition in our industry, please refer to “Item 1.A. Risk Factors”: “We rely on our suppliers for product availability, marketing funds, purchasing incentives and competitive products to sell”, and “The IT products and services industry is intensely competitive and actions of competitors, including manufacturers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business”.
         Products
     An essential part of our ongoing operations and growth plans is the continued recruitment of software publishers for which we can sell their products. The Company offers a wide variety of technology products from a broad range of publishers and manufacturers, such as Bluebeam Software, Dell/Dell Software, erwin, Flexera Software, Hewlett Packard, Infragistics, Intel Software, Lenovo, Micro Focus Microsoft, Mindjet, Samsung, SmartBear Software, SolarWinds, Sophos, StorageCraft Technology, TechSmith, Unitrends, Veeam Software and VMware. On a continuous basis, we screen new products for inclusion in our direct sales portfolio,  and web sites based on their features, quality, price, profit margins and warranties, as well as on current sales trends. The Company predominantly sells software, software subscriptions, and maintenance. Sales of hardware and peripherals represented 10%, 10%  and 7% of our overall net sales in 2016, 2015 and  2014, respectively.     Marketing and Distribution
     We market products through creative marketing communications, including our web sites, local and on-line seminars, webinars, and social media. We also use direct e-mail and printed material to introduce new products and upgrades, to cross-sell products to current customers, and to educate and inform existing and potential customers. We believe that our blend of electronic and traditional marketing and selling programs are important marketing vehicles for software publishers and manufacturers. These programs provide a cost-effective and service-oriented means to market and sell and fulfill software products and meet the needs of users.
     The Company had two customers that each accounted for more than 10% of total sales for 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Software House International Corporation (“SHI”), and CDW Corporation (“CDW”) accounted for 19.6%, and 17.9%, respectively, of consolidated net sales and, as of December 31, 2016, 13.3%, and 23.2%, respectively, of total net accounts receivable. The Company had two customers that each accounted for more than 10% of total sales for 2015. For the year ended December 31, 2015, SHI, and CDW Corporation accounted for 19.0%, and 17.9%, respectively, of consolidated net sales. The Company had three customers that each accounted for

more than 10% of total sales for 2014. For the year ended December 31, 2014, SHI, CDW, and Insight Enterprises, Inc. accounted for 17.4%, 16.4% and 11.0%, respectively, of consolidated net sales. Our top five customers accounted for 48%, 52%, and 52% of consolidated net sales in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. The Company generally ships products within 48 hours of confirming a customer’s order. This results in minimum backlog in the business.
     Sales to customers in Canada represented 7%, 6%, and 7% of our consolidated revenue in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. Sales in Europe and the rest of the world represented 6%, 6%, and 7% of our consolidate revenue in 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. For geographic financial information, please refer to Note 9 in the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
     Customer Support
     We believe that providing a high level of customer service is necessary to compete effectively, and is essential to continued sales and revenue growth. Our account representatives assist our customers with all aspects of purchasing decisions, order processing, and inquiries on order status, product pricing and availability. The account representatives are trained to answer all basic questions about the features and functionality of products. To deal with technical issues, we maintain an in-house technical support staff.     Purchasing and Fulfillment
     The Company’s success is dependent, in part, upon the ability of its suppliers to develop and market products that meet the changing requirements of the marketplace. The Company believes it enjoys good relationships with its vendors. The Company and its principal vendors have cooperated frequently in product introductions and in other marketing programs. As is customary in the industry, the Company has no long-term supply contracts with any of its suppliers. Substantially all of the Company’s contracts with its vendors are terminable upon 30 days’ notice or less. Moreover, the manner in which software products are distributed and sold is changing, and new methods of distribution and sale may emerge or expand. Software publishers have sold, and may intensify their efforts to sell, their products directly to end-users. The Company’s business and results of operations may be adversely affected if the terms and conditions of the Company’s authorizations with its vendors were to be significantly modified or if certain products become unavailable to the Company.
     We believe that effective purchasing from a diverse vendor base is a key element of our business strategy. For the year ended December 31, 2016, Sophos and Solarwinds accounted for 23.1% and 10.8%, respectively of our consolidated purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2015, Sophos was the only individual vendor from whom our purchases exceeded 10% of our total purchases and accounted for 24.2% of our total purchases. For the year ended December 31, 2014, Sophos was the only individual vendor from whom our purchases exceeded 10% of our total purchases and accounted for 14.7% of our total purchases. The loss of a key vendor or group of vendors could disrupt our product availability and otherwise have an adverse effect on the Company.
     In 2016, the Company purchased approximately 96% of its products directly from manufacturers and publishers and the balance from multiple distributors, as compared to 96% and 95% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Most suppliers or distributors will “drop ship” products directly to the customers, which reduces physical handling by the Company. Inventory management techniques, such as “drop shipping” allow the Company to offer a greater range of products without increased inventory requirements or associated risk.
     Inventory levels may vary from period to period, due in part to increases or decreases in sales levels, the Company’s practice of making large-volume purchases when it deems the terms of such purchases to be attractive, and the addition of new suppliers and products. Moreover, the Company’s order fulfillment and inventory control systems allow the Company to order certain products just in time for next day shipping. The Company promotes the use of electronic data interchange (“EDI”) with its suppliers and customers, which helps reduce overhead and the use of paper in the ordering process. Although brand names and individual products are important to our business, we believe that competitive sources of supply are available for substantially all of the product categories we carry.

     The Company operates a distribution facility in Eatontown, New Jersey. 
     Management Information Systems
     The Company operates management information systems on Windows 2008 and Windows 2012 platforms that allow for centralized management of key functions, including inventory, accounts receivable, purchasing, sales and distribution. We are dependent on the accuracy and proper utilization of our information technology systems, including our telephone, web sites, e-mail and fax systems.
     The management information systems allow the Company to monitor sales trends, provide real-time product availability and order status information, track direct marketing campaign performance and to make marketing event driven purchasing decisions. In addition to the main system, the Company has systems of networked personal computers, as well as microcomputer-based desktop publishing systems, which facilitate data sharing and provide an automated office environment.
     The Company recognizes the need to continually upgrade its management information systems to most effectively manage its operations and customer database. In that regard, the Company anticipates that it will, from time to time, require software and hardware upgrades for its present management information systems.
     Trademarks
     The Company conducts its business under various trademarks and service marks including Lifeboat Distribution, TechXtend and International Software Partners. The Company protects these trademarks and service marks and believes that they have significant value to us and are important factors in our marketing programs.     Employees
     As of December 31, 2016 Wayside Technology Group, Inc. and its subsidiaries had 141 full-time employees and 1 part-time employee. The Company is not a party to any collective bargaining agreements with its employees, has experienced no work stoppages and considers its relationships with its employees to be satisfactory.
