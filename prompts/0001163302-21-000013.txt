Item 1. BUSINESS
United States Steel Corporation (U. S. Steel), with operations in the U.S. and Central Europe, is transforming itself into a customer-centric, world-competitive, Best of BothSM steelmaker. By combining the best of the integrated and mini mill steelmaking models, U. S. Steel will deliver unmatched process and product innovation for our customers. Our Best of Both strategy is creating a value proposition that only U. S. Steel is uniquely positioned to offer at scale. We are executing on our strategy by investing where we have distinct cost and capability advantages to be a steel solutions provider for our customers. By offering unparalleled product capabilities and process innovation, including the green steels that our customers are increasingly demanding, we can achieve world-competitive positioning in strategic, high-margin end markets, and deliver high-quality, sustainable, value-added products and innovative solutions. 
As a mini mill steelmaker, we can utilize the sustainable and flexible EAF steelmaking process to meet our customers’ needs while creating a more variable cost structure and reducing our overall capital intensity. As an integrated steel producer we can create the virgin steel to meet some of our customers’ most demanding applications while utilizing the competitive advantage of our fully-integrated iron ore mines.
U. S. Steel has annual raw steel production capability of 22.9 million net tons (17.9 million tons in the United States and 5.0 million tons in Europe). With the acquisition of Big River Steel raw steel production will increase by 3.3 million net tons to a total U. S. Steel and United States capability of 26.2 million and 21.2 million net tons, respectively. U. S. Steel performs a wide range of applied research, development and technical support functions at facilities in Pennsylvania, Michigan, Texas and Slovakia. U. S. Steel supplies customers throughout the world primarily in the automotive, construction, consumer (packaging and appliance), electrical, industrial equipment, service center/distribution, structural tubing and energy (oil country tubular goods (OCTG) and line pipe) markets. According to the worldsteel Association’s latest published statistics, in 2019 U. S. Steel was the third largest steel producer in the United States and the twenty-seventh largest steel producer in the world. U. S. Steel is also engaged in other business activities consisting primarily of railroad services and real estate operations. U. S. Steel is a Delaware corporation established in 1901.
Acquisitions
On December 8, 2020, the Company exercised its option to acquire the remaining equity of Big River Steel. The acquisition closed on January 15, 2021.
Segments
U. S. Steel has three reportable segments: North American Flat-Rolled (Flat-Rolled), U. S. Steel Europe (USSE) and Tubular Products (Tubular). The results of our 49.9% ownership interest in Big River Steel and our railroad and real estate businesses that do not constitute reportable segments are combined and disclosed in the Other Businesses category. Beginning in 2021, we will report the results of Big River Steel in a separate “Mini Mill” segment.
Flat-Rolled
The Flat-Rolled segment includes the operating results of U. S. Steel’s integrated steel plants and equity investees in North America (except for Big River Steel, which is included in Other Businesses) involved in the production of slabs, strip mill plates, sheets and tin mill products, as well as all iron ore and coke production facilities in the United States. These operations primarily serve North American customers in the automotive, appliance, construction, container, transportation and service center markets. 
Flat-Rolled has aggregate annual raw steel production capability of 17.0 million tons produced at our Gary Works, Mon Valley Works, Great Lakes Works and Granite City Works facilities. Raw steel production was 9.3 million tons in 2020, 11.4 million tons in 2019 and 11.9 million tons in 2018. Raw steel production averaged 55 percent of capability in 2020, 67 percent of capability in 2019 and 70 percent of capability in 2018.
European Operations
The USSE segment includes the operating results of U. S. Steel Košice (USSK), U. S. Steel’s integrated steel plant and coke production facilities in Slovakia, and its subsidiaries. USSE conducts its business mainly in Central and Western Europe and primarily serves customers in the European transportation (including automotive), construction, container, appliance, electrical, service center, conversion and oil, gas and petrochemical markets. USSE produces and sells slabs, strip mill plate, sheet, tin mill products and spiral welded pipe, as well as refractory ceramic materials.
USSE has annual raw steel production capability of 5.0 million tons. USSE’s raw steel production was 3.4 million tons in 2020, 3.9 million tons in 2019, and 5.0 million tons in 2018. USSE’s raw steel production averaged 67 percent of capability in 2020, 78 percent of capability in 2019 and 100 percent of capability in 2018.
Tubular
The Tubular segment includes the operating results of U. S. Steel’s tubular production facilities and an equity investee in the United States. These operations produce and sell seamless and electric resistance welded (ERW) steel casing and tubing (commonly known as OCTG), and standard and line pipe and mechanical tubing and primarily serve customers in the oil, gas and petrochemical markets. The start-up of the new 1.6 million ton electric arc furnace at Fairfield, Alabama in October 2020 is currently used to feed our 0.9 million ton rounds caster. As a result, the Tubular segment now has annual raw steel production capability of 0.9 million tons. In 2020 raw steel production was 16 thousand tons and averaged 7 percent of capability. Tubular has total production capability of 1.9 million tons. In 2020, Tubular indefinitely idled the Lone Star Tubular Operations and Lorain Tubular Operations thereby effectively reducing on-line tubular production capacity by 790 and 380 thousand tons, respectively. U. S. Steel Tubular Products, Inc. (USSTP), a wholly owned subsidiary of U. S. Steel, continues to design and develop a range of premium and semi-premium connections to address the growing needs for technical solutions for our end users' well site production challenges.

Steel Industry Background and Competition
The global steel industry is cyclical, highly competitive and has historically been characterized by overcapacity.
U. S. Steel's competitive position may be affected by, among other things, differences among U. S. Steel's and its competitors' cost structure, labor costs, environmental remediation and compliance costs, global capacity and the existence and magnitude of government subsidies provided to competitors.
U. S. Steel competes with many North American and international steel producers. Competitors include 1) integrated producers, which, like U. S. Steel, use iron ore and coke as the primary raw materials for steel production, 2) EAF producers, which primarily use steel scrap and other iron-bearing feedstocks as raw materials and 3) slab re-rollers, who purchase mostly imported, but some domestic, semi-finished products and convert them into sheet products. Global steel production increased by 55 million metric tons in 2019 to 1.869 billion metric tons. Furthermore, capacity has continued to increase, with notable changes in 2019 Chinese crude steel production of 996 million metric tons, a 8.3% increase from 2018, and estimated to be more than 76 million metric tons above the apparent crude steel demand in China (source: worldsteel). In addition, other materials, such as aluminum, plastics and composites, compete with steel in several applications.
EAF producers typically require lower capital expenditures for construction of facilities and may have lower total employment costs; however, these competitive advantages may be minimized or eliminated by the cost of scrap when scrap prices are high. Some EAF producers utilize thin slab casting technology to produce flat-rolled products and are increasingly able to compete directly with integrated producers in many flat-rolled product applications previously produced only by integrated steelmakers. Slab re-rollers do not incur the cost of melting steel, their input costs are driven by the market price of slabs.
U. S. Steel provides defined benefit pension and/or other post-employment benefits to approximately 80,000 current employees, retirees and their beneficiaries. Many of our competitors do not have comparable retiree obligations. Participation in U. S. Steel's main defined benefit pension plan was closed to new entrants on July 1, 2003 and benefit accruals for all non-represented participants were frozen effective December 31, 2015. Participation in U. S. Steel’s retiree medical and life insurance programs for United Steelworkers (USW)-represented employees were closed to employees hired or rehired (except in limited circumstances) on or after January 1, 2016. Retiree medical and life insurance benefits for non-represented employees were eliminated for those who retired after December 31, 2017.
We believe that our major North American and many European integrated steel competitors are confronted with substantially similar environmental regulatory conditions and therefore do not believe that our relative position with regard to such competitors will be materially affected by the impact of environmental laws and regulations. However, if future regulations do not recognize the fact that the integrated steel process involves a series of chemical reactions involving carbon that create carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions without linking these emissions to steel scrap as well, our competitive position relative to mini-mills will be adversely impacted. Our competitive position compared to producers in developing nations such as China, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Brazil and India, will be harmed unless such nations require commensurate reductions in CO2 emissions or there are border adjustment tariffs for CO2. Competing materials such as plastics may not be similarly impacted. The specific impact on each competitor will vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of its operating facilities and its production methods. U. S. Steel is also responsible for remediation costs related to former and present operating locations and disposal of environmentally sensitive materials. Many of our competitors, including North American producers, or their successors, that have been the subject of bankruptcy relief have no or substantially lower liabilities for such environmental remediation matters.
In 2021, additional steelmaking capacity is expected to enter the domestic steel market as competitors' growth projects come on-line throughout the year.
Business Strategy
We are executing on our customer-centric strategy to transform U. S. Steel into a world-competitive, Best of Both, steelmaker by combining the best of the integrated steelmaking model with the best of the mini mill steelmaking model. Our strategy will deliver product and process innovation to create unmatched value for our customers while enhancing our earnings profile and delivering long-term cash flow through industry cycles. By offering unparalleled product capabilities, including the green steels our customers are increasingly demanding, we can achieve world-competitive positioning in strategic, high-margin end markets, and deliver high-quality, sustainable, value-added products and innovative solutions. To get to our Best of Both future, we are investing to create distinct cost and capability advantages, enhancing our focus on operational and commercial excellence and promoting technological innovation, so we can deliver an unmatched value proposition to our customers while creating a more variable cost structure, and lowering the capital intensity of the business.
Foundational to our efforts is our belief that we must operate as a principled company committed to our S.T.E.E.L. Principles, outlined in our Code of Ethical Business Conduct. Our core value of safety - the safety of our employees, our environment, our communities and our facilities and equipment - has served us well for much of our history and our commitment to it remains as strong as the products we make every day.
Our strategy is informed by our critical success factors, which are the bedrock of the Best of Both strategy: (1) Move Down the Cost Curve, (2) Win in Strategic Markets, and (3) Move Up the Talent Curve.
We continuously aim to move down the cost curve. We made considerable progress on this critical success factor in 2020. The successful acquisition of Big River Steel is expected to improve our cost position by making our cost structure more variable and reducing the capital intensity of the business. We also successfully completed the construction of the EAF at our Tubular Operations in Fairfield, Alabama and became self-sufficient in our rounds supply. We also made considerable progress and remain on track towards our stated goal of reducing fixed costs by $200 million.
We are focused on winning in strategic markets through a customer-focused business model with an emphasis on creating differentiated, innovative and value-added solutions that will help our customers succeed. As part of this effort, in 2020 we implemented an enhanced operating model and organizational structure to accelerate the company’s strategic transformation and better serve its customers. The realignment of U. S. Steel’s leadership team around more nimble and efficient executive functions, notably to sharpen focus on operational and commercial excellence and promote technological innovation, will enable the company to establish a more competitive cost structure with enhanced capabilities to serve customers in strategic markets.
Core to our strategy is moving up the talent curve. The success of our business is driven by the efforts of our hard-working employees. We know that we must work to identify, attract and retain best-in-class diverse talent. Our goal is to build a pipeline mapping the right people to the right value-driving roles. This includes providing the training and resources they need to succeed and fostering a culture where accountability, fairness and respect are foundational, and high performance and diversity in all its forms are valued and celebrated. This type of environment incentivizes the right behavior and allows for a best talent wins environment to help us achieve our Best of Both strategy. 
U. S. Steel will continue to evaluate potential strategic and organizational opportunities, which may include the acquisition, divestiture or consolidation of assets. Given the cyclicality of our industry, we are focused on strategically maintaining and spending cash, in order to invest in areas consistent with the execution of our Best of Both strategy, such as sustainable steel technologies, and are considering various possibilities, including exiting lines of business and the sale of certain assets, that we believe would ultimately result in greater stockholder value. The Company will pursue opportunities based on its long-term strategy, and what the Board of Directors determines to be in the best interests of the Company's stockholders at the time. In addition, we are bringing Big River Steel’s focused, innovative, and entrepreneurial mindset into the way we do business. By bringing these two world-class workforces together, with a shared values-based culture, we believe we can create significant value across the enterprise.
Strategic Projects and Technology Investments
In October 2019, the Company completed the first step in acquiring Big River Steel in Osceola, Arkansas through the purchase of a 49.9% ownership interest at a purchase price of approximately $700 million in cash, with a call option to acquire the remaining 50.1% within the next four years at an agreed-upon price formula. With the completion of its Phase II expansion in November 2020, Big River Steel operates two technologically advanced EAFs with approximately 3.3 million tons of steel making capacity. On December 8, 2020 the Company announced it exercised its call option to acquire the remaining equity of Big River Steel. The purchase of the remaining interest in Big River Steel closed on January 15, 2021 for approximately $723 million in cash and the assumption of liabilities of approximately $50 million. The successful completion of the acquisition marked a major milestone in our Best of Both strategy. Full ownership of Big River Steel creates North America’s only Best of Both steel technology company by combining leading advanced high-strength steel intellectual property with a technologically advanced and low-greenhouse gas emissions mini mill. 
In May 2019, U. S. Steel announced that it plans to construct a new endless casting and rolling facility at its Edgar Thomson Plant in Braddock, Pennsylvania, and a cogeneration facility at its Clairton Plant in Clairton, Pennsylvania, both part of the Company's Mon Valley Works. This investment in state-of-the-art sustainable steel technology is expected to significantly upgrade the production capability of our lowest liquid steel cost mill in the U.S., while further reducing conversion costs through improved process efficiencies, yield and energy consumption. Since announcement, the Company identified the potential need for additional equipment at the Edgar Thomson steel shop. The Company has amended the environmental permit applications to include a new ladle metallurgy facility (LMF). In addition, the expected capital costs of achieving the Company’s ambitious environmental targets from its future cogeneration facility have increased. The Company expects the total investment for the new endless casting and rolling facility at its Edgar Thomson Plant and cogeneration facility at its Clairton Plant to be at least $1.5 billion, with the expected incremental run-rate EBITDA benefits of approximately $275 million unchanged. The Company purchased certain equipment for this project before delaying groundbreaking in March 2020 in response to COVID-19. In 2021, the Company plans to resume equipment purchases for the project, which will be partially funded from our Export Credit Agreement.
The installation of endless casting and rolling technology will allow differentiated product capabilities to serve strategic markets. In 2020 we announced a delay in the construction of our endless casting and rolling line at Mon Valley Works, but plan to resume equipment purchases in 2021 as we monitor the right time to fully resume the project. With this technology the Mon Valley Works should become the principal source of substrate for the production of the Company's industry-leading XG3TM advanced high strength steel (AHSS), a market leading solution for our customers to improve fuel efficiency. The cogeneration facility, equipped with state-of-the-art emissions control systems at the Company's Clairton Plant, will convert a portion of the coke oven gas 
generated at its Clairton Plant into electricity to power the steelmaking and finishing facilities throughout U. S. Steel's Mon Valley operations. This project, in addition to producing sustainable AHSS, is expected to improve environmental performance, energy conservation and reduce our carbon footprint associated with Mon Valley Works.
In February 2019, U. S. Steel restarted construction of the EAF steelmaking facility at its Tubular Operations in Fairfield, Alabama. The EAF is expected to structurally improve the Company's competitive position and reduce rounds cost by $90 per seamless ton as the Company becomes self-sufficient in its rounds supply. Construction of the EAF was completed in October 2020. Utilization of the EAF will be subject to overall demand in the Tubular business.
The Company expects to invest approximately $550 million, of which approximately 50 percent has already been spent, to upgrade the Gary Works hot strip mill through a series of projects focused on expanding the line's competitive advantages. The Gary Works hot strip mill will further differentiate itself as a leader in heavy-gauge products in strategic markets. The Company has resumed certain capability upgrades in conjunction with planned outages after having delayed upgrades as part of the Company's comprehensive response to impacts from COVID-19. The Company will continue to evaluate the pace and timeline for completing the remaining investments in the Gary Works hot strip mill.
In January 2019, U. S. Steel announced the construction of a new Dynamo line at USSE. The new line, a $130 million investment, has an annual capacity of approximately 100,000 metric tons. Construction on the Dynamo line began in mid-2019 but due to challenging market conditions, has been paused. Upon its completion, the new line would enable production of sophisticated silicon grades of non-grain oriented (NGO) electrical steels to support increased demand in vehicles and generators.
Commercial Strategy
Beginning January 1, 2020, the Company implemented an enhanced operating model and organizational structure to accelerate its strategic transformation and better serve its customers. The new operating model is centered around manufacturing, commercial, and technological excellence. Our former “commercial entity” structure was put into place to deepen understanding of business ownership and our relationships with customers and allowed the Company to identify the technology that would differentiate our products and processes on the basis of cost and/or capabilities. The new enhanced operating model enables us to implement our Best of Both strategy faster by making us a more nimble and technologically superior customer driven company positioned to deliver the benefits of our strategy through the business cycle.
We have successfully produced several grades of green steel using Big River Steel substrate, including our Ultra High Strength Steels (UHSS) and XG3TM advanced high strength steel (AHSS) grades that our customers are increasingly demanding.
Our commercial strategy is focused on providing customer focused solutions with differentiated and value-added steel products, which includes advanced high strength steels such as our newly developed grades of GEN3 steel, coated sheets for the automotive and appliance industries, electrical steel sheets for the manufacture of motors and electrical equipment, both bare and prepainted galvanized and Galvalume® sheets for construction, heavy gauge hot rolled coils used in the production of American Petroleum Institute (API) line pipe used for energy transmission line pipe, tin mill products for the packaging industry and pipe, connections, accessories and rig site services for use in drilling for oil and gas.
We are responsive to our customers' changing needs by developing new steel products and uses for steel that meet the evolving market and regulatory demands imposed upon them. In connection with this commitment, we have research centers in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Košice, Slovakia, and Houston, Texas, as well as an automotive center in Troy, Michigan. The focus of these centers is to develop new products and to collaborate with our customers to better provide innovative solutions to serve their needs.
For automotive markets, we commissioned a first of its kind GEN3 hot dipped galvanize line at our PRO-TEC Coating Company (PRO-TEC) joint venture in 2020, and have embedded application engineers at original equipment manufacturers to demonstrate how to best utilize the highly formable, cost effective material in body design to meet automobile passenger safety requirements while significantly reducing weight to meet future vehicle fuel efficiency standards.
In our tubular markets, we continue development of premium and semi-premium tubular connections designed for our customers that operate in challenging drilling environments. These connections optimize well construction activities and provide outstanding sealing capabilities for onshore and offshore oil and gas drilling in North America. An example is the USS-TALON HTQ™, which was introduced in 2020 for customers that are constructing onshore natural gas and oil wells with long laterals requiring best-in-class torque capacity and optimized well-bore clearances. Please refer to Item I. Business Strategy for further details of related strategies.
Human Capital Management
At U. S. Steel, we are focused on attracting and retaining the top talent needed to support our strategic transformation and meet our customers’ evolving needs as a sustainable steel solutions provider. The support and development of our people is foundational to achieving our Best of Both strategy. We refer to this strategic talent pillar as “Moving Up the Talent Curve.”
Our focus on people extends to our current and future employees. We aim to have an engaged and diverse workforce to promote new ideas and innovation, reflect the communities where we operate, and deliver exceptional customer service. We seek to build an inclusive environment where people feel free to bring their whole selves to work. To achieve the Best of Both strategy, we must have the “Best from All.” More about our focus on people and human capital management can be found in our 2019 Sustainability Report.

Approximate Active Employees as of December 31, 2020

Ethics & Compliance
Our culture is based on our S.T.E.E.L. Principles: Safety First; Trust and Respect; Environmentally Friendly Activities; Ethical Behavior; and Lawful Business Conduct. We expect our employees and members of our board of directors to take personal responsibility to “do what’s right,” and our Code of Ethical Business Conduct serves as the foundation for the actions of our employees and directors. To further ensure that employees understand the Company’s expectations and all applicable rules, we provide formal ethics and compliance training to our employees and have frequent communication with information about key compliance topics, which include messages from senior management underscoring the importance of doing business with integrity. Employees also receive summaries of current events that demonstrate the need to do business lawfully that include reminders of the company’s expectations for all employees. In addition, through our annual policy certification process, employees and directors certify their ongoing compliance with our Code of Ethical Business Conduct.
Employee Health & Safety
At U. S. Steel, we have a long-standing commitment to the safety and health of the men and women who work in our facilities. Every employee deserves to return home safely at the end of every day, and we are working to eliminate all injuries and incidents. In addition, the psychological safety of all employees is important to us. We have combined physical safety and psychological safety into the construct of 360° safety. Ensuring a safe workplace also improves productivity, quality, reliability and financial performance. By making safety and health a personal responsibility, our employees are making a daily commitment to follow safe work practices, look out for the safety of co-workers and ensure safe working conditions for everyone. A “Safety First” mindset is as essential to our success as the tools and technologies we rely on to do business. This past year, we relied on our strong safety culture to ensure the health and safety of our employees during the COVID-19 pandemic, as described below.
Our objective is to attain a sustainable zero harm culture supported by leadership and owned by an engaged and highly skilled workforce, empowered with the capabilities and resources needed to assess, reduce, and eliminate workplace risks and hazards. In support of these objectives, we have developed an enhanced Safety Management System, initiated new safety communication methods and enhanced contractor safety processes. One of our most important safety protocols is our fatality prevention audit program. These proactive assessments of the processes and protocols we have in place, and adherence to them, to avoid fatalities and severe injuries are conducted annually at the enterprise level and more frequently at each of our facilities. We assess our safety performance through a variety of lagging and leading indicators, including OSHA Days Away From Work (DAFW). This measurement allows us to evaluate the frequency of injuries sustained at our facilities requiring an employee to stay at home for more than one day. U. S. Steel has achieved record-safety performance in this measurement in the last several years, routinely achieving performance better than industry benchmarks.
For 2020, we had a corporate DAFW rate of 0.07, which is 0.53 better than the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Iron and Steel benchmark DAFW rate of 0.60.
Inclusion & Diversity
Attracting, developing, and retaining a workforce of talented, diverse people is essential to having high-performing teams that drive results for our Company’s stakeholders. As part of our commitment to cultivating a culture of caring, we have inclusive benefits available for our U.S. non-represented workforce, including expanded parental leave, back-up dependent care, infertility coverage, gender reassignment coverage and healthcare continuation for the families of employees who suffered work-related or military service fatalities. In 2020, U. S. Steel earned a 100 percent score on the Human Rights Campaign’s annual Corporate Equality Index in recognition of our comprehensive and inclusive benefits. We also support several employee resource groups (ERGs) to enhance employee engagement, promote a culture of acceptance, foster diversity in the workplace, and raise awareness related to issues of identity and intersectionality. Our ERGs also provide leadership development, mentorship and networking opportunities for their members.
Talent Development and Retention 
We believe that development and retention of talent is essential to our success, and we seek to provide opportunities for continuous learning and development. All of our employees at a director-level and above have a formal professional development plan that is assessed at least annually. In addition, we proactively measure our attrition rates, and take targeted actions to ensure our highest potential and performing employees are incentivized to remain with the Company. Over the past five years, our regrettable voluntary turnover rate has been at or below 5 percent.
Labor Relations 
Approximately 80 percent of our employees in North America and Slovakia are covered by collective bargaining agreements. We work closely with union representatives to provide safe and productive workplaces that enable our employees to deliver high-quality products and meet the needs of our customers. Our partnership with the United Steelworkers includes not only a commitment to safety programs, but also a common approach to combating the unfairly traded imports that threaten our industry, our company, and ultimately the jobs of our employees.
Impact of COVID-19
The spread of the coronavirus pandemic across the globe significantly impacted global markets and nearly every industry, U. S. Steel included. We quickly recognized the uncertainty and potential severity the pandemic would cause, and implemented our crisis response plan. Overseen by our Board of Directors, and led by our executive team, we implemented a comprehensive and adaptive response to the pandemic focused on protecting lives and livelihoods, preserving cash and liquidity, remaining nimble to execute our strategy and supporting our customers and communities, all in line with our foundational S.T.E.E.L. Principles. Some of the measures we implemented and continue to practice include:
•Issuing weekly communication, including preventive tips, and a dedicated website for employees and their families;
•Providing employees with protective equipment, masks, and sanitizing and cleaning supplies and enhanced cleaning frequency;
•Limiting outside visitors to our facilities, restricting access for non-essential vendors, suppliers and contractors;
•Actively managing physical distancing while at work, including no meetings or gatherings of greater than 10 individuals
•Permitting a majority of our employees in our administrative offices and headquarters to work from home; and
•Intensifying our focus on preserving cash and proactively raised approximately $1.7 billion of incremental capital to support our balance sheet.
Environmental Stewardship
U. S. Steel is committed to effective environmental stewardship. We have implemented and continue to develop business practices that are environmentally effective. We believe part of being a good corporate citizen requires a dedicated focus on how our industry affects the environment. U. S. Steel's environmental expenditures totaled $278 million in 2020, $376 million in 2019 and $350 million in 2018. Overall, environmental compliance expenditures represent approximately 2 percent of U. S. Steel’s total costs and expenses in 2020, 2019 and 2018. For further information, see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Environmental Matters.” We have taken the actions described below in furtherance of that goal. 
We continue to work on the promotion of cost-effective environmental strategies through the development of appropriate air, water and waste laws and regulations at the local, state, national and international levels. We are committed to reducing our emissions and are investigating, creating and implementing innovative, best practice solutions throughout our operations to improve our environmental performance and to manage and reduce energy consumption.
In 2020 alone, U. S. Steel recycled 3.0 million tons of purchased and produced steel scrap. Because of steel’s physical properties, our products can be recycled at the end of their useful life without loss of quality, contributing to steel’s high recycling rate and affordability.
Many of our major production facilities have Environmental Management Systems that are certified to the ISO 14001 Standard. This standard, published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), provides the framework for the measurement and improvement of environmental impacts of the certified facility.
In 2019, we published the Clairton Operating and Environmental Report which will be published annually. While U. S. Steel agreed to publish an annual report as part of the 2019 Allegheny County Health Department Settlement Order and Agreement, we took the opportunity to enhance the report by including detailed descriptions of our operations, our safety and environmental performance and community involvement in order to provide easily accessible information for the public. The Report details our best ever battery combustion stack and fugitive emission performance at Clairton in 2019 and 2020.
By using the blast furnace and coke oven gas generated in our cokemaking and steelmaking activities to power our facilities, we avoided consuming natural gas and other fuels from 2018 to 2020 to heat more than 3.4 million households each year. In 2020, we recycled approximately 3.3 million tons of blast furnace slag and 0.4 million tons of steel slag by selling it for use as aggregate and in highway construction.
Reduction of Greenhouse Gas Emissions
In 2019, as part of our strategy to become the Best of Both in the steel industry, the Company announced its commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions intensity across its global footprint. The Company set a goal to reduce its global greenhouse gas emissions intensity by 20 percent, as measured by the rate of CO2 equivalents emitted per ton of finished steel shipped, by 2030 based on 2018 baseline levels. This target will apply to U. S. Steel’s global operations.
These reductions are equivalent to the amount of CO2 being generated by more than 850,000 average-sized homes each year. By creating targeted carbon reduction initiatives to accelerate our transformation toward a future of sustainable steel, we create value for all stakeholders.
U. S. Steel plans to achieve its greenhouse gas emissions intensity reduction goal through the execution of multiple initiatives. These include the use of EAF steelmaking technology at U. S. Steel’s Fairfield Works and at Big River Steel the first LEED-certified steel mill in the nation. EAF steelmaking relies on scrap recycling to produce new steel products, leveraging the ability to continuously recycle steel. Further carbon intensity reductions are expected to come from the Company’s introduction of state-of-the-art endless rolling and casting technology and construction of a cogeneration facility at its Mon Valley Works, as well as implementation of ongoing energy efficiency measures, continued use of renewable energy sources and other process improvements to be developed.
The carbon intensity reduction target reflects our continued commitment to improvement in production efficiency and the manufacture of products that are environmentally friendly. In addition to a commitment to reduce its own greenhouse gas emissions intensity, U. S. Steel is committed to helping its customers achieve their environmental goals. Our industry-leading 
XG3™ advanced high-strength steel enables automakers to manufacture lighter weight vehicles that meet federal Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards with reduced carbon emissions. As part of our innovation efforts, we continue to look at new steelmaking technologies so that we can produce green steels and further reduce carbon emissions.
Capital Structure and Liquidity
Our primary financial goal is to enhance stockholder value by utilizing our capital structure, liquidity, and financial flexibility to deploy cash to generate stockholder value. Our cash deployment strategy is aligned with our world-competitive, Best of Both strategy and includes: executing on strategic projects and portfolio moves; maintaining a strong balance sheet and a healthy pension plan; and delivering sustainable growth with a focus on core values such as safety and environmental stewardship. Cash deployment is also performed with a customer-centric focus on improving safety, quality, delivery and cost.
Our liquidity supports our ability to satisfy short-term obligations, fund working capital requirements, and provides a foundation to execute key strategic priorities. We are focused on maintaining a strong balance sheet and may proactively refinance or repay our debt from time to time to protect our capital structure from unforeseen external events and re-financing risks.
In 2020, we undertook several steps to support these goals, as well as to mitigate the impact on our business of the COVID-19 pandemic, taken together with the impact of disruptions in the oil and gas industry.
•The Company issued 50 million shares of common stock (par value $1 per share) in an underwritten public offering at a price of $8.2075 per share, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $410 million.
•The Company issued $1.056 billion aggregate principal amount of 12.000% Senior Secured Notes due June 1, 2025 (2025 Senior Secured Notes). The notes were issued at a price equal to 94.665% of their face value. U. S.

Raw Materials and Energy
As an integrated producer, U. S. Steel’s primary raw materials are iron units in the form of iron ore pellets and sinter ore, carbon units in the form of coal and coke (which is produced from coking coal) and steel scrap. As an EAF producer, our primary raw material is scrap. U. S. Steel’s raw materials supply strategy consists of acquiring and expanding captive sources of certain primary raw materials and entering into flexible supply contracts for certain other raw materials at competitive market prices which are subject to fluctuations based on market conditions at the time.
The amounts of such raw materials needed to produce a ton of steel will fluctuate based upon the specifications of the final steel products, the quality of raw materials and, to a lesser extent, differences among steel producing equipment. In broad terms, U. S. Steel consumes approximately 1.4 tons of coal to produce one ton of coke and then it consumes approximately 0.3 tons of coke, 0.3 tons of steel scrap (61 percent of which is internally generated) and 1.3 tons of iron ore pellets to produce one ton of raw steel. At normal operating levels, we also consume approximately 6 mmbtu’s of natural gas per ton produced. While we believe that these estimated consumption amounts are useful for planning purposes, and are presented to give a general sense of raw material and energy consumption related to steel production, substantial variations may occur.
Iron Ore
(a) Includes our share of production from Hibbing through December 31, 2020 and Tilden Mining Company, L.C. (Tilden) to September 29, 2017. U. S. Steel's ownership interest in Tilden was sold on September 29, 2017. The decrease in iron ore production in 2020 was primarily related to the temporary idling of our Keetac facility during part of 2020. The increase in iron ore production in 2017 is primarily related to the restarted production at our Keetac facility which was idled in 2014.
The iron ore facilities at Minntac and Keetac contain an estimated 766 million short tons of recoverable reserves and our share of recoverable reserves at the Hibbing joint venture is 5 million short tons. Recoverable reserves are defined as the tons of product that can be used internally or delivered to a customer after considering mining and beneficiation or preparation losses. Minntac and Keetac’s annual capability and our share of annual capability for the Hibbing joint venture total approximately 24 million tons. Through our wholly owned operations and our share of our joint venture, we have iron ore pellet production capability that exceeds our steelmaking capability in the U.S. 
We sold iron ore pellets in 2020, 2019 and 2018 to third parties. The Company has agreements to supply iron ore pellets to third-party customers over the next several years. 
Substantially all of USSE’s iron ore requirements are purchased from outside sources, primarily Russian and Ukrainian mining companies. Prices are determined in long-term contracts with strategic suppliers or as spot prices negotiated monthly or quarterly. In certain prior years, USSE also received iron ore from U. S. Steel’s iron ore facilities in North America. We believe that supplies of iron ore adequate to meet USSE’s needs are available at competitive market prices.
Coking Coal
All of U. S. Steel’s coal requirements for our cokemaking facilities are purchased from outside sources. Pricing for Flat-Rolled's coking coal contracts are typically negotiated on a yearly basis, and from time to time we have entered into multi-year agreements for a portion of our coking coal requirements. 
Prices for European contracts are negotiated quarterly, annually or determined as index-based prices.
We believe that supplies of coking coal adequate to meet our needs are available from outside sources at competitive market prices. The main source of coking coal for Flat-Rolled is the United States, and sources for USSE include Poland, the Czech Republic, Russia, Ukraine, Canada, Mozambique and the United States.
Coke
In North America, the Flat-Rolled segment operates a cokemaking facility at the Clairton Plant of Mon Valley Works. At our Granite City Works, we also have a 15-year coke supply agreement with Gateway that expires on December 31, 2024. Blast furnace injection of coal, and self-generated coke oven gas is also used to reduce coke usage. 
With Flat-Rolled’s cokemaking facilities and the Gateway long-term supply agreement, it has the capability to be nearly self-sufficient with respect to its annual coke requirements at normal operating levels. Coke from time to time has been purchased from, sold to, or swapped with suppliers and other end-users to adjust for production needs and reduce transportation costs.
In Europe, the USSE segment operates cokemaking facilities at USSK. While USSE is self-sufficient for coke at normal operating levels, it periodically purchases coke from Polish and Czech coke producers to meet production needs. Volume and price are negotiated quarterly.
Steel Scrap and Other Materials
We believe that supplies of steel scrap and alloys that are adequate to meet our needs are readily available from outside sources at competitive market prices for the Flat-Rolled and USSE segments and for our future Big River Steel segment. Generally, approximately 55 percent of our steel scrap requirements were internally generated through normal operations for the USSE and Flat-Rolled segments. 
Limestone
All of Flat-Rolled’s limestone requirements and for USSE's lime and limestone requirements are purchased from outside sources. We believe that supplies of limestone and lime adequate to meet our needs are readily available from outside sources at competitive market prices.
Zinc and Tin
We believe that supplies of zinc and tin required to fulfill the requirements for Flat-Rolled and USSE are available from outside sources at competitive market prices. For Flat-Rolled, the main sources of zinc are Canada, Peru and Mexico and the main sources of tin are Bolivia and Peru. For USSE, the main sources of zinc are Finland, Netherlands, Germany and Poland and the main sources of tin are Peru, Indonesia, Bolivia and China. 
During 2020, Flat-Rolled protected approximately 41% and 39% of its operation's zinc and tin purchases, respectively, with financial swap derivatives to manage exposure to zinc and tin price fluctuations. During 2020, USSE did not protect its zinc purchases from price fluctuations and protected 25% of its tin purchases with financial swaps to manage our exposure to tin price fluctuations. For further information, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Natural Gas
All of U. S. Steel’s natural gas requirements are purchased from outside sources.
We believe that adequate supplies to meet Flat-Rolled’s and Tubular's needs are available at competitive market prices. For 2020, approximately 81 percent of our natural gas purchases in Flat-Rolled were based on bids solicited on a monthly basis from various vendors; the remainder were made daily or with term agreements. 
We believe that adequate natural gas supplies to meet USSE’s needs are available at competitive market prices. During 2020, we routinely executed fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts for natural gas to partially manage our exposure to natural gas price increases. For 2020, approximately 54 percent of our natural gas purchases in USSE were made with fixed-price forward physical purchase contracts; the remainder were based on bids solicited on a quarterly or monthly basis from various vendors.
Both Flat-Rolled and USSE use self-generated coke oven and blast furnace gas to reduce consumption of natural gas. USSE also captures and consumes converter gas from its four steelmaking vessels.
Industrial Gases
U. S. Steel purchases industrial gas in the U.S. under long-term contracts with various suppliers. USSE owns and operates its own industrial gas facility, but also may purchase industrial gases from time to time.
Commercial Sales of Product 
U. S. Steel characterizes sales as contract sales if sold pursuant to an agreement with a defined volume and pricing and a duration of longer than three months, and as spot if sold without a defined volume and pricing agreement, typically three months or less. In 2020, approximately 73 percent, 48 percent and 60 percent of sales by Flat-Rolled, USSE and Tubular, respectively, were contract sales. Some contract pricing agreements include fixed prices while others are adjusted periodically based upon published prices of steel products or cost components. 
International Trade
U. S. Steel continues to face import competition, much of which is unfairly traded, supported by foreign governments, and fueled by massive global steel overcapacity, currently estimated to be over 700 million metric tons per year—over seven times the entire U.S. steel market and over twenty-five times total U.S. steel imports. These imports, as well as the underlying policies/practices and overcapacity, impact the Company’s operational and financial performance. U. S. Steel continues to lead efforts to address these challenges that threaten the Company, our workers, our stockholders, and our country’s national and economic security. 
As of the date of this filing, pursuant to a series of Presidential Proclamations issued in accordance with Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, U.S. imports of certain steel products are subject to a 25 percent tariff, except for imports from: (1) Argentina, Brazil, and South Korea, which are subject to restrictive quotas; (2) Canada and Mexico, which are not subject to either tariffs or quotas, but tariffs could be re-imposed on surging product groups after consultations; and (3) Australia, which is not subject to tariffs, quotas, or an anti-surge mechanism. Pursuant to a January 2020 Presidential Proclamation, the Section 232 action was expanded to cover certain downstream steel products from countries subject to the Section 232 tariffs, effective February 8, 2020. 
An August 2020 Presidential Proclamation reduced the Section 232 quota for fourth quarter 2020 for semi-finished steel imports from Brazil. In August 2020, the United States and Mexico announced that Mexico would establish a steel export licensing system to monitor recent U.S. import surges of semi-finished steel, standard pipe, and mechanical tubing from Mexico through June 2021. In September 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce (DOC) published new regulations that require steel import license applicants to report the “melt and pour” country of origin for all U.S. steel imports covered by the Section 232 action. These regulatory changes will facilitate monitoring for import surges and circumvention of tariffs/duties, quotas, product exclusions and country exemptions.
DOC is managing a process in which U.S. companies may request and/or oppose temporary product exclusions from the Section 232 tariffs and quotas. Over 214,000 exclusions have been requested for steel products. U. S. Steel opposes exclusion requests for products that are the same as, or substitutes for, products manufactured by U. S. Steel.
Multiple legal challenges to the Section 232 action continue before the U.S. Court of International Trade (CIT) and U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (CAFC). Several appeals of DOC exclusion denials have resulted in confidential settlements. Multiple countries have challenged the Section 232 action at the World Trade Organization (WTO), imposed retaliatory tariffs, and/or acted to safeguard their domestic steel industries from increased steel imports. In turn, the United States has challenged the retaliation at the WTO.
Since its implementation in March 2018, the Section 232 action has supported the U.S. steel industry’s and U. S. Steel’s investments in advanced steel capacity, technology, and skills, thereby strengthening U.S. national and economic security. The Company continues to actively defend the Section 232 action.
In February 2019, the European Commission (EC) imposed a definitive tariff rate quota safeguard of 25 percent on certain steel imports that exceed established quotas. In June 2020, the EC made several minor adjustments to the safeguard, which will remain in effect through June 2021. The European steel industry has asked for the opening of a review with a view to extending the safeguard measures beyond June 2021.
Antidumping duties (AD) and countervailing duties (CVD or antisubsidy duties) apply in addition to the Section 232 tariffs and quotas and the EC’s safeguard, and AD/CVD orders will continue beyond the Section 232 action and the EC’s safeguard. Thus, U. S. Steel continues to actively defend and maintain the 54 U.S. AD/CVD orders and 11 European Union (EU) AD/CVD orders covering U. S. Steel products in multiple proceedings before the DOC, U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC), CIT, CAFC, the EC and European courts, and the WTO.
In July and November 2020, in the first sunset review of the 2014 AD/CVD orders on oil country tubular goods (OCTG) from India, South Korea, Turkey, Ukraine, and Vietnam and the second sunset review of the 2010 AD/CVD orders on OCTG from China, respectively, the ITC voted to continue those AD/CVD orders for another five years. 
In July 2020, DOC announced final affirmative determinations in self-initiated circumvention investigations of imports of corrosion-resistant steel (CORE) from Costa Rica and the United Arab Emirates made from Chinese substrate, resulting in a combined AD/CVD rate of 239 percent on such imports. DOC made a final negative circumvention determination regarding CORE imported from Guatemala in July 2020, and final circumvention determinations regarding CORE imports from Malaysia and South Africa are expected in 2021. 
In November 2020, DOC self-initiated additional circumvention investigations of imports of OCTG from Brunei and the Philippines made from Chinese hot-rolled steel sheet and strip.
In July 2020, based on petitions filed by Vallourec Star, DOC initiated new AD/CVD investigations on U.S. imports of seamless steel standard, line, and pressure pipe from Czechia, South Korea, Russia, and Ukraine. Provisional measures were imposed on Czechia, South Korea and Russia in December 2020, with provisional measures expected on Ukraine in February 2021 and final duties could be imposed as early as April 2021. In May and June 2020, the EC initiated new AD/CVD investigations on EU imports of hot-rolled steel from Turkey. The EC has set provisional anti-dumping duties in range between 4.8% to 7.6% on hot-rolled coil originating from Turkey, with effect from January 8, 2021, for a period of six months. Definitive measures if adopted should apply as of July 2021.
Following the 2018 investigation under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, the United States began imposing 15 and 25 percent tariffs on certain imports from China, including certain steel products. Following the U.S.-China “Phase One” trade agreement, the 15 percent tariffs declined to 7.5 in February 2020, but the 25 percent tariffs remain in effect.
The Global Forum on Steel Excess Capacity, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development Steel Committee, and trilateral negotiations between the United States, EU and Japan continue to address overcapacity.
U. S. Steel will continue to execute a broad, global strategy to maximize opportunities and navigate challenges presented by imports, global steel overcapacity, and international trade law and policy developments.
Environmental Matters, Litigation and Contingencies
Some of U. S. Steel’s facilities were in operation before 1900. Although the Company believes that its environmental practices have either led the industry or at least been consistent with prevailing industry practices, hazardous materials have been and may continue to be released at current or former operating sites or delivered to sites operated by third parties.
Our U.S. facilities are subject to environmental laws applicable in the U.S., including the Clean Air Act (CAA), the Clean Water Act (CWA), the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), as well as state and local laws and regulations.
U. S. Steel has incurred and will continue to incur substantial capital, operating, and maintenance and remediation expenditures as a result of environmental laws and regulations, related to release of hazardous materials, which in recent years have been mainly for process changes to meet CAA obligations and similar obligations in Europe.
EU Environmental Requirements and Slovak Operations
Under the EU Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), USSE's final allocation of allowances for the Phase III period, which covers the years 2013 through 2020 is 48 million allowances. Based on projected total production levels, we started to purchase allowances in the third quarter of 2017 to meet the annual compliance submission. As of December 31, 2020, we have purchased approximately 12.3 million European Union Allowances (EUA) totaling €141 million (approximately $173 million) to cover the estimated Phase III period shortfall of emission allowances. The exact cost of complying with the EU ETS regulations will depend on verified 2020 emissions.
In the fourth quarter of 2020 USSE started with purchases of allowances for Phase IV period. As of December 31, 2020, we have pre-purchased approximately 1.5 million EUA totaling €38 million (approximately $47 million).
The EU's Industrial Emissions Directive requires implementation of EU determined best available techniques (BAT) for Iron and Steel production, to reduce environmental impacts as well as compliance with BAT associated emission levels. Total capital 
expenditures for projects to comply with or go beyond BAT requirements were €138 million (approximately $169 million) over the actual program period. These costs were partially offset by the EU funding received and may be mitigated over the next measurement periods if USSK complies with certain financial covenants, which are assessed annually. USSK complied with these covenants as of December 31, 2020. If we are unable to meet these covenants in the future, USSK might be required to provide additional collateral (e.g. bank guarantee) to secure 50 percent of the EU funding received. 
For further discussion of laws applicable in Slovakia and the EU and their impact on USSK, see Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Contingencies and Commitments, Environmental Matters, EU Environmental Requirements.”
New and Emerging Environmental Regulations
United States and European Greenhouse Gas Emissions Regulations
Future compliance with CO2 emission requirements may include substantial costs for emission allowances, restriction of production and higher prices for coking coal, natural gas and electricity generated by carbon-based systems. Because we cannot predict what requirements ultimately will be imposed in the U.S. and Europe, it is difficult to estimate the likely impact on U. S. Steel, but it could be substantial. On March 28, 2017, President Trump signed Executive Order 13783 instructing the United States Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) to review the Clean Power Plan (CPP). As a result, in June 2019, the U.S. EPA published a final rule, the “Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule” that replaced the CPP. Twenty-three states, the District of Columbia, and seven municipalities are challenging the CPP repeal and ACE rule in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. A coalition of 21 states has intervened in the litigation in support of the U.S. EPA. Various other public interest organizations, industry groups, and Members of Congress are also participating in the litigation. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the ACE to EPA, while the CPP remains stayed. It is unclear as to how the new Biden administration will proceed with the remand. Any impacts to our operations as a result of any future greenhouse gas regulations are not estimable at this time since the matter is unsettled. In any case, to the extent expenditures associated with any greenhouse gas regulation, as with all costs, are not ultimately reflected in the prices of U. S. Steel's products and services, operating results will be reduced.
The Phase IV EU ETS period spans 2021-2030 and began on January 1, 2021. The Phase IV period is divided into two sub periods (2021-2025 and 2026-2030). Revised rules for Phase IV are still being finalized and may differ between the periods. However, the legislation as currently drafted places more stringent requirements over reduction targets and the amount of the free allocation of CO2 emissions credits. Currently, the overall target is a 40 percent reduction of 1990 emissions by 2030. Ongoing political discussions indicate that an even more stringent target of 60 percent may be instituted. At this time, carbon neutrality of the EU industry is set to be achieved by 2050.

Revised rules for free allocation of CO2 emissions credits are based on reduced benchmark values which have not yet been published and historical levels of production from 2014-2018. USSE submitted all required historical production data in 2019. The final EU decision on the free allocation amount for 2021-2025 is expected in the second quarter of 2021. Allocations to individual installations may be adjusted annually to reflect relevant increases and decreases in production. The threshold for adjustments was set at 15 percent and will be assessed on the basis of a rolling average of two years. The average production level of 2019 and 2020 will be assessed to determine the free allocation for 2021. Preliminary production data shows that USSE missed the 15 percent threshold in 2020; therefore, the free allocation for 2021 may be decreased. Lower production in 2019 and 2020 may have an impact on the future free allocation for 2026-2030, where historical production average for years 2019-2023 are assessed.
United States - Air
The CAA imposes stringent limits on air emissions with a federally mandated operating permit program and civil and criminal enforcement sanctions. The CAA requires, among other things, the regulation of hazardous air pollutants through the development and promulgation of National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) and Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) Standards. The U.S. EPA has developed various industry-specific MACT standards pursuant to this requirement. The CAA requires the U.S. EPA to promulgate regulations establishing emission standards for each category of Hazardous Air Pollutants. The U.S. EPA also must conduct risk assessments on each source category that is already subject to MACT standards and determine if additional standards are needed to reduce residual risks.
While our operations are subject to several different categories of NESHAP and MACT standards, the principal impact of these standards on U. S. Steel operations includes those that are specific to coke making, iron making, steel making and iron ore processing.
On July 13, 2020, the U.S. EPA published a Residual Risk and Technology Review (RTR) rule for the Integrated Iron and Steel MACT category in the Federal Register. Based on the results of the U.S. EPA’s risk review, the Agency determined that risks due to emissions of air toxics from the Integrated Iron and Steel category are acceptable and that the current regulations provided an ample margin of safety to protect public health. Under the technology review, the U.S. EPA determined that there are no developments in practices, processes or control technologies that necessitate revision of the standards. In September 2020, several petitions for review of the rule, including those filed by the Company, AISI, Clean Air Council and others, were filed with 
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The cases were consolidated and are being held in abeyance until EPA reviews and responds to administrative petitions for review. For the Taconite Iron Ore Processing category, based on the results of the Agency’s risk review, U.S. EPA promulgated a final rule on July 28, 2020, in which EPA determined that risks from emissions of air toxics from this source category are acceptable and that the existing standards provide an ample margin of safety. Furthermore, under the technology review, the Agency identified no cost-effective developments in controls, practices, or processes to achieve further emissions reductions. Based upon our analysis of the proposed taconite rule, the Company does not expect any material impact if the rule as a result of the rule. However, petitions for review of the rule were filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in which the Company and AISI intervened. Because the U.S. EPA has not completed its review of the Coke MACT regulations, any impacts related to the U.S. EPA’s review of the coke standards cannot be estimated at this time.
On March 12, 2018, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), along with other petitioners, submitted a CAA Section 126(b) petition to the U.S. EPA. In the petition, the DEC asserts that stationary sources from the following nine states are interfering with attainment or maintenance of the 2008 and 2015 ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) in New York: Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and West Virginia. DEC is requesting the U.S. EPA to require sources of nitrogen oxides in the nine states to reduce such emissions. In a final rule promulgated in the October 18, 2019, Federal Register, EPA denied the petition. On October 29, 2019, New York, New Jersey, and the City of New York petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit for review of U.S. EPA’s denial of the petition. In July 2020, the Court vacated EPA’s determination and remanded it back to EPA to reconsider the 126(b) petition in a manner consistent with the Court’s opinion. At this time, since EPA’s decision after its reconsideration is unknown, the impacts of any reconsideration are indeterminable and inestimable.
The CAA also requires the U.S. EPA to develop and implement NAAQS for criteria pollutants, which include, among others, particulate matter (PM) - consisting of PM10 and PM2.5, lead, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide (SO2), and ozone.
In October 2015, the U.S. EPA lowered the NAAQS for ozone from 75 parts per billion (ppb) to 70 ppb. On November 6, 2017, the U.S. EPA designated most areas in which we operate as attainment with the 2015 standard. In a separate ruling, on June 4, 2018, the U.S. EPA designated other areas in which we operate as “marginal nonattainment” with the 2015 ozone standard. On December 6, 2018, U.S. EPA published a final rule regarding implementation of the 2015 ozone standard. Because no state regulatory or permitting actions to bring the ozone nonattainment areas into attainment have yet to be proposed or developed for U. S. Steel facilities, the operational and financial impact of the ozone NAAQS cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. On December 31, 2020, EPA published a final rule pursuant to its statutorily required review of NAAQS that retains the ozone NAAQS at 70 ppb.
On December 14, 2012, the U.S. EPA lowered the annual standard for PM2.5 from 15 micrograms per cubic meter (ug/m3) to 12 ug/m3, and retained the PM2.5 24-hour and PM10 NAAQS rules. In December 2014, the U.S. EPA designated some areas in which U. S. Steel operates as nonattainment with the 2012 annual PM2.5 standard. On April 6, 2018, the U.S. EPA published a notice that Pennsylvania, California and Idaho failed to submit a State Implementation Plan (SIP) to demonstrate attainment with the 2012 fine particulate standard by the deadline established by the CAA. As a result of the notice, Pennsylvania, a state in which we operate, was required to submit a SIP to the U.S. EPA no later than November 7, 2019 to avoid sanctions. On April 29, 2019, the ACHD published a draft SIP for the Allegheny County nonattainment area which demonstrates that all of Allegheny County will meet its reasonable further progress requirements and be in attainment with the 2012 PM2.5 annual and 24-hour NAAQS by December 31, 2021 with the existing controls that are in place. On September 12, 2019, the Allegheny County Board of Health unanimously approved the draft SIP. The draft SIP was then sent to the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (PADEP). PADEP submitted the SIP to U.S. EPA for approval on November 1, 2019. To date, U.S. EPA has not taken action on PADEP’s submittal. December 18, 2020, EPA published a final rule pursuant to its statutorily required review of NAAQS that retains the existing PM2.5 standards without revision. 
On January 26, 2021, ACHD announced that for the first time in history all eight air quality monitors in Allegheny County met the federal air quality standards including particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10).
On November 20, 2020, ACHD proposed a reduction to the current allowable emissions from coke plant operations, including the hydrogen sulfide content of coke oven gas, that would be more stringent than the Federal Best Available Control Technology and Lowest Achievable Emission Rate requirements. In various meetings with ACHD, U. S. Steel has raised significant objections, in particular, that ACHD has not demonstrated that continuous compliance with the draft rule is economically and technologically feasible. While U. S. Steel continues to meet with ACHD regarding the draft rule, U. S. Steel believes that any rule promulgated by ACHD must comply with its statutory authority. If the draft rule or similar rule is adopted, the financial and operational impacts to U. S. Steel could be material. To assist in developing rules objectively and with adequate technical justification, the June 27, 2019, Settlement Agreement, establishes procedures that would be used when developing a new rule. For further details on the June 27, 2019 Settlement Agreement with ACHD see "Item 3. Legal Proceedings, Environmental Proceedings, Mon Valley Works."
