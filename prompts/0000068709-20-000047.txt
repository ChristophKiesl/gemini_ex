Products and Markets
Test & Simulation
Our Test & Simulation segment (Test & Simulation) provides testing and simulation solutions including hardware, software and services that are used by customers in product development to characterize a product's mechanical properties along with simulation systems for human response features. Our solutions simulate forces and motions that customers expect their products to encounter in use. Mechanical simulation testing in a lab setting is an accepted method to accelerate product development compared to reliance on full physical prototypes in real-world settings, proving ground testing, and virtual testing because it provides more controlled simulation and accurate measurement. The need for mechanical simulation increases in proportion to the cost of a product, the range and complexity of the physical environment in which the product will be used, expected warranty or recall risk and expense, governmental regulation and potential legal liability. A significant portion of Test & Simulation products are considered by our customers to be capital expenditures. The timing of purchases of our products may be impacted by interest rates, general economic conditions, product development cycles and new product initiatives.
A typical Test & Simulation system includes a reaction frame to hold the prototype specimen; a hydraulic pump or electro-mechanical power source; actuators to create the force or motion; and a computer controller with specialized software to coordinate the actuator movement, and to measure, record, analyze and manipulate results. Lower force and less dynamic testing can usually be accomplished with electro-mechanical power sources, which are generally less expensive than hydraulic systems. In addition to these basic components, we sell a variety of accessories and spare parts. 
We provide Test & Simulation customers across all sectors with a spectrum of services to maximize product performance. Our service offerings include installation, product life cycle management, professional training, calibration and metrology, technical consulting and onsite and factory repair and maintenance.

Manufacturing and Engineering
Test & Simulation
Test & Simulation systems are largely built to order and primarily engineered and assembled at our headquarters in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. We assemble certain smaller systems at our locations in Berlin, Germany and Seoul, South Korea. We also operate system assembly facilities in Amsterdam and Mijdrect, Netherlands for electrical motion platforms and in Aarhus, Denmark for wind power energy test systems; however, the majority of the wind energy test systems are constructed at the customer site. Test & Simulation also has engineering operations in Amsterdam, Netherlands; Aarhus, Denmark and Prague, Czech Republic. Certain materials testing products are produced by a contract manufacturer in Shanghai and Hangzhou, China.
Installation of systems, training and services are primarily delivered at customer sites. The engineering and assembly cycle for a typical test system ranges from one to 12 months, depending on the complexity of the system and the availability of components. The engineering and assembly cycle for larger, more complex systems may be several years.
Sensors
Sensors are engineered and assembled regionally at facilities located in Depew, New York; Halifax and Cary, North Carolina; Sunnyvale, California; Farmington Hills, Michigan; Provo, Utah; Cincinnati, Ohio; and Lüdenscheid, Germany. Assembly cycles generally vary from several days to several weeks, depending on the degree of product customization, the size of the order and manufacturing capacity. 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials and Components
Test & Simulation
A significant portion of our test systems consist of materials and component parts purchased from independent vendors. We are dependent, in certain situations, on a limited number of vendors to provide raw materials and components. As Test & Simulation generally sells products and services based on fixed-price contracts, fluctuations in the cost of materials and components between the date of the order and the delivery date may impact the expected profitability. Material and component cost variability is considered in the estimation and customer negotiation process.
Sensors
A significant portion of Sensors products consists of materials and component parts purchased from independent vendors. We are dependent, in certain situations, on a limited number of vendors to provide raw materials and components, such as mechanical and electronic components. As Sensors generally sells products and services based on fixed-price contracts and the products are manufactured and delivered within days to months from the time of order, fluctuations in the cost of materials and components between the date of the order and the delivery date are not likely to materially impact the expected profitability.
Patents and Trademarks
We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and proprietary trade secrets to protect our proprietary technology, some of which are material to our segments. We have obtained numerous patents and trademarks worldwide and actively file and renew patents and trademarks on a global basis to establish and protect our proprietary technology. We are also party to exclusive and non-exclusive license and confidentiality agreements relating to our own and third-party technologies. We aggressively protect certain of our processes, products and strategies as proprietary trade secrets. Our efforts to protect intellectual property and avoid disputes over proprietary rights include ongoing review of third-party patents and patent applications.
Seasonality
There is no significant seasonality in Test & Simulation or Sensors.
Working Capital
Test & Simulation
Test & Simulation does not have significant finished product inventory, but maintains inventories of materials and components to facilitate on-time product delivery. Test & Simulation may have varying levels of work-in-process projects that are classified as inventories, net or unbilled accounts receivable, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, depending upon the manufacturing cycle, timing of orders, project revenue recognition and shipments to customers.
Payments are often received from Test & Simulation customers upon order or at milestones during the fulfillment of the order depending on the size and customization of the system. These payments are recorded as advance payments from customers in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and reduced as revenue is recognized. Conversely, if revenue is recognized on a project prior to customer billing, this revenue is recorded as unbilled accounts receivable, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until the customer has been billed. Upon billing, it is recorded as accounts receivable, net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Changes in the average size, payment terms and revenue recognition for orders in Test & Simulation may have a significant impact on accounts receivable, net; unbilled accounts receivable, net; advance payments from customers; and inventories, net. It has not been our practice to provide rights of return for our products. Payment terms vary and are subject to negotiation.
Sensors
Sensors has finished product inventory, as well as inventories of materials and components to facilitate rapid delivery of product to exceed customer expectations on delivery time. The type and amount of finished goods on hand are targeted based on historical and anticipated customer demands for high-volume products. Payment terms vary and are subject to negotiation. Revenue is primarily recognized when products are shipped. 
Customers
We do not have a significant concentration of sales with any individual customer within Test & Simulation, Sensors or total MTS. Therefore, the loss of any one customer would not have a material impact on our results.
Backlog
Most of our products are built to order. Our backlog of orders, defined as firm orders from customers that remain unfulfilled, totaled approximately $457,586, $420,115 and $415,155 as of October 3, 2020, September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively. Test & Simulation backlog was $385,905, $342,652 and $346,006 as of October 3, 2020, September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively. Sensors backlog was $71,681, $77,463 and $69,149 as of October 3, 2020, September 28, 2019 and September 29, 2018, respectively. Based on anticipated manufacturing schedules, we expect approximately 68% of the backlog as of October 3, 2020 will be converted to revenue in fiscal year 2021. Delays may occur in the conversion of backlog into revenue as a result of export licensing compliance, technical difficulties, specification changes, manufacturing capacity, supplier issues or access to the customer site for installation. While certain contracts within backlog are subject to order cancellation, we have not historically experienced a significant number of order cancellations. Refer to Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of order cancellations.
Government Contracts
Revenue from U.S. government contracts varies by year. A portion of our government business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts or subcontracts at the election of the U.S. government. In addition to contract terms, we must comply with procurement laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could lead to the termination of contracts at the election of the U.S. government or the suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting or subcontracting. U.S. government revenue as a percentage of our total revenue was 11%, 6% and 4% for fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. 
Competition
Test & Simulation
For relatively simple and inexpensive mechanical testing applications, customers may satisfy their needs internally by building their own test systems or using competitors who compete on price, performance, quality and service. For larger and more complex mechanical test systems, we compete directly with several companies worldwide based upon customer value including application knowledge, engineering capabilities, technical features, price, quality and service. 
Sensors
We primarily compete on factors that include technical performance, price and customer service in new applications or in situations in which other sensing technologies have been used. Sensors competitors are typically larger companies that carry multiple sensors product lines; larger diverse companies with only a small portion of business in the sensors market; or smaller, privately held companies throughout the world. 
Environmental Compliance
We believe our operations are in compliance with all applicable material environmental regulations within the jurisdictions in which we operate. Capital expenditures for environmental compliance were not material in fiscal year 2020, 2019 and 2018, and we do not expect such expenditures will be material in fiscal year 2021.
