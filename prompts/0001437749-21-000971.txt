General 
 
Bassett is a leading retailer, manufacturer and marketer of branded home furnishings. Our products are sold primarily through a network of Company-owned and licensee-owned branded stores under the Bassett Home Furnishings (“BHF”) name, with additional distribution through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers. We were founded in 1902 and incorporated under the laws of Virginia in 1930. Our rich 118-year history has instilled the principles of quality, value, and integrity in everything we do, while simultaneously providing us with the expertise to respond to ever-changing consumer tastes and meet the demands of a global economy.
 
With 97 BHF stores at November 28, 2020, we have leveraged our strong brand name in furniture into a network of Company-owned and licensed stores that focus on providing consumers with a friendly environment for buying furniture and accessories.  Our store program is designed to provide a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish, quality furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service.  In order to reach markets that cannot be effectively served by our retail store network, we also distribute our products through other wholesale channels including multi-line furniture stores, many of which feature Bassett galleries or design centers. We use a network of over 30 independent sales representatives who have stated geographical territories. These sales representatives are compensated based on a standard commission rate. We believe this blended strategy provides us the greatest ability to effectively distribute our products throughout the United States and ultimately gain market share.  
 
The BHF stores feature custom order furniture, free in-home and virtual design visits (“home makeovers”) and coordinated decorating accessories.  Our philosophy is based on building strong long-term relationships with each customer.  Sales people are referred to as “Design Consultants” and are trained to evaluate customer needs and provide comprehensive solutions for their home decor.  Until a rigorous training and design certification program is completed, Design Consultants are not authorized to perform in-home or virtual design services for our customers.
 
We have factories in Newton, North Carolina that manufacture custom upholstered and outdoor furniture. We also have factories in Martinsville and Bassett, Virginia that assemble and finish our custom dining offerings, including our “Bench Made” line of solid hardwood furniture. Our manufacturing team takes great pride in the breadth of its options, the precision of its craftsmanship, and the speed of its manufacturing process. Our logistics team then promptly ships the product to one of our home delivery hubs or to a location specified by our licensees.  In addition to the furniture that we manufacture domestically, we source most of our formal bedroom and dining room furniture (casegoods) and certain leather upholstery offerings from several foreign plants, primarily in Vietnam, Thailand and China. Over 75% of the products we currently sell are manufactured in the United States.
 
We also own Zenith Freight Lines, LLC (“Zenith”) which provides logistical services to Bassett along with other furniture manufacturers and retailers. Zenith delivers best-of-class shipping and logistical support services that are uniquely tailored to the needs of Bassett and the furniture industry. Approximately 60% of Zenith’s revenue is generated from services provided to non-Bassett customers.
 
On December 21, 2017, we purchased certain assets and assumed certain liabilities of Lane Venture from Heritage Home Group, LLC for $15,556 in cash. Lane Venture is a manufacturer and distributor of premium outdoor furniture and is now being operated as a component of our wholesale segment. This acquisition marked our entry into the market for outdoor furniture and we believe that Lane Venture has provided a foundation for us to become a significant participant in this category. Our strategy is to distribute this brand outside of our BHF store network only. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional details regarding this acquisition.
 
With the knowledge we have gained through operating Lane Venture, we have developed the Bassett Outdoor brand that is only marketed through the BHF store network. This allows Bassett branded product to move from inside the home to outside the home to capitalize on the growing trend of outdoor living.
 
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic Upon Our Business
 
On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the current COVID-19 outbreak to be a global pandemic. In response to this declaration and the rapid spread of COVID-19 within the United States, federal, state and local governments throughout the country imposed varying degrees of restrictions on social and commercial activity to promote social distancing in an effort to slow the spread of the illness. These measures have had a significant adverse impact upon many sectors of the economy, including non-essential retail commerce.

In response to the above and for the protection of our employees and customers, we temporarily closed our dedicated BHF stores, our manufacturing locations and many of our warehouses for several weeks primarily during the second fiscal quarter of 2020. We also implemented several operating changes which allowed us to maintain sufficient liquidity until we and other furniture retailers were able to reopen for business. These included, among other things, an approximate 23% permanent workforce reduction, temporary salary and wage reductions for all remaining employees, including a 50% pay reduction for our chief executive officer and certain other executives, negotiations with our landlords to receive abatements of rent, and in some cases, temporary rent deferrals, on many of our store leases and the amendment of our bank credit agreement to provide an additional $25,000 of availability under our credit line through December 31, 2020. The disruption to our operations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in a significant loss for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 which drove the loss for the full year despite our return to profitability during the third and fourth fiscal quarters.
 
However, since restarting our manufacturing operations and reopening stores beginning in late May of 2020, the pace of incoming wholesale orders from both the retail stores and our independent dealers outside the BHF store network have far exceeded our post reopening forecasts. Wholesale orders for the second half of 2020 increased 26% as compared to 2019. While our manufacturing operations, primarily our upholstery division, and shipping operations have not been able to keep pace with the incoming order level, we were able to generate net income of $8,782 and operating cash flow of $42,422 during the second half of fiscal 2020. As a result, we have restored all temporarily reduced salaries and wages and resumed the payment of quarterly dividends, including the payment of the dividend declared and subsequently suspended during the second quarter, as well as the declaration and payment of a special dividend subsequent to November 28, 2020.
 
We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and the potential effects on the economy, the consumer and our business. While the rate of incoming orders at both our wholesale and retail segments is currently strong, there are continuing logistical challenges faced by us and the entire home furnishings industry resulting from COVID-related labor shortages and supply chain disruptions creating significant delays in order fulfillment and increasing backlogs. Although unable to predict with certainty, we expect gradual decreases in wholesale and retail backlogs over the course of 2021 driven by an anticipated lower rate of future incoming orders coupled with increased manufacturing and shipping activity. While the home furnishings industry has fared much better during the pandemic than other sectors of the economy, continued economic weakness and the recent surge in COVID-19 cases coupled with the slow rollout of vaccinations may eventually have an additional adverse impact upon our business. The timing of any future actions by us in response to COVID-19 is largely dependent on the mitigation of the spread of the virus, the speed with which vaccinations are disseminated, status of government orders, directives and guidelines, recovery of the business environment, economic conditions, and consumer demand for our products.
 
Operating Segments 
 
We have strategically aligned our business into three reportable segments: Wholesale, Retail – Company-owned stores, and Logistical Services.
 
The wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design, manufacture, sourcing, sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of BHF stores (Company-owned retail stores and licensee-owned stores) and independent furniture retailers. Our retail segment consists of 63 Company-owned and operated BHF stores. The following table shows the number of Company-owned stores by state as of November 28, 2020:

 | Number of | | Number of
--------------+-----------+----------------+----------
State | Stores | State | Stores 
Alabama | 1 | Missouri | 1 
Arizona | 3 | Nevada | 1 
Arkansas | 1 | New Jersey | 2 
California | 3 | New York | 6 
Connecticut | 3 | North Carolina | 5 
Delaware | 1 | Ohio | 2 
Florida | 4 | Oklahoma | 1 
Georgia | 3 | Pennsylvania | 2 
Kansas | 1 | South Carolina | 1 
Kentucky | 1 | Tennessee | 1 
Maryland | 3 | Texas | 12 
Massachusetts | 1 | Virginia | 4 
 | | Total | 63 

 
    3 

  

Our six locations in the state of New York include a 16,000 square foot clearance center in Middletown, New York. Unlike our other 62 BHF locations, the clearance center offers only clearance merchandise at reduced price points and without design consulting services.
 
Wholesale Segment Overview
 
The wholesale furniture industry is very competitive and there are a large number of manufacturers both within and outside the United States who compete in the market on the basis of product quality, price, style, delivery and service. Additionally, many retailers source imported product directly, thus bypassing domestic furniture manufacturers and wholesale importers. We believe that we can be successful in the current competitive environment because our products represent excellent value combining attractive prices, quality and styling, prompt delivery, and superior service.
 
Wholesale shipments by category for the last three fiscal years are summarized below:
 

 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
--------------------------+------+---------+------+-------+-----
Bassett Custom Upholstery | $ | 128,200 | | 58.0 | % | $ | 152,415 | 58.4 | % | $ | 141,321 | 55.2 | %
Bassett Leather | | 21,436 | | 9.7 | % | | 19,220 | 7.4 | % | | 21,589 | 8.4 | %
Bassett Custom Wood | | 39,311 | | 17.8 | % | | 46,082 | 17.6 | % | | 46,074 | 18.0 | %
Bassett Casegoods | | 32,128 | | 14.5 | % | | 40,920 | 15.7 | % | | 42,875 | 16.8 | %
Accessories (1) | | - | | 0.0 | % | | 2,468 | 0.9 | % | | 4,099 | 1.6 | %
Total | $ | 221,075 | | 100.0 | % | $ | 261,105 | 100.0 | % | $ | 255,958 | 100.0 | %


(1) | Beginning with the third quarter of fiscal 2019, our wholesale segment no longer purchases accessory items for resale to our retail segment or to third party customers such as licensees or independent furniture retailers. Our retail segment and third party customers now source their accessory items directly from the accessory vendors.
----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Approximately 24% of our 2020 wholesale sales were of imported product compared to 23% and 27% in 2019 and 2018, respectively. We define imported product as fully finished product that is sourced. Our domestic product includes certain products that contain components which were also sourced. We continue to believe that a blended strategy including domestically produced products primarily of a custom-order nature combined with sourcing of major collections provides the best value and quality of products to our customers.
 
The dollar value of our wholesale backlog, representing orders received but not yet shipped to the BHF store network or independent dealers, was $54,874 at November 28, 2020 and $19,952 at November 30, 2019. We believe that the backlog will gradually decrease over the course of 2021 to a more manageable level as we do not believe the current pace of business is sustainable. 
 
We use lumber, fabric, leather, foam and other materials in the production of wood and upholstered furniture. These components are purchased from a variety of domestic and international suppliers and are widely available. The price and availability of foam, which is highly dependent on the cost of oil and available capacity of oil refineries, can be subject to significant volatility from time to time. We currently assemble and finish these components in our five manufacturing facilities in the United States.
 
Other Investments and Real Estate
 
Our balance sheet at November 28, 2020 and November 30, 2019 included short-term investments in certificates of deposit (“CDs”). At November 24, 2018, in addition to CDs, we also held investments in certain real estate related to former licensee-owned stores. The impact upon earnings arising from these investments is included in other loss, net, in our consolidated statements of operations. Our investment balances at each of the last three fiscal year-ends are as follows:

 | November 28, | | November 30, | | | November 24,
---------------------------------------+--------------+--------+--------------+---+--------+-------------
 | 2020 | | 2019 | | | 2018 
Investments in certificates of deposit | $ | 17,715 | | $ | 17,436 | | $ | 22,643
Certain retail real estate | | - | | | - | | | 1,655 

 
Our short-term investments at November 28, 2020 consist of CDs with original terms generally ranging from six to twelve months, bearing interest at rates ranging from 0.05% to 2.0% with a weighted average yield of approximately 0.21%. At November 28, 2020, the weighted average remaining time to maturity of the CDs was approximately four months. Each CD is placed with a federally insured financial institution and all deposits are within Federal deposit insurance limits.
 
Prior to November 30, 2019, we held investments in retail store properties that we had previously leased to licensees. In November of 2019, we sold one such property, which had a carrying value of $1,655 at November 24, 2018, to the lessee for net proceeds of $1,475. At November 30, 2019, our only remaining investment real estate consisted of a building subject to a ground lease which expired in 2020. During fiscal 2017, we fully impaired the carrying value of the building. See Item 2, Properties, for additional information about our retail real estate holdings.

Retail Segment Overview – Company-Owned Retail Stores
 
The retail furniture industry remains very competitive and includes local furniture stores, regional furniture retailers, national department and chain stores, single-vendor branded retailers and on-line retailers. As a whole, our store network with 63 Company-owned stores and 34 licensee-owned stores, ranks in the top 30 in retail furniture sales in the United States. Our Company-owned store network peaked at 70 stores in fiscal 2019. Since that time, we have closed seven underperforming locations and have no current plans to open additional locations.
 
Net sales for our Company-owned retail stores for the last three fiscal years are summarized below:
 

 | 2020 | | 2019 | | | 2018
----------+------+---------+------+---+---------+-----
Net sales | $ | 211,944 | | $ | 268,693 | | $ | 268,883

 
The COVID crisis has given us the opportunity to look inward and to begin making structural improvements to our business model. We instituted a “virtual appointment” program for our stores in late March, whereby consumers digitally engage with our designers and transact without physically visiting a store. Adding this new form of engagement is one of the many lasting changes that will come out of the 2020 pandemic.
 
We consider our website to be the front door to our brand experience where customers can research our furniture and accessory offerings and subsequently buy online or engage with an in-store design consultant. Customer acquisition resulting from our digital outreach strategies increased our traffic to the website by 82% and web orders by 92% for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to 2019. Digital advertising dominated our marketing expenditures for the majority of the year as we chose to spend less in traditional television and direct mail advertising. We plan to continue with increased levels of spending on digital advertising and outreach during 2021. We also expect to continue investing in our website to improve the navigation and the ordering capabilities to increase web sales. Much of our current product offerings highlight the breadth and depth of our custom furniture capabilities which are difficult to show and sell online. We plan to expand our merchandising strategies to include more product that can be more easily purchased online with or without a store visit. While we work to increase web sales, we will not compromise on our in-store experience or the quality of our in-home makeover capabilities.
 
We also continue to re-examine the performance of every one of our stores. Store traffic has been declining for three years and the effect on our retail model has become increasingly challenging. We believe that on a market-by-market basis, there will be fewer stores in the future and that they will operate with a leaner structure. As a result, our retail management team implemented a new retail staffing model that includes fewer designers, less administrative staff, and a smaller field management organization. We will continue to evaluate store-by-store performance as we seek the optimal store count in the markets in which we compete at retail. We believe the seismic shift in shopping behavior which has been tremendously accelerated by closures of brick and mortar stores as a result of COVID-19 will ultimately result in more favorable retail rent structures.
 
The migration to digital brand research and compressed transaction cycles have caused us to comprehensively evaluate all of our American made custom products. While our Custom Upholstery, Custom Dining, and Bench Made product lines continue to be our most successful offerings, they are not conducive to web transactions; most of these items must be purchased in a store. Furthermore, we offer many upholstery trim options, fabrics and finishes that have low rates of sale and that make web navigation more difficult for the consumer. Consequently, we will continue to methodically re-design each one of these important lines. Our intent is to continue to offer the consumer custom options that will help them personalize their home but to do so in an edited fashion that will provide a better web experience in the research phase and will also allow the final purchase to be made either on the web or in the store. We also plan to heavily emphasize our “Made in America” story and utilize locally harvested and organic materials when possible. While this will all take time to complete, new products began appearing on the retail floors and website in early 2021.

Logistical Services Segment Overview
 
Zenith is a specialized supply chain solutions provider, offering the home furnishings industry the benefit of an asset-based network to move product with greater efficiency, enhanced speed to market, less damage and a single source of shipment visibility. We provide fully integrated solutions with the highest commitment to customer care and service as we seek to go beyond our customers’ transactional expectations to create collaborative partnerships that provide a single source network to:

● | Better manage inventory across multiple locations and provide total audit-ready accountability
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduce line haul and delivery costs
--+------------------------------------


● | Ensure availability of high-volume items in stores
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Integrate the omnichannel nature of today’s retail supply chain
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Management and predictability of the total landed cost of goods
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our customer solutions are provided through the following services:
 

● | Network line haul freight (middle mile)
--+----------------------------------------


● | Warehousing, distribution and inventory management
--+---------------------------------------------------

 
At November 28, 2020, our shipping and delivery fleet consisted of the following:
 

 | Owned | | Leased | | Total
----------------------+-------+-----+--------+-----+------
Tractors | | 139 | | 121 | | 260
Trailers | | 239 | | 271 | | 510
Local delivery trucks | | 18 | | 4 | | 22 

 
We own a central warehousing and national distribution hub located in Conover, North Carolina, and we lease eleven facilities in ten states across the continental United States from which we operate regional freight terminals and provide warehouse and distribution services.
 
Trademarks 
 
Our trademarks, including “Bassett” and the names of some of our marketing divisions, products and collections, are significant to the conduct of our business. This is important due to consumer recognition of the names and identification with our broad range of products. Certain of our trademarks are licensed to independent retailers for use in full store and store gallery presentations of our products. We also own copyrights that are important in the conduct of our business.
Government Regulations 
 
We believe that we have materially complied with all federal, state and local standards regarding safety, health and pollution and environmental controls.
 
Our logistical services segment is also subject to regulation by several federal governmental agencies, including the Department of Transportation (“DOT”). Specifically the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the Surface Transportation Board, which are agencies within the DOT. We are also subject to rules and regulations of various state agencies. These regulatory authorities have broad powers, generally governing matters such as authority to engage in motor carrier operations, motor carrier registration, driver hours of service, safety and fitness of transportation equipment and drivers and other matters.
 
We may also be affected by laws and regulations of countries from which we source goods. Labor, environmental and other laws and regulations change over time, especially in the developing countries from which we source. Changes in these areas of regulation could negatively impact the cost and availability of sourced goods. The timing and extent to which these regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations is difficult to predict. In addition, the imposition of new or increased duties, tariffs, retaliatory tariffs and trade limitations with respect to foreign-sourced products could negatively impact the cost of such goods. Based on the present facts, we do not believe that they will have a material adverse effect on our financial position or future results of operations.

People 
 
We employed 2,071 people as of November 28, 2020. None of our employees are subject to collective bargaining arrangements and we have not experienced any recent work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good. Headcount by segment is as follows:

● | 948 in the wholesale segment
--+-----------------------------


● | 550 in the retail segment
--+--------------------------


● | 573 in the logistical services segment
--+---------------------------------------

 
We believe our employees are key to achieving our business objectives. In the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic we experienced brief closures at most of our facilities, generally four weeks or less. Upon reopening, we had COVID-19 prevention protocols in place to minimize the spread of COVID-19 in our workplaces. These protocols, which remain in place, meet or exceed the Centers for Disease Control guidelines and where applicable, state mandates. Our employees were trained on these protocols prior to or upon returning to work.
 
Our key human capital measures include employee safety, turnover, absenteeism and production. We frequently benchmark our compensation practices and benefits programs against those of comparable industries and in the geographic areas where our facilities are located. We believe that our compensation and employee benefits are competitive and allow us to attract and retain skilled and unskilled labor throughout our organization. Our notable health, welfare and retirement benefits include:
 

● | Company subsidized health insurance
--+------------------------------------


● | 401(k) Plan with Company matching contributions
--+------------------------------------------------


● | Tuition assistance program
--+---------------------------


● | Paid time off
--+--------------

 
We strive to maintain an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind, including sexual or other discriminatory harassment. Our employees have multiple avenues available through which inappropriate behavior can be reported, including a confidential hotline. All reports of inappropriate behavior are promptly investigated with appropriate action taken to stop such behavior.
 
Major Customers
 
Our risk exposure related to our customers, consisting primarily of trade accounts receivable along with certain guarantees, net of recognized reserves, totaled approximately $24,475 and $23,297 at November 28, 2020 and November 30, 2019, respectively. At November 28, 2020 and November 30, 2019, approximately 24% and 28%, respectively, of the aggregate risk exposure, net of reserves, was attributable to five customers. In fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, no customer accounted for more than 10% of total consolidated net sales. However, two customers accounted for approximately 29%, 44% and 40% of our consolidated revenue from logistical services during 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
