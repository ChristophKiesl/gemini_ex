ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
Overview 
Avanos Medical, Inc. is a medical technology company focused on delivering clinically superior breakthrough medical device solutions to improve patients’ quality of life. Headquartered in Alpharetta, Georgia, Avanos is committed to addressing some of today’s most important healthcare needs, such as reducing the use of opioids while helping patients move from surgery to recovery. We develop, manufacture and market clinically superior solutions in more than 90 countries. Unless the context indicates otherwise, the terms “Avanos,” “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” refer to Avanos Medical, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We were originally incorporated in Delaware in 2014. The address of our principal executive offices is 5405 Windward Parkway, Suite 100 South, Alpharetta, Georgia 30004, and our telephone number is (844) 428-2667.
We conduct our business in one operating and reportable segment that provides our medical device products to healthcare providers and patients with manufacturing facilities in the United States, Mexico, France and Tunisia. We provide a portfolio of innovative product offerings focused on chronic care and pain management to improve patient outcomes and reduce the cost of care.
Chronic Care is a portfolio of products that includes (i) digestive health products and (ii) respiratory health products. The digestive health product category accounted for 41%, 38% and 37% of our consolidated net sales in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Digestive health products include our MIC-KEY enteral feeding tubes, CORPAK patient feeding solutions and NEOMED neonatal and pediatric feeding solutions. The respiratory health product category accounted for 25%, 21% and 22% of our consolidated net sales in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Respiratory health products include closed airway suction systems, oral care and other airway management devices under the BALLARD, MICROCUFF and ENDOCLEAR brands.
Pain Management is a portfolio of products that includes (i) acute pain products and (ii) interventional pain solutions. The acute pain product category accounted for 22%, 27% and 26% of our consolidated net sales in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Acute pain includes ON-Q and AMBIT surgical pain pumps and GAME READY cold and compression therapy systems. Our interventional pain product category accounted for 12%, 14% and 15% of our consolidated net sales in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Interventional pain provides minimally invasive pain relieving therapies, such as our COOLIEF pain relief therapy.
Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 global pandemic caused disruption in global supply and distribution channels and dramatically changed the way companies do business. From the beginning of this global health crisis, our first priority has been the safety and well being of our employees. We have taken steps to ensure the health and safety of our employees and customers and to comply with shelter-in-place or quarantine orders that have been in effect in various jurisdictions throughout the world. Nearly all of our global non-manufacturing workforce continue to work remotely and measures are in place to monitor and protect our manufacturing employees. The risks the pandemic may continue to have on our operations and cash flows are described in “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report. 
Business Acquisitions
On May 2, 2016, we acquired all the issued and outstanding capital stock of Medsystems Holdings, Inc. (“Medsystems”), a Delaware corporation, for $175.0 million, net of cash acquired. Medsystems owned and conducted its primary business through CORPAK Medsystems (“Corpak”).
On July 1, 2018, we acquired Cool Systems, Inc. for $65.7 million, net of cash acquired, which was based on a purchase price of $65.0 million plus certain adjustments as provided in the purchase agreement. Cool Systems Inc., is marketed as Game Ready. 
During 2019, we completed the acquisition of substantially all the assets of Endoclear, LLC and Summit Medical Products, Inc. In addition, we also completed the acquisition of NeoMed, Inc. (collectively, the “Acquisitions”). The aggregate purchase price for the Acquisitions was $57.5 million, net of cash acquired, plus future contingent payments of $7.2 million. See “Business Acquisitions” in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report.
Divestiture
On April 30, 2018, we closed the sale of our Surgical and Infection Prevention (“S&IP”) business (the “Divestiture”) pursuant to an Amended and Restated Purchase Agreement dated April 30, 2018 (“Purchase Agreement”) for $710.0 million plus certain adjustments as provided in the Purchase Agreement, and resulted in a gain of $89.9 million. Due to the Divestiture, the results 
of operations from our S&IP business are reported as “Income from discontinued operations, net of tax” through April 30, 2018, as described in “Discontinued Operations” in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this report. 
Sales and Marketing 
We direct our primary sales and marketing efforts toward hospitals, physicians and other healthcare providers to highlight the unique benefits and competitive differentiation of our branded products. We work directly with physicians, nurses, professional societies, hospital administrators and healthcare group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) to collaborate and educate on emerging practices and clinical techniques. These marketing programs are delivered directly to healthcare providers. Additionally, we provide marketing programs to our strategic distribution partners throughout the world. 
Distribution 
While our products are generally marketed directly to hospitals and other healthcare providers, they are generally sold through third-party wholesale distributors, with some sales directly to healthcare facilities and other end-user customers. In 2020, approximately 55% of our net sales in North America were made through distributors. In the year ended December 31, 2020, sales to Medline Industries and McKesson Corporation each accounted for approximately 12% of consolidated net sales. In 2019, no single customer accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales, and in 2018, sales to Owens & Minor, Inc. accounted for approximately 10% of our consolidated net sales. 
Outside North America, sales are made either directly to end-user customers or through distributors, depending on the market served. In 2020, approximately 83% of our net sales outside North America were made through wholesalers or distributors. 
We utilize distribution centers in North America, Europe, Australia and Japan. No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts at the election of the government.
Group Purchasing Organizations
We enter into agreements with GPOs which allows for the sale of our products to their members, whether sold directly by us or through independent wholesale distributors. Agreements with GPOs are generally renewed every three years. GPOs negotiate pricing and volume purchasing discounts for hospitals, physician practices and other health care providers and institutions. Under our agreements with GPOs, we pay a fee based on sales of our products to GPO members, which is recorded as a reduction of net sales. Approximately 30% of our 2020 global net sales, including sales to wholesale distributors, were contracted through GPOs.
Competition 
While no single company competes with us across the breadth of our offerings, we face significant competition in U.S. and international markets. 
There are a variety of treatment means and alternative clinical practices to address surgical and interventional pain management and respiratory and digestive health. We face competition from these alternative treatments, as well as improvements and innovations in products and technologies by our competitors. Major competitors include, among others: 
•Digestive Health: Boston Scientific Corporation, Cook Medical and Applied Medical Technology, Inc.
•Respiratory Health: Becton, Dickinson and Company, Stryker Corporation, Medline Industries, Inc. and Smiths Medical
•Acute Pain Management: B. Braun Medical Inc., Pacira Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Teleflex Incorporated, Medtronic plc, Ambu A/S, Baxter International, Inc., Pajunk Medical Systems and Leventon
•Interventional Pain Management: Boston Scientific Corporation, Abbott Laboratories, Medtronic plc and Stryker Corporation
In developing and emerging markets, alternative clinical practices and different standards of care are our primary competition. 
While we believe that the number of procedures using our products will grow due, in part, to increasing global access to healthcare, we expect that our ability to compete with other providers of similar products will be impacted by rapid technological advances, pricing pressures and third-party reimbursement practices. We continue to defend our market positions and have launched seven new products in 2020. We believe that our key product characteristics, such as proven efficacy, reliability and safety, coupled with our core competencies such as our innovative ability to launch new products, efficient manufacturing processes, established distribution network, field sales organization and customer service, are important factors that distinguish us from our competitors. 
Research and Development 
We continuously engage in research and development to commercialize new products and enhance the effectiveness, reliability and safety of our existing products. We incurred $34.9 million in 2020, $37.7 million in 2019 and $41.8 million in 2018 on research and development for new products and processes, and to improve existing products and processes. These amounts consisted primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel, product trial costs, outside laboratory and license fees, the costs of laboratory equipment and facilities, and asset write-offs for equipment associated with unsuccessful product launches. We intend to continue our research and development efforts as a key strategy for growth. 
We collaborate with physicians to develop solutions that seek to accelerate the global adoption of our therapies and procedures. We are investing to expand the indications for use of our pain products with clinical research and studies and associated new product developments. We are expanding our portfolio with customer-preferred product enhancements, such as next generation cooled radiofrequency generators and a full line of needles, kits and accessories for continuous peripheral nerve block procedures.
Intellectual Property 
Patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights are very important to our business. We also rely upon trade secrets, manufacturing know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to maintain and improve our competitive position. We review third-party proprietary rights, including patents and patent applications, as available, in an effort to develop an effective intellectual property strategy, avoid infringement of third-party proprietary rights, identify licensing opportunities and monitor the intellectual property owned by others. 
We hold numerous patents and have numerous patent applications pending in the United States and other countries that relate to the technology used in many of our products. We utilize patents in our acute pain management, interventional pain management, respiratory health and digestive health products. These patents generally expire between 2021 and 2038. None of the patents we license from third parties are material to our business.
Under an agreement that we have with Owens & Minor, Inc., we may continue to distribute products bearing the “Halyard Health” or “Halyard” brands through February 2022 as we continue rebranding efforts to ensure our customers’ transition from the Halyard brand. 
We consider the patents and trademarks which we own and the trademarks under which we sell certain of our products, as a whole, to be material to our business. However, we do not consider our business to be materially dependent upon any individual patent or trademark. 
Raw Materials 
We use a wide variety of raw materials and other inputs in our production processes. We base our purchasing decisions on quality assurance, cost effectiveness and regulatory requirements, and we work closely with our suppliers to assure continuity of supply while maintaining high quality and reliability. We primarily purchase these materials from external suppliers, some of which are single-source suppliers. 
Regulatory Matters 
The development, manufacture, marketing, sale, promotion and distribution of our products are subject to comprehensive government regulation. Government regulation by various national, regional, federal, state and local agencies, both in the United States and other countries, addresses (among other matters) inspection of, and controls over, research and laboratory procedures, clinical investigations, product approvals and manufacturing, labeling, packaging, marketing and promotion, pricing and reimbursement, sampling, distribution, quality control, post-market surveillance, record keeping, storage and disposal practices. Our operations are also affected by trade regulations in many countries that limit the import of raw materials and finished products and by laws and regulations that seek to prevent corruption and bribery in the marketplace (including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, which provide guidance on corporate interactions with government officials) and require safeguards for the protection of personal data. In addition, we are subject to laws and regulations pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including state and federal anti-kickback and false claims laws in the United States. 
Compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and materially affects our business. Among other effects, healthcare regulations substantially increase the time, difficulty and costs incurred in obtaining and maintaining approval to market newly developed and existing products. For example, in the United States, before we can market a new medical product, or market a new use for, claim for or significant modification to an existing product, we generally must first receive clearance under Section 510(k) of the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“510(k) clearance”) from the United States Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). In order for us to obtain 510(k) clearance, the FDA must determine that our proposed product is substantially 
equivalent to a device legally on the market, known as a predicate device, with respect to intended use, technology, safety and effectiveness. 
Similarly, most major markets for medical devices outside the United States also require clearance, approval or compliance with certain standards before a product can be commercially marketed. For instance, the European Commission, or EC, has harmonized national regulations for the control of medical devices through European Medical Device Directives (“EU MDD”) with which manufacturers must comply. Under these regulations, manufacturing plants must have received certification of conformity from a notified body in order to be able to sell products within the member states of the European Union. Certification allows manufacturers to stamp the products of certified plants with a “CE” mark. Products covered by the EC regulations that do not bear the CE mark may not be sold or distributed in the European Union. However, the European Union has adopted the EU Medical Device Regulation (“EU MDR”), replacing the current EU MDD, effective May 26, 2021. The main goal of this regulation is to enhance product safety, quality and transparency for medical devices within the European Union. Consequently, the EU MDR brings significant new requirements for many medical devices, including enhanced requirements for clinical evidence and documentation, increased focus on device identification and traceability, and additional post-market surveillance and diligence. Compliance with the EU MDR will require re-certification of many of our products to the enhanced standards. Complying with the EU MDR may require us to incur significant expenditures. 
We expect compliance with these regulations to continue to require significant technical expertise and capital investment to ensure compliance. Failure to comply can delay the release of a new product or result in regulatory and enforcement actions, the seizure or recall of a product, the suspension or revocation of the authority necessary for a product’s production and sale, and other civil or criminal sanctions, including fines and penalties. 
In addition to regulatory initiatives, our business can be affected by ongoing studies of the utilization, safety, efficacy, and outcomes of healthcare products and their components that are regularly conducted by industry participants, government agencies, and others. These studies can call into question the utilization, safety, and efficacy of previously marketed products. In some cases, these studies have resulted, and may in the future result, in the discontinuance of, or limitations on, marketing of such products domestically or worldwide, and may give rise to claims for damages from persons who believe they have been injured as a result of their use. 
Access to healthcare products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies, legislative bodies, and private organizations in the United States and other countries. A major focus is cost containment. Efforts to reduce healthcare costs are also being made in the private sector, notably by healthcare payors and providers, which have instituted various cost reduction and containment measures. We expect insurers and providers to continue attempts to reduce the cost of healthcare products. Outside the United States, many countries control the price of healthcare products directly or indirectly, through reimbursement, payment, pricing, coverage limitations, or compulsory licensing. Budgetary pressures in the United States and in other countries may also heighten the scope and severity of pricing pressures on our products for the foreseeable future. 
We expect debate to continue during the next several years at all government levels worldwide over the marketing, availability, method of delivery, and payment for healthcare products and services. We believe that future legislation and regulation in the markets we serve could affect access to healthcare products and services, increase rebates, reduce prices or the rate of price increases for healthcare products and services, change healthcare delivery systems, create new fees and obligations, or require additional reporting and disclosure. It is not possible to predict the extent to which we or the healthcare industry in general might be affected by the matters discussed above. 
Since we market our products worldwide, certain products of a local nature and variations of product lines must also meet other local regulatory requirements. Certain additional risks are inherent in conducting business outside the United States, including price and currency exchange controls, changes in currency exchange rates, limitations on participation in local enterprises, expropriation, nationalization, and other governmental action. 
Demand for many of our existing and new medical devices is, and will continue to be, affected by the extent to which government healthcare programs and private health insurers reimburse our customers for patients’ medical expenses in the countries where we do business. Statutory and regulatory requirements for Medicaid, Medicare, and other government healthcare programs govern provider reimbursement levels. From time to time, legislative changes are made to government healthcare programs that impact our business, and the federal and/or state governments may continue to enact measures in the future aimed at containing or reducing reimbursement levels for medical expenses paid for in whole or in part with government funds. We cannot predict the nature of such measures or their impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Any reduction in the amount of reimbursements received by our customers could harm our business by reducing their selection of our products and the prices they are willing to pay. 
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
Our operations are subject to federal, state, provincial and local laws, regulations and ordinances relating to various environmental, health and safety matters. Our operations are in compliance with, or we are taking actions designed to ensure compliance with, these laws, regulations and ordinances. However, the nature of our operations exposes us to the risk of claims concerning non-compliance with environmental, health and safety laws or standards, and there can be no assurance that material costs or liabilities will not be incurred in connection with those claims. We are not currently named as a party in any judicial or administrative proceeding relating to environmental, health and safety matters. 
While we have incurred in the past several years, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures in order to comply with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances, we believe that our future cost of compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and ordinances, and our exposure to liability for environmental, health and safety claims will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations, or contamination of sites owned, operated or used for waste disposal by us (including currently unknown contamination and contamination caused by prior owners and operators of such sites or other waste generators) may give rise to additional costs which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.
Employees and Human Capital Management 
Employees are our most-valued resource and are at the center of everything we do. Their talent, diversity and commitment are crucial to our innovation and success. Our work environment fosters personal, professional and corporate growth and nurtures innovation through product development and customer solutions. Our global teams work together in a spirit of cooperation to improve health and healthcare every day.
