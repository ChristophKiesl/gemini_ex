Item 1. Business.
Our Company
Hibbett, headquartered in Birmingham, Alabama, is a leading athletic-inspired fashion retailer with approximately 1,100 stores under the Hibbett Sports and City Gear banners, primarily located in underserved communities. Founded in 1945, Hibbett has a rich history of convenient locations, personalized customer service and access to coveted footwear, apparel and equipment from top brands like Nike, Jordan and adidas.
Our Business Strategy
We target underserved markets with branded products and provide a high level of customer service. This market strategy enables us to achieve significant cost benefits including lower corporate expenses, reduced logistics costs and increased economies of scale from marketing activities. We use information systems to maintain tight controls over inventory and operating costs and continually search for ways to improve efficiencies and the customer experience through information system upgrades. In addition, we establish greater customer, vendor and landlord recognition as a leading specialty retailer in these communities. We believe our ability to align our merchandising mix to local preferences and trends differentiates us from our national competitors.
Our Store Brands
Hibbett Sports: As of January 30, 2021, we operated 882 Hibbett Sports stores. These stores average approximately 5,800 square feet and are located primarily in strip centers, usually near a major chain retailer. We operated 693 Hibbett Sports stores in strip centers, which include free-standing stores, and 189 stores in enclosed malls, the majority of which are the only enclosed malls in their county.
City Gear: In November 2018, we acquired 136 City Gear stores and as of January 30, 2021, operated 167 City Gear stores, which average 5,000 square feet and are located primarily in strip centers. We operated 128 City Gear stores in strip centers, which includes free-standing stores, and 39 stores in enclosed malls.
Sports Additions: We operate 18 Sports Additions (SA) stores, which average 2,800 square feet and are located primarily in enclosed malls. Approximately 90% of the merchandise carried in our SA stores is athletic footwear with the remainder consisting of headwear and apparel.
In selecting retail locations, we consider the size, demographics, quality of real estate and competitive conditions in each market. Our stores offer a core merchandising mix of premium athletic branded footwear, apparel, accessories and team sports equipment designed to appeal to the GEN-Z customers within each market. We strive to meet the fashion and technical demands of our customers.
Our Growth Strategy
We identify markets for our stores under a clustered expansion program. This approach primarily focuses on opening new stores within close proximity of existing locations, allowing us to take advantage of efficiencies in logistics, marketing and regional management. It also aids us in building a better understanding of appropriate merchandise selection for the local market. In addition to proximity to existing stores, we also consider population, economic conditions, local competitive dynamics, availability of suitable real estate and potential for return on investment when evaluating potential markets.
Omni-channel strategy: We recognize that even though our core customer is in underserved markets, they are digitally savvy. Our customer has high expectations that are constantly evolving including the ability to engage with us in multiple ways. As a result, we continue to make investments in omni-channel as well as our core e-commerce experience. 
In Fiscal 2021, we added more omni-channel options for customers including curbside pickup and ship to store. We now offer greater shopping flexibility and convenience than ever before. We also continued to improve our core e-commerce experience with an expanded product assortment through the reduction of customer friction points. The COVID-19 pandemic stress tested

many of our processes which allowed us to spot issues and make improvements to customer service, fulfillment, and the user experience on our website and in our apps.
In Fiscal 2022, we will continue to grow our e-commerce and omni-channel business. Major initiatives include a website refresh, personalization, customer service investments, increased delivery speed, enhancements to our launch shoe process and mobile app improvements. 
Our Logistics
We maintain a full-line wholesale and logistics facility in Alabaster, Alabama (a suburb of Birmingham) where we receive and ship most of our merchandise. In addition, we utilize a third-party logistics facility in Memphis, Tennessee to improve efficiencies and to improve time to market. For key products, we maintain backstock at the Alabaster and Memphis facilities. This product is allocated and shipped to stores through an automatic replenishment system based on inventory levels and sales. Merchandise is delivered to stores via Company operated vehicles, small package carriers or third-party logistics providers. In Fiscal 2021, we increased our delivery frequency to every store in the chain to further enhance our speed-to-market and in-store product availability for our customers. We believe strong logistics support for our stores is a critical element of our business strategy and that our current logistics structure will support our growth over the next several years.
Our Merchandise
Our merchandising strategy is to provide a broad assortment of premium brand name footwear, apparel, accessories and team sports equipment at competitive prices in a full service omni-channel environment. We believe that the assortment of brand name merchandise we offer consistently exceeds the merchandise selection carried by most of our competitors, particularly in our underserved markets and neighborhood centers. Many of these brand name products have limited availability and/or are technical in nature requiring considerable sales assistance. We coordinate with our vendors to educate the sales staff at the store level on new products and trends.
Although the core merchandise assortment tends to be similar for each store, it is somewhat differentiated by the Hibbett Sports or City Gear brands. Each brand utilizes important demographic, local and/or regional considerations. Accordingly, we offer products that reflect preferences for particular demographics as well as interests from each community. Our knowledge of these interests, combined with access to leading brands, enables our merchandising staff to react quickly to emerging trends or special events, such as fashion shifts or athletic events.
Our merchandising staff, operations staff and management analyze current trends primarily through the lens of our store typing strategy. Information is largely gathered and analyzed utilizing business intelligence tools. Other strategic measures we utilize to recognize trends or changes in our industry include:
•maintaining close relationships with vendors and other retailers;
•studying other retailers for best practices in merchandising;
•attending various trade shows, both in our industry and outside as well as reviewing industry trade publications; and
•actively participating in industry associations.
The merchandising staff works closely with store personnel to meet the requirements of individual stores for appropriate merchandise in sufficient quantities.
Our Vendor Relationships
The athletic specialty and city specialty retail businesses are brand-name-driven. Accordingly, we maintain positive relationships with a number of well-known vendors to satisfy customer demand. We believe that we offer a best-in-class omni-channel experience through physical locations, mobile apps and website and that we are among the primary retail distribution avenues for brand name vendors that seek to engage with consumers in underserved markets. As a result, we are able to attract considerable vendor interest and establish long-term partnerships with vendors. As our vendors expand their product lines and grow in popularity, we expand sales of these products. In addition, as we continue to increase our store base and enter new markets, our vendors increase their brand presence within these regions. We also work with our vendors to establish favorable pricing and to receive cooperative marketing funds.

Our Information Systems
We use technology as an enabler of our business strategies. We implement and maintain systems targeted at improving financial control, cost management, inventory control, merchandise planning, logistics, replenishment, and product allocation. Our systems are designed to be flexible to meet the unique needs of each specific store location. We continue to evolve our digital channel experience and development of further channel integration for a more seamless and frictionless set of capabilities aimed at enhancing our customers shopping experience in-store, online and through our mobile solutions. In Fiscal 2020, we co-branded our web presence by integrating City Gear into our omni-channel experience.
Our communications networks send and receive critical business data to and from stores, third-party cloud providers, and managed hosting facilities (data centers). Our Company’s information is processed in a secure environment to protect both the actual data and the physical assets. We attempt to mitigate the risk of cyber-security threats and business interruptions by maintaining strong security protocols, threat monitoring, regular risk reviews, and a detailed disaster recovery plan. In early Fiscal 2021, we consolidated the City Gear data center into our St. Louis hosted facility, which accomplished the alignment of controls over data. We completed the integration of all core systems during Fiscal 2021.
We strive to maintain highly qualified and motivated third-party partners and teams of individuals to support our information systems, which includes security, help desk, engineering, operations, quality assurance, business analysis, solution development, analytics and project management. Our systems are monitored 24 hours a day, and management believes that our current systems and practice of implementing regular updates will continue to support current needs and future growth. We use a strategic information systems planning process that involves senior management and is integrated into our overall business planning and enterprise risk management. Information systems projects are prioritized based upon strategic, financial, regulatory and other business criteria.
Our Marketing and Promotion
We focus on marketing opportunities that drive traffic and sales to our stores and digital business. For the last few years, digital marketing has been the major growth area for our marketing investments. We specifically see continued opportunities in personalization as well as hyper-local marketing efforts, including events and local store social media accounts. We have also maintained more traditional elements of our portfolio to drive store traffic. 
Our Rewards program represented a significant portion of overall sales in Fiscal 2021. Loyalty customers spent more than prior year driven by new customers as well as increases in average purchase amounts and increases in transactions. We will continue to improve our Rewards program to drive member acquisition and sales. Improvements will be focused on ease of use, value to customer and exceptional service both in our stores and on our e-commerce site and apps. 
Our Competition
The business in which we are engaged is highly competitive. The marketplace for athletic specialty merchandise is highly fragmented as many different brick and mortar and online retailers compete for market share by utilizing a variety of formats and merchandising strategies. We compete with specialty shoe stores, department stores, traditional shoe stores, mass merchandisers, e-commerce retailers, athletic and sporting good brands, and, in some of our large and mid-size markets, national sporting goods superstores. In addition, we face competition from vendors that sell directly to consumers.
Although we face competition from a variety of competitors, we believe that our stores are able to compete effectively by providing a premium assortment of footwear, apparel, accessories and team sports equipment. Additionally, we differentiate our store experience through extensive product knowledge, customer service and convenient locations. We believe we compete favorably with respect to these factors in the underserved markets and neighborhood centers predominantly in the South, Southwest, Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions of the United States.

Human Capital
Human Capital Management
At Hibbett, our key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. Our inclusive culture inspires leadership, encourages innovative thinking, and supports advancement opportunities for all associates. Our human resources programs are central to our long-term strategy and are designed to develop talent in preparation for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support associates through competitive pay and benefits; enhance the Company’s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; engage associates as brand ambassadors of the Company’s products and experiences; and evolve and invest in technology, tools, and resources to enable associates at work.
As of January 30, 2021, we employed approximately 10,700 employees, of which approximately 3,600 were full-time employees and over 90% of the total population work in our retail locations. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. The number of part-time employees fluctuates depending on seasonal needs. We have a long history of providing competitive compensation and benefits and providing meaningful experiences and career-development opportunities to our employees. As a result, we have not experienced significant interruptions in our operations due to labor disagreements or employee dissatisfaction. 
COVID-19
We are committed to the health and safety of our associates and their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we supported our associates by expanding remote work, broadening benefit offerings such as increasing paid-time-off for our retail associates and providing health care premium forgiveness. Our Chief Executive Officer has provided updates to our associates, including field leadership, every month since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. We offer Associate Assistance Program counseling sessions and conducted an associate engagement survey at our Store Support Center to understand and respond to associate needs.
Our Diversity and Inclusion Statement:
Diversity, inclusion, and belonging are at the heart of who we are as a Company. We’ve cultivated an authentic representation of our communities through thoughtful local hiring, often from our customer base. Our teams’ unique backgrounds, perspectives, and skills improve us all, creating a competitive advantage that positively impacts our business and contributes to our success. We intentionally foster a culture of belonging and inspiring self-expression, in our employees and our customers.
In response to ongoing civil unrest, we committed to doing our part to improve our inclusion and increase our diversity. We are driving important change through specific actions, including launching a relationship with the Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion at the University of Alabama at Birmingham to provide diversity and inclusion education sessions. In addition, we have fostered a culture where all associates are encouraged and empowered to be leaders through our Leadership Academy professional development program. 
Talent Acquisition/Talent Development/Associate Engagement
We understand that being an employer of choice requires providing best-in-class training and development opportunities, while creating innovative programs that enable a vibrant and engaged learning culture to flourish. In addition to our Leadership Academy, we recently adopted LinkedIn Learning as our e-learning platform for our Store Support Center. 
We recognize that maintaining an inclusive and high-performance culture requires an engaged workforce, where associates are motivated to do their best work every day. Our engagement approach centers on communication and recognition. We communicate with our associates in a variety of ways, including monthly live CEO updates that include Q&A sessions with employees and regular communications to all our retail locations. 
Our associate engagement survey at our Store Support Center provided our associates a channel for feedback on a variety of topics, such as company direction and strategy, individual growth and development, collaboration, confidence, and trust.

Sole School Program highlights include product donations, engagement programs, career coaching, academic incentives, and monetary donations. Our team members lead focus groups where student athletes are encouraged to excel in school and are introduced to various career paths that may be available to them after high school and college. Additionally, the student athletes get a first look at some of the newest product releases and selections and can provide feedback, potentially influencing future product selection.
For Fiscal 2022, we are partnering with two organizations; one that supports inner-city education that equips students from families of limited economic means with the knowledge, character and skills to transform their lives; and one that supports our disabled community through empowerment of disabled individuals to live full and meaningful lives.
