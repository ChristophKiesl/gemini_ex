ITEM 1: | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Our Company
 
Ideal Power Inc. was formed in Texas on May 17, 2007 and converted to a Delaware corporation on July 15, 2013. Unless otherwise stated or the context otherwise requires, the terms "Ideal Power," "we," "us," "our" and the "Company" refer to Ideal Power Inc.
 
Until April 2018, we were primarily focused on the design, marketing and sale of electrical power conversion products using our proprietary technology called Power Packet Switching Architecture™, or PPSA™. PPSA™ is a power conversion technology that improves upon existing power conversion technologies in key product metrics, such as size and weight while providing built-in isolation and bi-directional and multi-port capabilities. PPSA™ utilizes standardized hardware with application specific embedded software. Our products were designed to be used in both on-grid and off-grid applications with a focus on solar + storage, microgrid and stand-alone energy storage applications. The principal products of the Company were 30-kilowatt power conversion systems, including 2-port and multi-port products.
 
In April 2018, we realigned into two operating divisions: Power Conversion Systems, to continue the commercialization of our PPSA™ technology, and B-TRAN, to develop our Bi-directional bi-polar junction TRANsistor (B-TRAN™) solid state switch technology.
 
In January 2019, our Board of Directors (our “Board”) approved a strategic shift to focus on the commercialization of our B-TRAN™ technology and a plan to suspend further power converter system, or PPSA™, development and sales while we located a buyer for our power conversion systems division and PPSA™ technology. In September 2019, we closed on the sale of our power conversion systems division and, since that time, we have been solely focused on the further development and commercialization of our B-TRAN™ technology. We show the power conversion systems division as a discontinued operation in our financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2019.
 
To date, operations have been funded primarily through the sale of common stock and warrants. Total revenue generated from inception to date as of December 31, 2020 amounted to $15.3 million with approximately $12.4 million of that revenue from discontinued operations and the remainder from grant revenue for bi-directional power switch development. Revenue from continuing operations was $428,129 and $0 in the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and related to a government grant. We may pursue additional research and development grants, if and when available, to further develop and/or improve our technology.
 
COVID-19 Impact
 
As of the date of this report, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread throughout the United States and the rest of the world. The ultimate extent of the impact of COVID-19 on the financial performance of the Company will depend on future developments, including, among other things, the duration and spread of COVID-19, the timing of vaccination efforts, additional governmental restrictions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the overall economy, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant volatility in the global financial markets, which may impact the Company’s ability to raise additional capital if necessary, on acceptable terms or at all, though such risk has not materialized to date. If the financial markets and/or the overall economy are negatively impacted for an extended period, the Company's operating results may be materially and adversely affected.
 
While the outbreak of COVID-19 initially disrupted our business in the first and second quarters of 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic did not have a material adverse impact on our operations in the second half of 2020. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt our business in the future and cause delays in critical development and commercialization activities and/or result in potential incremental costs associated with mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing, and its dynamic nature, including uncertainties relating to the ultimate spread of the virus, the severity of the disease, the duration of the outbreak and additional actions that may be taken by governmental authorities to contain the outbreak or to treat its impact, makes it difficult to forecast the effects on our business and results of operations for 2021 and thereafter. See “Item 1A: Risk Factors – Risks Related to the Company – Our business, including our supply chain, liquidity, financial condition and financial results may be adversely disrupted and impacted due to COVID-19 pandemic.”

Sale of Power Conversion Systems Division
 
In September 2019, we closed on the sale of our power conversion systems division to CE+T Energy Solutions, Inc. (“CE+T Energy”) The consideration consisted of $200,000 in cash and 50 shares of CE+T Energy’s common stock, which represented a 5% ownership interest in CE+T Energy as of the closing date. We did not record any value of the equity consideration obtained in the sale as there was not a market for such shares and we did not have access to current financial information and future financial projections of CE+T Energy. CE+T Energy also assumed certain liabilities of the power conversion systems division in connection with the sale. The net cash proceeds from the sale were $23,587. In December 2020, CE+T Energy repurchased our shares of CE+T Energy’s common stock for $25,000.
 
In September 2019, we entered into a sublease with CE+T Energy pursuant to which we sublease approximately seventy-five (75%) percent of our Austin, Texas facility to CE+T Energy. Under the sublease, CE+T Energy is obligated to make monthly payments equal to 75% of all sums due under the master lease and 100% of any maintenance and repair costs related to the subleased premises. The sublease replaced a temporary agreement between us and CE+T Energy, effective in July 2019, that contained similar payment obligations by CE+T Energy for utilization of the subleased premises. Consistent with the master lease, the sublease terminates on May 31, 2021.
 
February 2021 Offering
 
In February 2021, we issued and sold 1,352,975 shares of our common stock, including 176,475 additional shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of the underwriter’s option to purchase additional shares in full, in an underwritten public offering at a price of $17.00 per share (the “February 2021 Offering”). The net proceeds to us from the February 2021 Offering were $21.2 million. We intend to use the net proceeds from the February 2021 Offering to fund commercialization and development of our B-TRAN™ technology and general corporate and working capital purposes. 
Early Warrant Exercise Transaction
 
In August 2020, we closed the Early Warrant Exercise Transaction (as defined herein), pursuant to which certain holders of our outstanding Series A warrants exercised such Series A warrants to purchase an aggregate of 1,176,137 shares of common stock, and we issued to such holders new Series C warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of 705,688 shares of common stock with an exercise price of $8.90 per share and an expiration date of August 4, 2025. We raised net proceeds of $2.5 million in the Early Warrant Exercise Transaction. We intend to use the net proceeds from the Early Warrant Exercise Transaction to fund commercialization and development of our B-TRAN™ technology and general corporate and working capital purposes. 
Industry Background
 
A semiconductor material is a substance that is characterized for "conducting" electricity easily, while at the same time, working as an insulator to prevent the flow of electricity. By using semiconductors, it becomes possible to perform rectification for the one-directional flow of electricity, amplification for increasing electrical signals, and switching to open and close the flow of electricity.
 
Power semiconductors possess a structure that is different from regular semiconductors, enabling them to handle high voltages and large currents without damage. Failures may occur due to a rise in temperatures resulting from heat generated from handling large amounts of power. Therefore, methods have been developed to reduce the amount of power semiconductor loss, which is the cause of the heat generation, while also effectively releasing the generated heat to the outside.
 
Power semiconductors are mostly used in power conversion such as in changing voltages and frequencies, as well as changing direct current (“DC”) to alternating current (“AC”) and AC to DC. Power semiconductors play an indispensable role in accurately driving motors from low to high speeds, controlling the voltage and flow of electricity in electric and hybrid vehicles, supplying power grids with power generated from solar cells with less power loss, and providing a stable source of electricity to various home appliances and electrical equipment. In recent years, there has been a greater demand for energy-savings and power consumption reductions and, as a result, the need for power semiconductors that minimize power loss has been increasing.
 
Power semiconductors are solid-state devices that act as a switch without any mechanical movement. Solid-state devices are completely made from a solid material, typically silicon, and their flow of charges is confined within this solid material. The term solid-state is often used to show a difference with the earlier technologies of vacuum and gas-discharge tube devices and also to exclude the conventional electro-mechanical devices such as relays, switches, hard drives and other devices with moving parts. Solid-state switches are typically more efficient due to lower losses during power processing.
 
The global power semiconductor market may be categorized by component, material, end-use and geography. Based on component, the market includes power metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (“MOSFETs”), thyristors, rectifiers, bipolar junction transistors, insulated gate bipolar transistors (“IGBTs”) and power diodes. With respect to material, the power semiconductor market is bifurcated into silicon/germanium, silicon carbide and gallium nitride.
 
The end-use market is classified into automotive, industrial, renewable energy, telecommunication, consumer electronics, aerospace and defense, healthcare and others. Among these, automotive electronics accounts for significant consumption of power semiconductors. The number of semiconductors in vehicles has surged in recent years with the rising adoption of electric vehicles, plug-in electric vehicles, and hybrid electric vehicles. Further, the advent of drive-by-wire or x-by-wire technologies have led to a rise in number of electric components in vehicles over mechanical vehicle parts. This rise helps reduce vehicle weight which is directly related to improved fuel efficiency and reduced vehicular emissions. The heavy consumption of power semiconductors across several end use markets such as industrial, automotive, consumer electronics and renewable energy is a key growth driver of the power semiconductor market.

The telecommunications market is also a significant end-user of power semiconductors. This segment displays demand for radio frequency (“RF”) power amplifiers and IGBTs among others. With the launch of 5G, we believe the demand for power semiconductors is likely to increase.
 
Geographically, Asia Pacific accounts for the leading consumption of power semiconductors among other key regions. The region is also one of the leading exporters of power semiconductors in the world. The growth in the region is mainly attributed to China, which is the leading automotive and passenger vehicle market in the world. China is currently the leading consumer of power semiconductors. Furthermore, demand for power semiconductors is increasing from renewable energy sectors in the region.
 
Europe and North America are also leading consumers of power semiconductors among others in the global market.
 
Leading players in the global power semiconductor market include Infineon Technologies AG, Texas Instruments, ON Semiconductor, Fuji Electric Co. Ltd., ST Microelectronics N.V., Mitsubishi Electric Group, Semikron International GmbH, and Toshiba Corporation. While these companies are potential competitors, they are also potential licensees for our B-TRAN™ technology as there is not, to our knowledge, a high-efficiency bi-directional design available in the market. See “—Competition.”
 
Our Technology
 
To further improve the performance of our former bi-directional PPSA™ technology and products, we identified the need for a true bi-directional power switch and applied for and, in 2012, received a grant from the U.S. Department of Energy’s Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (“ARPA-E”) to develop a bi-directional solid-state power switch. At the outset, our efforts under the ARPA-E grant were focused on the development of, including the manufacturing process development for, a bi-directional insulated gate bipolar transistor (“BD-IGBT”). Although work on BD-IGBTs had previously been done by others in research labs, it was a technology that had not yet been commercialized.
 
Our former PPSA™-based products incorporate multiple IGBTs, which are power switches used in the process to convert power from one current form to another. IGBTs switch current in only one direction and require the use of a blocking diode to prevent current from flowing back through the system. To enable our former PPSA™ products to perform bi-directional power conversion, for each IGBT and diode used in our products, we were required to include a second IGBT and diode. These additional components have slight voltage drops that affect the electrical efficiency of our former PPSA™ products and generate heat that must be dissipated. To eliminate the need to utilize four devices to create one bi-directional switch and to improve the performance of bi-directional switching, a true bi-directional switch is necessary. While we initially focused on the development of a BD-IGBT under the ARPA-E grant, we shifted our focus under the grant to the development of a new, highly efficient power switch called a bi-directional bipolar transistor, or B-TRAN™, that we believe will allow us to substitute one B-TRAN™ for two pairs of IGBTs and diodes used in PPSA™ products but, more importantly, is a potential replacement for conventional power switches, such as IGBTs, in the broader power semiconductor market. The B-TRAN™ leverages many of the same processing steps we had developed for the BD-IGBT while also providing us with certain key advantages including patentability and higher efficiency compared to a BD-IGBT.
 
Based on third-party device software simulations and prototype testing to date, we believe that the B-TRANs™ can significantly improve electrical efficiency in power converters and many other power conversion applications. Compared to conventional power switches, such as IGBTs, we believe the B-TRAN™ will reduce power losses by 50% or more depending on the application. The higher efficiency would substantially reduce the heat generated by the operation of products utilizing this technology. As a result, products incorporating B-TRANs™ would have lower thermal management requirements. This in turn would require significantly smaller surface area required for heat dissipation which would enable increased power density, or power per pound, and potentially result in smaller original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, products. In addition, B-TRAN™’s symmetric bi-directional operation reduces the number of components by 75% as compared to a conventional bi-directional switch utilizing IGBTs and diodes. This highly efficient and, we believe, unique symmetric operation will potentially provide a strong competitive advantage in bi-directional applications which are growing at rapid rates due to the electrification of transportation and the shift to renewable energy coupled with energy storage.
 
Our testing of B-TRAN™ silicon dies and prototypes to date are consistent with third-party simulations that predict significant performance and efficiency improvements over conventional power switches such as silicon-controlled rectifiers (“SCRs”), IGBTs and MOSFETs. We have also successfully confirmed the proof of concept of double-sided B-TRAN™ prototypes, validating the ability to make B-TRAN™ semiconductor power switches using conventional silicon semiconductor fabrication equipment and processes. Test results on the standard double-sided prototypes measured B-TRAN™ electrical losses at less than 40% that of conventional power switches such as silicon IGBTs.

As part of the B-TRAN development process and in partnership with our semiconductor fabrication partner, we continue with additional B-TRAN™ wafer runs, incorporating the results of prior runs and subsequent testing into the B-TRAN™ wafer fabrication. With the double-sided transistor behavior and low conduction losses measured and upgrades and improvements in the manufacturing process implemented, the next goal is to complete the fabrication of prototype engineering samples for evaluation by potential partners. These samples will include a new packaging design, incorporating input from a design for manufacturability, or DFM, review from a commercial packaging house. The samples will also include a second-generation prototype driver. Initial samples will be packaged B-TRAN™ dies with the prototype driver. The coupling of packaged devices with a driver will form the basis of an intelligent power module. Feedback from potential customers in the engineering sampling program will be incorporated into the intelligent power module for commercialization.
 
The primary raw material used in the fabrications of B-TRAN™ devices is silicon wafers. Silicon is abundant and the production of silicon wafers is a large, global business with most manufacturers in Europe and Asia.
 
Business Strategy and Target Markets
 
Once we have completed the fabrication of engineering samples of packaged B-TRAN™ devices with a driver for engineering evaluation and evaluation by potential customers and partners, we intend to engage target customers for our B-TRAN™ utilizing a strategic partnership model.
 
Potential target markets for B-TRAN™ devices include, but are not limited to, electric and hybrid vehicles, electric vehicle charging, renewable energy and energy storage system power converters, uninterruptible power supplies (“UPS”) for data centers, industrial motor drives, direct current-based distribution and transmission switches and controls and other industrial and military markets. These markets typically utilize IGBTs for power switching in their applications. According to Mordor Intelligence, the IGBT market in 2020 was valued at $6 billion and is projected to be valued at $11 billion by 2026. We expect to initially target large and growing segments of the IGBT market, such as electric vehicles, electric vehicle charging, renewable energy and data center UPS systems. We expect the B-TRAN™ to provide a competitive advantage in the IGBT markets due to its higher expected efficiency and inherent bi-directionality, the growth in bi-directional applications such as electric vehicles and energy storage, and as it seems the IGBT has almost reached its technological limit. We are currently in the process of fully developing our commercialization strategy for our B-TRAN™ technology.
 
Intellectual Property
 
We rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, laws that protect intellectual property, confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions with our employees and others to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. As of December 31, 2020, we had 36 U.S. and 21 foreign issued patents on our B-TRAN™ technology as well as 27 additional pending U.S. and international patent applications on our B-TRAN™ technology. Our first B-TRAN™ patent issued in 2015 and our patents generally have a 20-year life prior to expiration. We expect to continue to build our patent estate for our B-TRAN™ technology and other technological developments that broaden the scope of our technology platform.
License Agreement
 
In 2015, we entered into licensing agreements which expire on February 7, 2033. Per the agreements, we have an exclusive royalty-free license associated with semiconductor power switches which enhances our intellectual property portfolio. The agreements include both fixed payments, all of which were paid prior to 2017, and ongoing variable payments. The variable payments are a function of the number of associated patent filings pending and patents issued under the agreements. We will pay $10,000 for each patent filing pending and $20,000 for each patent issued each year of the agreements, up to a maximum of $100,000 each year (i.e. five issued patents).
 
Through December 31, 2020, a total of three patents associated with the agreements were issued. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, the corresponding long-term liability for the estimated present value of future payments under the licensing agreement was $552,031 and $595,802, respectively.
 
Competition
 
We will compete against well-established incumbent power semiconductor device suppliers, including companies that already operate at a large scale in the single-sided (uni-directional) power switch market with IGBTs and MOSFETs, including silicon carbide MOSFETs. We expect that these power semiconductor device providers will base their products on current technologies serving the uni-directional power switch market, although we continue to monitor the competitive landscape for offerings or potential offerings based on new technologies. Many, if not all of our competitors, have greater financial resources, more comprehensive product offerings, broader market presence, longer standing relationships with business partners, longer operating histories, greater manufacturing capabilities, stronger brand recognition, and greater marketing resources than we have. To date, we are not aware of any offerings or potential offerings based on a true high efficiency bi-directional design other than our potential products based on our B-TRAN™ technology.

Power semiconductor device providers typically compete based on voltage, current and frequency capabilities with the larger providers offering a broad range of standard products, including discrete devices and modules. Smaller providers generally take a niche approach focused on a unique or customized device capability. Customers for these devices are typically looking for demonstrable product or system level improvements in efficiency and/or power density for their applications. Power semiconductor device providers utilize direct and indirect sales teams focused on capturing customer design wins.
 
Government Approval and Regulation
 
Government approval is not required for us to license our B-TRAN™ technology or sell B-TRAN™ devices. However, government support for certain of our potential target markets including electric and hybrid vehicles, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, renewable energy, grid storage, and improved grid resiliency, may impact the size and growth rate of these potential target markets.
Employees
 
As of February 28, 2021, we had 5 employees, all of whom are full-time employees. None of these employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our relationship with our employees is good.
