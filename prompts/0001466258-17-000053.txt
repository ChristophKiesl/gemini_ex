Acquisitions
On January 1, 2015, we completed the acquisition of the assets of Cameron International Corporation’s Centrifugal Compression (Engineered Centrifugal Compression) business for approximately $850 million. The acquired business manufactures centrifugal compression equipment and provides aftermarket parts and services for global industrial applications, air separation, gas transmission and process gas. The acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand and debt. The results of the Engineered Centrifugal Compression business have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition and reported within our Industrial segment.

On March 4, 2015, we acquired 100% of the outstanding stock of FRIGOBLOCK for approximately €100 million (approximately $113 million). The acquisition was funded through a combination of cash on hand and debt. The acquired business manufactures and designs transport refrigeration units for trucks and trailers, which it sells primarily in Western Europe. The results of the FRIGOBLOCK business have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition and reported within our Climate segment. 
Competitive Conditions
Our products and services are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. Due to the diversity of these products and services and the variety of markets served, we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line and services. They include well-established regional or specialized competitors, as well as larger U.S. and non-U.S. corporations or divisions of larger companies.
The principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price, quality, delivery, service and support, technology and innovation. We believe that we are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of HVAC systems and services, air compression systems, transport temperature control products, power tools, and golf, utility and consumer low-speed vehicles.
Distribution
Our products are distributed by a number of methods, which we believe are appropriate to the type of product. U.S. sales are made through branch sales offices, distributors and dealers across the country. Non-U.S. sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world.
Operations by Geographic Area
Approximately 35% of our net revenues in 2016 were derived outside the U.S. and we sold products in more than 100 countries. Therefore, the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country, such as currency devaluation, nationalization and establishment of common markets, may have an adverse impact on our non-U.S. operations. For a discussion of risks associated with our non-U.S. operations, see “Risk Factors – Our global operations subject us to economic risks,” and “Risk Factors – Currency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect our results,” in Item 1A and “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure about Market Risk” in Item 7A. Additional geographic data is provided in Note 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Customers
We have no customer that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenues in 2016, 2015 or 2014. No material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers; therefore, the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.
Raw Materials
We manufacture many of the components included in our products, which requires us to employ a wide variety of commodities. Principal commodities, such as steel, copper and aluminum, are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world. In the past, variability in prices for some commodities, particularly steel and non-ferrous metals, have caused margin pressure in some of our businesses. We have historically been able to adjust pricing with customers to maintain our margins; however, we may not always be able to offset these cost changes with price changes.
We believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future. There have been no commodity shortages which have had a material adverse effect on our businesses. However, significant changes in certain material costs may have an adverse impact on our costs and operating margins. To mitigate this potential impact, we enter into long-term supply contracts in order to manage our exposure to potential supply disruptions.
Working Capital
We manufacture products that must be readily available to meet our customers’ rapid delivery requirements. Therefore, we maintain an adequate level of working capital to support our business needs and our customers’ requirements. Such working capital requirements are not, however, in the opinion of management, materially different from those experienced by our major competitors. We believe our sales and payment terms are competitive in and appropriate for the markets in which we compete.
Seasonality
Demand for certain of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions. For instance, sales in our commercial and residential HVAC businesses historically tend to be seasonally higher in the second and third quarters of the year because this 
 5

represents summer in the U.S. and other northern hemisphere markets, which is the peak season for sales of air conditioning systems and services. Therefore, results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unexpected cool trends or unseasonably warm trends during the summer season could negatively or positively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations. 
Research and Development
We engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products, enhance existing product effectiveness, improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate. In addition, we continually evaluate developing technologies in areas that we believe will enhance our business for possible investment or acquisition. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position. 
Patents and Licenses
We own numerous patents and patent applications, and are licensed under others. Although in aggregate we consider our patents and licenses to be valuable to our operations, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single patent or license or any group of them. In our opinion, engineering, production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents and/or licenses.
Backlog
Our approximate backlog of orders, believed to be firm, at December 31, was as follows:

In millions | 2016 | | 2015
Climate | $ | 1,754.4 | | | $ | 1,557.0
Industrial | 443.2 | | | 574.0 | 
Total | $ | 2,197.6 | | | $ | 2,131.0

These backlog figures are based on orders received. While the major portion of our products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock, orders for specialized machinery or specific customer application are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision and deferral, and to a lesser extent cancellation or termination. We expect to ship substantially all the December 31, 2016 backlog during 2017.
Environmental Matters
We continue to be dedicated to an environmental program to reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials during the manufacturing process and to remediate identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities.
We are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency and similar state authorities. We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. For all such sites, there are other PRPs and, in most instances, our involvement is minimal.
In estimating our liability, we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis. Additional lawsuits and claims involving environmental matters are likely to arise from time to time in the future.
For a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities, see Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.
Asbestos Related Matters
Certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries are named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In many of the lawsuits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. None of our existing or previously-owned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos.
