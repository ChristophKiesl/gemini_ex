 We were founded in June 1996 by a team at Deloitte LLP (Deloitte), led by our chairman, Donald B. Murray, who was then a senior partner with Deloitte. Our founders created the Company to capitalize on the increasing demand for high quality outsourced professional services. We operated as a part of Deloitte until April 1999. In April 1999, we completed a management-led buyout. In December 2000, we completed our initial public offering of common stock and began trading on the NASDAQ Stock Market. We currently trade on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. We operate under the acronym RGP, the branding for our operating entity name of Resources Global Professionals. 
 Our business model combines the client service orientation and commitment to quality from our legacy as part of a Big Four accounting firm with the entrepreneurial culture of an innovative, agile and dynamic company. We are positioned to take advantage of what we believe are two continuing trends in the marketplace: constant change driving the need for agile, specialized talent in our global client base and a growing innovative talent pool interested in working in a non-traditional professional environment. We believe our business model allows us to simultaneously offer challenging yet flexible career opportunities to attract well qualified, experienced professionals and to attract clients with enterprise-wide, global consulting needs. 
 As of May 27, 2017, we employed or contracted with 2,569 consultants serving a diverse base of over 1,800 clients ranging from large multinational corporations to mid-sized companies to small entrepreneurial entities, in a broad range of industries. Our 
 
1 
 
 consultants have professional experience in a wide range of industries and functional areas and most have advanced professional degrees or designations. We offer our consultants careers that combine the flexibility of project-based consulting work with many of the advantages of working for a traditional professional services firm. 
 Our offices serve our multinational clients throughout the world with a client focus rather than from just a regional/office perspective. To enhance our ability to serve multinational clients, we served our clients from 43 offices in the United States and from 24 offices within 21 countries abroad as of May 27, 2017. 
 Revenue from the Companys major geographic areas was as follows (in thousands): 
 

 | Revenue for theFor the Years Ended | | | | | % of Total
 | May 27, 2017 | | May 28, 2016 | | | %Change | May 27,2017 | | May 28,2016 | 
North America | $ | 479,263 | | $ | 499,229 | | (4.0 | )% | | 82.1 | % | 83.4 | %

 See Note 14  Segment Information and Enterprise Reporting  to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the Companys domestic and international operations and Part I Item 1A, Risk Factors  Our ability to serve clients internationally is integral to our strategy and our international activities expose us to additional operational challenges that we might not otherwise face for information regarding the risks attendant to our international operations. 
 We believe our distinctive culture is a valuable asset and is, in large part, due to our management team, which has extensive experience in the professional services industry. Most of our senior management and office managing directors have Big Four, management consulting and/or Fortune 500 experience and an equity interest in the Company. This team has created a culture of professionalism and a client service orientation that we believe fosters in our consultants a feeling of personal responsibility for, and pride in, client projects and enables us to deliver high-quality service and results to our clients. 
 Industry Background 
 Changing Market for Project- or Initiative-Based Professional Services 
 RGPs services respond to a growing marketplace trend: namely, corporate clients are increasingly choosing to plan for their workforce needs in more agile ways. Permanent headcount is being reduced as clients purposely engage agile talent for project initiatives and transformation work. 
 While the market for professional services is broad and fragmented and independent data on the size of the market is not readily available, we believe companies may be more willing to choose alternatives to permanent headcount and traditional professional service providers because of evolving economic competitive pressure and significant increases in government-led regulatory requirements, such as the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. We believe RGP is positioned as a viable alternative to traditional accounting, consulting and law firms in numerous instances because, by using project consultants, companies can: 

 | Strategically access specialized skills, expertise for projects of set duration
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Effectively supplement internal resources
--+------------------------------------------


 | Increase labor flexibility
--+---------------------------


 | Reduce their overall hiring, training and termination costs
--+------------------------------------------------------------

 Typically, companies use a variety of alternatives to fill their project needs. Companies outsource entire projects to consulting firms which provides them access to the expertise of the firm but often entails significant cost and less management control of the 
 
2 
 
 project. Companies also supplement their internal resources with employees from the Big Four accounting firms or other traditional professional services firms. Companies use temporary employees from traditional and Internet-based staffing firms, although these employees may be less experienced or less qualified than employees from professional services firms. Finally, some companies rely solely on their own employees who may lack the requisite time, experience or skills. 
 Supply of Project Consultants 
 Based on discussions with our consultants, we believe the number of professionals seeking to work on an agile basis has historically increased due to a desire for: 

 | More flexible hours and work arrangements, coupled with a professional culture that offers competitive wages and benefits
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Challenging engagements that advance their careers, develop their skills and add to their experience base
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | A work environment that provides a diversity of, and more control over, client engagements
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Alternate employment opportunities in regions throughout the world
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 The employment alternatives available to professionals may fulfill some, but not all, of an individuals career objectives. A professional working for a Big Four firm or a consulting firm may receive challenging assignments and training, but may encounter a career path with less choice and less flexible hours, extensive travel and limited control over work engagements. Alternatively, a professional who works as an independent contractor faces the ongoing task of sourcing assignments and significant administrative burdens. 
 Resources Global Professionals Solution 
 We believe RGP is positioned to capitalize on the confluence of the industry trends described above. We believe, based on discussions with our clients, that RGP provides the agility that companies desire in todays competitive and quickly evolving environment. We are able to combine all of the following: 

 | A relationship-oriented and collaborative approach with our clients
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Client service teams with Big Four, consulting and/or industry backgrounds to assess our clients project needs and customize solutions to meet those needs
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Highly qualified consultants with the requisite expertise, experience and points of view
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Competitive rates on an hourly, rather than project, basis
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


 | Significant client control of their projects with effective knowledge transfer and change management
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Resources Global Professionals Strategy 
 Our Business Strategy 
 We are dedicated to serving our clients with highly qualified and experienced talent in support of projects and initiatives in a broad array of functional areas, including accounting; finance; corporate governance, risk and compliance management; corporate advisory, strategic communications and restructuring; information management; human capital; supply chain management; and legal and regulatory. Our objective is to be the leading provider of agile consulting services for companies facing transformation, change and compliance challenges. We have developed the following business strategies to achieve our objectives: 

 | Hire and retain highly qualified, experienced consultants. We believe our highly qualified, experienced consultants provide us with a distinct competitive advantage. Therefore, one of our priorities is to continue to attract and retain high-caliber consultants. We believe we have been successful in attracting and retaining qualified professionals by providing challenging work assignments, competitive compensation and benefits, and continuing education and training opportunities, while offering flexible work schedules and more control over choosing client engagements.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
3 
 
Maintain our distinctive culture. Our corporate culture is the foundation of our business strategy and we believe it has been a significant component of our success. Our senior management, virtually all of whom are Big Four or other professional services firm alumni, has created a culture that combines the commitment to quality and the client service focus of a Big Four firm with the entrepreneurial energy of an innovative, high-growth company. We seek consultants and management with talent, integrity, enthusiasm and loyalty (TIEL, an acronym used frequently within the Company) to strengthen our team and support our ability to provide clients with high-quality services and solutions. We believe our culture has been instrumental to our success in hiring and retaining highly qualified employees and, in turn, attracting quality clients. 
 

 | Build consultative relationships with clients. We emphasize a relationship-oriented approach to business rather than a transaction-oriented or assignment-oriented approach. We believe the professional services experience of our management and consultants enables us to understand the needs of our clients and to deliver an integrated, relationship-oriented approach to meeting their professional services requirements. We regularly meet with our existing and prospective clients to understand their business issues and help them define their project needs. Once an initiative is defined, we identify consultants with the appropriate skills and experience to meet the clients objectives. We believe that by establishing relationships with our clients to solve their professional services needs, we are more likely to generate new opportunities to serve them. The strength and depth of our client relationships is demonstrated by two key statistics: 1) during fiscal 2017, 49 of our 50 largest clients used more than one practice area and 40 of those top 50 clients used three or more practice areas; and 2) 45 of our largest 50 clients in fiscal 2012 remained clients in fiscal 2017 while 37 of our top 50 clients in 2008 were still clients in 2017. In addition, during fiscal 2017 our top 50 clients were served by an average of six RGP offices, demonstrating the breadth of our relationships with clients world-wide.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Build the RGP brand. Our objective is to build RGPs reputation as the premier provider of agile consulting services for companies facing transformation, change and compliance challenges. Our primary means of building our brand is by consistently providing high-quality, value-added services to our clients. We have also focused on building a significant referral network through our 2,569 consultants and 732 management and administrative employees working from offices in 21 countries as of May 27, 2017. In addition, we have global, regional and local marketing efforts that reinforce the RGP brand.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy 
 Since inception, our growth has been primarily organic rather than via acquisition. We believe we have significant opportunity for continued organic growth in our core business as the global economy strengthens and economic uncertainties decrease and, in addition that we can grow opportunistically through strategic acquisitions. In both our core and acquired businesses, key elements of our growth strategy include: 

 | Expanding work from existing clients. A principal component of our strategy is to secure additional work from the clients we have served. We believe, based on discussions with our clients, the amount of revenue we currently receive from many of our clients represents a relatively small percentage of the amount they spend on professional services, and, consistent with historic industry trends, they may continue to increase the amount they spend on these services as the global economy evolves. We believe that by continuing to deliver high-quality services and by further developing our relationships with our clients, we can capture a significantly larger share of our clients expenditures for professional services. Near the end of fiscal 2017, we launched our Strategic Client Program to serve a number of our largest clients with dedicated global account teams.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Growing our client base. We will continue to focus on attracting new clients. We strive to develop new client relationships primarily by leveraging the significant contact networks of our management and consultants and through referrals from existing clients. We believe we can continue to attract new clients by building our brand name and reputation, supplemented by our global, regional and local marketing efforts. We anticipate our growth efforts this year will focus on identifying strategic target accounts especially in the large and middle market client segments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Expanding geographically. We have expanded geographically to meet the demand for agile professional services around the world and currently have offices in 21 countries. We believe, based upon our clients requests, there are future opportunities to promote growth globally. Consequently, we intend to continue to expand our international presence on a
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
4 
 

strategic and opportunistic basis. We may also add to our existing domestic office network when our existing clients have a need or if there is a significant new client opportunity.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Providing additional professional service offerings. We will continue to develop and consider entry into new professional service offerings. Since our founding, we have diversified our professional service offerings from a primary focus on accounting and finance to other areas in which our clients have significant needs such as human capital; information management; governance, risk and compliance; supply chain management; legal and regulatory services; and corporate advisory, strategic communications and restructuring services. In fiscal 2017, we formed our Integrated Solutions group to identify project opportunities that we can market at an enterprise level with talent, tools and methodologies. This group commercializes projects into solution offerings. Currently, our solutions practice is focused on M&A Integration Services, Data Solutions and Technical Accounting Services. Our considerations when evaluating new solutions offerings include cultural fit, growth potential, profitability, cross-marketing opportunities and competition.

Consultants 
 We believe an important component of our success has been our highly qualified and experienced consultants. As of May 27, 2017, we employed or contracted with 2,569 consultants engaged with clients. Our consultants have professional experience in a wide range of industries and functional areas. We provide our consultants with challenging work assignments, competitive compensation and benefits, and continuing education and training opportunities, while offering more choice concerning work schedules and more control over choosing client engagements. 
 Almost all of our consultants in the United States are employees of RGP. We typically pay each consultant an hourly rate for each consulting hour worked and for certain administrative time and overtime premiums, and offer benefits, including: paid time off and holidays; a discretionary bonus program; group medical and dental programs, each with an approximate 30-50% contribution by the consultant; a basic term life insurance program; a 401(k) retirement plan with a discretionary company match; and professional development and career training. Typically, a consultant must work a threshold number of hours to be eligible for all of these benefits. In addition, we offer our consultants the ability to participate in the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP), which enables them to purchase shares of the Companys stock at a discount. We intend to maintain competitive compensation and benefit programs. 
 Internationally, our consultants are a blend of employees and independent contractors. Independent contractor arrangements are more common abroad than in the United States due to the labor laws, tax regulations and customs of the international markets we serve. A few international practices also utilize a partial bench model; that is, certain consultants are paid a weekly salary rather than for each consulting hour worked with bonus eligibility based upon utilization. 
 Clients 
 We provide our services and solutions to a diverse client base in a broad range of industries. In fiscal 2017, we served over 1,800 clients from offices located in 21 countries. Our revenues are not concentrated with any particular client or within any particular industry. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of revenue for the years ended May 27, 2017, May 28, 2016 and May 30, 2015, and in fiscal 2017, our 10 largest clients accounted for approximately 15% of our revenues. 
 The clients listed below represent the multinational and industry diversity of our client base: 
 

Aetna Inc. | IBM Bluemix Infrastructure (SoftLayer)
AIG | Kaiser Permanente

Services and Products 
 RGPs business model and operating philosophy are rooted in the support of client-led projects and consulting initiatives, extending to advisory-based services that leverage the deep experience and expertise of our internal team while partnering with our clients business leaders. Often, we deliver our services to clients across multiple functional areas of expertise with consultants from several disciplines working on the same project. Our areas of core competency include: finance and accounting; information management; human capital; corporate advisory, strategic communications and restructuring services; legal and regulatory; governance, risk and compliance; and supply chain management. 
Finance & Accounting 
 RGPs Finance and Accounting services encompass accounting operations, financial reporting, internal controls, financial analyses and business transactions.

We provide specialized skills and then transfer knowledge to clients in order to help them leverage their own personnel. RGP specializes in providing customized solutions to our clients most pressing business problems, through project management and providing access to full project teams for a specific initiative.

 Sample Engagement  Cross-practice area M&A Joint Venture Assessment and Integration Execution: A large U.S. based manufacturing company engaged RGP to execute a 50/50 joint venture with another manufacturer. Using RGPs proprietary M&A integration framework, our team of 22 consultants helped the client through integration planning, execution and transformation. RGP set up the Integration Management Office (IMO) to provide the client with program and project management, change management, synergy management, and reporting/metrics. Functioning as an extension of the company, 
 
6 
 
 RGPs team provided the following services, which serve as a rigorous example of its cross-discipline functionality between our practice areas: 
 

 | Supported the integration execution across all functional areas of the company, including:

 Sample Engagement  Revenue Recognition Assessment and Solution: RGP led the execution and solution design for a U.S. based provider of global customer-experience technology in order to comply with the requirements of the Financial Accounting Standards Boards (FASB) revenue recognition guidance, Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers and subsequently issued amendments (Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 606). RGP led the clients ASC 606 assessment by gathering data, analyzing contracts, identifying issues and documenting accounting conclusions. Subsequently, RGP led the effort to align stakeholders, define future-state processes to address gaps and develop the application and data roadmap. 
 RGPs efforts consisted of two phases: Phase 1  Impact Assessment and Phase 2  Solution Design. Our consultants activities included: 
 

 | Project managing the initiative, including developing the project plan, establishing project governance, identifying key stakeholders and providing training to facilitate appropriate client employee engagement
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cataloging of collected data to obtain a comprehensive view of revenue streams, contract data and other critical elements across the company, including identifying contract populations and determining grouping strategy for future analysis of representative contract samples
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Identifying and documenting an enterprise view of Revenue Recognition generated impacts across departments (accounting, sales, others), processes (order to cash, deal desk, invoicing) and systems (technical architecture, system selection)
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 By partnering with the client, RGP was able to help the client leadership team understand the extent of changes caused by the new revenue recognition standard and how current, manual processes wouldnt be able to scale. The client was also able to identify process and technology integration challenges resulting from several previous acquisitions. 
 RGP worked with the client to develop an integrated, cross-departmental and phased implementation plan to address the revenue recognition gaps while also solving inherited selected integration challenges from legacy systems.

Sample Engagement  Reorganization, Bankruptcy Support and Human Capital: A U.S. clothing manufacturer and retailer was unable to meet its financial obligations in 2015 and filed for Chapter 11 protection in U.S. bankruptcy court. The client initially hired RGP for a three-week engagement to analyze and reconcile their critical vendor claims. It was important to complete this reconciliation quickly in order for the continued flow of goods from their vendors. 
 The clients satisfaction with the initial project led to expansion of the engagement to include an analysis and reconciliation of required supplier claims just prior to the bankruptcy filing, plus administration claims and bankruptcy court reporting, including monthly financial reports. 
 Because of employee layoffs as well as employee attrition due to the Chapter 11 filing, the company was unable to perform certain critical functions. RGP provided consultants to serve as interim controller; AP Manager; Budgeting Manager and HR Manager, including the handling of WARN Act notices, layoffs and COBRA matters. With RGPs support, the company successfully exited bankruptcy. 
 This client continued to have financial difficulty and filed chapter 11 again. RGP was hired to reconcile all of the claims and assist with the claims objections. In addition, during the second engagement RGP provided personnel to clean up and manage AP records, financial reporting, bankruptcy court reporting and prepare 1099 tax forms. 
 Sample Engagement  Transition of Accounting Cycle Processes Following Significant Acquisition: A Fortune 500 retail company that recently completed a significant acquisition of a competitor embarked on a comprehensive program to recognize synergies from the overlap of certain back-office functions. Under a lift & shift scenario, the client engaged RGP to assess the current state of revenue, cash and payables processes for the acquired company and to develop and execute a plan to transition those functions to the clients existing shared services centers around the world. 
Information Management 
 RGPs Information Management practice provides planning and execution services in four primary areas: program & project management; business & technology integration; data strategy & management; and IT strategy & advisory. By focusing on the initiative as defined by our clients, RGP can provide continuity of service from the creation or expansion of an overall IT strategy through post-implementation support. In addition to these services, we assist clients in implementation of a variety of technology solutions: enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems; strategic front-of-the-house systems; human resources (HR) information systems; supply chain management systems; core finance and accounting systems; audit compliance systems; and financial reporting, planning and consolidation systems.

 Sample Engagement  Identification of Significant Inefficiencies and Proposed Solutions: Our client, a large multinational consumer goods company, experienced significant monthly losses due to material waste. Our clients challenge was to find a way to identify areas of cost savings swiftly and effectively, with better data analytics. 
 RGP finance and data specialists, working with the clients IT team, analyzed operating conditions, and designed statistical models and dashboard reporting. As a result, the client now has a weekly view into its material inventory and can initiate stock transfers between factories so that excess material can be utilized where needed, avoiding potential costly write-offs. By identifying production costs across all factories, the client has quick insight into causes of variance and can take action in a timely manner. In addition, relevant factory teams can be held responsible and receive best practice training to improve efficiencies. Finally, the client can utilize the insights to make more efficient capital expenditure decisions for factories using outdated machinery. 
 Sample Engagement  Improvement in Data Analytics and Data Management Capabilities: A U.S. based public utility wanted to strengthen its advanced analytics capabilities: enterprise reporting, analytic competency and data management capabilities. RGP consultants were tasked to: 
 

 | Address data quality issues
--+----------------------------


 | Improve operational efficiencies for better support, control and ownership of data
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Automate data integration across applications to improve operational effectiveness
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Leading a multi-year data strategy project to deliver improved analytic and data value to departments in Finance, HR, Marketing, IT, Generation, Transmission & Distributio (T&D), RGP consultants initiated and operationalized data management to ensure accurate and reliable data to support company decisions and to fulfill the vision of managing data as a strategic asset. Tasks included: 
 

 | Mobilizing domain teams to define data terms and develop data warehouse requirements
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Orienting teams to data dictionary, data modeling, issue management, data warehouse requirements, testing, training and sustaining processes
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Using the work of RGP consultants, the company improved workforce management and work scheduling for T&D through standardized generation, improved company profitability by reducing costs in finance, HR and IT, and improved supply chain vendor and contract management. 
 Sample Engagement  Project Leadership for Global Next Generation Program: A Fortune 50 automotive company is implementing a global program to create the next generation of connected vehicle technology and infotainment applications for all North American vehicle production. The RGP team leads the coordination and integration of a highly complex set of services that requires the seamless integration of six external suppliers and eight internal teams, to create a new customer facing registration portal, secure global network and real-time interfaces needed to enable the new services. 
 RGP consultants serve as technical program management across 13 defined work streams as well as a variety of internal systems integrations that span enterprise infrastructure. The project also includes systems implementation in the form of architecture support and complex systems integration across the 14 teams building the technology components.

 RGP has been retained to provide advisory services to assist in putting together best practices, protocols, quality control, training, metrics and other tasks related to overall project management, as well as attorneys to provide substantive legal expertise by conducting the rights analysis of the contracts and capturing consistent and accurate data. The project is business critical  the new system must ultimately be an effective tool that helps drive revenue, enforce compliance and mitigate risk. 
 Sample Engagement  Assessment to Mitigate Reputational Harm, Regulatory Exposure and Litigation Risk: The senior management of a global entity, which had grown rapidly via acquisition to over $2.5 billion in revenue and 100,000 employees, asked RGP to assist in the assessment of mitigation of potential reputational harm, regulatory exposure and litigation risk. In particular, management was concerned about their ability to ensure the security of sensitive financial and personal information for customers, tracking of its contractual commitments, and adherence to applicable laws and regulations. The goal was to assess risk, protect from reputational harm, mitigate against regulatory exposure and litigation and communicate to its clients that the company is a trusted business partner and world-class organization. 
 
14 
 
RGP was selected to create and conduct a compliance risk assessment. Using the work of RGP consultants, the assessment will position our client to present the following information to the companys Board of Directors:

 Sample Engagement  Unbundling Support for M&A Activity: Our client, a world leader in the in-flight entertainment and communication solutions business, turned to RGP for supplemental support and expertise in connection with a buy-side acquisition. The clients general counsel engaged us to supplement the bandwidth of the in-house team. Our consultants drove the diligence process, collaborated extensively with internal business units and, working closely with lead outside counsel who focused on the strategy and structure of the deal, assisted in the drafting of deal documents. The client reduced its legal spend by multi-sourcing the work needed to support the transaction. 
 Sample Engagement  Law Department Organizational Design: The new general counsel for a multi-billion dollar energy and specialty refining company asked RGP to redesign its legal department structure from the ground up. A series of acquisitions, coupled with a more complex business environment, increased the departments work flows. Our consultants conducted extensive stakeholder interviews and an analysis of department operations to develop an organizational model stressing business continuity, best practices in organizational design, areas of process and resourcing improvement, and organizational development. RGPs solution resulted in a leaner legal team that leverages effective and efficient legal services providers, while implementing in-house efficiencies and automation. 
 Sample Engagement  Development and Implementation of Knowledge Management Tool: Our client, a multi-million dollar asset management firm, lacked an efficient tool for handling information related to its investment/private equity funds. As a result, in-house attorneys often started deals without the benefit of knowledge gleaned from previously negotiated agreements. Documents were difficult to locate, important deal information was lost, and providing information to regulators and third parties was often time consuming and inefficient. 
 RGP designed a knowledge management tool to increase efficiencies in the clients deal flow and archiving process. RGP crafted a simple searchable database tool that provided an effective way to access, retrieve, archive and leverage important deal information. RGP also conducted a gap analysis on missing deal documents and developed training to ensure attorney buy-in and acceptance of the management tool. 
 Supply Chain Management 
 RGPs Supply Chain Management practice assists clients in the planning, execution, maintenance and troubleshooting of complex supply chain systems and processes.

 Sample Engagement Negotiation, Monitoring and Supervision of Construction Projects: Our client, a Fortune 1000 technology company, has multiple priorities in procurement and design of internal construction projects. Working with the clients personnel, RGP consultants oversaw the negotiation and implementation of construction/redesign projects at the clients corporate headquarters. The clients primary concerns were: design consistency with the companys culture, operating within a set budget, and on-time completion of the various projects. 
 RGP provided procurement personnel to work closely with our clients counterparts to negotiate, monitor, and supervise construction projects. In addition, RGP consultants provided budget management for the clients procurement department and an advisory/quality assurance lead. The client lacked procurement expertise and construction/real estate sourcing knowledge. RGP built a detailed timeline collaborating with the client and their commercial real estate company. Our consultants negotiated project costs leveraging future growth opportunities, especially with subcontractor firms, reviewed quotes, researched benchmarks and imposed cost structure across the clients organization. In addition, RGP worked with the clients legal department to negotiate and document contract parameters. Ultimately, the client estimates it was able to achieve a 6.5% cost savings. 
 Sample Engagement  Vendor Risk Management Software Selection and Monitoring: A publicly-traded financial services company wanted to effectively and proactively identify and manage previously unaddressed significant vendor risks. Working collaboratively, a cross-functional team of client personnel and RGP consultants developed a comprehensive vendor performance monitoring function. The team identified three key project work streams: 1) establishment of solutions to support and maintain the clients third party vendor management processes, systems, standards and metrics tracking; 2) development of user guides and materials and training on the selected software tool to support the function; 3) development and support of the day to day processes to ensure compliance with regulations, guidelines and firm requirements. Specifically, RGP was responsible for: 

 | Developing the framework and vendor scorecards

 Sample Engagement  Improvement in On-Line Checkout: A U.S. based product distributor initiated a major campaign to drive consumers to using an e-commerce platform. However, during checkout, customers realized that shipping and handling fees associated with the purchase were too high, resulting in an 80% cart abandonment rate and a significant loss in sales. In the current e-commerce environment, consumers have been trained to expect free shipping, free shipping over a specific order value or flat rate shipping. 
 The client engaged RGP to identify short term solutions to reduce shipping and handling charges prior to the next selling season, as well as longer term ideas for future releases. After conducting a four week assessment of the recent sales cycle and associated data, RGP consultants provided specific recommendations to reduce shipping and handling costs, reduce the order cycle and transit time and reduce packaging waste. In addition, observations were made to improve the consumer experience, with the goal of increasing sales. 
 
16 
 
Sample Engagement  Procure-to-Pay Assessment: A large multinational consumer electronic company needed assistance in conducting an assessment of its Procure-to-Pay process to review performance and to identify recommendations to fill gaps. The client had two primary goals: 1) to assess the current state; and 2) to provide insights on the future state, with comparison to leading practices and a high-level implementation roadmap.

 | Outlining benefits of using the new Oracle system
--+--------------------------------------------------

--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Developing recommendations for future state, including ways to maximize effectiveness and efficiency, optimizing cost structures and mitigating risk exposures
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sample Engagement  Cost Recovery Review: One of the worlds largest multinational energy companies engaged RGP to provide services to ensure contract compliance and to identify cost recovery opportunities with a supplier of significant services. Performing services at the supplier location, the RGP consultants developed the procedure plan, conducted supplier interviews, performed test work on selected transactions and issued a final report. The findings ultimately resulted in a recovery for the client and an enhanced understanding with the supplier. 
Governance, Risk and Compliance (GRC): Corporate Governance, Risk Management, Internal Audit and Compliance Services 
 RGPs GRC practice assists clients with a variety of governance, risk management, internal audit and compliance initiatives. The professionals in our GRC practice have experience in operations, controllership and internal and external audit and serve our clients in any number of roles required  from program manager to team member. In addition to helping clients worldwide in the areas of audit, risk and compliance, we are able to draw on RGPs other practice areas to bring the required business expertise to the engagement.

 Sample Engagement  Global Internal Audit & Internal Controls Delivery: A global technology leader decided to outsource its internal controls testing and co-source its internal audit needs, engaging RGP on a multi-year co-sourcing and advisory contract. During the transition phase, RGP created a core delivery team of experts and set up a dedicated, offshored testing/audit center. 
 
17 
 
For internal audit, RGP carries out internal audits on behalf of the client, following the clients specific audit methodology. Deploying consultants from our offices in cities where our client has operations, RGP adds local knowledge and skills to the clients fieldwork. To fully integrate the methodology, RGP created customized onboarding and training. 
 For internal controls testing, the client leverages RGP in a cost-efficient manner versus developing its own larger internal audit team. In addition, by leveraging industry best practices in control and finance compliance audits, RGP provides our client with better insights into more efficient ways of working and control. The client further leverages cost control by having RGP consultants perform a large portion of independent (local) testing to reduce time and budget of the external auditor. 
 Sample Engagement  Creation of Corporate Compliance Function: A leading independent specialty chemical company needed an effective compliance program to meet federal regulations and all necessary standards, procedures and training to support it. RGP established the clients first corporate compliance function with three major areas of significance: Foreign Corrupt Practices Act compliance (FCPA), Global trade compliance (OFAC) and Federal Acquisition Regulation compliance (FAR). RGP provided the client with the overall compliance framework, policies, procedures and tools necessary to support an effective compliance program. 
 Sample Engagement  Enterprise Risk Management: A Fortune 1000 U.S. based financial services company launched an initiative to significantly increase the risk governance and standardization of project management within their organization. Our enterprise risk management consultants focused on establishing more consistent, simplified processes to optimize the risk management process and create ways to identify and implement standardization of reporting, process and procedures across all lines of business. Our work will establish a comprehensive view of projects, enabling reporting and escalation to significantly mitigate their risk. 
 Sample Engagement  Documentation and Enhancement of Internal Controls in Preparation for IPO or Sale: A highly profitable and fast growing maker of electronic equipment had both inadequate IT general controls and poor documentation of its processes. As a result, highly detailed and expensive substantive audit procedures needed to be performed in order to prepare financial statements for a contemplated IPO or sale of the company. Serving as project manager and change management lead, RGP consultants performed an assessment of IT general controls, identified critical risk areas and prepared detailed action plans to remediate or implement controls. 
 Sample Engagement  Documentation and Enhancement of Internal Controls: A rapidly growing maker of automation software needed an assessment of current state business processes and internal controls at its U.S. and India operations for Sarbanes and general business purposes. Our consultants documented current state of internal controls, made recommendations for enhanced future state of controls and presented our findings to executive management. The assessments identified a significant number of high risk items that the client was unaware of, with actionable recommendations for improvement. 
 Sample Engagement  Banking Compliance Support: Our client, a Fortune 500 financial services company, wanted to develop and implement a more formal approach to the assessment of the companys regulatory risk profile. Previously, decisions on assessment of regulatory risk were more of an intuitive exercise than a formalized methodology. To help the client evolve its process, RGP was responsible for the entire project, including: 

 | Identifying risk topics for each product type (real estate loans, consumer loans, credit cards, deposits, trusts and others)
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Determining gaps in regulation coverage
--+----------------------------------------


 | Creating risk statements for each product
--+------------------------------------------


 | Defining the inherent and control risk definitions
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | Building and scoring the templates to be used to document the efforts
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

 The final deliverable allowed bank management to better allocate limited resources to maximize coverage of critical compliance issues using the quantifiable basis of risk assessment. Ultimately, RGP consultants deployed the methodology through other facets of the companys operation, including property/casualty and life insurance and investment management. 
 
18 
 
Sample Engagement  Audit IT Security Controls: The CIO of a global healthcare company headquartered in Europe planned a series of global IT audits. Working as a part of a client team, RGP was responsible for an assessment of the strength and sophistication of the IT security organization, implementation of the IT security governance model, conducting a series of interviews with top management stakeholders in the IT organization, and transfer of knowledge on audit techniques. 
 policyIQ 
 RGPs policyIQ is our proprietary cloud-based GRC software application, enabling the focused management of a wide range of GRC processes, including Risk Assessments, Sarbanes Compliance, Policy and Procedure Management, Internal Audit Programs, Anti-Corruption Compliance and Contract Administration. policyIQ can be implemented quickly to manage a specific aspect of an overall GRC program, or easily scaled to integrate multiple initiatives, allowing the organization to realize greater efficiency. In addition, our engagement teams often utilize policyIQ as a tool to assist in the efficient collection, storing and review of project workpapers, deliverables and other critical project content. Business problems that our clients have used policyIQ to resolve include: 
 

 | Sarbanes Compliance Management: Clients use policyIQ to manage their entire Sarbanes compliance program, from risk assessment through remediation tracking. Electronic forms automate quarterly certifications, and reporting allows all stakeholders insight into the status of Sarbanes compliance at any time.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Policy and Procedure Management: With policyIQ as the central location for all organizational policies and procedures, all employees have access to the most current documentation  and using electronic forms, can easily document annual proof of compliance.

 | Contract Management: policyIQ provides a central, secure location to house all contract documentation, allowing companies to index contracts for ease of searching and align view, edit and approve security appropriately. By utilizing custom fields to capture standard meta data, contracts can be categorized and communications established to alert all stakeholders of upcoming renewals or milestones.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sample Engagement  Fresh Approach to Sarbanes Compliance: For a publicly traded manufacturing company with global operations, RGP was engaged to bring efficiency and consistency to its Sarbanes compliance and internal audit programs. Using policyIQ, our consulting team was able to: 

 | Implement the 2013 COSO Framework, with mapping to entity level controls, in order to meet expectations by external auditors and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Integrate workflow processes on all control reviews and audit testing to improve quality assurance over documentation and oversight on audit testing
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Establish consistent processes for Sarbanes documentation and testing across multiple business units
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Operations 
 We generally provide our professional services to clients at a local level, with the oversight of our regional managing directors and consultation of our corporate management team. The managing director, client service director(s) and recruiting director(s) in each office are responsible for initiating client relationships, identifying consultants specifically skilled to perform client projects, ensuring client and consultant satisfaction throughout engagements and maintaining client relationships post-engagement. Throughout this process, the corporate management team and regional managing directors are available to consult with the managing director with respect to client services. 
 Our offices operate in an entrepreneurial manner. The managing directors of our offices are given significant autonomy in the daily operations of their respective offices, and are responsible for overall guidance and supervision, budgeting and forecasting, 
 
19 
 
 sales and marketing, pricing and hiring within their office. We believe a substantial portion of the buying decisions made by our clients are made on a local or regional basis and that our offices most often compete with other professional services providers on a local or regional basis. Because our managing directors are in the best position to understand the local and regional outsourced professional services market and because clients often prefer local relationships, we believe a decentralized operating environment maximizes operating performance and contributes to employee and client satisfaction. 
 We believe our ability to deliver professional services successfully to clients is dependent on our managing directors working together as a collegial and collaborative team, at times working jointly on client projects. To build a sense of team effort and increase camaraderie among our managing directors, we have an incentive program for our office management that awards annual bonuses based on both the performance of the Company and the performance of the individual. We also share across the Company the best and most effective practices of our highest achieving offices and use this as an introductory tool with new managing directors. New managing directors also spend time with another practice, partnering with experienced managing directors and other senior management personnel. This allows the veteran managing directors to share their success stories, foster the culture of the Company with new managing directors and review specific client and consultant development programs. We believe these team-based practices enable us to better serve clients who prefer a centrally organized service approach. 
 From our corporate headquarters in Irvine, California, we provide centralized administrative, marketing, finance, HR, IT, legal and real estate support. Our financial reporting is also centralized in our corporate service center. This center handles invoicing, accounts payable and collections, and administers HR services including employee compensation and benefits administration for North American offices. We also have a business support operations center in our Utrecht, Netherlands office to provide centralized finance, HR, IT, payroll and legal support to our European offices. In addition, in North America, we have a corporate networked IT platform with centralized financial reporting capabilities and a front office client management system. These centralized functions minimize the administrative burdens on our office management and allow them to spend more time focused on client and consultant development. 
 Business Development 
 Our business development initiatives are composed of: 
 

 | local and global initiatives focused on existing clients and target companies
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | national and international targeting efforts focused on multinational companies
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | brand marketing activities
--+---------------------------


 | national and local advertising and direct mail programs
--+--------------------------------------------------------

 Our business development efforts are driven by the networking and sales efforts of our management. In addition, the local office managing directors are assisted by management professionals focused on business development efforts on a national basis based on firm-wide and industry-focused initiatives. These business development professionals, teamed with the managing director and client service teams, are responsible for initiating and fostering relationships with the senior management and decision makers of our targeted client companies. During fiscal 2017, we commenced implementation of software from SalesForce.com as a tool to enhance our local and worldwide business development efforts. 
 We believe that our national marketing efforts have been effective in generating incremental revenues from existing clients and developing new client relationships. Our brand marketing initiatives help develop RGPs image in the markets we serve. Our brand is reinforced by our professionally designed website, print, and online advertising, direct marketing, seminars, initiative-oriented brochures, social media and public relations efforts. We believe our branding initiatives, coupled with our high-quality client service, help to differentiate us from our competitors and to establish RGP as a credible and reputable global professional services firm.

 We compete for clients on the basis of the quality of professionals, the timely availability of professionals with requisite skills, the scope and price of services, and the geographic reach of services. We believe our attractive value proposition, consisting of our highly qualified consultants, relationship-oriented approach and professional culture, enables us to differentiate ourselves from our competitors. Although we believe we compete favorably with our competitors, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources, generate greater revenues and have greater name recognition than we do.

 As of May 27, 2017, we had a total of 3,301 employees, including 732 corporate and local office employees and 2,569 consultants. Our employees are not covered by any collective bargaining agreements.
