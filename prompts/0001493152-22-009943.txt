References in this report to “we,” “us” or the “Company” refer to Genesis Unicorn Capital Corp. References to our “management” or our “management team” refer to our officers and directors, and references to the “Sponsor” refer to Genesis Unicorn Capital LLC, a Delaware limited liability company.
 
Company Profile
 
Genesis Unicorn Capital Corp. was formed on February 23, 2021 formed under the laws of the State of Delaware, as a blank check company for the purpose of engaging in a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar Business Combination, with one or more target businesses or entities (a “Business Combination”). While we may pursue an Initial Business Combination target in any business, industry, sector or geographic location, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify promising opportunities at the intersection of the healthcare and technology industries, specifically within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors. Our objective is to focus on middle market and emerging growth businesses operating with a total enterprise value from $200 million to $1 billion, which companies may be located throughout the world except for an entity or business with its principal or a majority of its business operations (either directly or through any subsidiaries) in the People’s Republic of China (including Hong Kong and Macau). 
 
Our Registration Statement on Form S-1 was declared effective by the SEC on February 14, 2022. EF Hutton, division of Benchmark Investments, LLC, acted as sole bookrunner for our initial public offering. We may refer to our initial public offering in this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our “Initial Public Offering” or “IPO”. On February 17, 2022, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 7,500,000 units (each a “Unit” and collectively, the “Units”). Each Unit consists of one share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and one redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. The Units were sold at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to us of $75,000,000. In connection with our Initial Public Offering, the underwriters were granted a 45-day option to purchase up to 1,125,000 additional Units to cover over-allotments, if any. On February 15, 2022, the underwriters elected to exercise the over-allotment option in full, resulting in the same of 1,125,000 additional units at an offering price of $10.00 per Unit for additional gross proceeds of $11,250,000. 
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the Initial public offering, we completed the private sale to the Sponsor of an aggregate of 377,331 placement units (including 30,937 Units as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of its allotment option at a price of $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds to the Company of $3,773,310. These Sponsor private placement units are identical to the units sold in the IPO, except that the Sponsor has agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the Sponsor private placement units (except to certain permitted transferees) until 30 days after the completion of the Company’s Initial Business Combination (“Initial Business Combination”). No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid with respect to the private placement.
 
A total of $87,543,750 comprised of proceeds from the IPO (including the proceeds received from the exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option) and the sale of the private placement units (including the proceeds received as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of the over-allotment option) were placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. 
 
Our Sponsor made an initial investment of $25,000 in exchange for 2,156,250 shares of our Class B common stock (up to 281,250 shares of which were subject to forfeiture by our Sponsor depending on the extent to which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised), which will automatically convert into shares of Class A common stock at the time of the consummation of our Initial Business Combination, on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment as described herein. As the underwriters exercised their over-allotment option in full, none of our shares of Class B common stock were forfeited. Additionally, our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 377,331 private placement units at a price of $10.00 per unit, for an aggregate purchase price of $3,773,310.
 
As a result of the IPO, the exercise in full by the underwriters of the over-allotment option, the private placement by our Sponsor and the purchase of shares of Class A common stock by the lead underwriter, and assuming all of the Units separate into their component parts, we had outstanding: (i) 9,002,331 units, (ii) 11,201,706 shares of common stock consisting of 9,045,456 shares of Class A common stock (including 8,625,000 shares of Class A common stock that are subject to redemption) and 2,156,250 shares of Class B common stock. We have not issued any securities since such date.
 
Prior to the IPO, there had been no public market for our Units, shares of common stock or warrants. Our Units, are listed for trading on the Nasdaq Global Market, or Nasdaq, under the symbol “GENQU”. The shares of Class A common stock and warrants comprising the Units had began separately trading as of April 7, 2022 under the symbols “GENQ,” and “GENQW,” respectively. As our IPO registration statement and Form 8A were not declared effective by the SEC until February 14, 2022, we were not a filing company under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended until such date.

Upon the closing of the IPO, a total of $87,543,750 (which amount includes $2,803,125 of the underwriters’ deferred discount), comprised of the proceeds from the IPO (including the proceeds received from the exercise by the underwriters of the over-allotment option) and the sale of the private placement unit (including the proceeds received as a result of the underwriters’ exercise of the over-allotment option) were placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. As of April 12, 2022, the balance in the trust account was $87,584,055.
 
The funds held in trust has been invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a Business Combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a Business Combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a Business Combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.
 
Since our IPO, our sole business activity has been identifying and evaluating suitable acquisition transaction candidates and engaging in non-binding discussions with potential target entities. To date we have not entered into any binding agreement with any target entity. We presently have no revenue and have had losses since inception from incurring formation and operating costs since completion of our IPO.
 
Management Business Combination Experience
 
Our management team is led by Dr. Adeoye Olukotun, Samuel Lui, Dr. Niel Starksen, Juan Fernandez Pascal and our directors – Grainne Coen, Ernest Fong, Chung Fan Cheng and Teck-Yong Heng. We have also engaged as advisors a group of individuals (Dr. Hank Wuh and Dr, Robert Chang) with extensive experience in the medical and healthcare fields. The individuals serving as our directors and as our advisors and officers have experience in acquiring businesses in the international marketplace, executive leadership, operational oversight, private equity investment management and capital markets experience in various industries, including healthcare. Our directors, offices and advisors also have experience with developing corporate strategy and implementation and identification of new and advancing technologies, which we believe will significantly benefit us as we evaluate potential acquisition or merger candidates as well as following the completion of our Initial Business Combination.
 
The past performance of the members of our management team or their affiliates is not a guarantee that we will be able to identify a suitable candidate for our Initial Business Combination or of success with respect to any Business Combination we may consummate. You should not rely on the historical record of the performance of our management team or any of its affiliates’ performance as indicative of our future performance.

Business Strategy
 
While we may pursue an Initial Business Combination target in any industry or geographic location, we intend to focus our search on middle market and emerging growth biotech and pharmaceutical-focused companies, businesses or assets that benefit from continuously evolving technology and the resulting shift in consumer and business purchase behavior. Most of these companies will ultimately need to consolidate to achieve the scale necessary to attain high revenue growth and attractive profitability. We believe that acquiring a leading high-growth technology company or assets in the healthcare, biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry will provide a platform to fund consolidation and fuel growth for our company. We have not identified any particular geographical area or country in which we may seek a Business Combination. However, we shall not consider or undertake a Business Combination with an entity or business with its principal or a majority of its business operations (either directly or through any subsidiaries) in the People’s Republic of China (including Hong Kong and Macau).
 
We believe that there is a large pool of quality Initial Business Combination targets looking for exit opportunities with an increasing number of private equity (or PE) and venture capital (or VC) activities in the Americas, which provides us opportunities given what we believe are the limited exit options for mid-market companies in the region. Also, we believe that the technology and tech enabled industries in the Americas represent a particularly attractive deal sourcing environment that will allow us to leverage our team’s skill sets and experience to identify an Initial Business Combination which can potentially serve as a strong platform for future add-on acquisitions. Our investment thesis is supported by what we believe are the following trends in our target sectors:
 
- Growth in research and development: Scientific breakthroughs and innovations in oncology, gene therapy, synthetic biology, personalized medicine, precision medicine, rare diseases, and other sub-sectors of the biopharmaceutical and life sciences industries, are creating new opportunities for investors in the sector. According to EvaluatePharma, worldwide pharmaceutical R&D spend is expected to reach over $230 billion by 2026, an approximately 50% increase over ten years.
 
- Robust private market deal activity: Strong levels of venture capital activity in the biotechnology sector support our pursuit of an Initial Business Combination. According to a recent Analyst note from Pitchbook, biotechnology and pharmaceutical start-ups raised over $23 billion in venture capital financing across 865 deals in 2020 as of November 18, 2020 breaking the deal value record set in 2018. Since 2015, biotechnology and pharmaceutical start-ups raised over $80 billion across over 4,000 deals. Many of these companies continue to grow and may view the public markets as an attractive alternative to support their growth.
 
- Regulatory environment: The FDA continues to approve new drugs at a healthy pace. There were 228 novel drug approvals in the five-year period from 2016 to 2020. This represents a 44% increase over the number of novel drugs approved over the period from 2010 to 2014. The constructive regulatory environment is encouraging continued investment in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors.
 
Competitive Advantages
 
We intend to capitalize on the following competitive advantages in our pursuit of a target company:
 

● | Leadership of an Experienced Management Team. Our experienced management team has over 35 years of combined work experience as investment professionals in a variety of industries, such as pharmaceutical and financial institutions. These years of experience have allowed us to gain not only extensive and deep expertise in our fields, but also vast networks of some of the most influential thought leaders and top performing companies in our target industries and region. This positions Genesis Unicorn Capital Corp as a unique and strategic player, and as an attractive alternative for the many companies that seek to tap the equity capital markets, ensuring that we find the most attractive opportunities that maximize value to our stockholders. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Established Deal Sourcing Network. We believe the strong track record of our management team will enable us to get access to quality deal pipeline. In addition, we believe that our management team and advisors, can generate acquisition opportunities and possibly seek complementary follow-on business arrangements through their international network of contacts in, among others, private and public companies, private equity and venture capital funds, investment banks, accounting and law firms.

● | Status as a Publicly Listed Acquisition Company. We believe our structure will make us an attractive Business Combination partner to prospective target businesses. As a publicly listed company, we will offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering process. We believe that some target businesses will favor this alternative, which we believe is less expensive, while offering greater certainty of execution, than the traditional initial public offering process. During an initial public offering, there are typically underwriting fees and marketing expenses, which would cost more than a Business Combination with us. Furthermore, once a proposed Business Combination is approved by our stockholders (if applicable) and the transaction is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriter’s ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. Once public, we believe our target business would have greater access to capital and additional means of creating management incentives that are better aligned with stockholders’ interests than it would as a private company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a target company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented management staffs.

● | Targeting of Fastest Growing Industries. The main industries we are targeting are in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical sectors. This is not just a function of our expertise in these fields, but it is also because these sectors are currently anticipated to be some of the fastest growing industries in the global economy, with the expectation that the biotechnology sector will expand at a CAGR of approximately 15.83% from 2021 to 2028, while the pharmaceutical sector will expand at a CAGR of approximately 10.23% for the corresponding period. 

Industry Opportunity
 
While we may acquire a business in any industry, our focus will be in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries. We believe that our target industries are attractive for a number of reasons.
 
We believe that the biotechnology sector represents a tremendous opportunity for growth, with many promising pre-commercial companies seeking funding and guidance from knowledgeable investment firms. There are multiple trends in the sector that contribute to this growth potential, and we believe they will enable us to identify and acquire an attractive target. These trends include the following:
 
- Large addressable market with strong growth: Total U.S. national health expenditure was $74.1 billion in 1970. By 2000, health expenditures reached about $1.4 trillion, and in 2019 the amount spent on health more than doubled to $3.8 trillion. CMS projected that by 2028, health care spending would reach $6.19 trillion, and would account for 19.7% of GDP, up from 17.7% in 2018.
 
- Technological progress driving innovation. Biotechnology innovation has accelerated in recent years due to new technology, including advances in computing, artificial intelligence, genetics and cellular engineering. Biotechnology companies have used these tools in many ways, particularly for breakthrough discoveries in the areas of targeted oncology, gene therapy, gene editing and cell therapy. We believe the pace of this advancement can persist and even grow, which could result in many new therapies that address unmet needs.
 
- Transformational opportunities. Technology can be used as a disruptor within the healthcare sector to improve the quality of care provided to patients or the accessibility of care. Furthermore, there is significant scope for transformational innovation within the healthcare and technology industries separately.
 
- Strong macroeconomic trends. The global population is aging and according to the United Nations the population aged 60 years or over is expected to more than double between 2017 and 2050. This represents a significant global healthcare challenge but also an opportunity for innovative companies focused on extending healthy lifespans.
 
- Strength despite COVID-19. The Nasdaq Biotech Index (NBI) has outperformed the general market for the last ten years (from 2012 to December 15,2021), with a 337.5% return for the NBI versus a 274.5% return for the S&P 500. We believe this demand is fueled in part by a renewed focus on the biotechnology sector as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has served as a reminder of the important role biotechnology plays in solving global health problems. We believe this paradigm can serve as an additional tailwind for the growth of promising, innovative biopharmaceutical companies.

We believe becoming publicly traded presents several major benefits for private biotechnology companies, including greater access to capital, more liquid securities and increased customer awareness. Furthermore, we believe an acquisition by a special purpose acquisition company with a respected management team that is well-known to biotechnology investors and management teams can be a very attractive mechanism for accessing the public markets due to the increased deal certainty, transparency and efficiency it can provide.
 
Acquisition Criteria and Process
 
Our acquisition strategy is to complete a Business Combination that will create value for our stockholders over time. We expect to conduct intensive diligence of a potential target, including but not limited to deal structure, financial forecasting and scientific viability using our management team’s expertise combined with the opinions of key industry leaders in their network of relationships. While we may enter into a Business Combination with a company that does not meet all of these criteria, we intend to focus on companies that we believe have the following characteristics:
 
-Therapeutics-focused business (i.e. biopharmaceuticals) with potential to significantly advance care for the disease of focus.
 
-Preclinical through commercial stage assets, with investments focused on programs that are both pre-proof-of-concept (“PoC”) and post-PoC.
 
-A company with minimal additional equity required to achieve significant defined clinical, regulatory or commercial milestones beyond the capital provided by the target, us and any potential concurrent PIPE.
 
Consistent with our strategy, we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses. We will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities, although we may decide to enter into our Initial Business Combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines.
 

● | Revenue and Earnings Growth Potential. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential for significant revenue and earnings growth through a combination of both existing and new product development, increased production capacity, expense reduction and synergistic follow-on acquisitions resulting in increased operating leverage. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Potential for Strong Free Cash Flow Generation. We will seek to acquire one or more businesses that have the potential to generate strong, stable and increasing free cash flow. We intend to focus on one or more businesses that have the potential for predictable, recurring revenue streams and definable low working capital and capital expenditure requirements. We may also seek to prudently leverage this cash flow in order to enhance stockholder value. 
● | Strong and Experienced Management. We will to seek companies that have strong, experienced management teams in place, or are a platform to assemble an effective management team with a track record of driving growth and profitability. We will spend significant time assessing a company’s leadership and human fabric, and maximizing its efficiency over time. 
● | Benefit from Being a Public Company. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that will benefit from being publicly traded and can effectively utilize the broader access to capital and the public profile that are associated with being a publicly traded company. 
● | Defensible Market Position. We intend to acquire one or more businesses that have a defensible market position, with demonstrated advantages when compared to their competitors and which create barriers to entry against new competitors. 

 
These criteria are not intended to be exhaustive. Any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular Initial Business Combination may be based, to the extent relevant, on these general guidelines as well as other considerations, factors and criteria that from time to time our management may deem relevant.

Initial Business Combination
 
Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Initial Business Combination. Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. Additionally, pursuant to Nasdaq rules, any Initial Business Combination must be approved by a majority of our independent directors.
 
We anticipate structuring our Initial Business Combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our Initial Business Combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the prior owners of the target business, the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such Business Combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the Business Combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the Business Combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our Initial Business Combination could own less than a majority of our issued and outstanding shares subsequent to our Initial Business Combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% fair market value test. If the Business Combination involves more than one target business, the 80% fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses and we will treat the target businesses together as our Initial Business Combination for purposes of a tender offer or for seeking stockholder approval, as applicable.
 
To the extent we effect our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our Initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Business Combination.

Sourcing of Potential Initial Business Combination Targets
 
Certain members of our management team have spent significant portions of their careers working with businesses in the technology industry and have developed a wide network of professional services contacts and business relationships in that industry. The members of our board of directors also have significant executive management and public company experience with technology related companies and bring additional relationships that further broaden our industry network.
 
This network has provided our management team with a flow of referrals that have resulted in numerous transactions in the past. We believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with an important source of acquisition opportunities. In addition, we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment market participants, private equity groups, investment banks, consultants, accounting firms and large business enterprises.
 
Members of our management team and our independent directors will directly or indirectly own founder shares and/or placement units following the Initial Public Offering and, accordingly, may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our Initial Business Combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular Business Combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our Initial Business Combination.
 
In addition, each of our officers and directors presently has, and any of them in the future may have additional, fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a Business Combination opportunity to such entity. The personal and financial interests of our directors and officers may influence their motivation in timely identifying and selecting a target business and completing a Business Combination. The different timelines of competing Business Combinations could cause our directors and officers to prioritize a different Business Combination over finding a suitable acquisition target for our Business Combination. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination.
 
In addition, our Sponsor and our officers and directors may sponsor or form other special purpose acquisition companies similar to ours or may pursue other business or investment ventures during the period in which we are seeking an Initial Business Combination. Any such companies, businesses or investments may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an Initial Business Combination. However, we do not believe that any such potential conflicts would materially affect our ability to complete our Initial Business Combination.
 
Effecting Our Initial Business Combination
 
We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations for an indefinite period of time following the Initial Public Offering. We intend to effectuate our Initial Business Combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement units, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our Initial Business Combination (pursuant to backstop agreements we may enter into following the consummation of the Initial Public Offering or otherwise), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
 
If our Initial Business Combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our Initial Business Combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our Initial Business Combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our Initial Business Combination, and we may effectuate our Initial Business Combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account. In addition, we intend to target businesses larger than we could acquire with the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the placement units, and may as a result be required to seek additional financing to complete such proposed Initial Business Combination. Subject to compliance with applicable securities laws, we would expect to complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our Initial Business Combination. In the case of an Initial Business Combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our proxy materials or tender offer documents disclosing the Initial Business Combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law or stock exchange requirements, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately, or through loans in connection with our Initial Business Combination. At this time, we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise.
 
We have 12 months (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination, as described in more detail below) from the consummation of our IPO to consummate our Initial Business Combination. Public stockholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with such extensions. If we are unable to consummate our Initial Business Combination within such time period, we will distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of taxes payable), pro rata to our public stockholders, by way of redemption of their shares, and thereafter cease operations except for the purpose of winding up our affairs, as further described herein. We expect the pro rata redemption price to be $10.15 per share (regardless of whether or not the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option), without taking into account any interest earned on such funds. However, we cannot assure you that we will in fact be able to distribute such amounts as a result of claims of creditors which may take priority over the claims of our public stockholders.
 
As stated above, we will have 12 months from the consummation of our IPO to consummate our Initial Business Combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our Initial Business Combination within 12 months, we may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination up to two (2) successive three-month periods at our option, up to 18 months in total from the closing of the IPO, and provided further that our Sponsor deposits into the trust account the sum of $0.20 per share ($1,725,000 in the aggregate for each three-month extension as a result of the underwriters exercising the over-allotment option in full), subject to our board of directors authorizing such extension and the Sponsor or its affiliates or designees depositing additional funds into the trust account as set out below. Pursuant to the terms of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and the trust agreement entered into between us and Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, in order to extend the time available for us to consummate our Initial Business Combination, our board of directors would adopt a resolution approving such extension and our founders or their respective affiliates or designees (which may include the potential target business), upon five (5) days advance notice prior teach applicable deadline, must deposit into the trust account $1,725,000 (approximately $0.20 per public share) for each three-month extension, up to an aggregate of $3,450,000, or $0.40 per public share (for an aggregate of six months), on or prior to the date of the applicable deadline, for each extension. The insiders or the Sponsor (or their respective affiliates or designees) providing such additional funds will receive non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory notes equal to the amount of any such deposit. The final and definitive terms of any such loans have not yet been negotiated, but any such loan would be interest free and will not be repaid in the event that we are unable to close a Business Combination unless there are funds available outside the trust account to do so. Such notes would either be paid upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination, or, at the purchaser’s discretion, converted upon consummation of our Business Combination into additional units on the basis of $10.00 per private unit. Public stockholders will not be offered the opportunity to vote on or redeem their shares in connection with such extension. If we are unable to consummate our Initial Business Combination within such time period, we will distribute the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (net of taxes payable), pro rata to our public stockholders, by way of redemption of their shares, and thereafter cease operations except for the purpose of winding up our affairs, as further described herein.

Sources of Target Businesses
 
We anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources, including investment bankers and investment professionals, as a result of being solicited by us by calls or mailings. These sources may also introduce us to target businesses in which they think we may be interested on an unsolicited basis, since many of these sources will have read the prospectus in connection with the Initial Public Offering and know what types of businesses we are targeting. Our officers and directors, as well as our sponsor and their affiliates, may also bring to our attention target business candidates that they become aware of through their business contacts as a result of formal or informal inquiries or discussions they may have, as well as attending trade shows or conventions. In addition, we expect to receive a number of deal flow opportunities that would not otherwise necessarily be available to us as a result of the business relationships of our officers and directors and our sponsor and their affiliates. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms or other individuals that specialize in business acquisitions on any formal basis, we may engage these firms or other individuals in the future, in which event we may pay a finder’s fee, consulting fee, advisory fee or other compensation to be determined in an arm’s length negotiation based on the terms of the transaction. We will engage a finder only to the extent our management determines that the use of a finder may bring opportunities to us that may not otherwise be available to us or if finders approach us on an unsolicited basis with a potential transaction that our management determines is in our best interest to pursue. Payment of finder’s fees is customarily tied to completion of a transaction, in which case any such fee will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account. In no event, however, will our sponsor or any of our existing officers or directors be paid any finder’s fee, reimbursement, consulting fee, monies in respect of any payment of a loan or other compensation by the company prior to, or in connection with any services rendered for any services they render in order to effectuate, the completion of our Initial Business Combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). None of our Sponsor, executive officers or directors, or any of their respective affiliates, will be allowed to receive any compensation, finder’s fees or consulting fees from a prospective Business Combination target in connection with a contemplated Initial Business Combination except as set forth herein. We have agreed to pay Genesis Unicorn Capital, LLC, our Sponsor, a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support and to reimburse our sponsor for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating and completing an Initial Business Combination. Some of our officers and directors may enter into employment or consulting agreements with the post-transaction company following our Initial Business Combination. The presence or absence of any such fees or arrangements will not be used as a criterion in our selection process of an Initial Business Combination candidate.
 
We are not prohibited from pursuing an Initial Business Combination with an Initial Business Combination target that is affiliated with our Sponsor, officers or directors or making the Initial Business Combination through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our Sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our Initial Business Combination with an Initial Business Combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions that such an Initial Business Combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
 
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
 
If we are unable to (i) complete any such Business Combination within 12 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering unless such 12 months is extended for up to two (2) successive three-month periods at our option (up to 18 months in total from the closing of the Initial Public Offering) and provided further that our Sponsor deposits into the escrow account the sum of $0.20 per share (or $1,725,000 in the aggregate for each three-month extension) we will (x) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (y) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten (10) business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (z) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in the case of clauses (y) and (z) above to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. In the event we elect to extend the deadline, we intend to issue a press release announcing such intention at least three (3) days prior to the applicable deadline. In addition, we intend to issue a press release the day after the applicable deadline announcing whether or not the funds have been timely deposited. Our public shareholders will not have the right to vote upon or redeem their shares in connection with any extensions from the initial 12-month period.

Nasdaq rules require that we must complete one or more Business Combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the value of the assets held in the trust account (excluding the deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on the interest earned on the trust account) at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our Initial Business Combination. The fair market value of our Initial Business Combination will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation, a valuation based on trading multiples of comparable public businesses or a valuation based on the financial metrics of mergers and acquisition transactions of comparable businesses. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or another independent entity that commonly renders valuation opinions with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our Initial Business Combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of a target’s assets or prospects. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our Initial Business Combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will virtually have unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our Initial Business Combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
 
In any case, we will only complete an Initial Business Combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be taken into account for purposes of Nasdaq’s 80% fair market value test. There was no basis for investors in the Initial Public Offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our Initial Business Combination.
 
To the extent we effect our Initial Business Combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
 
In evaluating a prospective business target, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us.
 
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our Initial Business Combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our Initial Business Combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another Business Combination.
 
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our Initial Business Combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the Initial Business Combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed Initial Business Combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement. Under Nasdaq rules, asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure an Initial Business Combination with a target company in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed Initial Business Combination. We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirements or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. So long as we maintain a listing for our securities on Nasdaq, we will be required to comply with such rules.
 
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our Initial Business Combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, we will not redeem any public shares unless our net tangible assets will be at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our Initial Business Combination. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the Initial Business Combination.
 
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we may not redeem our public shares unless our net tangible assets are at least $5,000,001 either immediately prior to or upon consummation of our Initial Business Combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our Initial Business Combination. For example, the proposed Initial Business Combination may require: (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed Initial Business Combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed Initial Business Combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the Initial Business Combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.

Status as a Public Company and Financial Considerations
 
We believe our structure will make us an attractive Business Combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other Business Combination. In this situation, the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for our shares of common stock or for a combination of our shares of common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. We believe target businesses might find this method a more certain and cost-effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. In a typical initial public offering, there are additional expenses incurred in marketing, roadshow and public reporting efforts that will likely not be present to the same extent in connection with a Business Combination with us. Furthermore, once the Business Combination is consummated, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions that could prevent the offering from occurring. We believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests than it would have as a privately-held company. It can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
 
While we believe that our status as a public company will make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view the inherent limitations in our status as a blank check company as a deterrent and may prefer to effect a Business Combination with a more established entity or with a private company. These inherent limitations include limitations on our available financial resources, which may be inferior to those of other entities pursuing the acquisition of similar target businesses; the requirement that we seek stockholder approval of a Business Combination, which may delay the consummation of a transaction; and the existence of our outstanding warrants, which may represent a source of future dilution.
 
With funds in the trust account of approximately $87.5 million available to use for a Business Combination, we offer a target business a variety of options such as providing the owners of a target business with shares in a public company and a public means to sell such shares, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio. Because we are able to consummate our Initial Business Combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. In connection with any potential acquisition, we may be required to obtain acquisition financing. However, since we have no specific Business Combination under consideration, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance that it will be available to us. We may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our Business Combination, and we may effectuate our Business Combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account.
 
We chose our net tangible asset threshold of $5,000,001 to ensure that we would avoid being subject to Rule 419 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. However, if we seek to consummate an Initial Business Combination with a target business that imposes any type of working capital closing condition or requires us to have a minimum amount of funds available from the trust account upon consummation of such Initial Business Combination, we may need to have more than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets upon consummation and this may force us to seek third party financing which may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. As a result, we may not be able to consummate such Initial Business Combination and we may not be able to locate another suitable target within the applicable time period, if at all. Public stockholders may therefore have to wait up to 18 months from the closing of our IPO in order to be able to receive a pro rata share of the trust account.

Summary Information Related to Our Securities, Redemption Rights and Liquidation
 
We are a Delaware corporation and our affairs are governed by our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, and the Delaware General Corporation Law. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we are authorized to issue (i) 125,000,000 shares of Class A common stock, $0.0001 par value each; (ii), 12,500,000 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 each; and (iii) 1,250,000 shares pf preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share. The information provided below is a summary only and we refer you to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our warrant agreement with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company as warrant agent for additional important and material information.
 
Upon completion of our IPO and as of March 31, 2022, we had and have 9,045,456 shares of Class A common stock issued and outstanding (including 377,331 private placement shares and 43,125 representative shares) and 2,156,250 shares of Class B common stock (sometimes referred to as “Founder Shares”). The Class B common stock is convertible into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment. Common stockholders of record are entitled to one vote for each share held on all matters to be voted on by stockholders and vote together as a single class, except as required by law. Unless specified by applicable law, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or applicable stock exchange rules, the affirmative vote of a majority of our shares of common stock that are voted is required to approve any such matter voted on by our stockholders. Directors are elected for a term of one year. Our stockholders are entitled to receive ratable dividends when, as and if declared by the Board of Directors out of funds legally available therefor.
 
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our Business Combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of our Business Combination, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable) divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is Initially anticipated to be approximately $10.15 per public share (subject to increase of up to an additional $0.40 per public share in the event that our Sponsor elects to extend the period of time to consummate a Business Combination).
 
Our Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our Business Combination.
 
If a stockholder vote is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, and file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our Business Combination. If, however, stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law, or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons, we will, like many blank check companies, offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules. If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our Business Combination only if a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the Business Combination. However, the participation of our Sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates in privately-negotiated transactions, if any, could result in the approval of our Business Combination even if a majority of our public stockholders vote, or indicate their intention to vote, against such Business Combination.

If we seek stockholder approval of our Business Combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our Business Combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in our IPO, which we refer to as the “Excess Shares.” However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our Business Combination.
 
If we do not complete a Business Combination within 12 months (or up to 18 months, as discussed above) from the closing of our IPO, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten (10) business days thereafter, redeem 100% of the outstanding public shares and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject (in the case of (ii) and (iii) above) to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law.
 
In connection with our IPO we issued an aggregate of 8,625,000 warrants to acquire an aggregate of 8,625,000 shares of Class A common stock. In addition, in the private placement with our Sponsor that we completed simultaneously with the IPO, we also issued 377,331 warrants to acquire 377,331 shares of Class A common stock. The warrants purchased in our IPO have been issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as warrant agent, and us. Each warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment as discussed below, at any time commencing on the later of 12 months from the date we consummated our IPO or 30 days from the completion of our Business Combination. Because the warrants may only be exercised for whole numbers of shares, only an even number of warrants may be exercised at any given time. Pursuant to the warrant agreement, a warrant holder may exercise its warrants only for a whole number of shares. This means that only an even number of warrants may be exercised at any given time by a warrant holder. The warrants will expire five (5) years after the completion of our Business Combination, at 5:00 p.m., New York City time, or earlier upon redemption or liquidation.
 
Once the warrants become exercisable, we may call the warrants for redemption:
 

● | in whole and not in part; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | upon a minimum of 30 days’ prior written notice of redemption, 
● | if, and only if, the last sales price of our shares of common stock equals or exceeds $18.00 per share for any 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period ending three business days before we send the notice of redemption, and 
● | if, and only if, there is a current registration statement in effect with respect to the shares of common stock underlying such warrants at the time of redemption and for the entire 30-day trading period referred to above and continuing each day thereafter until the date of redemption. 

 
The redemption price for the warrants shall be either (i) if the holder of a warrant has followed the procedures specified in our notice of redemption and surrendered the warrant, the number of shares of common stock as determined in accordance with the “cashless exercise” provisions of the warrant agreement or (ii) if the holder of a warrant has not followed such procedures specified in our notice of redemption, the price of $0.01 per warrant. If the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption, each warrant holder can exercise his, her or its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date either by paying the cash exercise price or on a “cashless exercise” basis. However, the price of our shares of Class A common stock may fall below the $18.00 trigger price, as well as the $11.50 warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued.
 
The private warrants are identical to the warrants included in the Units sold in our IPO except for certain transfer restrictions as described herein. The purchasers of the private warrants have agreed not to transfer, assign or sell any of the private warrants or underlying securities (except to the same permitted transferees as the Sponsor and provided the transferees agree to the same terms and restrictions as the permitted transferees of the Sponsor must agree to) until the completion of our Initial Business Combination. In the event of a liquidation prior to our Initial Business Combination, the private warrants will expire worthless.

Competition
 
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our Initial Business Combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic Business Combinations. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting Business Combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the Initial Business Combination of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our Initial Business Combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an Initial Business Combination.
Employees
 
We currently have four executive officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but each intends to devote as much of his time as he deems necessary to our affairs until we have completed our Initial Business Combination. The amount of time that he will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our Initial Business Combination and the stage of the Initial Business Combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our Initial Business Combination.
Corporate Information
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth (5th) anniversary of the completion of our IPO, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our shares of common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the prior June 30th, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period. References herein to “emerging growth company” shall have the meaning associated with it in the JOBS Act.
 
Additionally, we are a “smaller reporting company” as defined in Item 10(f)(1) of Regulation S-K. Smaller reporting companies may take advantage of certain reduced disclosure obligations, including, among other things, providing only two years of audited financial statements. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the last day of the fiscal year in which (1) the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $250 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, or (2) our annual revenues exceeded $100 million during such completed fiscal year and the market value of our common stock held by non- affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter.
 
We are a Delaware corporation incorporated on February 23, 2021. Our executive offices are located at 281 Witherspoon Street, Suite 120, Princeton, New Jersey 08540, and our telephone number is (609) 466-0792.
