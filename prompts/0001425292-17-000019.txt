Item 1.    Business
Overview
CVR Partners, LP ("CVR Partners," the "Partnership," "we," "us," or "our") is a Delaware limited partnership formed by CVR Energy to own, operate and grow our nitrogen fertilizer business. We produce and distribute nitrogen fertilizer products, which are used by farmers to improve the yield and quality of their crops. Our principal products are UAN and ammonia. All of our products are sold on a wholesale basis.
We produce our nitrogen fertilizer products at two manufacturing facilities, which are located in Coffeyville, Kansas and East Dubuque, Illinois. We acquired the East Dubuque, Illinois facility in April 2016 through our acquisition of CVR Nitrogen. For a discussion of the East Dubuque Merger, refer to Note 3 ("East Dubuque Merger") of Part II, Item 8 of this Report. The consolidated financial statements and key operating metrics include the results of the East Dubuque Facility beginning on April 1, 2016, the date of the closing of the acquisition. 
Our Coffeyville Facility includes a 1,300 ton-per-day capacity ammonia unit, a 3,000 ton-per-day capacity UAN unit, and a gasifier complex having a capacity of 89 million standard cubic feet per day of hydrogen. Our gasifier is a dual-train facility, with each gasifier able to function independently of the other, thereby providing redundancy and improving our reliability. Strategically located adjacent to CVR Refining’s refinery in Coffeyville, Kansas, our Coffeyville Facility is the only operation in North America that utilizes a petroleum coke, or pet coke, gasification process to produce nitrogen fertilizer. During the past five years, over 70% of the pet coke consumed by our Coffeyville Facility was produced and supplied by CVR Refining’s Coffeyville, Kansas crude oil refinery. We upgrade substantially all of the ammonia we produce at our Coffeyville Facility to higher margin UAN, which has historically commanded a premium price over ammonia. Approximately 93% of our Coffeyville Facility produced ammonia tons were upgraded into UAN in 2016. 
Our East Dubuque Facility includes a 1,075 ton-per-day capacity ammonia unit and a 1,100 ton-per-day capacity UAN unit. The facility is located on a 210-acre, 140-foot bluff above the Mississippi River, with access to the river for loading certain products. The East Dubuque Facility uses natural gas as its primary feedstock. The East Dubuque Facility has the flexibility to significantly vary its product mix. This enables us to upgrade our ammonia production into varying amounts of UAN, nitric acid and liquid and granulated urea each season, depending on market demand, pricing and storage availability. Product sales are heavily weighted toward sales of ammonia and UAN. For the post-acquisition period ended December 31, 2016, approximately 44% of our East Dubuque Facility produced ammonia tons were upgraded to other products. 
CVR Energy, which indirectly owns our general partner and approximately 34% of our outstanding common units, also indirectly owns the general partner and approximately 66% of the outstanding common units of CVR Refining at December 31, 2016. CVR Refining owns and operates a complex full coking medium-sour crude oil refinery with a rated capacity of 115,000 barrels per calendar day (bpcd) in Coffeyville, Kansas, a complex crude oil refinery with a rated capacity of 70,000 bpcd in Wynnewood, Oklahoma and ancillary businesses.
We generated net sales of $356.3 million, $289.2 million and $298.7 million and net income (loss) of $(26.9) million, $62.0 million and $76.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Additionally, during the second quarter of 2016, the Partnership repurchased approximately $315.8 million of the 2021 Notes pursuant to the Tender Offer and the Change of Control Offer. Further, on September 30, 2016, the Partnership entered into the ABL Credit Facility in an aggregate principle amount of availability of up to $50.0 million. Refer to Note 10 ("Debt") of Part II, Item 8 of this Report for further discussion of the debt transactions.
Raw Material Supply
Coffeyville Facility
Our Coffeyville Facility was built in 2000 and uses a gasification process to convert pet coke to high purity hydrogen for subsequent conversion to ammonia. Our Coffeyville Facility's pet coke gasification process results in a significantly higher percentage of fixed costs than a natural gas-based fertilizer plant. During the past five years, over 70% of our pet coke requirements on average were supplied by CVR Refining's adjacent crude oil refinery, pursuant to a renewable long-term agreement. Historically we have obtained the remainder of our pet coke requirements from third parties such as other Midwestern refineries or pet coke brokers at spot-prices. We are party to a pet coke supply agreement with HollyFrontier Corporation. The term of this agreement ends in December 2017, and we have historically renewed this agreement annually. If necessary, there are other pet coke suppliers and the gasification process can be modified to operate on coal as an alternative, which provides an additional raw material source. There are significant supplies of coal within a 60-mile radius of our nitrogen fertilizer plant.
We also purchased some of our hydrogen from CVR Refining's adjacent crude oil refinery pursuant to a feedstock and shared services agreement. CRNF and CRRM entered into a hydrogen purchase and sale agreement that is effective January 2017, pursuant to which, CRRM agrees to sell and deliver a committed hydrogen volume of 90,000 mscf per month, and CRNF agrees to purchase and receive the committed volume. CRNF also has the option to purchase excess volume of up to 60,000 mscf per month, or more upon mutual agreement, from CRRM, if available for purchase. The agreement has an initial term of 20 years and will be automatically extended following the initial term for additional successive five-year renewal term unless either party gives 180 days written notice. Refer to Part III, Item 13 of this Report for further discussion of the hydrogen purchase and sale agreement.
The pet coke gasification process is licensed from an affiliate of General Electric Company. The license grants us perpetual rights to use the pet coke gasification process on specified terms and conditions, and the license is fully paid. 
Linde LLC ("Linde") owns, operates, and maintains the air separation plant that provides contract volumes of oxygen, nitrogen, and compressed dry air to our Coffeyville Facility for a monthly fee. We provide and pay for all utilities required for operation of the air separation plant. The air separation plant has not experienced any long-term operating problems; however, CVR Energy maintains, for our benefit, contingent business interruption insurance with a $200.0 million limit for any interruption caused by physical damage to the air separation plant that results in a loss of production from an insured peril. 
Although we have our own boiler that is used to create start-up steam at the Coffeyville Facility, we also have the ability to import start-up steam from CVR Refining's adjacent crude oil refinery and then export steam back to the crude oil refinery once all of our units are in service. We have entered into a feedstock and shared services agreement with a subsidiary of CVR Refining, which regulates, among other things, the import and export of start-up steam between the adjacent refinery and the Coffeyville Facility. Monthly charges and credits are recorded with the steam valued at the natural gas price for the month.
East Dubuque Facility
The East Dubuque Facility uses natural gas to produce nitrogen fertilizer, primarily ammonia and UAN. We are able to purchase natural gas at competitive prices due to the plant’s connection to the Northern Natural Gas interstate pipeline system, which is within one mile of the facility, and the ANR Pipeline Company pipeline. The pipelines are connected to Nicor Inc.’s distribution system at the Chicago Citygate receipt point and at the Hampshire interconnect, from which natural gas is transported to the facility. 
Changes in the levels of natural gas prices and market prices of nitrogen-based products can materially affect our financial position and results of operations. Natural gas prices in the United States have experienced significant fluctuations over the last several years, increasing substantially in 2008 and subsequently declining to the current lower levels. Several recent discoveries of large natural gas deposits in North America, combined with advances in technology for natural gas production have caused large increases in the estimates of available natural gas reserves and production in the United States, contributing to significant 
6

reductions in the market price of natural gas. From time to time, we enter into forward contracts with fixed delivery prices to purchase portions of our natural gas requirements. As of December 31, 2016, we had commitments to purchase 1.5 million MMBtus of natural gas supply for planned use in our East Dubuque Facility in January and February 2017 at a weighted average rate per MMBtu of $3.46, exclusive of transportation cost.
Distribution, Sales and Marketing
The primary geographic markets for our fertilizer products are Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, and Texas. We primarily market the UAN products to agricultural customers and ammonia products to agricultural and industrial customers.
UAN and ammonia are primarily distributed by truck or by railcar. If delivered by truck, products are most commonly sold on a FOB shipping point basis, and freight is normally arranged by the customer. We lease and own a fleet of railcars for use in product delivery, and, if delivered by railcar, our products are most commonly sold on a FOB destination point basis and we typically arrange the freight. We incur costs to maintain and repair our railcar fleet that include expenses related to regulatory inspections and repairs. For example, many of our railcars require specific regulatory inspections and repairs due on ten-year intervals. The extent and frequency of railcar fleet maintenance and repair costs are generally expected to change based partially on when regulatory inspections and repairs are due for our railcars under the relevant regulations. 
Our products leave our Coffeyville Facility either in railcars for destinations located principally on the Union Pacific Railroad or in trucks for direct shipment to customers. We do not currently incur significant intermediate transfer, storage, barge freight or pipeline freight charges; however, we do incur costs to maintain and repair our railcar fleet as discussed above. 
The East Dubuque Facility is located in northwest Illinois, in the corn belt. The East Dubuque Facility primarily sells its product to customers located within 200 miles of the facility. In most instances, customers take delivery of nitrogen products at the East Dubuque Facility and arrange and pay to transport them to their final destinations by truck. The East Dubuque Facility has direct access to a barge dock on the Mississippi River as well as a nearby rail spur serviced by the Canadian National Railway Company.
The heavy in-season demand periods are spring and fall in the corn belt and summer in the wheat belt. The corn belt is the primary corn producing region of the United States, which includes Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Ohio and Wisconsin. The wheat belt is the primary wheat producing region of the United States, which includes Kansas, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Texas. Most of our industrial sales are contractual agreements.
We have the capacity to store approximately 160,000 tons of UAN and 80,000 tons of ammonia. Our storage tanks are located primarily at our two production facilities. Inventories are often allowed to accumulate to allow customers to take delivery to meet the seasonal demand.
We offer our agricultural products on a spot, forward or prepay basis. We often use forward sales of our fertilizer products to optimize our asset utilization, planning process and production scheduling. These sales are made by offering customers the opportunity to purchase product on a forward basis at prices and delivery dates that we propose. We use this program to varying degrees during the year and between years depending on our view of market conditions. Fixing the selling prices of our products months in advance of their ultimate delivery to customers typically causes our reported selling prices and margins to differ from spot market prices and margins available at the time of shipment. Cash received as a result of prepayments is recognized as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheet upon receipt, and revenue and resultant net income and EBITDA are recorded as the product is delivered.
Customers
We sell UAN products to retailers and distributors. In addition, we sell ammonia to agricultural and industrial customers. Given the nature of our business, and consistent with industry practice, we do not have long-term minimum purchase contracts with most of our UAN and ammonia customers.
For the year ended December 31, 2016, the top five customers in the aggregate represented 32% of our net sales. Each of our top two customers on a consolidated basis accounted for approximately 10% of our net sales. While we do have high concentration of customers, we do not believe that the loss of any single customer would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Our business depends on significant customers, and the loss of significant customers may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions, of this Report for further discussion.

Competition
We have experienced and expect to continue to meet significant levels of competition from current and potential competitors, many of whom have significantly greater financial and other resources. Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Nitrogen fertilizer products are global commodities, and we face intense competition from other nitrogen fertilizer producers, of this Report for further discussion.
Competition in our industry is dominated by price considerations. However, during the spring and fall application seasons, farming activities intensify and delivery capacity is a significant competitive factor. We maintain a large fleet of leased and owned railcars and seasonally adjust inventory to enhance our manufacturing and distribution operations.
Our major competitors include Agrium, Inc.; CF Industries Holdings, Inc., including its majority owned subsidiary Terra Nitrogen Company, LP.; Koch Nitrogen Company, LLC; and Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan, Inc. Domestic competition is intense due to customers' sophisticated buying tendencies and competitor strategies that focus on cost and service. We also encounter competition from producers of fertilizer products manufactured in foreign countries. In certain cases, foreign producers of fertilizer who export to the United States may be subsidized by their respective governments.
Seasonality
Because we primarily sell agricultural commodity products, our business is exposed to seasonal fluctuations in demand for nitrogen fertilizer products in the agricultural industry. As a result, we typically experience higher net sales in the first half of the calendar year, which we refer to as the planting season, and our net sales tend to be lower during the second half of each calendar year, which we refer to as the fill season. In addition, the demand for fertilizers is affected by the aggregate crop planting decisions and fertilizer application rate decisions of individual farmers who make planting decisions based largely on the prospective profitability of a harvest. The specific varieties and amounts of fertilizer they apply depend on factors like crop prices, farmers' current liquidity, soil conditions, weather patterns and the types of crops planted. 
Environmental Matters
Our business is subject to extensive and frequently changing federal, state and local, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing the emission and release of hazardous substances into the environment, the treatment and discharge of waste water and the storage, handling, use and transportation of our nitrogen fertilizer products. These laws and regulations, their underlying regulatory requirements and the enforcement thereof impact us by imposing:

• | restrictions on operations or the need to install enhanced or additional controls;


• | the need to obtain and comply with permits and authorizations;


• | liability for the investigation and remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater at current and former facilities (if any) and off-site waste disposal locations; and


• | specifications for the products we market, primarily UAN and ammonia.

Our operations require numerous permits and authorizations. Failure to comply with these permits or environmental laws and regulations generally could result in fines, penalties or other sanctions or a revocation of our permits. In addition, the laws and regulations to which we are subject are often evolving and many of them have become more stringent or have become subject to more stringent interpretation or enforcement by federal and state agencies. The ultimate impact on our business of complying with existing laws and regulations is not always clearly known or determinable due in part to the fact that our operations may change over time and certain implementing regulations for laws, such as the federal Clean Air Act, have not yet been finalized, are under governmental or judicial review or are being revised. These laws and regulations could result in increased capital, operating and compliance costs or result in delays or limits to our operations or growth while attempting to obtain required permits.
The principal environmental risks associated with our business are outlined below.
The Federal Clean Air Act
The federal Clean Air Act and its implementing regulations, as well as the corresponding state laws and regulations that regulate emissions of pollutants into the air, affect us through the federal Clean Air Act's permitting requirements and emission control requirements relating to specific air pollutants, as well as the requirement to maintain a risk management program to help prevent accidental releases of certain substances. Some or all of the standards promulgated pursuant to the federal Clean Air Act, or any future promulgations of standards, may require the installation of controls or changes to our nitrogen fertilizer facilities in order to comply. If new controls or changes to operations are needed, the costs could be material. These new requirements, other requirements of the federal Clean Air Act, or other presently existing or future environmental regulations 
8

could cause us to expend substantial amounts to comply and/or permit our facilities to produce products that meet applicable requirements. 
The regulation of air emissions under the federal Clean Air Act requires that we obtain various construction and operating permits and incur capital expenditures for the installation of certain air pollution control devices at our operations. Various regulations specific to our operations have been implemented, such as National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants, New Source Performance Standards and New Source Review. We have incurred, and may be required to make, substantial capital expenditures to attain or maintain compliance with these and other air emission regulations that have been promulgated or may be promulgated or revised in the future. 
Release Reporting
The release of hazardous substances or extremely hazardous substances into the environment is subject to release reporting requirements under federal and state environmental laws. We periodically experience releases of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances from our equipment. Our facilities periodically have excess emission events from flaring and other planned and unplanned startup, shutdown and malfunction events. Such releases are reported to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the "EPA") and relevant state and local agencies. From time to time, the EPA has conducted inspections and issued information requests to us with respect to our compliance with release reporting requirements under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act ("CERCLA") and the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act. If we fail to properly report a release, or if the release violates the law or our permits, it could cause us to become the subject of a governmental enforcement action or third-party claims. Government enforcement or third-party claims relating to releases of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances could result in significant expenditures and liability.
Greenhouse Gas Emissions
Refer to Part I, Item 1A, Risk Factors, Climate change laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions, of this Report for further discussion of the Greenhouse Gas ("GHG") Emissions regulations. 
Environmental Remediation
Under CERCLA, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, and related state laws, certain persons may be liable for the release or threatened release of hazardous substances. These persons can include the current owner or operator of property where a release or threatened release occurred, any persons who owned or operated the property when the release occurred, and any persons who disposed of, or arranged for the transportation or disposal of, hazardous substances at a contaminated property. Liability under CERCLA is strict, and, under certain circumstances, joint and several, so that any responsible party may be held liable for the entire cost of investigating and remediating the release of hazardous substances. As is the case with all companies engaged in similar industries, we face potential exposure from future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters, including soil and water contamination, personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by hazardous substances that we manufactured, handled, used, stored, transported, spilled, disposed of or released. We cannot assure you that we will not become involved in future proceedings related to our release of hazardous or extremely hazardous substances or that, if we were held responsible for damages in any existing or future proceedings, such costs would be covered by insurance or would not be material.
Environmental Insurance
We are covered by CVR Energy's site pollution legal liability insurance policy with an aggregate limit of $51.0 million per pollution condition, subject to a self-insured retention of $1.0 million. The policy includes business interruption coverage, subject to a 5-day waiting period deductible. This insurance expires on March 1, 2017 and is expected to be renewed without any material changes in terms. The policy insures any location owned, leased, rented or operated by the Partnership, including our nitrogen fertilizer facilities. The policy insures certain pollution conditions at, or migrating from, a covered location, certain waste transportation and disposal activities and business interruption.
In addition to the site pollution legal liability insurance policy, we benefit from umbrella and excess casualty insurance policies maintained by CVR Energy having an aggregate and occurrence limit of $300.0 million, subject to a self-insured retention and deductible of $5.0 million. This insurance provides coverage due to named perils for claims involving pollutants where the discharge is sudden and accidental and first commenced at a specific day and time during the policy period. The casualty insurance policies, including umbrella and excess policies, expire on March 1, 2017 and are expected to be renewed or replaced by insurance policies containing materially equivalent sudden and accidental pollution coverage with no reduction in limits. 
9

The site pollution legal liability policy and the pollution coverage provided in the casualty insurance policies contain discovery requirements, reporting requirements, exclusions, definitions, conditions and limitations that could apply to a particular pollution claim, and there can be no assurance such claim will be adequately insured for all potential damages.
Safety, Health and Security Matters
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations related to safety, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Act ("OSHA"), and comparable state statutes, the purpose of which are to protect the health and safety of workers. We also are subject to OSHA Process Safety Management regulations, which are designed to prevent or minimize the consequences of catastrophic releases of toxic, reactive, flammable or explosive chemicals.
We operate a comprehensive safety, health and security program, with participation by employees at all levels of the organization. We have developed comprehensive safety programs aimed at preventing OSHA recordable incidents. Despite our efforts to achieve excellence in our safety and health performance, there can be no assurances that there will not be accidents resulting in injuries or even fatalities. We routinely audit our programs and consider improvements in our management systems.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 299 direct employees. As of December 31, 2016, these employees are covered by health insurance, disability and retirement plans established by CVR Energy. We believe that our relationship with our employees is good. 
As of December 31, 2016, the Coffeyville Facility employed 146 of our employees, of whom none were unionized. As of December 31, 2016, the East Dubuque Facility employed 150 of our employees, about 61% of whom were represented by the International Union of United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Implement Workers under a three-year collective bargaining agreement that expires in October 2019.
We also rely on the services of employees of CVR Energy and its subsidiaries pursuant to a services agreement between us, CVR Energy and our general partner. Additionally, the Partnership's general partner manages the Partnership's operations and activities as specified in the partnership agreement and had 5 employees as of December 31, 2016. For more information on these agreements, see Note 15 ("Related Party Transactions") to Part II. Item 8 of this Report.
