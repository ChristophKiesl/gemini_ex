B. | BUSINESS DESCRIPTION
---+---------------------


(1) | OCEAN TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT
----+-----------------------------

      Ocean Freight Services:
     Matson’s Ocean Transportation segment provides the following services:
     Ocean Services:
     Hawaii Service:  Matson’s Hawaii service provides ocean freight services (lift-on/lift-off, roll-on/roll-off and conventional services) between the ports of Long Beach and Oakland, California, Seattle, Washington, and the major ports in Hawaii on the islands of Oahu, Kauai, Maui and Hawaii.  Matson is the largest carrier of ocean cargo between the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii.
     Westbound cargo carried by Matson to Hawaii includes dry containers of mixed commodities, refrigerated commodities, packaged foods and beverages, retail merchandise, building materials, automobiles and household goods.  Matson’s eastbound cargo from Hawaii includes automobiles, household goods, dry containers of mixed commodities, and livestock.  The majority of Matson’s Hawaii service revenue is derived from the westbound carriage of containerized freight and automobiles.
     Alaska Service:  Matson’s Alaska service, which Matson acquired on May 29, 2015 as part of the Horizon Acquisition, provides ocean freight services (lift-on/lift-off and conventional services) between the port of Tacoma, Washington, and the ports of Anchorage, Kodiak, and Dutch Harbor in Alaska.  The Company also provides a barge service between Dutch Harbor and Akutan in Alaska, and other transportation services to smaller locations in Alaska.
     Matson’s northbound cargo to Alaska includes dry containers of mixed commodities, refrigerated commodities, packaged foods and beverages, retail merchandise, household goods, and automobiles.  Matson’s southbound cargo from Alaska primarily consists of household goods, automobiles and seafood.
     China Service:  Matson’s expedited China-Long Beach Express (“CLX”) service is part of an integrated Hawaii/Guam/ China service.  This service carries cargo from Long Beach, California to Honolulu, Hawaii, and then to Guam.  The vessels continue to the ports of Ningbo and Shanghai in China, where they are loaded with cargo to be discharged in Long Beach, California.  These vessels also carry cargo destined to and originating from the Guam and Micronesia services. Commencing February 2017, Matson replaced its direct calling to Xiamen, China with a transshipment service to Shanghai, China.  China cargo consists mainly of garments, footwear and other retail merchandise.
     Guam Service:  Matson’s Guam service provides weekly container and conventional freight services carrying mainly general sustenance cargo between the U.S. West Coast and Guam.  Additionally, Matson provides weekly freight services to the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands with transshipment in Guam.
     Japan Service:  On December 20, 2016, Matson announced the introduction of service to the Port of Naha in Okinawa, Japan as part of its expedited CLX service.  The new weekly service is expected to make its first call during the second quarter 2017. This service is expected to carry mainly general sustenance cargo supporting the U.S. military and commercial customer base.

 Micronesia Service:  Matson’s Micronesia service provides conventional container freight services carrying mainly general sustenance cargo between the U.S. West Coast and the islands of Kwajalein, Ebeye and Majuro in the Republic of the Marshall Islands, the islands of Yap, Pohnpei, Chuuk and Kosrae in the Federated States of Micronesia, and the Republic of Palau.  Cargo destined for these locations is transshipped through Guam.
     South Pacific Service:  Matson’s South Pacific service provides container and conventional freight services carrying general sustenance cargo between New Zealand and the South Pacific Islands, including Fiji, Samoa, American Samoa, Tonga, the Cook Islands, Niue, Vanuatu, Nauru, and the Solomon Islands.  In August 2016, Matson introduced its new South Pacific Express service that connects the U.S. West Coast to the ports in the South Pacific Islands.  Cargo is transshipped to Honolulu, Hawaii, with a monthly conventional container freight service connecting the U.S. West Coast and Hawaii service to our South Pacific network, including New Zealand. 
     Terminals: 
     Matson provides container stevedoring, container equipment maintenance and other terminal services (collectively “terminal services”) for MatNav at terminals located on the Hawaiian islands of Oahu, Hawaii, Maui and Kauai; and in the Alaska terminal locations of Anchorage, Kodiak and Dutch Harbor.  Matson also provides terminal services for other ocean carriers at the Alaska terminal locations of Kodak and Dutch Harbor. 
     SSAT provides terminal and stevedoring services to various carriers at six terminal facilities on the U.S. West Coast and to MatNav at three of those facilities, including Long Beach and Oakland, California, and Seattle, Washington.  Matson records its share of income in the joint venture in operating costs in the Consolidated Statements of Income and Comprehensive Income, and within the Ocean Transportation segment due to the nature of SSAT’s operations.
     Matson utilizes the services of other third-party terminal operators at all of the other ports at which its vessels call. 
     Ship Management Services:  
     Matson contracts with the U.S. Department of Transportation to provide ship management services.  During the first quarter of 2016, Matson signed an eight-year ship management contract to manage and maintain three Ready Reserve Force vessels on behalf of the U.S. Department of Transportation Maritime Administration.     Matson’s Vessel and Equipment Information:
     Vessels:
     Matson’s fleet includes 22 owned and five chartered vessels.  Matson’s owned vessels represent an investment of approximately $1.4 billion (see Critical Accounting Estimates in Item 7 of Part II below for additional information about vessel costs and net book values).  The majority of Matson’s owned vessels are U.S. flagged vessels, and have been acquired with the assistance of withdrawals from a Capital Construction Fund (“CCF”) established under Section 607 of the Merchant Marine Act of 1936 (see Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below for additional information).
     Matson’s fleet consists of 21 U.S. flagged vessels operating in the Hawaii, Guam, China and Alaska services, and six non-U.S. flagged vessels operating in the Micronesia and South Pacific services.

      Hawaii Fleet Renewal Program:        Matson has 11 vessels actively deployed in its Hawaii service including three steamships.  Including these three steamships, the Company has a total of seven steamships, all of which are near the end of their useful life.  Beginning January 1, 2020, these steamships will no longer comply with established U.S. and international emission regulations without substantial modifications.  In order to renew its Hawaii fleet and prepare for the phase-out of its steamships, Matson ordered four new vessels as follows:
    
· | During the fourth quarter of 2013, MatNav and Philly Shipyard, Inc. (“Philly Shipyard”) entered into definitive agreements pursuant to which Philly Shipyard will construct two new Aloha Class containerships with dual-fuel capable engines (the “Philly Shipbuilding Agreements”).
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

· | During the third quarter of 2016, MatNav and General Dynamics NASSCO (“NASSCO”) entered into a definitive agreement pursuant to which NASSCO will construct two new Kanaloa Class combination container and roll-on/roll-off (“Con-Ro”) vessels with dual-fuel capable engines (the “NASSCO Shipbuilding Agreements”).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Certain specifications of the new vessels on order are as follows:

      Expected annual construction progress payments based on signed agreements and change orders, excluding owners’ items and capitalized interest, for both the Aloha Class and Kanaloa Class vessels are as follows:
    
(in millions) | 2016 and Prior | | 2017 | | 2018 | 2019 | | 2020 | | Total
Two Aloha Class Containerships | $ | 95.9 | | $ | 159.1 | $ | 138.1 | | $ | 20.3 | $ | 0.9 | $ | 414.3
Two Kanaloa Class Con-Ro Vessels | | 25.6 | | | 41.7 | | 246.1 | | | 174.3 | | 23.3 | | 511.0
Total | $ | 121.5 | | $ | 200.8 | $ | 384.2 | | $ | 194.6 | $ | 24.2 | $ | 925.3

      Upon delivery, the two new Aloha Class containerships are expected to replace the three active steamships currently deployed in the Company’s Hawaii service.  By the end of 2019, Matson expects to have retired all of its seven active steamships as they will no longer comply with new environmental regulations without substantial modifications that are effective as of January 1, 2020.
     When complete, these new Aloha Class containerships and Kanaloa Class Con-Ro vessels are expected to have among the lowest operating cost per TEU of any vessel in the U.S. domestic trades.  The cost efficiencies are expected to be driven by our ability to return to an optimal nine vessel Hawaii fleet deployment and by significantly lower operating costs including fuel consumption, maintenance and repair, and dry-docking costs. 
     Equipment
     As a complement to its fleet of vessels, Matson has a variety of equipment including cranes, containers, chassis and other equipment, which represents an investment in excess of $0.5 billion as of December 31, 2016.  Matson also leases containers, chassis and other equipment under various operating lease agreements.
     Additional information of Matson’s fleet equipment is as follows:

----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

      Operating Costs:
     Major components of ocean transportation operating costs are as follows:
     Direct Cargo Expense includes terminal handling costs, purchased outside transportation and other related costs.  
    
 
  5

 

 Vessel Operating Expense includes crew wages and related costs, fuel consumption, pilot, tugs and line related costs, vessel charter expenses, and other vessel related expenses.  Matson purchases fuel oil, lubricants and gasoline for its operations; and also pays fuel surcharges to other third party transportation providers.
     Operating Overhead includes equipment repair costs, equipment operating lease and repositioning expenses, vessel repair and maintenance costs, dry-docking amortization, insurance, port engineers and other maintenance costs, and other vessel and shoreside related overhead.
     Matson’s U.S. flagged vessels must meet specified seaworthiness standards established by U.S. Coast Guard rules and classification society requirements.  These standards require that our vessels undergo two dry-docking inspections within a five-year period.  The majority of Matson’s U.S. flagged vessels are enrolled in the U.S. Coast Guard’s Underwater Survey in Lieu of Dry-docking (“UWILD”) program.  The UWILD program allows eligible vessels to meet their intermediate dry-docking requirement with a less costly underwater inspection.
     Matson is responsible for ensuring that its non-U.S flagged owned and bareboat chartered vessels meet international standards for seaworthiness, which among other requirements generally mandate that Matson perform two dry-docking inspections every five years.  The dry-dockings of Matson’s time chartered vessels are the responsibility of the vessel owners.
     Competition:
     The following is a summary of major competitors in Matson’s Ocean Transportation service:
     Hawaii Service: Matson’s Hawaii service has one major containership competitor, Pasha Hawaii (“Pasha”), which operates container and roll-on/roll-off services between the ports of Long Beach, Oakland and San Diego, California, to Honolulu, Hawaii.  There also are two barge operators, Aloha Marine Lines and Sause Brothers, which offer barge service between the Pacific Northwest and Hawaii.
     Foreign-flag vessels carrying cargo to Hawaii from non-U.S. locations also provide alternatives for companies shipping to Hawaii.  Other competitors in the Hawaii service include proprietary operators and contract carriers of bulk cargo.  Air freight competition for time-sensitive and perishable cargo exists; however, inroads by such competition in terms of cargo volume are limited by the amount of cargo space available in passenger aircrafts and by relatively high air freight rates.
     Matson vessels are operated on schedules that provide shippers and consignees fixed day-of-the-week sailings from the U.S. West Coast as well as fixed day-of-the-week arrivals in Hawaii.  Matson offers four westbound sailings per week, though this amount may be adjusted according to seasonal demand and market conditions.  One of Matson’s westbound sailings each week continues on to Guam and China, so the number of eastbound sailings from Hawaii to the U.S. Mainland is three per week.  This service is attractive to customers because more frequent sailings permit customers to reduce inventory costs.  Matson also competes by offering a more comprehensive service to customers, including:  service to and from the three largest U.S. West Coast ports; the most efficient terminal network on the U.S. West Coast; a dedicated neighbor islands barge network; an award winning customer service team; and its efficiency and experience in handling cargo of all types.
     Alaska Service:  Matson’s Alaska service has one major competitor, Totem Ocean Trailer Express, Inc., which operates a roll-on/roll off service between Tacoma, Washington and Anchorage, Alaska.  There are also two barge operators, Alaska Marine Lines which mainly serves Seattle, Washington to the main ports of Anchorage and Dutch Harbor, and other locations in Alaska, and Samson Tug & Barge which mainly serves Western Alaska and other locations.  The barge operators have historically shipped lower value commodities that can accommodate a longer transit time, as well as construction materials and other cargo that are not conducive to movement in containers.        Matson offers customers twice weekly scheduled services from Tacoma, Washington to Anchorage and Kodiak, Alaska and weekly service to Dutch Harbor, Alaska. The Company also provides a weekly barge service between Dutch Harbor and Akutan in Alaska. Matson is the only Jones Act containership operator providing service to Kodiak and Dutch Harbor in Alaska, which are the primary loading ports for southbound seafood.

 China Service: Major competitors to Matson’s China service include large international carriers such as Maersk, MSC, CMA CGM, Evergreen, China COSCO, “K” Line, OOCL, Hyundai and NYK Line.
     Matson competes by offering fast and reliable freight availability from the ports of Ningbo and Shanghai in China to Long Beach, California, providing fixed day arrivals and next-day cargo availability.  Matson’s service is further differentiated by offering a dedicated Long Beach marine terminal, an off-dock container yard providing fast truck turn times, one-stop intermodal connections, and providing state-of-the-art technology and world-class customer service.  Matson has offices in Hong Kong, Shenzhen, Xiamen, Ningbo and Shanghai, and has contracted with terminal operators in Ningbo and Shanghai.
     Guam Service: Matson’s Guam service has one major competitor, American President Lines (“APL”), a subsidiary of CMA CGM, which operates a weekly U.S. flagged container feeder service connecting the U.S. West Coast to Guam and Saipan, via transshipments over Yokohama, Japan and Busan, South Korea.  There are also several foreign carriers that call at Guam from foreign origins along with the Waterman Steamship Corporation, a U.S. flagged carrier, which periodically calls at Guam.  
     Japan Service:  Matson’s Japan service will compete primarily with APL, which operates a weekly U.S. flagged containership service from the U.S. West Coast to the Port of Naha, Okinawa, Japan.
     Micronesia and the South Pacific Services: Matson’s Micronesia and South Pacific services have competition from a variety of local and international carriers that provide freight services to the area.
     Customer Concentration:  
     Matson serves customers in numerous industries and carries a wide variety of cargo, mitigating its dependence upon any single customer or single type of cargo.  In 2016, the Company’s 10 largest Ocean Transportation customers accounted for approximately 24 percent of the Company’s Ocean Transportation revenue.  None of these customers accounted for more than 10 percent of Ocean Transportation’s operating revenues.     Seasonality:
     Matson’s Ocean Transportation services typically experience seasonality in volume, generally following a pattern of increasing volumes starting in the second quarter of each year, culminating in a peak season throughout the third quarter, with subsequent decline in demand during the fourth and first quarters.  This seasonality trend is amplified in the Alaska service primarily due to winter weather and the timing of southbound seafood trade.  As a result, earnings tend to follow a similar pattern, offset by periodic vessel dry-docking and other episodic cost factors, which can lead to earnings variability. In addition, in the China trade, volume is driven primarily by U.S. consumer demand for goods during key retail selling seasons while freight rates are impacted mainly by macro supply and demand variables.     Maritime Laws and the Jones Act:
     Maritime Laws: All interstate and intrastate marine commerce within the U.S. falls under the Merchant Marine Act of 1920 (commonly referred to as the Jones Act).
     The Jones Act is a long-standing cornerstone of U.S. maritime policy.  Under the Jones Act, all vessels transporting cargo between covered U.S. ports must, subject to limited exceptions, be built in the U.S., registered under the U.S. flag, be manned predominantly by U.S. crews, and owned and operated by U.S.-organized companies that are controlled and 75 percent owned by U.S. citizens.  U.S. flagged vessels are generally required to be maintained at higher standards than foreign flagged vessels and are subject to rigorous supervision and inspections by, or on behalf of, the U.S. Coast Guard, which requires appropriate certifications and background checks of the crew members.  Under Section 27 of the Jones Act, the carriage of cargo between the U.S. West Coast, Hawaii and Alaska on foreign-built or foreign-documented vessels is prohibited.
     During 2016, approximately 57 percent of Matson’s revenues generated by ocean transportation services, including Hawaii and Alaska, came from trades that were subject to the Jones Act.  Matson’s Hawaii and Alaska trade routes are included within the non-contiguous Jones Act market.  Hawaii, as an island economy, and Alaska due to its geographical 

 
  7

 
location, are both dependent on ocean transportation.  The Jones Act ensures frequent, reliable, roundtrip service to these locations.  Matson’s vessels operating in these trade routes are Jones Act qualified.
     Matson is a member of the American Maritime Partnership (“AMP”), which supports the retention of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws.  The Jones Act has broad support from both houses of Congress.  Matson also believes that the ongoing war on terrorism has further solidified political support for U.S. flagged vessels because a vital and dedicated U.S. merchant marine is a cornerstone for a strong homeland defense, as well as a critical source of trained U.S. mariners for wartime support.  AMP seeks to inform elected officials and the public about the economic, national security, commercial, safety and environmental benefits of the Jones Act and similar cabotage laws.  Repeal of the Jones Act would allow foreign-flag vessel operators that do not have to abide by all U.S. laws and regulations to sail between U.S. ports in direct competition with Matson and other U.S. domestic operators that must comply with all such laws and regulations.
     Other U.S. maritime laws require vessels operating between Guam, a U.S. territory, and U.S. ports to be U.S. flagged and predominantly U.S. crewed, but not U.S. built.
     Cabotage laws are not unique to the United States, and similar laws exist around the world in over 50 countries, including regions in which Matson provides ocean transportation services.  Any changes in such laws may have an impact on the services provided by Matson in those regions.
     Rate Regulations and Fuel Related Surcharge:        Matson is subject to the jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board with respect to its domestic ocean rates.  A rate in the non-contiguous domestic trade is presumed reasonable and will not be subject to investigation if the aggregate of increases and decreases is not more than 7.5 percent above, or more than 10 percent below, the rate in effect one year before the effective date of the proposed rate, subject to increase or decrease by the percentage change in the U.S. Producer Price Index.  Matson generally provides a 30-day notice to customers of any increases in general rates and terminal handling charges, and passes along decreases as soon as possible.
     Matson’s Ocean Transportation services engaged in U.S. foreign commerce are subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Maritime Commission (“FMC”).  The FMC is an independent regulatory agency that is responsible for the regulation of ocean-borne international transportation of the U.S.  Conducting business in foreign shipping markets subjects the Company to certain risks (see Item 1A of Part I below for additional information about such risks).
     Matson applies a fuel surcharge rate to its ocean transportation customers.  Changes in the fuel surcharge levels are correlated to prevailing market rates for bunker fuel prices along with other fuel related cost factors.  
     Emission Regulations:  
     Matson is focused on reducing transportation emissions, including carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, particulate matter and sulfur dioxide, through improvements in vessel fuel consumption and truck efficiency; and the development of more fuel-efficient transportation solutions.
     The global sulfur emissions cap was reduced to 3.5 percent effective January 1, 2012, and is planned to be reduced to as low as 0.5 percent by 2020. With respect to North America, the U.S Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) received approval from the International Maritime Organization, in coordination with Environment Canada, to designate all waters, with certain limited exceptions, within 200 nautical miles of U.S. and Canadian coast lines as designated emission control areas (“ECAs”).  Most of Matson’s vessels operate a portion of their voyages in ECAs while Matson’s Alaska vessels operate a substantial portion of their voyages in ECAs.  The North American ECA went into effect on August 1, 2012, limiting the sulfur emissions to 1.0 percent, with scheduled reductions in future years.  Maximum sulfur emissions permitted in designated ECA’s were reduced to 0.1 percent on January 1, 2015.
     In 2014, Matson received a conditional waiver from the EPA ECA regulations for three diesel-powered vessels used in the Hawaii service that permits the continued use of 1.0 percent sulfur content fuel for a limited time, subject to the development of technologies that monitor main engine performance and promote full power operations on fuels with a sulfur content of less than 0.1 percent.  This waiver expires at the end of 2017 but does include a provision for extension

for an additional two years.  The Company is currently developing solutions to comply with the EPA ECA regulations for these three vessels. 
     Effective in 2015, Horizon received a conditional waiver (subsequently transferred to Matson pursuant to the Horizon Acquisition) from the EPA ECA regulations for three diesel-powered vessels used in the Alaska service that permits the use of 2.0 percent sulfur content fuel on these vessels for a limited time, subject to the installation and testing of an exhaust gas cleaning system (known as ‘scrubbers’) on such vessels.  Matson completed the installation of scrubbers in each of the three diesel-powered vessels as of December 31, 2016, which are now operating within the EPA ECA regulations.
    
(1) | LOGISTICS SEGMENT
----+------------------

      Logistics Services:        Matson’s Logistics segment provides the following services:
     Transportation Brokerage Services:  Matson Logistics’ transportation brokerage services provide intermodal rail, highway, and other third-party logistics services for North American customers and international ocean carrier customers, including MatNav.  Matson Logistics is able to reduce transportation costs for its customers through volume purchases of rail, motor carrier and ocean transportation services, augmented by such services as shipment tracking and tracing, and single-vendor invoicing.  Matson Logistics operates five customer service centers and has sales offices throughout the United States.
     Freight Forwarding Services: Matson Logistics provides LCL consolidation and freight forwarding services primarily to the Alaska market through its wholly owned subsidiary, Span Alaska.  Span Alaska’s business aggregates LCL freight at its main terminal in Auburn, Washington for consolidation and shipment to a network of terminals in Alaska.  Span Alaska also provides trucking services to its Auburn terminal and from its Alaska based terminals to final customer destinations in Alaska.
     Warehousing and Distribution Services:  Matson Logistics provides warehousing and distribution services in Northern and Southern California, and in Georgia.  Matson Logistics operates two warehouses in Georgia, two in Northern California, and one in Southern California.
     Supply Chain Management and Other Services:  Matson Logistics’ supply chain management provides customers with a variety of logistics services including purchase order management, non-vessel operating common carrier freight forwarding services and customs brokerage. 
     Operating Costs:
     Logistics operating costs primarily include the costs of outside transportation, leased warehouse and other facilities operating costs, customer service costs, and other operating overhead. 
     Competition:
     Matson Logistics competes with hundreds of local, regional, national and international companies that provide transportation and third-party logistics services. The industry is highly fragmented and, therefore, competition varies by geography and areas of service. 
     Matson Logistics’ transportation brokerage services competes most directly with C.H. Robinson Worldwide, the Hub Group, and other freight brokers and intermodal marketing companies, and asset-invested market leaders such as J.B. Hunt.  Competition is differentiated by the depth, scale and scope of customer relationships; vendor relationships and rates; network capacity; and real-time visibility into the movement of customers’ goods and other technology solutions.  Additionally, while Matson Logistics primarily provides surface transportation brokerage, it also competes to a lesser degree with other forms of transportation for the movement of cargo, including air freight services.
     Matson Logistics’ freight forwarding services competes most directly with a variety of freight forwarding companies that operate within Alaska including Carlile, Lynden, American Fast Freight and Alaska Traffic Company.

     Customer Concentration:
     Matson Logistics serves customers in numerous industries and geographical locations.  In 2016, the Company’s 10 largest logistics customers accounted for approximately 22 percent of the Company’s Logistics revenue.  None of these customers accounted for more than 10 percent of Matson Logistics’ operating revenues.     Seasonality:
     Matson’s Logistics services are generally not significantly impacted by seasonality factors, except for its freight forwarding service to Alaska which are affected by the winter weather, the cyclical nature of the oil, construction and fishing industries, and the seasonal nature of the tourism industry.
C. | EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS
---+------------------------------

      Employees:
     As of December 31, 2016, Matson and its subsidiaries had 1,925 employees, of which 712 employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements with shoreside and offshore unions.  These numbers do not include billets on vessels discussed below, employees of SSAT, or other non-employees, such as agents, temporary workers and contractors.
     Matson’s active fleet employed seagoing personnel in 355 billets at December 31, 2016.  Each billet corresponds to a position on a vessel that typically is filled by two or more employees because seagoing personnel rotate between active sea-duty and time ashore.  Matson’s ship management services also employed personnel in 28 billets at December 31, 2016.
     Bargaining Agreements:
     Matson and SSAT are members of the Pacific Maritime Association (“PMA”), which on behalf of its members negotiates collective bargaining agreements with the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (“ILWU”) on the U.S. Pacific Coast.  The PMA/ILWU collective bargaining agreements cover substantially all U.S. West Coast longshore labor.  Matson also has collective bargaining agreements with other unions that expire at various dates in the future.
     Matson’s seagoing employees are represented by unions for both unlicensed and licensed crew members.  
 Matson also has collective bargaining agreements with these unions that expire at various dates in the future.
     While Matson believes that it will be able to renegotiate collective bargaining agreements with its various unions as they expire without any significant impact on its operations; no assurance can be given that such agreements will be reached without slow-downs, strikes, lock-out or other disruptions that may adversely impact Matson’s operations.
     Multi-employer Pension Plans:
     Matson contributes to a number of multi-employer pension plans.  If Matson were to withdraw from or significantly reduce its obligation to contribute to any one of the plans, Matson would review and evaluate data, actuarial assumptions, calculations and other factors used in determining its withdrawal liability, if any.  If any third-parties materially disagree with Matson’s determination, Matson would pursue the various means available to it under federal law for the adjustment or removal of its withdrawal liability.
     Matson has no present intention of withdrawing from, and does not anticipate the termination of any of the multi-employer pension plans that it contributes to except for the ILA-PRSSA pension fund in Puerto Rico which Horizon withdrew from (see Notes 11 and 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II below for a discussion of withdrawal liabilities under certain multi-employer pension plans).
