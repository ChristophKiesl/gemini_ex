ITEM 1. BUSINESS
History
 
The Glimpse Group, Inc. was incorporated on June 15, 2016, under the laws of the State of Nevada and is headquartered in New York, New York.
 
On July 6, 2021, the Company completed its initial public offering (“IPO”). In connection with the IPO, the Company’s common stock began trading on the Nasdaq Capital Market on and as of July 1, 2021. In conjunction with its IPO, the Company sold approximately 1.91 million shares of its common stock at $7.00 per share, raising approximately $11.82 million in net proceeds after fees and expenses.
COMPANY OVERVIEW
 
We are a Virtual (“VR”) and Augmented (“AR”) Reality platform company, comprised of a diversified group of wholly-owned and operated VR and AR companies, providing enterprise-focused software, services and solutions. We believe that we offer significant exposure to the rapidly growing and potentially transformative VR and AR markets, while mitigating downside risk via our diversified model and ecosystem.
 
Our platform of VR/AR subsidiary companies, collaborative environment and diversified business model aims to simplify the challenges faced by companies in the emerging VR/AR industry, potentially improving each subsidiary company’s ability to succeed, while simultaneously providing investors an opportunity to invest directly into the emerging VR/AR industry via a diversified infrastructure.
 
Leveraging our platform, we strive to cultivate and manage the business operations of our VR/AR subsidiary companies, with the goal of allowing each underlying company to better focus on mission-critical endeavors, collaborate with the other subsidiary companies, reduce time to market, optimize costs, improve product quality and leverage joint go-to-market strategies. Subject to operational, market and financial developments and conditions, we intend to carefully add to our current portfolio of subsidiary companies via a combination of organic expansion and/or outside acquisition.
 
The VR/AR industry is an early-stage technology industry with nascent markets. We believe that this industry has significant growth potential across verticals, may be transformative and that our diversified platform and ecosystem create important competitive advantages. Our subsidiary companies currently target a wide array of industry verticals, including but not limited to: Corporate Training, Education, Healthcare, Branding/Marketing/Advertising, Retail, Financial Services, Food & Hospitality, Media & Entertainment, Architecture/Engineering/Construction (“AEC”) and Social VR support groups and therapy. We do not currently target direct-to-consumer (“B2C’) VR/AR software or services, only business-to-business (“B2B”) and business-to-business-to-consumer (“B2B2C”), and we are hardware agnostic.

The Glimpse Platform
 
We develop, commercialize and market innovative and proprietary VR/AR software products, solutions and intellectual property (“IP”). Our platform is currently comprised of ten active wholly-owned subsidiary companies, each targeting different industry segments in a non-competitive, collaborative manner. Our experienced management and dynamic VR/AR entrepreneurs have deep domain expertise, providing the foundation for value-add-collaborations throughout our ecosystem.
 
Each of our subsidiary companies share operational, financial and IP infrastructure, facilitating shorter time-to-market, higher quality products, reduced development costs, fewer redundancies, significant go-to-market synergies and, ultimately, a higher potential for success for each subsidiary company. We believe that our collaborative platform is unique and necessary, especially given the early nature of the VR/AR industry. By offering technologies and solutions in various industry segments, we aim to reduce dependency on any one single subsidiary company, technology or industry segment.
 
We believe that three core tenets enhance our probability of success: (1) our ecosystem of VR/AR companies, (2) diversification and (3) profitable growth.
 
(1) Our ecosystem of VR/AR software and service companies provides significant benefits to each subsidiary company and our group as a whole. We believe that the most notable benefits are: (a) economies of scale, cost efficiencies and reduced redundancies; (b) cross company collaboration, deep domain expertise, IP and knowledge transfer; (c) superior product offerings; (d) faster time to market; (e) enhanced business development and sales synergies; and (f) multiple monetization paths. In an emerging industry that is lacking in infrastructure, we believe that our ecosystem provides a distinct competitive advantage relative to a single, standalone company in the industry.
 
(2) By design, we incorporate multiple aspects of diversity to reduce the risks associated with an early stage industry, create multiple monetization venues and improve the probabilities of success. There is no single point of failure or dependency. This is created through: (a) ownership of numerous wholly-owned subsidiary companies operating in different industry segments; (b) targeting large industries with clear VR/AR use-cases; (c) developing and utilizing various technologies and IP; (d) expanding to different geographic technology centers in a hub model under our umbrella; and (e) across industries, having a wide array of customers and potential acquirers/investors.
 
(3) From our inception, we have prioritized achieving operational cash flow neutrality early in our life. This was an important factor that drove our strategy to: (a) focus on enterprise software and services, only onboarding companies that are generating revenues or clearly could in the short term; (b) target solutions that are based on use cases that have a clear return on investment (“ROI”) and can be effectively developed from existing technologies and hardware; and (c) centralize costs to reduce inefficiencies. By targeting cash flow neutrality, our goal is to minimize dilution and support greater independence from capital markets, thereby increasing resiliency and maximizing upside potential.
 
As part of our platform, we provide a centralized corporate structure, which significantly reduces general and administrative costs (financial, operational, legal & IP), streamlines capital allocation and helps in coordinating business strategies. This allows our subsidiary company general managers to focus their time and effort almost exclusively on the core software, product and business development activities relating to their subsidiary.
 
Additionally, aligned economic incentives encourage cross-Company collaboration. All of our employees own equity in our Company. The leadership team of each subsidiary company, in addition to their equity ownership in Glimpse, also have an economic interest in their particular subsidiary company. This economic interest is negotiated with lead management of a subsidiary company upon their joining of our Company, and typically ranges between 5-10% of the total net sale proceeds of the subsidiary and includes a three-year vesting schedule. Thus, there is benefit to them not only when their subsidiary company succeeds but also when any of the other subsidiaries succeeds, and when Glimpse as a whole succeeds. We believe that this ownership mechanism is a strong driver of cross-pollination of ideas and fosters collaboration. While each subsidiary company owns its own IP, our parent company currently owns 100% of each subsidiary company. In addition, there will be perpetual licensing agreements between our subsidiary companies, so that if a subsidiary company is divested, then the remaining subsidiaries, if utilizing the IP of a divested subsidiary company, will continue to retain usage rights post-divestiture.

AUGGD Asset Acquisition
 
In August 2021, the Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary company, MotionZone, LLC, (dba AUGGD) completed an acquisition of certain assets, as defined, from Augmented Reality Investments Pty Ltd., an Australia based company providing augmented reality software and services to the AEC market segments. AUGGD is our 10th active subsidiary company.
 
Initial consideration for the purchase is $0.75 million payable in the Company’s common stock. In August 2021, the Company issued 77,264 shares of common stock to satisfy the purchase price. The acquisition agreement provides for additional contingent consideration in the form of Company common stock if certain future revenue targets are achieved through June 2024. No liabilities were assumed as part of the acquisition and the primary assets acquired included employees, customer relationships and technology. The Company is currently determining its purchase price allocation between customer list, intellectual property and goodwill.
 
In conjunction with this acquisition, the Company has begun the process of establishing a new subsidiary - “Glimpse Australia” - focused on facilitating the potential introduction of our products and services to the Australian markets and, in addition to AUGGD, potentially adding other Australian VR/AR companies to Glimpse Australia over time.
 
The VR and AR (XR) Markets
 
Virtual Reality (VR) fully immerses the user in a digital environment via a head mounted display (“HMD”), where the user is blocked out of their immediate physical environment. Augmented Reality (AR) is a less immersive experience, where the user views their immediate physical environment with digital images overlaid, via a phone, tablet or a dedicated HMD such as smart glasses. While distinct, VR and AR are related, utilize some similar underlying technologies and are expected to become increasingly interconnected - combined they are often referred to as Immersive Technology (XR).
 
VR and AR are emerging technologies, and the markets for them are still nascent. We believe that XR technologies and solutions have the potential to fundamentally transform how people and businesses interact, further enabling remote work, education and commerce. XR is also expected to increasingly interconnect with other emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, computer vision, big data, NFT and crypto currencies. Additionally, HMD and telecommunication (5G) advancements have been driving vast improvements in capabilities and ease of use, while significantly reducing headset cost. As a result, market adoption has accelerated and is expected to continue. Leading technology companies such as Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Samsung, Sony and HP have been at the forefront of VR/AR hardware development and software infrastructure, while also increasing integration of their products with AR and VR capabilities.
 
Since Facebook released its first VR headset as a consumer product in 2016 (after its $2B+ acquisition of Oculus), successive iterations of it, as well as others, have become significantly lighter, more comfortable, lower priced, with higher resolution and increasingly wireless/mobile. With a standalone mobile headset, users no longer need an expensive gaming computer to power the headset and they also do not have a wire tethered to that computer restricting movement. These advances have facilitated easier corporate procurement and integration. The accelerating rollout of 5G should enable further improvement in user experience since with 5G, remote processing and heavier, real time applications become possible without noticeable visual lag, allowing for lighter, smaller, more comfortable HMDs with longer battery life.

Based on Artillery Intelligence’s market forecasts, the VR and AR markets are forecasted to grow 31% in 2021 to over $9 billion, expanding at a 39% Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) over the next three years, exceeding $35 billion by 2023. In particular, VR and AR enterprise software – the segment we are focused on – is projected to grow 59% in 2021 and expand at a 55% CAGR to more than $10 billion in 2023.
 

Business Development and Sales
 
We utilize a hybrid approach to the sales and distribution of our software products and services.
 
At our subsidiary company level, each company has its own business development and sales team, the size of which depends on its stage of development. Each subsidiary company’s general manager is responsible for business development, and as the subsidiary gains market traction, its business development and sales team are expanded as needed.
 
Our subsidiary companies’ business development and sales teams are enhanced by the shared resources and influence of our ecosystem. Our management takes an active role in the business development activities of each subsidiary company and in the overall development and integration of sale strategies, goals and budgets. As an integral part of the business development and sales processes, each subsidiary company’s general manager is very familiar with the product offerings of other subsidiary companies and leverages those into his or her own efforts when appropriate. This leads to substantial cross marketing collaboration.
 
We believe that a subsidiary company’s ability to demonstrate to potential customers scale as part of our ecosystem of companies, combined with our subsidiary’s ability to offer its products and solutions as well as those of our other subsidiary companies in an integrated manner, represents a key competitive advantage. We believe our customers often view us as a “one-stop-shop” for all their VR/AR needs and an expert in the emerging VR/AR space.
 
We and our subsidiary companies continue to develop a shared partner ecosystem to further scale business and expand our solutions into new and existing target markets.
 
Competitive Environment
 
We believe that our competitors in the VR/AR industry are focused on two primary segments: VR/AR Hardware (headsets) and Software.
 
VR/AR Hardware (Headsets) (“Hardware”):
 
We do not develop any Hardware, and our software and service solutions are mostly compatible with any Hardware. We believe that Hardware development, commercialization and distribution are highly capital intensive and there is not yet large enough scale or mass adoption in the VR/AR industry to justify such expenditures for a smaller company. As such, there are relatively few participants on the Hardware side, some very large (for example: Facebook/Oculus, Microsoft, Samsung, Google, Apple, HTC, HP, Lenovo, Sony and Epson) and some much smaller (for example: Magic Leap, Pico, Valve and Vuzix). In general, Hardware cycles have been accelerating and performance improving, with simplified usability and reduced end-user costs. The more advanced, easier to use and cheaper the Hardware becomes, the higher the potential for the development of robust software applications and increased market adoption of VR/AR solutions.

9
-

VR/AR Software (“Software”):
 
In contrast to VR/AR Hardware, Software is highly fragmented with hundreds of VR/AR Software companies targeting different segments and solutions. Many are consumer oriented, whereas we are entirely enterprise focused (B2B, B2B2C). We believe that the AR/VR Software segment is currently far less competitive than traditional software markets, as most companies in the space tend to be early stage and often underfunded.
 
While competition is evolving and increasing, there is currently no dominant player in any particular VR/AR Software segment. We believe that we have the potential to become a leader in the VR/AR Software space in general and that each of our subsidiary companies has the potential to become a significant player in their particular industry sector.
 
As previously described, we believe that our structure, ecosystem and integrated capabilities create significant competitive advantages for each of our subsidiary companies, not available to other Software companies in the VR/AR space. By owning and operating a diverse set of VR/AR companies, we believe that we significantly improve each of our subsidiary company’s ability to succeed by addressing many of the challenges early stage companies face and expanding each’s opportunity set and capabilities.
 
We believe that there are a select number of earlier stage companies of approximately our size that provide VR/AR Software and could be viewed as potential competitors. In addition, several of the larger technology players provide general infrastructure VR/AR Software. In particular: ARCore from Google and ARKit from Apple, which enable AR functionality on smartphones and tablets; and Unity and Epic Unreal, which enable software languages used in VR and AR programing. We do not view these larger companies as competition, but rather as complementary to our business. We believe infrastructure software benefits us, and the industry at large, as they are not industry specific and enable companies like us to more effectively build industry specific solutions, thereby saving significant costs and development efforts.
 
Platform Expansion and Diversification Strategy
 
As described above in “Competitive Environment,” the VR/AR software and services industries are highly fragmented. There are numerous potential acquisition targets that, while having established a niche market position, product or technology, have limited resources and ability to pursue growth initiatives. We intend to leverage our position and relative scale in the industry in order to continue to add to our platform both earlier stage companies and technologies and, subject to the availability of capital and appropriate targets, more mature companies. Beyond the expected financial impact of each such potential addition, these could also enhance our ecosystem, technology, scale and competitive position. These potential acquisitions may be domestic or international. If there is sufficient scale in a certain geographic location (beyond our current NYC headquarters), then a new hub may be established in such location, with several subsidiary companies operating in that hub, under the overall Glimpse umbrella.
Strategic Divestitures
 
Each one of our subsidiary companies has the potential to be divested or spun off. Although the purpose of our platform is to grow and develop the ecosystem on which each of our subsidiaries can mature by benefitting from collaboration, each subsidiary company targets a specific industry vertical (i.e. Healthcare, Education, Corporate Training, etc.) and as such has a distinct set of potential acquirers or investors. If a subsidiary company is divested and the proceeds are substantive, then our intent is to distribute the majority of the net proceeds to our shareholder base, if such distribution would not jeopardize our growth and operations.
Intellectual Property
 
Our intellectual property is an integral part of our business strategy and practice. In accordance with industry practice, we protect our proprietary products, technology and competitive advantage through a combination of contractual provisions and trade secrets, patents, copyright and trademark laws in the United States and other jurisdictions where business is conducted.
 
As of the date of this disclosure and summarized in the table below, we have filed thirteen (13) patent applications, four (4) of which have been issued and one (1) allowed and registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (the “USPTO”).

Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our services or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. The laws of many countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. There can be no assurance that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar services or products. Any failure by us to adequately protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition. See “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business.”
 
Business Cycles
 
Based on our history and information available to date, we have not been able to identify any seasonality of cycles within our business. Since VR/AR is an emerging industry, market and customer education are material and the length of the typical sales cycle can be between 3 and 18 months, depending on the size and complexity of the proposed solution and the customer’s level of understanding of the VR/AR space and prior experience.
Economic Dependence
 
For the year ended June 30, 2021, one customer accounted for approximately 26% of our revenues and another for approximately 23% of our revenues. These same customers accounted for approximately 0.5% and 5% of revenues, respectively, for the year ended June 30, 2020. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues for the year ended June 30, 2021. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, a different customer than mentioned above accounted for 12.5% of our revenues. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, no other customer accounted for 10% or more of our revenues.
 
We operate in an early stage industry, and customers are exploring various options for AR and VR solutions and acting as early adopters of VR and AR solutions. As such, there is a high degree of variance on our source of revenues while customers are on-boarded and our software product and solutions are integrated, measured and digested. A customer that may account for a higher concentration of revenue in one period may not account for any revenue in subsequent periods. In some cases those customers could re-engage after they have evaluated our solutions and may or may not be a source of future revenue.
 
As such, customers that make up a significant portion of revenues in one period, often do not make up a significant portion in other periods. Given this dynamic, which has continued both prior and subsequent to the reported periods, we expect this variability in Customer Concentration to continue until such point in time when our revenue has reached larger scale, and with a larger portion of our revenues coming from Software Licenses/SaaS. While there has been consistent oscillation in Customer Concentration from period-to-period, a significant reduction in revenue from our larger customers could have a material negative impact on our operations.
 
Typically, customer contracts can be canceled at any time by the customer upon 30-90 day written notice (depending on the size of the contract). In such an event, the customer would owe the Company unpaid amounts up until the point of cancelation. We typically charge 25-50% of the contract value upfront and the amounts are usually not refundable, mitigating some of the contract cancellation risk. While it does happen on occasion, it is rare that a signed contract is canceled.
 
Facilities
 
We are based in New York, New York. Our current facilities are leased and adequate to meet our ongoing needs. If we require additional space or expand geographically, we may seek additional facilities on commercially reasonable terms at such time. Due to Covid-19 constraints, since March 2020 our personnel have been working primarily on a remote basis, without detrimental effects. We returned to partial in person work in July 2021 and expect to continue as such for the foreseeable future, subject to Covid-19 developments.
 
We also lease a small office in Izmir, Turkey for the operations of Glimpse Turkey.
