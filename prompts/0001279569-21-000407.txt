ITEM 1. BUSINESSOverview
 
We are a vertically-integrated, multi-state owner and operator of licensed cannabis cultivation, processing and dispensary facilities and a developer, producer and distributor of innovative branded cannabis and cannabidiol (“CBD”) products in the United States. Although we are committed to creating a national retail brand and portfolio of branded cannabis and CBD products recognized in the United States, cannabis currently remains illegal under U.S. federal law.
 
Through our subsidiaries, we currently own and/or operate 31 dispensaries and 10 cultivation and/or processing facilities in nine U.S. states. In addition, we distribute cannabis and CBD products to over 200 dispensaries and CBD products to over 2,300 retail locations throughout the United States. Pursuant to our existing licenses, interests and contractual arrangements, we have the capacity to own and/or operate up to an additional 12 dispensaries in five states, plus an uncapped number of dispensaries in Florida and up to 12 cultivation and/or processing facilities and we have the right to manufacture and distribute cannabis products in nine U.S. states.
 
Our multi-state operations encompass the full spectrum of medical and adult-use cannabis and CBD enterprises, including cultivation, processing, product development, wholesale-distribution and retail. Cannabis products offered by us include flower and trim, products containing cannabis flower and trim (such as pre-rolls), cannabis infused products (such as topical creams and edibles) and products containing cannabis extracts (such as vape cartridges, concentrates, live resins, wax products, oils and tinctures). Our CBD products include topical creams, tinctures and sprays and products designed for beauty and skincare (such as lotions, creams, haircare products, lip balms and bath bombs). Under U.S. federal law, cannabis is classified as a Schedule I controlled substance under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act (the “CSA”). A Schedule I controlled substance is defined as a substance that has no currently accepted medical use in the United States, a lack of safety use under medical supervision and a high potential for abuse. Other than Epidiolex (cannabidiol), a cannabis-derived product, and three synthetic cannabis-related drug products (Marinol (dronabinol), Syndros (dronabinol) and Cesamet (nabilone)), the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) has not approved a marketing application for cannabis for the treatment of any disease or condition and has not approved any cannabis, cannabis-derived or CBD products. See Risk Factor - Our products are not approved by the FDA.

Operations
 
Cultivation. We cultivate multiple strains of cannabis plants within our licensed cultivation facilities across the United States. We believe that our facilities are designed, managed and operated to cultivate high-quality products in a cost-effective manner. Our cultivation process uses all parts of the cannabis plant, including flower and trim (“biomass”), to produce cannabis products that we sell at our dispensaries and distribute to third parties on a wholesale basis. We currently have 12 issued cultivation and processing licenses in nine U.S. states, with approximately 417,000 square feet of cultivation and processing space which is fully built-out, approximately 400,000 square feet of space which is under construction and the ability to expand to a total of approximately 817,000 square feet of space within our existing lots. We currently have the ability to harvest approximately 56,000 pounds of biomass annually in our existing cultivation space, and we believe that we will have the ability to harvest approximately 195,000 pounds of biomass annually if we are able to use all of our projected cultivation space, including the cultivation space that is currently under construction and the additional unused cultivation space within our existing lots.
Product Development and Processing. We develop and sell cannabis products for medical and adult-use and CBD products for beauty and skincare. Biomass is processed into oil and resin that is used to develop numerous cannabis-extracted products, including vape pen oils, lotions, tinctures, other concentrates and edibles. We typically conduct product development and processing activities within our cultivation facilities and CBD products are manufactured in third-party manufacturing facilities. Processing procedures include developing formulations and packaging for all cannabis branded products, including the brands we own (such as Mayflower Medicinals, Black Label and Melting Point Extracts (MPX)), as well as brands that we manufacture and sell pursuant to our white label and/or licensing agreements.
Distribution.
 
Wholesale.
 
We distribute our cannabis products through our wholesale channel to over 200 dispensaries, including our own dispensaries. Our MPX and Black Label branded products are distributed in over 170 dispensaries in Arizona, Maryland and Nevada. Our CBD products, which are produced under the brand name CBD For Life, are distributed through a mass market retail model, including online at www.cbdforlife.us and in over 2,300 retail locations across the United States. Wholesale customers for our CBD products include dispensaries, local retailers and several national retailers. We also have distribution and sales partnerships for our CBD products.
Retail.
 
We currently own and/or operate 31 dispensaries for the sale of medical and/or adult-use cannabis, CBD and ancillary products. These dispensaries sell products that have been cultivated, developed and processed by us as well as third parties, in states where such sales are permitted. We own and/or operate licensed dispensaries in prime markets, including Baltimore, Bethesda, Boston, Brooklyn, Miami, Orlando, Phoenix, Staten Island and West Palm Beach, and we plan to open additional locations in other prime markets such as Atlantic City and Las Vegas.

(2) | A holder of an Arizona Medical Marijuana Dispensary Registration Certificate and Marijuana Establishment License, also referred to as a dual license holder, permits its holder to operate one co-located medical and adult-use retail cannabis dispensary, which can be co-located with one medical or adult-use cannabis cultivation and manufacturing facility, two separately located cultivation and manufacturing facilities, and one separately located manufacturing, packaging, and storage facility. The Dispensary Registration Certificates and Marijuana Establish Licenses each held by ABACA, HFL, Soothing Options and THCWC, collectively allow for the operation of: (i) up to four co-located medical and adult-use cannabis retail dispensaries, (ii) up to four on-site cultivation facilities to cultivate and manufacturing cannabis and cannabis products; (iii) up to eight off-site cultivation facilities to cultivate and manufacture cannabis and cannabis products, and (iv) up to four off-site locations to manufacture, package, and store cannabis and cannabis products, all subject to regulatory approval. Through ABACA, HFL, Soothing Options and THCWC, we currently operate four medical cannabis dispensaries and three facilities for medical cannabis cultivation and processing, two of which are co-located with their affiliated dispensaries. We anticipate adult-use retail sales to begin at the start of the second quarter of 2021. In addition, Soothing Options has entered into a Cultivation Services Agreement with an unaffiliated, third-party, pursuant to which Soothing Options will license its off-site cultivation and processing license to the third-party, for a monthly fee and an option to purchase a set amount of biomass per month.

(3) | We do not currently have a license to operate a cannabis business in Colorado; however, on December 5, 2016, in related transactions, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiaries, Scarlet Globemallow, LLC (“Scarlet”) and Bergamot Properties, LLC (“Bergamot”) acquired certain non-cannabis assets of Organix, LLC (“Organix”) and the real estate holdings of Organix’s affiliate, DB Land Holdings, Inc., consisting of a 12,000 square foot cultivation facility in Denver, Colorado.

(4) | We own 100% of GHHIA Management, Inc. (“GHHIA”), which holds an exclusive 40-year management agreement to operate the medical cannabis business associated with the Florida Medical Marijuana Treatment Center (“MMTC”) license issued to McCrory’s and held an option to acquire 100% of McCrory’s for a nominal consideration, which was subject to the approval of the Florida Department of Health. On August 14, 2019, the Florida Department of Health approved GHHIA’s option to acquire McCrory’s and GHHIA subsequently exercised the option. Accordingly, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary GHHIA, now own 100% of McCrory’s.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(5) | Until April 1, 2020, Florida imposed a progressive limit on the number of medical cannabis dispensaries that could be operated by each vertically licensed MMTC based on the number of registered qualified medical cannabis patients in the state. This statutory cap, which permitted 25 dispensaries per MMTC, increasing by 5 dispensaries for each additional 100,000 patients registered in Florida’s Medical Marijuana Use Registry, expired on April 1, 2020. As of April 1, 2020, the MMTC license held by McCrory’s is no longer subject to the statutory cap. Through its vertically integrated MMTC license, McCrory’s currently operates 17 medical dispensaries in Florida.

(8) | We, through our wholly-owned subsidiary, iAnthus Capital Management, LLC (“ICM”), own 100% of Mayflower, which holds several medical and adult-use cannabis licenses. In addition, we, through our wholly-owned subsidiary CGX, own 100% of two separate management entities with service and consulting agreements with a second vertically integrated medical cannabis license holder, Cannatech. On October 8, 2020, we obtained approval from the Massachusetts Cannabis Control Commission (“CCC”) to convert Cannatech from a non-profit corporation to a for-profit corporation. On November 16, 2020, Cannatech was converted from a non-profit corporation to a for-profit corporation. As a result of the conversion, Cannatech is now owned 100% by the Company, through its wholly-owned subsidiary, CGX. In Massachusetts, an entity is permitted to control and operate up to three vertically-integrated medical Marijuana Treatment Center licenses, which include medical cultivation, product manufacturing and retail dispensing functions, up to three adult-use Marijuana Establishment cultivation licenses, up to three adult-use Marijuana Establishment product manufacturing licenses and up to three adult-use Marijuana Establishment retail licenses, with a maximum total cultivation “canopy” of up to 100,000 square feet.

(10) | Our Holliston, Massachusetts facility currently includes the cultivation and product manufacturing operations of its final vertically integrated medical Marijuana Treatment Center license as well as the operations of its final adult-use Marijuana Establishment cultivation license and product manufacturing license. Subject to regulatory approval, we expect that our Holliston, Massachusetts facility will also include the cultivation and product manufacturing operations of our additional provisional vertically-integrated medical Marijuana Treatment Center license. Subject to regulatory approval, we expect that our Fall River, Massachusetts facility will include the cultivation and product manufacturing operations of the provisional vertically integrated medical Marijuana Treatment Center license held by Cannatech as well as the operations of a provisional adult-use Marijuana Establishment cultivation license and provisional adult-use product manufacturing license granted to Cannatech on October 8, 2020. Subject to applicable regulatory approval, we expect to operate cultivation and product manufacturing functions for three vertically integrated medical licenses, two adult-use cultivation licenses and two adult-use product manufacturing licenses out of two facilities in Holliston and Fall River, Massachusetts. We may also seek an additional adult-use cultivation license and an additional product manufacturing license within the Massachusetts statutory and regulatory limitations.

Growth Strategies and Strategic Priorities
 
Expand retail footprint within existing dispensary license portfolio. We currently have 31 operating dispensaries; however, our licenses permit us to own and/or operate an additional 12 dispensaries in five states, plus an uncapped number of licenses in Florida, all subject to regulatory approval. We have dispensary licenses in key markets throughout the United States including New York City (Brooklyn and Staten Island), Boston, the Washington D.C. metro area (Bethesda), the Tampa and St. Petersburg area, Phoenix, the Miami and Fort Lauderdale area, Orlando, Baltimore and Las Vegas. We intend to expand our operations in Florida, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Jersey and New York.
 
Increase cultivation and processing capacity. We have 10 operational cultivation and processing licenses in nine states, with approximately 417,000 square feet of cultivation and processing space which is fully built-out, approximately 400,000 square feet of space which is under construction and the ability to expand to a total of approximately 817,000 square feet of space within our existing lots, subject to regulatory approval. We currently have the ability to harvest approximately 56,000 pounds of biomass annually in our existing cultivation space and we believe that we will have the ability to harvest approximately 195,000 pounds of biomass annually if we are able to use all of our projected cultivation space, including the cultivation space that is currently under construction and the additional unused cultivation space within our existing lots.

Increase patient and customer counts per location. We are focused on brand awareness and attracting new and existing patients and customers to our dispensaries and online ordering platforms. Our marketing and sales strategies include medical outreach, industry associations and websites, social media and a variety of other grassroots initiatives.
 
Acquire attractive targets to enhance our footprint, product offerings and/or operations. Strategic acquisitions are an important part of our ongoing growth strategy. We expect to continue to make strategic acquisitions that, among other things, are intended to increase revenue, build our geographic footprint, add new branded products to our portfolio and allow us to expand our capabilities and/or help improve operating efficiencies in existing markets.
 
Secure additional operating licenses throughout the United States. As more states legalize medical and/or adult-use cannabis products or expand their current cannabis regulations, new or additional cultivation, processing and/or dispensary licenses may become available. Given our operational history, we believe that we are well positioned to apply for any such new licenses.
 
Acquisitions
 
iA CBD, LLC
 
On June 27, 2019, we acquired substantially all of the assets and liabilities of CBD For Life through our wholly owned subsidiary, iA CBD, for consideration of $10.9 million (in cash and our common shares). As a result of this acquisition, we entered the CBD products market. We sell CBD For Life products directly to consumers online at www.cbdforlife.us as well as in over 2,300 retail locations across the United States.
 
MPX Bioceutical ULC
 
On February 5, 2019, we acquired the U.S. operations of MPX Bioceutical Corporation, which amalgamated into our-wholly owned subsidiary MPX Bioceutical ULC (“MPX”) for consideration of $533.1 million (in our common shares and common shares of a newly formed spin-out corporation which holds all of the non-U.S. cannabis businesses of MPX). In addition, we assumed certain debt instruments, warrants and options of MPX. As a result of the MPX Acquisition, we expanded our operations from six to ten states and added a robust portfolio of MPX-branded products. In addition, we acquired operations in Arizona, Nevada, Maryland and New Jersey and expanded our operations in Massachusetts.
Citiva Medical, LLC 
 
On February 1, 2018, we acquired Citiva which holds one vertically integrated medical cannabis license in the state of New York for consideration of $24.8 million (in cash and our common shares). As a result of the acquisition of Citiva, we expanded our cannabis operations to New York and are permitted to operate one medical manufacturing facility, including cultivation and processing capabilities and up to four medical dispensaries in New York.
 
GrowHealthy Properties, LLC
 
On January 17, 2018, we acquired substantially all of the assets of GrowHealthy Properties, LLC (“GHP”) and McCrory’s (collectively “GrowHealthy”) for consideration of $58.3 million (in cash and our common shares). The transactions included the formation of iAnthus Holdings Florida, LLC and GHHIA, each a wholly-owned subsidiary of ICM, together with the purchase of GHP and an option to acquire 100% of McCrory’s for nominal consideration. On September 19, 2019, the option was exercised and 100% of the membership interest in McCrory’s was transferred to GHHIA. As a result of the acquisition of GrowHealthy, we expanded our cannabis operations to Florida and as a result of the acquisition of McCrory’s, we hold a medical marijuana treatment center license in the state of Florida that permits us to operate one or more cultivation and processing facilities and an unlimited number of dispensaries.
 
Mayflower and Pilgrim 
 
On December 31, 2017, we acquired an 80% interest in Pilgrim Rock Management, LLC (“Pilgrim”) and on April 17, 2018, we acquired the remaining 20% interest in Pilgrim for consideration of an aggregate of 1,665,734 of our common shares. Pilgrim is an affiliated management company that provides management services, financing, intellectual property licensing, real estate, equipment leasing and certain other services to Mayflower. On July 31, 2018, Mayflower converted from a non-profit into a for-profit corporation and became our wholly-owned subsidiary. As a result of the acquisitions of Mayflower and Pilgrim, we expanded our cannabis operations to Massachusetts. Mayflower maintains one final vertically integrated medical license, one provisional vertically integrated medical license, one final adult-use cultivation license, one final adult-use product manufacturing license, one final adult-use retail license and one provisional adult-use retail license. Mayflower is also currently applying for a third provisional adult-use Marijuana Establishment retail license.

In addition, Mayflower received its final adult-use Marijuana Establishment retail license for its Worcester, Massachusetts dispensary, which became operational on December 10, 2020 and exclusively maintains adult-use operations.

Competition
 
We compete on a state-by-state basis in the limited license medical and adult-use cannabis markets as well as the national CBD markets. Participation in state cannabis programs has significant regulatory and financial hurdles that create high barriers to entry, which result in a limited number of market participants in most states. In addition, most of the states in which we operate impose regulatory limitations on the number of cannabis licenses that can be granted, thus allowing for existing license holders to compete against a fixed number of regulated competitors in a particular market. We face competition from local regulated cannabis operators as well as illicit cannabis businesses and other persons engaging in illicit cannabis-related activities within each state. Our primary competitors include the following multi-state operators: Acreage Holdings, Inc., Cresco Labs Inc., Curaleaf Holdings Inc., Green Thumb Industries Inc., Harvest Health & Recreation, Inc., Trulieve Cannabis Corp., AYR Wellness Inc. and Verano Holdings Corp.
 
With respect to our CBD business, we compete with a growing number of emerging CBD companies including multi-state cannabis operators that also offer CBD products, as well as certain large national and multinational corporations that offer or plan to offer CBD products that are or may be deemed similar to those offered by us.
 
Financial Restructuring
 
The significant disruption of global financial markets, and specifically, the decline in the overall public equity cannabis markets due to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic negatively impacted our ability to secure additional capital. Due to the liquidity constraints, we attempted to negotiate temporary relief of our interest obligations with the holders (the “Secured Lenders”) of our 13% senior secured convertible debentures (the “Secured Convertible Notes”) issued by ICM. However, we were unable to reach an agreement and did not make interest payments when due and payable to the Secured Lenders or payments that were due to the holders of our 8% convertible unsecured debentures (the “Unsecured Convertible Debentures” and together with the Secured Convertible Notes, the “Debentures”) (the “Unsecured Lenders” and together with the Secured Lenders, the “Lenders”). As of December 31, 2020, we are in default of our obligations pursuant to the Debentures which consists of $97.5 million and $60.0 million in principal amount plus accrued interest thereon of $15.1 million and $4.8 million with respect to the Secured Convertible Notes and Unsecured Convertible Debentures, respectively.


As a result of the default, all amounts, including principal and accrued interest, became immediately due and payable to the Lenders. Furthermore, as a result of the default, we also became obligated to pay an exit fee (the “Exit Fee”) of $10.0 million that accrues interest at a rate of 13% annually in relation to the Secured Convertible Notes, which exit fee, as of December 31, 2020, is $13.8 million. Upon payment of the Exit Fee, the holders of the Secured Convertible Notes issued in May 2018 (“Tranche One Secured Convertible Notes”) are required to transfer the 3,891,051 common shares issued under the $10.0 million equity financing that closed concurrently with the Tranche One Secured Convertible Notes to us. As of December 31, 2020, we have not paid the Exit Fee and such shares have not been transferred to us.

On June 22, 2020, we received a notice demanding repayment under the Secured Notes Purchase Agreement of the entire principal amount of the Secured Convertible Notes, together with interest, fees, costs and other charges that have accrued or may accrue from Gotham Green Admin 1, LLC, the collateral agent (the “Collateral Agent”) holding security for the benefit of the Secured Convertible Notes. The Collateral Agent concurrently provided us with a Notice of Intention to Enforce Security (the “BIA Notice”) under section 244 of the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act (Canada) (the “BIA”). Pursuant to section 244 of the BIA, the Collateral Agent may not enforce the security over the collateral granted by us until ten days after sending the BIA Notice unless we consent to an earlier enforcement of the security.
 
On July 13, 2020, we entered into a restructuring support agreement (the “Restructuring Support Agreement”) with the Secured Lenders and a majority of the Unsecured Lenders (the “Consenting Unsecured Lenders”) to effectuate a proposed recapitalization transaction (the “Recapitalization Transaction”) to be implemented by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement (the “Plan of Arrangement”) under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia) (the “BCBCA”) following approval by the Secured Lenders, Unsecured Lenders and our existing shareholders. Pursuant to Section 288(1) of the BCBCA, a company may propose an arrangement to its security holders (including shareholders and noteholders). To be effective, the arrangement must first be approved by the security holders of the company and then by the Supreme Court of British Columbia pursuant to a final arrangement approval order.
 
Pursuant to the Recapitalization Transaction, the Secured Lenders, the Unsecured Lenders and our shareholders are to be allocated and issued, approximately, such amounts of Restructured Senior Debt (as defined below), Interim Financing (as set forth below), 8% Senior Unsecured Convertible Debentures and percentage of our pro forma common shares, as presented in the following table: 



(in ’000s of U.S. dollars) | Restructured Senior Debt(1) | | Interim Financing(2) | | | 8% Senior Unsecured Debentures(3) | | Pro Forma Common Equity(4)
---------------------------+-----------------------------+--------+----------------------+---+--------+-----------------------------------+---+---------------------------
Secured Lenders | $ | 85,000 | | $ | 14,737 | | $ | 5,000 | 48.625 | %
Unsecured Lenders | | – | | | – | | | 15,000 | 48.625 | %
Existing Shareholders | | – | | | – | | | – | 2.75 | %
Total | $ | 85,000 | | $ | 14,737 | | $ | 20,000 | 100 | %


(1) | The principal balance of the Secured Convertible Notes will be reduced to $85.0 million, which will be increased by the amount of the Interim Financing (as defined below), which has a first lien, senior secured position over all of our assets, is non-convertible and non-callable for three years and includes payment in kind at an interest rate of 8% per year and a maturity date which will be five years after the consummation of the Recapitalization Transaction (the “Restructured Senior Debt”).
----+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(2) | The Secured Lenders provided $14.7 million of interim financing (the “Interim Financing”) to ICM, on substantially the same terms as the Restructured Senior Debt, net of a 5% original issue discount. The amounts of the Interim Financing along with any accrued interest thereon is expected to be converted into, and the original principal balance will be added to, the Restructured Senior Debt upon consummation of the Recapitalization Transaction.
----+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(3) | The 8% Senior Unsecured Debentures include payment in kind at an interest rate of 8% per year, a maturity date which will be five years after the consummation of the Recapitalization Transaction, are non-callable for three years and are subordinate to the Restructured Senior Debt but senior to our common shares.
----+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


(4) | Following consummation of the Recapitalization Transaction, a to-be-determined amount of equity will be made available for management, employee and director incentives, as determined by the New Board (as defined below). All of our existing warrants and options will be cancelled and our common shares may be consolidated pursuant to a consolidation ratio which has yet to be determined.
----+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Upon consummation of the Recapitalization Transaction, a new board of directors (the “New Board”) will be composed of the following members: (i) three nominees will be designated by Gotham Green Partners, LLC and each of its affiliates and subsidiaries on behalf of the Secured Lenders; (ii) three nominees will be designated by each of the Consenting Unsecured Lenders as follows: one by Oasis Investments II Master Fund Ltd., one by Senvest Global (KY), LP and Senvest Master Fund, LP, and one by Hadron Healthcare and Consumer Special Opportunities Master Fund; and (iii) one nominee will be designated by the director nominees of the Secured Lenders and Consenting Unsecured Lenders to serve as a member of the New Board, who will also serve as our Chief Executive Officer.

Pursuant to the terms of the proposed Recapitalization Transaction, the Collateral Agent, the Secured Lenders and the Consenting Unsecured Lenders agreed to forbear from further exercising any rights or remedies in connection with any events of default that now exist or may in the future arise under any of the purchase agreements with respect of the Secured Convertible Notes and all other agreements delivered in connection therewith, the purchase agreements with respect of the Unsecured Convertible Debentures and all other agreements delivered in connection therewith and any other agreement to which the Collateral Agent, Secured Lenders, or Consenting Unsecured Lenders are a party to (collectively, the “Defaults”) and shall take such steps as are necessary to stop any current or pending enforcement efforts in relation thereto. Upon consummation of the Recapitalization Transaction, the Collateral Agent, Secured Lenders and Consenting Unsecured Lenders are also expected to irrevocably waive all Defaults and take all steps required to withdraw, revoke and/or terminate any enforcement efforts in relation thereto.
 

On September 14, 2020, our securityholders voted in support of the Recapitalization Transaction. Specifically, all of the holders of the Secured Convertible Notes and Unsecured Convertible Debentures voted in favor of the Plan of Arrangement. In addition, the holders of our common shares, options and warrants, representing 79.0% of the votes cast, voted in favor of the Plan of Arrangement.
 
On October 5, 2020, the Plan of Arrangement was approved by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, subject to the receipt of the Requisite Approvals (as defined below).
 
On November 3, 2020, Walmer Capital Limited, Island Investments Holdings Limited and Alastair Crawford collectively served and filed a Notice of Appeal with respect to the Court’s approval of the Plan of Arrangement, which appeal was dismissed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal on January 29, 2021.
 
Consummation of the Recapitalization Transaction through the Plan of Arrangement is subject to certain conditions, including: approval of our securityholders, which has been obtained; approval of the Plan of Arrangement by the Supreme Court of British Columbia, which has been obtained; and the receipt of all necessary state regulatory approvals in which we operate that require approval and approval by the CSE (collectively, the “Requisite Approvals”). Specifically, we will need to obtain approval from the following states: Florida, Nevada, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York and Vermont. To date, we have only received approval from the State of Nevada.
 
Subject to the consummation of the Recapitalization Transfer, we anticipate that we will have approximately 225 shareholders of record (as compared to 214 shareholders of record as of February 28, 2021, prior to the Recapitalization Transaction.) This does not include shares held in the name of a broker, bank or other nominees (typically referred to as being held in “street name”). In addition, pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, we intend to issue up to an aggregate of 6,072,579,699 common shares upon the restructuring of (i) $22.5 million of Senior Secured Notes (including the Exit Fee) and $40.0 million of Unsecured Convertible Debentures, including interest accrued thereon and (ii) interest accrued on the Interim Financing. The issuance of common shares upon the consummation of the Plan of Arrangement would substantially increase the voting securities held of record by U.S. residents from approximately 50% to approximately 70%.
 
Recent Developments
 
New Jersey $11.0 Million Debt Financing
 
On February 2, 2021, INJ issued an aggregate of $11.0 million of senior secured bridge notes (“Senior Secured Bridge Notes”) which notes mature on the earlier of (i) February 2, 2023, (ii) the date on which we close a Qualified Financing and (iii) such earlier date that the principal amount may become due and payable pursuant to the terms of such notes. The Senior Secured Bridge Notes accrue interest at a rate of 14% per annum (decreasing to 8% per annum upon the completion of the Recapitalization Transaction (the “Effective Date”)) which interest is payable quarterly, and in kind, commencing on March 31, 2021. INJ and the holder of the Senior Secured Bridge Notes may mutually agree that all or part of the repayment of the Obligations (as defined in the Senior Secured Bridge Notes) be applied to the subscription price for our securities issued in connection with a Qualified Financing or otherwise, subject to approval by our board of directors and compliance with applicable laws; provided that such subscription for securities may occur only after the Effective Date. The Senior Secured Bridge Notes are secured by a security interest in certain assets of INJ. We have provided a guarantee in respect of all of the obligations of INJ under the Senior Secured Bridge Notes. “Qualified Financing” means a transaction or series of related transactions resulting in net proceeds to us of not less than $10.0 million from the subscription of our securities, including, but not limited to, a private placement or rights offering.
Intellectual Property
 
Our portfolio of subsidiaries currently includes a number of local brands; however, we intend to transition to a national model under fewer brands. As cannabis currently remains illegal under U.S. federal law, we cannot register our cannabis brands with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”). However, we rely on the intellectual property protections afforded under applicable state laws and common law through the use of our marks in commerce in each of the respective regions in which we operate.

Governmental Regulations 
 
Cannabis
 
In the United States, the cultivation, manufacturing, importation, distribution, use and possession of cannabis is illegal under U.S. federal law. However, medical and adult-use cannabis has been legalized and regulated by individual states. Currently, 36 states plus the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories recognize, in one form or another, the medical use of cannabis, while 15 of those states plus the District of Columbia and certain U.S. territories recognize, in one form or another, the full adult-use of cannabis. Notwithstanding the regulatory environment with respect to cannabis at the state level, cannabis continues to be categorized as a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA. Accordingly, the use, possession, or distribution of cannabis violates U.S. federal law. As a result, cannabis businesses in the United States are subject to inconsistent state and federal legislation, regulation and enforcement.
 
Under former President Barack Obama, in an effort to provide guidance to U.S. federal law enforcement regarding the inconsistent regulation of cannabis at the U.S. federal and state levels, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) released a memorandum on August 29, 2013 titled “Guidance Regarding Marijuana Enforcement” from former Deputy Attorney General James Cole (the “Cole Memorandum”). The Cole Memorandum acknowledged that, although cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA, the U.S. Attorneys in states that have legalized cannabis should prioritize the use of the U.S. federal government’s limited prosecutorial resources by focusing enforcement actions on the following eight areas of concern (the “Cole Priorities”):
 

• | Preventing the distribution of marijuana to minors;
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing revenue from the sale of marijuana from going to criminal enterprises, gangs and cartels;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing the diversion of marijuana from states where it is legal under state law in some form to other states;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing state-authorized marijuana activity from being used as a cover or pretext for the trafficking of other illegal drugs or other illegal activity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing violence and the use of firearms in the cultivation and distribution of marijuana;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing drugged driving and the exacerbation of other adverse public health consequences associated with marijuana use;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing the growing of marijuana on public lands and the attendant public safety and environmental dangers posed by marijuana production on public lands; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Preventing marijuana possession or use on U.S. federal property.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------

 
In January 2018, under the administration of former President Donald Trump, former U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded the Cole Memorandum. While this did not create a change in U.S. federal law, as the Cole Memorandum was policy guidance and not law, the rescission added to the uncertainty of U.S. federal enforcement of the CSA in states where cannabis use is legal and regulated. Former Attorney General Sessions, concurrent with the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, issued a memorandum (“Sessions Memorandum”) which explained that the Cole Memorandum was “unnecessary” due to existing general enforcement guidance adopted in the 1980s, as set forth in the U.S. Attorney’s Manual (“USAM”). The USAM enforcement priorities, like those of the Cole Memorandum, are also based on the U.S. federal government’s limited resources and include law enforcement priorities set by the Attorney General, the seriousness of the alleged crimes, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community.
 
While the Sessions Memorandum emphasizes that cannabis is a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and states that it is a “dangerous drug and that marijuana activity is a serious crime,” it does not otherwise provide that the prosecution of cannabis-related offenses is now a DOJ priority. Furthermore, the Sessions Memorandum explicitly indicates that it is a guide for prosecutorial discretion and that discretion is firmly in the hands of U.S. Attorneys who determine whether to prosecute cannabis-related offenses. U.S. Attorneys could individually continue to exercise their discretion in a manner similar to that permitted under the Cole Memorandum. While certain U.S. Attorneys have publicly affirmed their commitment to proceeding in a manner contemplated under the Cole Memorandum, or otherwise affirmed that their views of U.S. federal enforcement priorities have not changed as a result of the rescission of the Cole Memorandum, others have publicly supported the rescission of the Cole Memorandum.

Under former Attorney General William Barr, the Department of Justice did not take a formal position on the federal enforcement of laws relating to cannabis. However, prior to his resignation on December 23, 2020, former Attorney General William Barr stated that his preference would be to have a uniform federal rule against cannabis, but, absent such a uniform rule, his preference would be to permit the existing federal approach leaving it up to the states to make their own decision. In addition, former Attorney General William Barr indicated that the DOJ was reviewing the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act (“STATES Act”), which would shield individuals and businesses complying with state cannabis laws from federal intervention.
 
On March 10, 2021, the Senate confirmed , President Joseph R. Biden’s nominee, Merrick Garland, to serve as Attorney General in his administration. Furthermore, two of President Biden’s nominees for top positions at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) have strong track records of supporting and defending state-legalized marijuana programs. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who was nominated to serve as the head of HHS, vowed to defend California’s legal cannabis market from any potential intervention during the Trump administration. Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine, who was nominated to serve as the assistant secretary of HHS, played a pivotal role in the implementation of Pennsylvania’s medical marijuana program. In addition, Democrats are generally more supportive of federal cannabis reform than Republicans. In the November 2020 election, the Democrats maintained their majority in the House of Representatives, although at a smaller margin than initially expected, and, as a result of the Georgia runoff elections in January 2021, have gained sufficient seats in the Senate to achieve control in the event of a Vice Presidential tie-breaking vote. Most notably, during the presidential campaign, President Biden stated that he supports decriminalizing marijuana. Despite the growing enthusiasm in the cannabis business community, it remains unclear whether the Department of Justice under President Biden and Attorney General Garland will re-adopt the Cole Memorandum or announce a substantive marijuana enforcement policy.


Other federal legislation provides or seeks to provide protection to individuals and businesses acting in violation of U.S. federal law but in compliance with state cannabis laws. For example, the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment has been included in annual spending bills passed by Congress since 2014. The Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment restricts the DOJ from using federal funds to interfere with states implementing laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession, or cultivation of medical cannabis.
 
U.S. courts have construed these appropriations bills to prevent the U.S. federal government from prosecuting individuals or businesses engaged in cannabis-related activities to the extent they are operating in compliance with state medical cannabis laws. However, because this conduct continues to violate U.S. federal law, U.S. courts have observed that should the U.S. Congress choose to appropriate funds to prosecute individuals or businesses acting in violation of the CSA, such individuals or businesses could be prosecuted for violations of U.S. federal law even to the extent/even if they are operating in compliance with applicable state medical cannabis laws.
 
If Congress declines to include the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment in future fiscal year appropriations bills or fails to pass necessary budget legislation causing a government shutdown, the U.S. federal government will have the authority to spend federal funds to prosecute individuals and businesses acting contrary to the CSA for violations of U.S. federal law.
 
Furthermore, the appropriations protections only apply to individuals and businesses operating in compliance with a state’s medical cannabis laws and provide no protection to individuals or businesses operating in compliance with a state’s adult-use cannabis laws. On June 20, 2019, however, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Blumenauer-Norton-McClintock Amendment, which would expand the protections afforded by the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment to individuals and businesses operating in compliance with applicable state adult-use cannabis laws. The U.S. Senate did not include the Blumenauer-McClintock-Norton Amendment in its appropriations bill, and ultimately, the Blumenauer-McClintock-Norton Amendment was not passed into law. On July 30, 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives again voted to include the Blumenauer-Norton-McClintock Amendment in the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2021. However, it is unclear whether the U.S. Senate will include the Blumenauer-McClintock-Norton Amendment in its version of the appropriations bill and whether it will ultimately be included in appropriations legislation for 2021.

Additionally, there are a number of marijuana reform bills that have been introduced in the U.S. Congress that would amend federal law regarding the legal status and permissibility of medical and adult-use cannabis, including the STATES Act, the Marijuana Opportunity Reinvestment and Expungement Act (the “MORE Act”), the Substance Regulation and Safety Act (the “SRSA”) and the Medical Marijuana Research Act (the “MMRA”). The STATES Act would create an exemption in the CSA to allow states to determine their own cannabis policies without fear of federal reprisal. The MORE Act, which was passed by the House Judiciary Committee on November 20, 2019, would remove cannabis from the CSA, expunge federal cannabis offenses and establish a 5% excise tax on cannabis to fund various federal grant programs. The SRSA, which was introduced by U.S. Senator Tina Smith on July 30, 2020, would remove cannabis from the CSA, grant the FDA authority to regulate cannabis and cannabis products and regulate the safety and quality control of cannabis crops and the import and export of cannabis materials. The MMRA, which was introduced by Representative Earl Blumenauer on July 17, 2019, would amend the CSA to make marijuana accessible for use by qualified marijuana researchers for medical purposes. On December 4, 2020, the House passed the MORE Act. Nevertheless, it is uncertain which federal marijuana reform bills, if any, will ultimately be passed and signed into law.
 
Businesses in the regulated cannabis industry, including our business, are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States that involve money laundering, financial recordkeeping and proceeds of crime, including the U.S. Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (“Bank Secrecy Act”) and the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act (the “US PATRIOT Act”) and the rules and regulations thereunder and any related or similar rules, regulations, or guidelines, issued, administered, or enforced by governmental authorities in the United States. Further, under U.S. federal law, banks or other financial institutions that provide a cannabis business with a checking account, debit or credit card, small business loan, or any other service could be charged with money laundering, aiding and abetting, or conspiracy.
 
Despite these laws, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (“FinCEN”), a bureau within the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“U.S. Treasury”), issued a memorandum on February 14, 2014 (the “FinCEN Memorandum”), which provides instructions to banks and other financial institutions seeking to provide services to cannabis-related businesses. The FinCEN Memorandum explicitly references the Cole Priorities and indicates that in some circumstances it is permissible for banks and other financial institutions to provide services to cannabis-related businesses without risking prosecution for violation of U.S. federal money laundering laws. Under these guidelines, financial institutions are subject to a requirement to submit a suspicious activity report in certain circumstances as required by federal money laundering laws. These cannabis related suspicious activity reports are divided into three categories: marijuana limited, marijuana priority and marijuana terminated, based on the financial institution’s belief that the marijuana business follows state law, is operating out of compliance with state law, or where the banking relationship has been terminated, respectively. The FinCEN Memorandum refers to supplementary guidance in the Cole Memorandum relating to the prosecution of money laundering offenses predicated on cannabis-related violations of the CSA.
 
The rescission of the Cole Memorandum did not affect the status of the FinCEN Memorandum, and to date, the U.S. Treasury has not given any indication that it intends to rescind the FinCEN Memorandum. While the FinCEN Memorandum was originally intended to work in tandem with the Cole Memorandum, the FinCEN Memorandum appears to remain in effect as standalone guidance. Although the FinCEN Memorandum remains intact, indicating that the U.S. Treasury and FinCEN intend to continue abiding by its guidance, it is unclear whether the Biden administration will continue to follow the guidelines set forth under the FinCEN Memorandum.
 
In March 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives Financial Services Committee passed the Secure and Fair Enforcement Banking Act (the “SAFE Banking Act”) and the U.S. Senate held a hearing on the SAFE Banking Act in July 2019. On September 25, 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the SAFE Banking Act. The SAFE Banking Act creates protections for financial institutions that provide banking services to businesses acting in compliance with applicable state cannabis laws, but it is uncertain whether it will be passed by the U.S. Senate and ultimately signed into law. On May 15, 2020, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act (the “HEROES Act”), which included the provisions of the SAFE Banking Act. The U.S. House of Representatives passed a more limited version of the HEROES Act on October 1, 2020, which also includes the provisions of the SAFE Banking Act. However, it is unclear whether the version of the HEROES Act to be passed by the U.S. Senate and ultimately signed into law will include the provisions of the SAFE Banking Act.

There can be no assurance that state laws legalizing and regulating the sale and use of cannabis will not be repealed or overturned or that local governmental authorities will not limit the applicability of state laws within their respective jurisdictions. In addition, local and city ordinances may strictly limit and/or restrict the distribution of cannabis in a manner that could make it difficult or impossible to operate cannabis businesses in certain jurisdictions.
 
Hemp
 
On December 20, 2018, the U.S. Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 (the “2018 Farm Bill”) was signed into law. Prior to its enactment, the U.S. federal government did not distinguish between cannabis and hemp and the entire plant species Cannabis sativa L. (subject to narrow exceptions applicable to specific portions of the plant) was scheduled as a controlled substance under the CSA. Therefore, the cultivation of hemp for any purpose in the United States without a Schedule I registration with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (“DEA”) was federally illegal, unless exempted by Section 7606 of the Agricultural Act of 2014 (the “2014 Farm Bill”). The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp (which is defined as “the plant Cannabis sativa L. and any part of that plant, including the seeds thereof and all derivatives, extracts, cannabinoids, isomers, acids, salts and salts of isomers, whether growing or not, with a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of not more than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis”) and its derivatives, extracts and cannabinoids, including CBD derived from hemp, from the definition of marijuana in the CSA, thereby removing hemp and its derivatives from DEA purview as a controlled substance. The 2018 Farm Bill also amends the Agricultural Marketing Act of 1946 to allow for the commercial production of hemp in the United States under the purview of the United States Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”) in coordination with state departments of agriculture that elect to have primary regulatory authority over hemp production in their respective jurisdictions. Pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill, states, U.S. territories and tribal governments may adopt their own regulatory plans for hemp production even if more restrictive than federal regulations so long as they meet minimum federal standards and are approved by the USDA. Hemp production in states and tribal territories that do not choose to submit their own plans and that do not prohibit hemp production will be governed by USDA regulation.
 
On October 31, 2019, the USDA issued an interim final rule governing the domestic production of hemp under the 2018 Farm Bill, establishing the U.S. Domestic Hemp Production Program (the “USDA IFR”). The USDA IFR will be effective from October 31, 2019 through November 1, 2021, at which time the USDA may adopt permanent regulations. The USDA IFR outlines the requirements for the USDA to approve plans submitted by states and tribal governments for the domestic production of hemp. It also establishes a federal plan for hemp producers in states or territories of Native American tribes that do not have USDA-approved hemp production plans. Pursuant to the USDA IFR, the USDA reviews hemp production plans submitted by state and tribal governments that wish to obtain or retain primary regulatory authority over hemp production in their respective jurisdictions. Once the USDA formally receives a plan from a state or tribal government, the agency has 60 days to review and approve or reject the plan.
 
Although the USDA IFR provides the framework for the USDA, state departments of agriculture and tribal governments to begin the implementation of commercial hemp production programs pursuant to the 2018 Farm Bill, the 2014 Farm Bill was scheduled to remain in effect for one year after the effective date of the USDA IFR.
 
Accordingly, until the USDA approves a state or tribal hemp production plan and licenses are issued pursuant to a USDA-approved plan, the 2014 Farm Bill is currently the primary U.S. federal law governing domestic hemp production. The application of the hemp provisions of the 2014 Farm Bill was set to expire on October 31, 2020, at which time state programs would be required to comply with the 2018 Farm Bill regulations. However, with this deadline approaching, U.S. Senators and state agricultural departments requested an extension of the application of the 2014 Farm Bill and a delay of the implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill due to delays caused by COVID-19. On October 1, 2020, a Continuing Resolution passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. Senate was signed by former President Trump to fund federal agencies at fiscal 2020 levels through December 11, 2020, which also extended the application of the hemp provisions of the 2014 Farm Bill and delayed the implementation of the 2018 Farm Bill for another year until October 31, 2021.

Under both the 2014 Farm Bill and the 2018 Farm Bill, states and tribal governments have authority to adopt regulatory regimes that are more restrictive than federal mandates or prohibit hemp production altogether. Accordingly, variance in hemp regulation across jurisdictions is likely to persist. Compliance with state hemp law, if any, is required under both the 2014 Farm Bill and 2018 Farm Bill.
 
As a result of the 2018 Farm Bill, federal law now provides that CBD derived from hemp is not a controlled substance under the CSA; however, CBD derived from hemp could still be considered a controlled substance under applicable state law. States take varying approaches to regulating the production and sale of hemp and hemp-derived CBD. While some states explicitly authorize and regulate the production and sale of CBD or otherwise provide legal protection for authorized individuals and businesses to engage in commercial hemp activities, other states maintain outdated drug laws that do not distinguish hemp or hemp-derived CBD from marijuana (or “cannabis” as used herein), resulting in hemp being classified as a controlled substance under certain state laws. In these states, the sale of CBD, notwithstanding its origin, is either restricted to state medical or adult-use cannabis program licensees or remains unlawful. Additionally, a number of states prohibit the sale of consumable CBD products based on the position of the FDA set forth in the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FFDCA”) that it is unlawful to introduce food containing added CBD or THC into interstate commerce, or to market CBD or THC products as or in dietary supplements regardless of whether the substances are hemp-derived.
 
The 2018 Farm Bill preserves the authority and jurisdiction of the FDA under the FFDCA to regulate the manufacture, marketing and sale of food, drugs, dietary supplements and cosmetics, including products that contain hemp extracts and derivatives such as CBD. As a producer and marketer of hemp-derived products, we are required to comply with FDA regulations applicable to the manufacturing and marketing of such products, including with respect to dietary supplements, food and cosmetics. To date, the FDA has not deemed CBD or other cannabinoids permissible for use in dietary supplements, as dietary ingredients, or as safe for use in food. The FDA has consistently taken the position that CBD is prohibited from being marketed as a dietary supplement or added to food because substantial clinical trials studying CBD as a new drug must be made public prior to the marketing of any food or dietary supplements containing CBD.
 
To date, the FDA has issued warning letters to companies unlawfully marketing CBD products. In many of these cases, the manufacturer made unsubstantiated claims that products containing CBD are able to treat serious medical conditions, including cancer, Alzheimer’s disease, opioid withdrawal and anxiety, among others, without obtaining drug approvals. Some of these letters were co-signed with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and cited the companies for making claims about the efficacy of CBD that were not substantiated by scientific evidence.
 
The FDA has stated that it recognizes the potential opportunities and significant interest in drugs and consumer products containing CBD, is committed to evaluating the agency’s regulatory policies related to CBD and has established a high-level internal working group to explore potential pathways for various types of CBD products to be lawfully marketed. The FDA has authority to issue regulation that would allow these naturally-occurring hemp compounds to be added to food or dietary supplements. In May 2019, the FDA held a public hearing to obtain scientific data and information about the safety, manufacturing, product quality, marketing, labeling and sale of products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds.
 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, other than Epidiolex (cannabidiol), a cannabis-derived product, and three synthetic cannabis-related drug products (Marinol (dronabinol), Syndros (dronabinol) and Cesamet (nabilone)), the FDA has not approved a marketing application for cannabis for the treatment of any disease or condition and has not approved any cannabis, cannabis-derived or CBD products. See Risk Factors - Our products are not approved by the FDA; and There is uncertainty surrounding the regulatory pathway for CBD.


In connection with the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, the House Committee on Appropriations issued an explanatory statement agreeing to appropriate $2.0 million in funding to the FDA for research, policy evaluation, market surveillance and issuance of an enforcement discretion policy for products under the FDA’s jurisdiction that contain CBD. The legislation requires the FDA to provide a report within 60 days regarding its progress in obtaining and analyzing data to help determine a policy of enforcement discretion and the process through which CBD will be evaluated for use in products. On March 5, 2020, the FDA issued a report on its progress and committed to expanding its educational efforts regarding CBD products, encouraging, facilitating and initiating more research on CBD, continuing to monitor the CBD marketplace and take appropriate action against unlawful CBD products that pose a risk of harm to the public and developing a risk-based enforcement policy aimed at protecting the public and providing more regulatory clarity regarding the FDA’s CBD enforcement priorities. The FDA further announced that it is actively evaluating potential rulemaking to allow CBD in dietary supplements. The FDA is also required to conduct a sampling study of the current CBD marketplace to determine the extent to which products containing CBD are mislabeled or adulterated within 180 days of the enactment of the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020.

On July 9, 2020, the FDA issued its sampling study to the U.S. House Committee on Appropriations and the U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations detailing the sampling conducted in recent years on CBD products. While the minority of CBD products previously tested by the FDA contained CBD concentrations consistent with their labeling, the report states that a majority of products tested for potentially harmful elements “did not raise significant public health concerns.” The report further provides that the FDA will undertake a more extensive sampling effort expected to cover a representative sample of currently marketed CBD products, including tinctures, oils, extracts, capsules, powders, gummies, water and other beverages, conventional foods, cosmetics, lubricants, tampons, suppositories, vape cartridges and products sold for consumption by pets. Products will be evaluated for cannabinoid content as well as potentially harmful elements.
 
The rules, regulations and enforcement in this area continue to evolve and develop. Most recently, on August 20, 2020, the DEA issued an interim final rule conforming its regulations to the 2018 Farm Bill (the “DEA IFR”), which went into effect on August 21, 2020. The DEA IFR was subject to public comment through October 20, 2020, which period has since expired. Notably, the DEA IFR creates uncertainty with respect to the federal legal status of any hemp derivative, extract, or product that exceeds a delta-9 tetrahydrocannabinol concentration of 0.3 percent during processing, which, pursuant to the DEA IFR, renders it a federal Schedule I substance under the CSA even if the hemp plant from which any such material is sourced does not exceed the 0.3 percent threshold.
 
Additionally, on September 4, 2020, the Hemp and Hemp-Derived CBD Consumer Protection and Market Stabilization Act of 2020 was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives, which permits the inclusion of hemp and CBD derived from hemp as ingredients in dietary supplements that otherwise comply with the applicable requirements for dietary supplements set forth in the FFDCA and the Fair Packaging and Labeling Act. The bill does not address the inclusion of hemp or CBD derived from hemp as ingredients in food products, and it is unclear whether it will ultimately be passed and signed into law.
 
Most recently, on January 8, 2021, the FDA issued a report stating that more real-world data on CBD use and safety, alongside data from other types of studies, is needed to fill in the current gaps in the FDA’s understanding of the safety profile of CBD and many other cannabis-derived compounds, including potential safety risks for people and animals. Until these gaps are filled and the FDA formally adopts regulations authorizing the production and sale of CBD products as food and/or dietary supplements, there is a risk that the FDA could take enforcement action against us. Failure to comply with FDA requirements may result in, among other things, warning letters, injunctions, product withdrawals, recalls, seizures, fines and criminal prosecutions. We continue to closely monitor FDA developments with respect to CBD and our compliance with applicable United States laws relating to hemp, including the FDA’s regulations of CBD and evaluate and implement appropriate compliance measures on an ongoing basis.
 
Application of Cannabis Regulations in the United States
 
Violations of U.S. federal laws and regulations could result in significant fines, penalties, administrative sanctions, convictions, or settlements arising from either civil or criminal proceedings brought by either the U.S. federal government or private citizens, including, but not limited to, disgorgement of profits, seizure of property or products, cessation of business activities, or divestiture. Our cannabis business activities and the cannabis business activities of our subsidiaries, while believed to be compliant with applicable U.S. state and local laws, currently are illegal under U.S. federal law.
