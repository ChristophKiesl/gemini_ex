Company Overview
 
We are a fully integrated commercial company that provides clinically useful molecular diagnostic tests and pathology services for improved patient diagnosis and management. We develop and commercialize molecular diagnostic tests and related first line assays principally focused on early detection of high potential progressors to cancer and leverage the latest technology and personalized medicine for improved patient diagnosis and management. We currently have three commercialized molecular diagnostic assays in the marketplace for which we are reimbursed by Medicare and multiple private payors: PancraGEN®, a pancreatic cyst and pancreaticobiliary solid lesion molecular test that can aid in pancreatic cyst diagnosis and pancreatic cancer risk assessment utilizing our proprietary PathFinder platform; ThyGenX®, which assesses thyroid nodules for risk of malignancy; and ThyraMIR®, which assesses thyroid nodules for risk of malignancy utilizing a proprietary gene expression assay. We are also in the process of “soft launching” while we gather additional market data, BarreGEN®, an esophageal cancer risk classifier for Barrett’s Esophagus that utilizes our PathFinder platform.
 
Our mission is to provide personalized medicine through molecular diagnostics and innovation to advance patient care based on rigorous science. We are leveraging our Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments, or CLIA, certified and College of American Pathologists, or CAP, accredited laboratories to develop and commercialize our assays and products. We aim to provide physicians and patients with diagnostic options for detecting genetic and other molecular mutations that are associated with gastrointestinal and endocrine cancer. Our customers consist primarily of physicians, hospitals and clinics.
 
With the completion of the sale of substantially all of our contract sales organization (CSO) business in December 2015 and transition of related activities through September 2016, we are now concentrating our efforts on our molecular diagnostics business by offering solutions for determining the presence of certain cancers to clinicians and their patients as well as providing prognostic pre-cancerous information, which we believe to be an expanding market opportunity. The global molecular diagnostics market is estimated to be $6.45 billion and is a segment within the approximately $60 billion in vitro diagnostics market. We believe that the molecular diagnostics market offers significant growth and strong patient value given the substantial opportunity it affords to lower healthcare costs by helping to reduce unnecessary surgeries and ensuring the appropriate frequency of monitoring. We are keenly focused on growing our test volumes, securing additional coverage and reimbursement, maintaining our current reimbursement and supporting revenue growth for our three commercialized innovative tests, introducing related first line product and service extensions, as well as expanding our business by developing and promoting synergistic products, like BarreGEN®, in our market. 
 
In March 2016, we announced that we implemented a broad-based program to maximize efficiencies and cut costs as we focus on improving cash flows and profitability while completing our transition to a standalone molecular diagnostics business. In addition to reducing headcount, we realigned our compensation structure, consolidated positions, eliminated programs and development plans that did not have near term benefits, and streamlined and right-sized operating systems while reducing overhead. This was done while supporting the transition of our CSO business to the buyer of that business and continuing to shut-down less profitable CSO contracts that were not part of the sale of that business.
 
In August 2016, we announced that the New York State Department of Health had reviewed and approved ThyraMIR®, the Company’s micro RNA gene-expression based test, for use in New York State. New York State accounts for approximately 5% of the 600,000 Thyroid Fine Needle Aspirate, or FNA, biopsies performed in the U.S. annually according to Thyroid Disease Manager. With this final approval ThyraMIR® is now available to patients across the U.S.

 In October 2016, we announced that the New York State Department of Health had reviewed and approved for use ThyGenX®, our NextGen Sequencing oncogene panel for thyroid nodules. The New York State approval of ThyGenX® enables us to test specimens from patients in New York and therefore, enables us to market both ThyGenX® and ThyraMIR® together in that state. As ThyGenX® always precedes the running of ThyraMIR®, approximately 80 of ThyGenX® cases warranting reflex to a more sophisticated RNA assessment via ThyraMIR®. Of the several states that require special licensure to provide testing to patients who reside in their jurisdiction, New York was the final state to issue a license.
 
Also, in October 2016, we announced completion and the validation and launch of two new thyroid services, further expanding our comprehensive support of physicians and health care institutions servicing thyroid patients. Our new cytopathology service is designed to assist physicians and clinics that prefer to have the initial FNA biopsy assessed by an independent third party versus having it performed on site. 
 
We have been successfully expanding the reimbursement of our products in 2016. In summary, three of our molecular diagnostics are now covered by Medicare. Specifically we have made the following progress with payors in 2016:
 
● In December 2016, we announced that Aetna, the third largest health plan in the United States, agreed to cover our ThyraMIR® test, the first micro RNA classifier made available for improving the diagnosis of indeterminate thyroid nodules, for all of Aetna’s approximately 46 million members nationwide, with coverage effective immediately. Our ThyGenX® and ThyraMIR® thyroid assays are now covered for approximately 200 million patients nationwide, including through Medicare, national and regional health plans.
 
● In April 2016, we announced that we received coverage for all of our products by Galaxy Health Network, a national managed care provider with over 3.5 million covered lives. Galaxy Health Network’s Preferred Provider Organization includes a network of over 400,000 contracted physicians, 2,700 hospitals and 47,000 ancillary providers. 
 
● In April 2016, we also announced new coding by Novitas Solutions, Inc., or Novitas Solutions, for PancraGEN®. Novitas Solutions has assigned a new molecular Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code to its PancraGEN® test for pancreatic cysts. Prior to this coding change, the test was covered under a miscellaneous chemistry code, which is used for billing a wide range of tests across the laboratory industry and does not effectively differentiate between technologies that have significantly different features and offer unique benefits to patients with specific diseases.
 
● In February 2016, we announced that we received Medicare approval for coverage of ThyraMIR®. As a result, ThyraMIR® is now accessible to more than 50 million Medicare covered patients nationwide effective December 14, 2015. ThyGenX® is already covered by Medicare. Therefore, the addition of coverage for ThyraMIR® provides Medicare covered patients the benefits of the ThyGenX®/ThyraMIR® combination test.
 
● In January 2016, we announced that our Medicare administrative carrier, or MAC, Novitas Solutions, issued a new local coverage determination, or LCD, for PancraGEN®. The LCD provides the specific circumstances under which PancraGEN® is covered. The new policy is non-conditional and may improve the efficiency of the testing process for doctors and patients. The LCD covers approximately 55 million patients, bringing the total patients covered for PancraGEN® to nearly 68 million.

Recent Business Developments 
 
Blue Cross Blue Shield Agreement
 
On January 3, 2017, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with the Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) Association’s Center for Clinical Effectiveness “Evidence Street”, a program that provides us with the opportunity to provide available evidence for our molecular Thyroid and Pancreas tests, to support further coverage determinations among Blue Cross Blue Shield and other health plans.
International Expansion – Agreement with Best Med Opinion Ltd
 
On January 20, 2017, we announced that we had entered into an agreement with Best Med Opinion Ltd, or Best Med, of Tel Aviv, Israel, a provider of second opinion and clinical services for physicians and patients in Israel and several other countries. As part of this agreement, effective February 1, 2017, Best Med will provide physicians and patients with information regarding our ThyGenX®, ThyraMIR®, and PancraGEN® tests, and when these tests are selected to support and inform treatment decisions, Best Med will manage the logistics associated with collecting and shipping samples to our CLIA certified, CAP accredited laboratories and report results back to the ordering physician. The agreement designates Best Med as the exclusive provider of our products for the country of Israel, and under the agreement, providers in Israel will be able to order all of our marketed molecular diagnostic products. The agreement is part of our international expansion efforts to leverage the opportunities for our products outside the U.S. market.
Reporting Segments
 
We currently operate under one operating segment, which is our molecular diagnostic business. Until December 22, 2015 prior to the sale of the CSO business, we operated under two reporting segments: Commercial Services and Interpace Diagnostics. The CSO business is reported as discontinued operations for the periods ended December 31, 2015 and 2016. 
Our Business
 
In August 2014, we acquired certain assets from Asuragen Inc., or Asuragen, in the endocrine and thyroid cancer sectors, and in October 2014, we acquired our pancreatic and gastrointestinal assets from RedPath Integrated Technologies Inc., or RedPath. In December 2015, we sold the majority of the assets of our CSO business and became a dedicated molecular diagnostics and related first line assays, company.
 
We are now a molecular diagnostics company that is focused on improving patient care by resolving diagnostic uncertainty with evidence that is trustworthy and actionable. Our products and services uniquely combine genomic technology, clinical science and pathological review to provide answers that give physicians and patients a clear path forward and help avoid risky, costly surgeries that are often unnecessary.
 
Our goal is to drive shareholder value by improving patient outcomes and reducing the cost of healthcare.
 
The role of molecular diagnostic information in medical practice is evolving rapidly. The diagnosis of complex diseases as well as the role of molecular diagnostics in treatment decisions continue to expand to complement the evaluation performed by pathologists. Information at the molecular level enables one to understand more fully the makeup and specific subtype of disease to improve diagnosis. In many cases, the molecular diagnostic information derived can ultimately help guide treatment decisions as part of the standard of care.
 
We deploy biomarker analysis combined with microRNA expression to improve diagnostic clarity for cancer. In our thyroid and pancreatic cancer indications, diagnosis can be ambiguous and can lead to indeterminate first line assessments and uncertainty among physicians regarding how to effectively treat patients. Accordingly, physicians may often select surgery due to lack of confirmation of disease progression. Our tests are designed to provide clarity of diagnosis that can in turn guide treatment decisions often, eliminating costly, risky surgeries and other unnecessary medical procedures, improving the lives of patients and saving the healthcare system money.

Patients typically access our tests through their physician during the diagnostic process. All of our testing services are made available through our clinical reference laboratories located in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and New Haven, Connecticut, which are each CLIA certified and CAP accredited. 
 
The published evidence supporting our tests demonstrates the robustness of our science and clinical studies. Patients and physicians can access our full list of publications on our website. We continue to build upon our extensive library of clinical evidence. We also expect to continue expanding our offerings in gastrointestinal and endocrinology cancers, as well as other cancer indications that we believe will benefit from our technology and approach.
 
We believe our focus on developing clinically useful tests that change patient care is enabling the company to continue to expand.in this marketplace. Our thyroid assays, ThyGenX® and ThyraMIR®, are covered by our MAC, Novitas Solutions, and are now covered for more than 200 million people in the U.S. for use in thyroid cancer diagnosis. Our thyroid assay, PancraGEN®, for pancreatic cancer is also covered by Novitas Solutions and is now covered for more than 97 million people in the US. 
 
Background
 
The global molecular diagnostics market is estimated to be $6.45 billion and is a segment within the approximately $60 billion in vitro diagnostics market.
 
The molecular diagnostics segment is highly fragmented with numerous science-based companies that have developed clinical tests that are on the market or ready or near ready to be marketed. A vast majority of these companies have very limited experience bringing a test to market and many of them do not have the capital to build an infrastructure to effectively commercialize their tests. Due to their complexity, most molecular diagnostic tests require a specialized go-to-market strategy that includes messaging to physicians, hospitals and potentially patients and managed care organizations. Additionally, robust data and clinical studies are often necessary to demonstrate to physicians and managed care organizations the benefit and utility of the assays offered. We believe that developing and delivering these kinds of messages is one of our core strengths.
 
Oncology, which represents the third largest segment after infectious disease and blood screening, is one of the fastest growing segments of the molecular diagnostics market. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, of the Department of Health and Human Services estimated in June 2014 that there were more than 5,900 independent clinical reference laboratories and specialty clinics, and more than 8,900 hospital-based laboratories, in the United States.
 
Our Molecular Diagnostic Tests
 
We are developing and commercializing molecular diagnostic tests to detect genetic alterations that are associated with gastrointestinal and endocrine cancer risk, which are principally focused on early detection of high potential progressors to cancer. Our tests assist healthcare providers in distinguishing between patients at risk for progression to cancer versus non-progressors. Thus, as part of a comprehensive diagnostic and treatment plan, our tests allow healthcare providers to determine whether surgery or surveillance is most appropriate. We, therefore, believe our tests can help identify patients at high risk for cancer. We also believe our tests can avoid unnecessary surgeries in those at low risk, thereby reducing healthcare costs and potential risks associated with surgery.
  
We offer PancraGEN®, a molecular diagnostic test designed for determining risk of malignancy in pancreatic cysts and solid pancreaticobiliary lesions, ThyGenX®, a next-generation sequencing test in combination with ThyraMIR®, a novel microRNA gene expression classifier, designed to assist physicians in distinguishing between benign and malignant genotypes in indeterminate thyroid nodules, and BarreGEN®, an assay for evaluating Barrett’s Esophagus, an esophageal cancer risk classifier, which we distribute today to limited customers while we gather additional data, perform clinical studies, seek initial reimbursement and are looking for collaboration partners.

Gastrointestinal Cancer Tests
 
Our current gastrointestinal cancer risk diagnostic test, PancraGEN® is based on our PathFinderTG platform, or PathFinder. PathFinder is designed to use advanced clinical algorithms to accurately stratify patients according to risk of cancer by assessing panels of DNA abnormalities in patients who have pancreaticobiliary lesions (cysts or solid masses) with potential for cancer. PathFinder is supported by our state of the art CLIA certified, and CAP accredited laboratory in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Our Pittsburgh laboratory is our major commercial-scale and development Center of Excellence where we process the majority of our current and future oncology related tests, and we support our gastrointestinal development activities through this laboratory.
 
Accurate detection of pancreatic cancer risk is crucial. Pancreatic cancer is now the third leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. with an average survival rate of five years. PancraGEN® is designed to determine the risk of malignancy in pancreatic cysts and pancreaticobiliary solid lesions. We believe that PancraGEN® is the leading integrated molecular diagnostic test for determining risk of malignancy in pancreatic cysts currently available on the market. We currently estimate that the immediate addressable market for PancraGEN® is approximately 150,000 indeterminate cysts annually or approximately $350 million annually based on the current size of the patient population and current and anticipated reimbursement rates. To date, PancraGEN® has been used in about 30,000 clinical cases. The National Pancreatic Cyst Registry study published in Endoscopy in 2015 demonstrated the clinical validity of PancraGEN® and that it more accurately determined the malignant potential of pancreatic cysts than the Sendai 2012 EUS criteria for detection of malignant pancreatic cystic lesions in the context of routine clinical care. The vast majority of all surgeries for pancreatic cysts are for benign disease. The American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 2015 Guidelines support the basic principle that too many pancreatic surgeries are being performed unnecessarily on benign lesions. In addition, the 2016 guidelines published by the American Society of Gastroenterology Endoscopy (ASGE) included a specific recommendation for use of PancraGEN® in specific circumstances where other types of testing and analysis have not provided sufficient data on which to determine the best course of action for patient treatment. Accordingly, we believe that PancraGEN® provides a highly reliable diagnostic option for distinguishing between patients with pancreatic cysts who are at low or high risk for developing pancreatic cancer.
 
We have also developed a cancer risk diagnostic assay, BarreGEN®, which is designed to evaluate patients with Barrett’s esophagus, an upper gastrointestinal condition that can progress into esophageal cancer. BarreGEN®, which utilizes our PathFinder platform, is distributed today on a limited basis while we gather additional data, perform clinical studies, seek initial reimbursement and are looking for collaboration partners. We preliminarily estimate that the total market is approximately $2 billion annually based on the current size of the patient population and anticipated reimbursement rates comparable to those received currently for PancraGEN® for pancreatic cysts. We are planning to expand our initial soft launch of BarreGEN® in 2017 and seek to partner this product for development and marketing with a larger partner in the gastrointestinal diagnostic market.
 
Endocrine Cancer Tests
 
We currently market and sell a dual platform endocrine cancer risk diagnostic test. The incidence of thyroid nodules is on the rise. ThyGenX® is a next generation DNA and RNA sequencing oncogene panel and when applied to indeterminate FNA, provides a highly specific “rule-in” test with over 80% positive predictive value in predicting whether a patient’s thyroid nodule is cancerous. ThyGenX® works synergistically with our second endocrine cancer diagnostic test ThyraMir®, which is based on microRNA and is designed to provide a highly sensitive “rule-out” test to accurately categorize a mutation negative indeterminate FNA as being benign or malignant. Our testing is performed in our state of the art CLIA certified, CAP accredited laboratories in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and New Haven, Connecticut. We estimate the total market for our endocrine cancer diagnostic tests is approximately $350 million annually based on the current size of the patient population, estimated numbers of indeterminate FNAs and current and anticipated reimbursement rates. ThyGenX® is used by some customers as a base line oncogene panel assessment and approximately 80% of such users will reflex to also using ThyraMIR® as a more specific evaluation.

Endocrinologists evaluate thyroid nodules for possible cancer by collecting cells through FNAs that are then analyzed by cytopathologists to determine whether or not a thyroid nodule is cancerous. It is estimated that up to 20% or up to approximately 100,000 of FNAs analyzed annually yield indeterminate results, meaning they cannot be diagnosed as definitely being malignant or benign by cytopathology alone. Traditionally, guidelines recommended that some patients with indeterminate cytopathology results undergo surgery to remove all or part of their thyroid to obtain an accurate diagnosis by looking directly at the thyroid tissue. Historically, in approximately 70% to 80% of these cases, the thyroid nodule proves to be benign. In addition to exposing a patient to unnecessary surgical risk and incurring costs, surgery can lead to a lifetime of thyroid hormone replacement therapy. Our ThyGenX® and ThyraMir® assays, are aimed at significantly improving the ability of physicians to determine an accurate diagnosis of an indeterminate FNA result.
Research and Development
 
We conduct most of our research and development activities at our CLIA certified and CAP accredited laboratories in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and New Haven, Connecticut. Our research and development efforts currently focus on providing data and clinical trials and analyses necessary to support our existing products on the market. Additionally our research and development activities provide product line extension of our existing products as well as new product opportunities utilizing our proprietary platforms.
 
We will also focus our research and development efforts on enhancing existing molecular diagnostic tests as new research becomes available. We may enter collaborative relationships with research and academic institutions for the development of additional or enhanced molecular diagnostic tests to further increase the depth and breadth of our molecular diagnostic test offerings. Where appropriate, we may also enter into licensing agreements with our collaborative partners to both license intellectual property for use in our molecular diagnostic test panels as well as licensing such intellectual property out, as appropriate.
 
Customers
 
Our customers consist primarily of physicians, hospitals and clinics. Our revenue channels include reimbursement by Medicare, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, and client billings (for example, hospitals and clinics), and commercial payors.
Marketing
 
Our commercialization efforts are currently focused in Endocrinology and Gastroenterology.  Communication of our molecular diagnostic marketing messaging and value proposition are done principally through our two field based sales teams of approximately 10 representatives each in Endocrinology and Gastroenterology. Additionally we communicate through print, digital advertising, a web presence, peer-reviewed publications, and trade show exhibits. We believe that our molecular diagnostic tests provide value to payors, physicians and patients by lowering healthcare costs through avoidance of unnecessary surgeries, reducing the morbidity associated with unnecessary surgeries for patients, and providing better diagnostic and prognostic insights to physicians. We support the value propositions of our molecular diagnostic tests through rigorous science that demonstrates their clinical and analytical validity as well as their clinical utility, which demonstrates how they actually impact physicians’ decisions. 
 
We also communicate to payors, integrated delivery systems and hospital systems about our molecular diagnostic tests' value through highly trained professionals who are experienced in reimbursement and business to business selling and through face to face meetings, phone calls, digital communications and advisory boards. We develop health economic analyses and budget impact models and incorporate these along with our clinical validation studies, and clinical utility studies to demonstrate our molecular diagnostic tests' value to this distinct and important constituency.

Intellectual Property
 
Patents, trademarks and other proprietary rights are important to us. We generate our own intellectual property and hold numerous patents and patent applications covering our existing and future products and technologies. As of December 31, 2016, we owned one issued United States Patent and three issued patents, one each in Australia, Europe (validated in Germany, France, United Kingdom, and Ireland) and Japan and nine pending patent applications in the United States and seven pending patent applications in Europe, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Israel and Japan. Provided all maintenance fees and annuities are paid, our issued United States patent expires in 2034 and our foreign patents expire in 2027, and our pending patent applications, if issued, are expected to expire between 2027 and 2032, absent any disclaimers, adjustments or extensions. On March 29, 2017 we were notified by the European Patent Office that our EP patent #1410739.2 for diagnosing thyroid cancer from a sample based upon at least MIR-375 was issued and, provided all maintenance fees and annuities are paid, expires in 2031. Our patents are directed to certain of the technologies relating to detecting, diagnosing, and classifying thyroid tumors, pancreatic cysts and other forms of gastrointestinal disorders, such as Barrett's esophagus.
 
We also rely on a combination of trade secrets and proprietary processes to protect our intellectual property. We enter into non-disclosure agreements with certain vendors and suppliers to attempt to ensure the confidentiality of our intellectual property. We also enter into non-disclosure agreements with our customers. In addition, we require that all our employees sign confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements.
 
In addition to our own molecular diagnostic test development efforts, we are currently using, and intend to use in the future, certain tests and biomarkers that have been developed by third parties or by us in collaboration with third parties. While a significant amount of intellectual property in the field of molecular diagnostic tests is already in the public domain, ThyraMIR®, ThyGenX®, PancraGEN® and some of the future tests developed by us, or by third parties on our behalf for use in our tests, may require, that we license the right to use certain intellectual property from third parties and pay customary royalties or make one time payments.
 
On August 13, 2014, the Company, consummated an agreement to acquire certain fully developed thyroid and other tests in development for thyroid cancer, associated intellectual property and a biobank with more than 5,000 patient tissue samples, or the Acquired Property Asuragen, pursuant to an asset purchase agreement, or the Agreement. The Company paid $8.0 million at closing and paid an additional $0.5 million to Asuragen for certain integral transition service obligations set forth in a transition services agreement, entered into concurrently with the Agreement. The Company also entered into two license agreements with Asuragen relating to the Company’s ability to sell the fully developed diagnostic tests and other tests in development for thyroid cancer. Under the Asuragen License Agreement, we owed a $500,000 milestone payment, all of which was paid in installments throughout 2016 and paid in full as of January 13, 2017. We are further obligated to pay royalties on the future net sales of the miRInform® pancreas platform for a period of ten years following a qualifying sale, on the future net sales of the miRInform® thyroid platform through August 13, 2024 and on certain other thyroid diagnostics tests for a period of ten years following a qualifying sale.
 
Additionally, we have a broad and growing trademark portfolio. We have secured trademark registrations for the marks PancraGEN®, BarreGEN® and miRInform® in the United States, and miRInform® with the World Intellectual Property Organization. We also have pending trademark applications for our other molecular diagnostic tests in the United States.
 
Competition
 
We compete on the basis of such factors as reputation, service quality, management experience, performance record, customer satisfaction, ability to respond to specific customer needs, integration skills, product portfolio, and price.  Increased competition and/or a decrease in demand for our services or molecular diagnostic tests may also lead to other forms of competition.  We believe that our business has a variety of competitive advantages that allow us to compete successfully in the marketplace.  While we believe we compete effectively with respect to each of these factors, certain of our competitors are substantially larger than us and have greater capital, personnel and other resources than we have. Many of our competitors also offer broader product lines outside of the molecular diagnostic testing market, and many have greater brand recognition than we do. Moreover, our competitors may make rapid technological developments that may result in our technologies and products becoming obsolete before we recover the expenses incurred to develop them or before they generate significant revenue.  Increased competition may lead to pricing pressures and competitive practices that could have a material adverse effect on our market share and our ability to attract new business opportunities as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.

We also compete with physicians and the medical community who use traditional methods to diagnose gastrointestinal and endocrine cancers. In many cases, practice guidelines in the United States have recommended therapies, surveillance or surgery to determine if a patient’s condition is malignant or benign. As a result, we believe that we will need to continue to educate physicians and the medical community on the value and benefits of our molecular diagnostic tests in order to change clinical practices and continue to support the use of molecular diagnostic tests in clinical guidelines.
 
Specifically, in regard to our thyroid diagnostic tests, Veracyte, Inc., or Veracyte, has a molecular thyroid nodule cancer diagnostic test (Afirma) that is the current market leader and competes with our ThyGenX® and ThyraMir® tests. Quest Diagnostics Incorporated, or Quest, currently offers a diagnostic test similar to the earlier version of our ThyGenX test and recently announced an agreement to distribute the Affirma test in partnership with Veracyte. CBLPath, Inc., or CBL, is offering a diagnostic test that analyzes genetic alterations using next-generation sequencing and in 2016 Rosetta Genomics introduced a thyroid cancer micro RNA assay. Other competitors include Rosetta Genomics, Accelerate Diagnostics, Inc., Cancer Genetics, Inc., Genomic Health Inc., NeoGenomics Inc. and Trovagene, Inc.
 
We are currently not aware of any direct competitors to PancraGEN® that integrate clinical, imaging, cytology, and molecular information to stratify patients' risk for malignancy and inform physicians on the best course of action, i.e. surgery or surveillance and surveillance interval length. Recently, University of Pittsburgh Medical Center began offering PanSeq, a Next Generation Sequencing "gene only" panel that focuses on the analysis of mutations in four oncogenes and three tumor suppressor genes, most of which may help establish the type of pancreatic cyst present and some of which may help establish the presence of malignancy. All but one of these related genomic regions are included in PancraGEN®.  This laboratory test however does not integrate any additional information to fully characterize a patient's risk for pancreatic cancer.  Importantly, there has been no long-term clinical validation or utility studies completed on any gene panel for pancreatic cyst fluid other than that associated with PancraGEN®. PancraGEN® has been validated in multiple studies and peer reviewed publications and has been used in over 30,000 patients. Notably, the Company has validated and is currently planning the 2017 launch of a DNA only version of PancraGEN®, known as PanDNA™.
 
It is also possible that we face future competition from laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs, developed by commercial laboratories such as Quest and other diagnostic companies developing new tests or technologies. Furthermore, we may be subject to competition as a result of new, unforeseen technologies that may be developed by our competitors in the gastrointestinal and endocrine cancer molecular diagnostic tests space.
 
We are aware of companies that are in the process of developing assays and laboratory development tests for Barrett’s esophagus, such as Cernostics Inc. In addition, NeoGenomics, Inc. is marketing a Barrett’s assay, so it is likely that this space will be competitive in the future.
 
Government Regulations and Industry Guidelines
 
The healthcare industry, and thus our business, is subject to extensive Federal, State, local and foreign regulation. Both Federal and State governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. We believe that we have structured our business operations and relationships with our customers to comply with applicable legal requirements. However, it is possible that governmental entities or other third parties could interpret these laws differently and assert otherwise. We discuss below the statutes and regulations that are most relevant to our business and most frequently cited in enforcement actions.

Regulations Over Our Clinical Laboratories
 
The conduct and provision of our molecular diagnostic tests are regulated under CLIA. CLIA requires us to maintain Federal certification. CLIA imposes requirements relating to test processes, personnel qualifications, facilities and equipment, recordkeeping, quality assurance and participation in proficiency testing. CLIA compliance and certification are also a condition for participation by clinical laboratories in the Medicare Program and for eligibility to bill for services provided to governmental healthcare program beneficiaries. As a condition of CLIA certification, our laboratory is subject to survey and inspection every other year, in addition to being subject to additional random inspections. The biennial survey is conducted by CMS, a CMS agent (typically a State agency), or, if the laboratory is accredited, a CMS-approved accreditation organization. Sanctions for failure to meet these certification, accreditation and licensure requirements include suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certification, accreditation or license, which is necessary to conduct business, cancellation or suspension of the laboratory’s ability to receive Medicare or Medicaid reimbursement, as well as imposition of plans to correct deficiencies, injunctive actions and civil monetary and criminal penalties. The loss or suspension of a CLIA certification, imposition of a fine or other penalties, or future changes in the CLIA law or regulations (or interpretation of the law or regulations) could harm our business. In addition to CLIA requirements, we participate in the oversight program of the CAP. Under CMS requirements, accreditation by CAP is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of CLIA. CLIA does not preempt State laws that are more stringent than Federal law. State laws may require additional personnel quality control, record maintenance and/or proficiency testing.
 
In addition to CLIA certification, we are required to maintain State licenses to conduct testing in our Pittsburgh and New Haven laboratories. Pennsylvania, New York and Connecticut laws require that we maintain a license and establish standards for the day-to-day operation of our clinical reference laboratories in Pittsburgh and New Haven. In addition, our clinical reference laboratory is required to be licensed on a test-specific basis by California, Florida, Maryland, New York (on a test-specific basis) and Rhode Island. California, Florida, Maryland, New York and Rhode Island laws also mandate proficiency testing for laboratories licensed under the laws of each respective State regardless of whether such laboratories are located in California, Florida, Maryland, New York or Rhode Island. On September 26, 2016 we received approval for our ThyGenX® test in New York. We are currently approved to perform ThyGenX®, ThyraMIR®, PancraGEN® and BarreGEN® in all states including the state of New York. If we were to lose our CAP Accreditation, CLIA certificate or State licenses for our laboratories, whether as a result of revocation, suspension or limitation, we would no longer be able to perform our molecular diagnostic tests, which would eliminate a source of revenue, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our Pittsburgh and New Haven laboratories are also subject to licensing and regulation under Federal, State and local laws relating to hazard communication and employee right-to-know regulations, and the safety and health of laboratory employees. Additionally, our Pittsburgh and New Haven laboratories are subject to applicable Federal and State laws and regulations and licensing requirements relating to the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous waste, and laboratory specimens, including the regulations of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Transportation, and the National Fire Protection Agency. The regulations of the United States Department of Transportation, Public Health Service and Postal Service apply to the surface and air transportation of laboratory specimens. 
 
In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers may be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis B virus, by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries. Although we believe that we are currently in compliance in all material respects with such Federal, State and local laws, failure to comply with such laws could subject us to denial of the right to conduct business, fines, criminal penalties and other enforcement actions. 
 
Further, laboratories that analyze human blood or other biological samples for the diagnosis and treatment of clinical trial subjects must comply with CLIA, as well as requirements established by Federal law, various States laws and local regulations. In addition, we are also subject to such laws relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemical and biological agents and compounds. Typically, we use outside vendors who are contractually obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations to dispose of such waste. These vendors are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of such waste. The failure to meet these requirements may result in civil penalties and suspension or revocation of our CLIA certifications at our New Haven and Pittsburgh laboratories.

Potential U.S. Food and Drug Administration Regulation of Diagnostics Tests
 
Both United States Federal and State governmental agencies continue to subject the healthcare industry to intense regulatory scrutiny, including heightened civil and criminal enforcement efforts. As indicated by work plans and reports issued by these agencies, the Federal government will continue to scrutinize, among other things, the marketing, labeling, promotion, manufacturing and export of molecular diagnostic tests. While subject to oversight by CMS through its enforcement of CLIA, the FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all laboratories that produce LDTs, a type of in vitro diagnostic test that is designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. The FDA has regulatory responsibility over, among other areas, instruments, test kits, reagents and other devices used in clinical laboratories to perform diagnostic testing in the United States. 
 
The FDA has generally exercised enforcement discretion over all LDTs. However, in October 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents: “Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests,” which provided an overview of how the FDA would regulate LDTs through a risk-based approach, and “FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests,” which provided guidance on how the FDA intends to collect information on existing LDTs, including adverse event reports. Pursuant to the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance, LDT manufacturers would be subject to medical device registration, listing, and adverse event reporting requirements. LDT manufacturers would be required to either submit a pre-market application and receive the FDA’s approval before an LDT may be marketed or submit a pre-market notification in advance of marketing. The Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance states that within six months after the guidance documents are finalized, all laboratories will be required to give notice to the FDA and provide basic information concerning the nature of the LDTs offered. If the FDA were to regulate LDTs as proposed under the 2014 draft guidance documents, then it would classify LDTs into one of three classes according to the current system used to regulate medical devices. Class I devices are those for which reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness can be provided by adherence to the FDA’s general regulatory controls for medical devices. Class II devices are subject to the FDA’s general controls, and any other special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to provide reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the devices. Class III devices are those devices which are deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, have a new intended use, or use advanced technology that is not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device. Under the guidance documents, LDTs would also be subject to significant post-market requirements as well. 
 
On November 18, 2016, however, the FDA announced that it would not release the final guidance at this time and instead would continue to work with stakeholders, the new administration and Congress to determine the right approach. On January 13, 2017, the FDA released a discussion paper on LDTs outlining a possible risk-based approach for FDA and CMS oversight of LDTs. According to the 2017 discussion paper, previously marketed LDTs would not be expected to comply with most or all FDA oversight requirements (grandfathering), except for adverse event and malfunction reporting. In addition, certain new and significantly modified LDTs would not be expected to comply with pre-market review unless the agency determines certain tests could lead to patient harm. Since LDTs currently on the market would be grandfathered in, pre-market review of new and significantly modified LDTs could be phased-in over a four-year period, as opposed to the nine years proposed in the Framework for Regulatory Oversight draft guidance. In addition, tests introduced after the effective date, but before their phase-in date, could continue to be offered during pre-market review. 
 
The discussion paper notes that FDA will focus on analytical and clinical validity as the basis for marketing authorization. The FDA anticipates laboratories that already conduct proper validation should not be expected to experience new costs for validating their tests to support marketing authorization and laboratories that conduct appropriate evaluations would not have to collect additional data to demonstrate analytical validity for FDA clearance or approval. The evidence of the analytical and clinical validity of all LDTs will be made publically available. LDTs are encouraged to submit prospective change protocols in their pre-market submission that outline specific types of anticipated changes, the procedures that will be followed to implement them and the criteria that will be met prior to implementation.

Despite the FDA decision to not release the guidance at this time, it can choose to regulate LDTs at any time. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA, such as fines, product suspensions, warning letters, recalls, injunctions and other civil and criminal sanctions. There are other regulatory and legislative proposals that would increase general FDA oversight of clinical laboratories and LDTs. The outcome and ultimate impact of such proposals on the business is difficult to predict at this time. We are monitoring developments and anticipate that our products will be able to comply with requirements if ultimately imposed by the FDA. In the meantime, we maintain our CLIA certification of accreditation, which permits the use of LDTs for diagnostics purposes.
Healthcare, Fraud, Abuse and Anti-kickback Laws
 
The Anti-kickback Law makes it a felony for a person or entity, including a laboratory, to knowingly and willfully offer, pay, solicit or receive remuneration, directly or indirectly, in order to induce business that is reimbursable under any Federal healthcare program. A violation of the Anti-kickback Law may result in imprisonment of up to five years and fines of up to $250,000 for each offense in the case of individuals and $500,000 for each offense in the case of organizations. Convictions under the Anti-kickback Law result in mandatory exclusion from federal healthcare programs for a minimum of five years. In addition, HHS has the authority to impose civil assessments and fines and to exclude healthcare providers and others engaged in prohibited activities from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs. Actions, which violate the Anti-kickback Law, also incur liability under the Federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below, which prohibits knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. Government.
  
Although the Anti-kickback Law applies only to federal healthcare programs, a number of states have passed statutes substantially similar to the Anti-kickback Law pursuant to which similar types of prohibitions are made applicable to all other health plans and third-party payors. Federal and state law enforcement authorities scrutinize arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as a mechanism to induce patient care referrals or induce the purchase or prescribing of particular products or services. The law enforcement authorities, the courts and Congress have also demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and actual or potential referral sources. Generally, courts have taken a broad interpretation of the scope of the Anti-kickback Law, holding that the statute may be violated if merely one purpose of a payment arrangement is to induce referrals or purchases.
 
In addition to the requirements discussed above, several other healthcare fraud and abuse laws could have an effect on our business. For example, provisions of the Social Security Act permit Medicare and Medicaid to exclude an entity that charges the federal healthcare programs substantially in excess of its usual charges for its services. The terms "usual charge" and "substantially in excess" are ambiguous and subject to varying interpretations. Further, the Federal False Claims Act, discussed in more detail below, prohibits a person from knowingly submitting a claim, making a false record or statement in order to secure payment or retaining an overpayment by the federal government. In addition to actions initiated by the government itself, the statute authorizes actions to be brought on behalf of the federal government by a private party having knowledge of the alleged fraud. Because the complaint is initially filed under seal, the action may be pending for some time before the defendant is even aware of the action. If the government is ultimately successful in obtaining redress in the matter or if the plaintiff succeeds in obtaining redress without the government's involvement, then the plaintiff will receive a percentage of the recovery. Finally, the Social Security Act includes its own provisions that prohibit the filing of false claims or submitting false statements in order to obtain payment. Violation of these provisions may result in fines, imprisonment or both, and possible exclusion from Medicare or Medicaid programs.
 
We are also subject to the federal physician self-referral prohibitions, commonly known as the Stark Law. These restrictions generally prohibit us from billing a patient or any governmental or private payor for any diagnostic services when the physician ordering the service, or any member of such physician's immediate family, has an investment interest in or compensation arrangement with us, unless the arrangement meets an exception to the prohibition.

Persons or entities found to violate the Stark Law are required to refund any payments received pursuant to a referral prohibited by these laws to the patient, the payor or the Medicare program, as applicable. Sanctions for a violation of the Stark Law include the following:

• | denial of payment for the services provided in violation of the prohibition;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refunds of amounts collected by an entity in violation of the Stark Law;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a civil penalty of up to $15,000 for each service arising out of the prohibited referral;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a civil penalty of up to $100,000 against parties that enter into a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law's prohibition.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
These prohibitions apply regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral. No finding of intent to violate the Stark Law is required for a violation. In addition, knowing violations of the Stark Law may also serve as the basis for liability under the Federal False Claims Act.
 
We do retain healthcare practitioners as key opinion leaders providing consultation in various aspects of the business. These arrangements as any arrangement that includes compensation to a healthcare provider may trigger Federal or State anti-kickback and Stark Law liability. Our arrangements are designed to meet available safe harbors and exceptions provided in the anti-kickback laws and Stark laws, respectively. There is no guarantee that the government will find that these arrangements are designed properly or that they do not trigger liability. Under existing laws, all arrangements must have a legitimate purpose and compensation must be fair market value. These terms require some subjective analysis and there is limited available case law or guidance for the application of these laws to the CLIA Laboratory industry. Safe harbors in the anti-kickback laws do not necessarily equate to exceptions in the Stark Law; and there is no guarantee that the government will not have issue with the relationships between the laboratories and the healthcare providers.
 
HIPAA, Fraud and Privacy Regulations
 
The Federal government’s efforts to combat fraud in the healthcare setting were consolidated and strengthened under Public Law 104-191, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. HIPAA established a comprehensive program to combat fraud committed against all health plans, both public and private by, among other things creating two new Federal offenses: healthcare fraud (18 U.S. Code § 1347) and false statements relating to healthcare matters (18 U.S. Code § 1035). These provisions prohibit: (1) the knowing and willful execution, or attempted execution, of a scheme or artifice (a) to defraud any healthcare benefit program (including private payors), or (b) to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items, or services; and (2) the knowing and willful (a) falsification, concealment or covering up of a material fact by any trick, scheme or device, or (b) making of any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement or representation, or making or using any materially false writing or document knowing the same to contain any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statement or entry, in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of these provisions is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion from government-sponsored programs.
 
HIPAA, along with the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and the various regulations promulgated thereunder, also establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the security and privacy of individually identifiable health information maintained or transmitted by healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, which are referred to as “covered entities.” The regulations promulgated under HIPAA govern: the Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information, restricting the use and disclosure of certain individually identifiable health information (45 C.F.R. §§ 164.500, et seq.); Administrative Requirements for electronic transactions, establishing standards for common healthcare transactions, such as claims information, plan eligibility, payment information and the use of electronic signatures (45 C.F.R. §§ 162.100, et seq.); Security Standards for the Protection of Electronic Protected Health Information, requiring covered entities to implement and maintain certain security measures to safeguard certain electronic health information (45 C.F.R. §§ 164.302, et seq.); and Breach Notification, requiring covered entities and their business associates to provide notification following a breach of unsecured protected health information (45 C.F.R. §§ 164.400, et seq.). As a covered entity, and also in our capacity as a business associate to certain of our customers, we are subject to these standards. While the government intended this legislation to reduce administrative expenses and burdens for the healthcare industry, our compliance with certain provisions of these standards entails significant costs for us, and our failure to comply could lead to enforcement action that could have an adverse effect on our business. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of HIPAA or its implementing regulations, we may be subject to potentially significant penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages and fines.

In addition to Federal regulations issued under HIPAA, many States and foreign jurisdictions have enacted privacy and security statutes or regulations that, in some cases, are more stringent than those issued under HIPAA. In those cases, it may be necessary to modify our planned operations and procedures to comply with the more stringent laws. If we fail to comply with applicable State laws and regulations, we could be subject to additional sanctions.
Third Party Coverage and Reimbursement
 
Our customers bill many different payor groups. The majority of reimbursement dollars for traditional laboratory services are provided by traditional commercial insurance products, most notably preferred provider organizations, or PPOs, and other managed care plans, as well as government healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. PPOs, HMOs and other managed care plans typically contract with a limited number of laboratories and then designate the laboratory or laboratories to be used for tests ordered by participating physicians. We are currently an out-of-network provider with most payors, which means we do not have a contract with payors to pay a specific rate for our tests. We are subject to applicable State laws regarding who should be billed, how they should be billed, how business should be conducted, and how patient obligations regarding cost sharing should be handled. In addition, if we become an “in-network” provider for certain payors in the future, we will also be subject to the terms of contracts (which could include reduced reimbursement rates) and may be subject to discipline, breach of contract actions, non-renewal or other contractually provided remedies for non-compliance with the contract's requirements and/or applicable laws.
 
We generally bill third-party payors and individual patients for testing services on a test-by-test basis. Third-party payors include Medicare, private insurance companies, institutional direct clients and Medicaid, each of which has different billing requirements. Medicare reimbursement programs are complex and ambiguous, and are continuously being evaluated and modified by CMS. Our ability to receive timely reimbursements from third-party payors is dependent on our ability to submit accurate and complete billing statements, and/or correct and complete missing and incorrect billing information. Missing and incorrect information on reimbursement submissions slows down the billing process and increases the aging of accounts receivable. We must bill Medicare directly for tests performed for Medicare patients and must accept Medicare’s fee schedule for the covered tests as payment in full. State Medicaid programs are generally prohibited from paying more than the Medicare fee schedule. Our Pittsburgh and New Haven laboratories have contracted with a healthcare billing services management company to work with our in-house staff and help manage our third-party billing.
 
Some billing arrangements require us to bill multiple payors, and there are several other factors that complicate billing (e.g., disparity in coverage and information requirements among various payors; and incomplete or inaccurate billing information provided by ordering physicians). We incur additional costs as a result of our participation in Medicare and Medicaid programs because diagnostic testing services are subject to complex, stringent and frequently ambiguous federal and state laws and regulations, including those relating to coverage, billing and reimbursement. Additionally, auditing for compliance with applicable laws and regulations as well as internal compliance policies and procedures adds further cost and complexity to the billing process. Further, our billing systems require significant technology investment and, as a result of marketplace demands, we need to continually invest in our billing systems. Changes in laws and regulations could further complicate our billing and increase our billing expense. CMS establishes procedures and continuously evaluates and implements changes to the reimbursement process and requirements for coverage.
 
As an integral part of our billing compliance program, we investigate reported failures or suspected failures to comply with Federal and State healthcare reimbursement requirements. Any Medicare or Medicaid overpayments are reimbursed by us. As a result of these efforts, we have periodically identified and reported overpayments, reimbursed the payors for overpayments and taken appropriate corrective action.

The majority of our bad debt expense comes from two categories, Medicare Advantage payors, which unlike Medicare or CMS, have coverages that vary according to specific patient health plans and direct-bill invoices to hospital-based laboratories, who may dispute or refuse payment. We are taking, and plan to continue to take, steps to improve our collection rates in these two areas.  The remainder of our bad debt expense is primarily due to missing or incorrect billing information on requisitions received from healthcare providers. Historically, due to the nature of our business, we have performed requested testing and have reported test results regardless of collectability or form of reimbursement. We submit claims for reimbursement on a best efforts basis including the use of a third-party revenue cycle management firm. If at times the billing information is incorrect or incomplete, we subsequently attempt to contact the healthcare provider or patient to obtain any missing information and to rectify incorrect billing information. Missing or incorrect information on requisitions complicates and slows down the billing process and may also impact bad debt expense. The increased use of electronic ordering reduces the incidence of missing or incorrect information, and the company is seeking to electronically integrate with more and more payors and clients.
  
There are a number of factors that influence coverage and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic tests. In the United States, the American Medical Association assigns specific CPT codes, which are necessary for reimbursement of molecular diagnostic tests. Once the CPT code is established, CMS establishes reimbursement payment levels and coverage rules under Medicaid and Medicare, and private payors establish rates and coverage rules independently. However, the availability of a CPT code is not a guarantee of coverage or adequate reimbursement levels, and the revenues generated from our tests will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payors provide coverage and establish adequate reimbursement levels.
 
United States and other government regulations governing coverage and reimbursement for molecular diagnostic testing may affect, directly or indirectly, the design of our tests and the potential market for their use. The availability of third-party reimbursement for our tests and services may be limited or uncertain. Third-party payors may deny coverage if they determine that the tests or service has not received appropriate FDA or other government regulatory clearances, is not used in accordance with cost-effective treatment methods as determined by the payor, or is deemed by the third-party payor to be experimental, unnecessary or inappropriate. Furthermore, third-party payors, including Federal and State healthcare programs, government authorities, private managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations, are increasingly challenging the prices, examining the medical necessity for, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of healthcare products and services, including laboratory tests. Such payors may limit coverage of our tests to specific, limited circumstances, may not provide coverage at all, or may not provide adequate reimbursement rates, if covered. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage for the test. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to maintain our revenue and growth. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time.
 
Government payors, such as Medicare and Medicaid, have taken steps and are expected to continue to take steps to control the cost, utilization and delivery of healthcare services, including clinical test services. For example, Medicare has adopted policies under which it does not pay for many commonly ordered clinical tests unless the ordering physician has provided an appropriate diagnosis code supporting the medical necessity of the test. Physicians are required by law to provide diagnostic information when they order clinical tests for Medicare and Medicaid patients.
 
Currently, Medicare does not require the beneficiary to pay a co-payment for diagnostic information services reimbursed under the Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule. Certain Medicaid programs require Medicaid recipients to pay co-payment amounts for diagnostic information services.
 
The Medicare Part B program contains fee schedule payment methodologies for clinical testing services performed for covered patients, including a national ceiling on the amount that carriers could pay under their local Medicare clinical testing fee schedules. Historically, the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, has been subject to change. In April 2014, the President signed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which included a substantial new payment system for clinical laboratory tests under the CLFS. PAMA removed CMS’s authority to adjust the CLFS based and established a new method for setting CLFS rates. Implementation of this new method for setting CLFS rates begins in 2017. Under PAMA, laboratories that have more than $12,500 in Medicare revenues from laboratory services and that receive more than 50 percent of their Medicare revenues from laboratory services would report private payor data from January 1, 2016 through June 30, 2016, to CMS between January 1, 2017 and March 31, 2017. CMS will post the new Medicare CLFS rates (based on weighted median private payor rates) in November 2015 and the new rates will be effective beginning on January 1, 2017. Any reductions to payment rates resulting from the new methodology are limited to 10% per test per year in each of the years 2017 through 2019 and to 15% per test per year in each of the years 2020 through 2022. CMS has issued draft regulations regarding these changes. Further rule-making from CMS will define the time period and data elements evaluated on an annual basis to set reimbursement rates. Other than our chemistry testing services, our products are defined as Advanced Diagnostic Laboratory Tests (ALDTs) and therefore, we believe the pricing provisions of PAMA do not affect a majority of our marketed molecular diagnostic tests. The only testing for which we bill that is included in the CLFS is our carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and Amylase chemistry testing services. For these services, we provided CMS with the median pricing received from all payers in compliance with PAMA regulations.

Penalties for violations of laws relating to billing government healthcare programs and for violations of federal and state fraud and abuse laws include: (1) exclusion from participation in Medicare/Medicaid programs; (2) asset forfeitures; (3) civil and criminal fines and penalties; and (4) the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business. Civil monetary penalties for a wide range of violations may be assessed on a per violation basis. A parallel civil remedy under the federal False Claims Act provides for penalties on a per violation basis, plus damages of up to three times the amount claimed.
 
Historically, most Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries were covered under the traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs administered by the federal government. Reimbursement from traditional Medicare and Medicaid programs represented approximately 61% of our consolidated net revenues during 2015. Over the last several years, the federal government has continued to expand its contracts with private health insurance plans for Medicare beneficiaries and has encouraged such beneficiaries to switch from the traditional programs to the private programs, called “Medicare Advantage” programs. There has been growth of health insurance providers offering Medicare Advantage programs and of beneficiary enrollment in these programs. In recent years, in an effort to control costs, states also have mandated that Medicaid beneficiaries enroll in private managed care arrangements.
 
The current position of the laboratories is that they do not meet the definition of an “Applicable Manufacturer” under Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA (also known as the Affordable Care Act) and therefore are not subject to the disclosure or tax requirements contained in PPACA. However, as new regulations are implemented and diagnostic tests reclassified, this may change and the laboratory business may be subject to PPACA as are other companies. There is no guarantee that our interpretation of the law is now or will be in the future consistent with government guidance and interpretation.
