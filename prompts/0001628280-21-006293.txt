Item 1. Business
Tillys is a leading destination specialty retailer of casual apparel, footwear, accessories, and hardgoods for young men, young women, boys and girls with an extensive assortment of iconic global, emerging, and proprietary brands rooted in an active and social lifestyle. Tillys is headquartered in Irvine, California and operated 238 stores in 33 states as of January 30, 2021. Our stores are located in a variety of retail centers, including malls, lifestyle centers, "power" centers, community centers, outlet centers, and street-front locations. Customers may also shop online, where we feature substantially the same assortment of products as is carried in our brick-and-mortar stores, supplemented by additional online-only styles. Our goal is to serve as a destination for the latest, most relevant merchandise and brands important to our customers. 
The Tillys concept began in 1982 when our co-founders, Hezy Shaked and Tilly Levine, opened their first store in Orange County, California. Since 1984, the business has been conducted through World of Jeans & Tops, a California corporation, or "WOJT", which operates under the name "Tillys". In May 2011, Tilly's, Inc., a Delaware corporation, was formed solely for the purpose of reorganizing the corporate structure of WOJT in preparation for an initial public offering. As part of the initial public offering in May 2012, WOJT became a wholly owned subsidiary of Tilly's, Inc. 
As used in this Report, except where the context otherwise requires or where otherwise indicated, the terms "the Company", "World of Jeans and Tops", "WOJT", "we", "our", "us", and "Tillys" refer to World of Jeans & Tops before our initial public offering, and to Tilly's, Inc. and its subsidiary after our initial public offering.
Our fiscal year ends on the Saturday closest to January 31. For example, "fiscal 2020" refers to the fiscal year ended January 30, 2021; "fiscal 2019" refers to the fiscal year ended February 1, 2020; and "fiscal 2018" refers to the fiscal year ended February 2, 2019.
Our Strengths 
We believe that the following strengths contribute to our success and distinguish us from our competitors:
•Destination retailer with a broad and differentiated assortment. We believe the combined depth and breadth of apparel, footwear and accessories offered at our stores exceeds the selection offered at many other specialty retailers. We offer an extensive selection of lifestyle and emerging third-party brands, as well as proprietary brands. Our merchandise includes a wide assortment of relevant brands, styles, colors, sizes, and price points to ensure our customers have a variety of choices every time they visit our stores. We offer a balanced mix of merchandise across the apparel, footwear and accessories categories serving young men, young women, boys, and girls. We believe that by combining proven and emerging fashion trends and core style products with a vibrant blend of carefully selected music and visuals, we provide an in-store experience that is authentic, fun, and engaging for our core customers. We believe that our differentiated in-store environment, evolving selection of relevant brands, and broader and deeper assortment positions us as a retail destination that appeals to a larger demographic than many other specialty retailers.
•Dynamic merchandise model. We believe our extensive selection of third-party and proprietary merchandise allows us to identify and offer several trends simultaneously, offer a greater range of price points, and manage our inventories more dynamically. By closely monitoring trends and shipping product to our stores multiple times per week, we are able to adjust our merchandise mix based on store size and location. We also keep our merchandise mix relevant by introducing emerging brands and new merchandise from established brands not available at many other retailers. Our merchandising capabilities enable us to adjust our merchandise mix with a frequency that promotes a current look to our stores and website.
•Flexible real estate strategy across real estate venues and geographies. Our stores have proven to be successful in a variety of retail centers and geographies. We operate stores in malls, lifestyle centers, power centers, community centers, outlet centers, and street-front locations across 82 markets in 33 states. We believe our success operating in these different retail venues and geographies demonstrates the portability of the Tillys brand.
•Multi-pronged marketing approach. We utilize a multi-pronged marketing strategy to connect with our customers and drive traffic to our stores and online platforms. We offer an integrated digital platform for our customers to shop how and when they like, and to drive further connection with them. We partner and collaborate with our vendors on exclusive, compelling in-store events, digital new customer acquisition, and contests to build credibility with our target customers, actively involve them in our brands, and enhance the connection between Tillys and our customers' active lifestyle. We have a growing customer loyalty program, “Tilly’s Rewards”, to further engage with our customers, reward our most loyal customers, provide loyalty only events, and gain valuable customer insights. From time to time, we distribute catalogs and postcards to potential and existing customers to familiarize them with the Tillys brand, our products, and to drive traffic to 
our stores and website. We use social media to communicate directly with our customers while also encouraging customers to interact with one another and provide feedback on our events and products. We also look to partner with social media stars and influencers to drive brand awareness. All of these programs are complemented by digital and email marketing, as well as print advertising, to build customer awareness and loyalty, highlight key merchandise offerings, drive traffic to our stores and online platforms, and promote the Tillys brand. We also seek to maintain a connection with our local communities through our various community outreach initiatives.
•Systems and distribution/fulfillment infrastructure to support growth. We have previously made investments in distribution, fulfillment and allocation infrastructure that we believe are adequate to support continued growth for a number of years. Our distribution center allows us to quickly sort and process merchandise and deliver it to our stores in a floor-ready format for immediate display. We also have a dedicated e-commerce fulfillment center to support our online growth potential. Our systems enable us to respond to changing fashion trends, manage inventory in real time, and provide a customized selection of merchandise at each location. We believe our distribution and fulfillment infrastructure can support significant growth in our stores and e-commerce platform with minimal incremental capital investment.
•Experienced management team. Our senior management team, led by Hezy Shaked and Edmond Thomas, has extensive experience across a wide range of disciplines in the specialty retail and direct-to-consumer industries, including store operations, merchandising, distribution, real estate, and finance. Mr. Shaked, our Co-Founder, Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors, and Chief Strategy Officer, plays an important role in developing our long-term growth initiatives and cultivating our unique culture. Mr. Thomas, our President and Chief Executive Officer, has over 30 years of retail industry experience.
Growth Strategy 
Subject to our ongoing evaluation of the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our business (as further described elsewhere in this Report), we are pursuing several strategies to drive long-term sales and profitability, including:
•Drive Comparable Store Sales Growth. We seek to maximize our comparable store sales by consistently offering new, on-trend and relevant merchandise, including exclusive and proprietary branded merchandise, across a broad assortment of categories, increasing our brand awareness through our multi-pronged marketing approach, providing an authentic in-store and online experience for our core customers, and maintaining a high level of customer service. We continue to enhance our existing loyalty program to further reward our most loyal customers. We believe the combination of these factors, together with the operating strategies described below, will improve our comparable store sales results over time.
•Increase Our Operating Margins. We believe we have the opportunity to drive operating margin expansion through scale efficiencies and continued process improvements. We believe comparable store sales increases will permit us to generate more favorable buying costs from larger volume purchases, and better leverage largely fixed occupancy costs, labor costs for store management and corporate overhead, as well as the fixed portion of shipping and handling costs over higher sales volumes. In addition, we expect to improve operating margins and support growth by leveraging previous investments in infrastructure, including our dedicated fulfillment center for e-commerce, upgraded e-commerce platform, and in-store point-of-sale system. We also will continue to use established business processes to identify and execute initiatives focused on lowering our unit costs and improving operational efficiency throughout our organization.
•Continue Growing E-Commerce. Our e-commerce net sales represented approximately 33% of our total net sales for fiscal 2020 and 16% of our total net sales for fiscal 2019. We believe that a significant portion of this increase was driven by changing consumer behaviors associated with the pandemic, including as a result of the temporary shutdown of all of our stores beginning in mid-March 2020 in response thereto and the staggered reopening of those stores with government-mandated restrictions on customer traffic and reduced operating hours throughout the remainder of the fiscal year. Notwithstanding these impacts of the pandemic, we believe that significant growth opportunities continue to exist for our e-commerce business. We believe our e-commerce platform is an extension of our brand and retail stores, and we seek to maintain an extensive selection of our newest and best merchandise assortments online, providing our customers with a seamless shopping experience. Our e-commerce platform allows us to reach new customers, and build our brand in markets where we currently do not have stores. For example, we generate e-commerce sales in all 50 states and the District of Columbia although we have physical stores in only 33 states. Our target customer regularly shops online and via mobile devices in addition to visiting stores, giving us a continued opportunity to grow our e-commerce platform over time. In recent years, we have invested in a new point-of-sale system in stores, an upgraded e-commerce website platform, and a new order management system that is integrated with our stores and website to allow for certain omni-channel capabilities, including fulfilling e-commerce orders from stores when items are out of stock in our e-commerce distribution center, allowing customers to place orders online for in-store or curbside pickup, or to have items shipped to them from our stores. We have also partnered with Afterpay and Postmates to offer our customers greater flexibility in payment options and delivery convenience. We plan to continue to invest in additional customer-facing technologies to improve customer convenience and engagement over time. Key factors we expect to drive growth may include continuing our catalog, online 
and mobile application marketing efforts, enhancing the efficiency and responsiveness of our digital capabilities, and supplementing the assortment available in our brick-and-mortar stores with additional online-only styles. We also expect to continue to expand digital marketing efforts, customer loyalty, and build brand awareness in the communities surrounding our existing stores to drive growth in both brick-and-mortar and e-commerce sales.
•Improve Inventory Management. We continue to improve our operating results through more refined micro-merchandising tactics based on specific store and online characteristics. We regularly update individual store profiles for every store to highlight the differences in brand performance, gender penetrations, and customer interests that exist within our fleet of stores. We also monitor sell-through rates online versus stores to identify opportunities for inventory efficiencies. By adapting allocation strategies to capitalize on these individual store and online differences, we believe we can continue to improve our net sales results.
•Develop Omni-Channel Capabilities. We have a direct-to-consumer program that allows online orders to be fulfilled and shipped directly to our customers from our brick-and-mortar stores when inventory is otherwise unavailable in our e-commerce fulfillment center. In addition, our omni-channel capabilities allow customer online orders to be picked up in our stores at our customers' discretion, allowing us to satisfy an order from existing inventories within our stores as well as shipping product from our e-commerce fulfillment center to our stores. We also offer same-day delivery and curbside pickup options from a large majority of our stores. We continue to further enhance our omni-channel capabilities by seeking to offer a ship-to-store ordering option for our e-commerce customers. We believe these omni-channel capabilities will drive additional traffic to our stores and increase sales opportunities with customers who come to the store to pick up their online orders.
•Reinvest in Existing Stores. We believe that re-investing in our existing stores is strategically important to enhance customer loyalty, elevate the customer experience and, in turn, drive additional comparable store sales. We have remodeled or refreshed approximately 90% of our stores in recent years, and intend to continue to do so in the future to keep the shopping experience associated with the Tillys brand updated and compelling for our customers. 
•Real Estate Opportunities. With 238 total stores at the end of fiscal 2020, we believe there are numerous attractive opportunities for Tillys to continue to open new stores in the future. We currently expect to open seven new stores during fiscal 2021 which had been originally signed and planned for opening during fiscal 2020. We intend to continue to maintain a disciplined approach to store growth in the future by targeting existing markets with room for growth and new markets with high population density, and clustering stores within key markets to build brand awareness. With regard to existing stores, we have approximately 34 lease decisions to make during fiscal 2021, covering a range of stores in a variety of markets. These lease decisions include lease extension options, lease kick-out options, and lease expirations that require negotiated renewals. In each case, our real estate decisions will be driven by the overarching goal of improving our profitability. As a result, we may close a limited number of stores from time to time if acceptable levels of profitability cannot be obtained through occupancy negotiations with landlords, particularly in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Merchandising, Purchasing, and Planning and Allocation
Merchandising
We seek to be viewed by our customers as the destination for the apparel, footwear and accessories that best represent their active, outdoor and social lifestyle. We believe we offer an unparalleled selection of relevant brands, styles, colors, sizes and price points to ensure our customers have a variety of choices every time they visit our stores. Our extensive selection of third-party and proprietary merchandise allows us to identify and address trends more quickly, offer a greater range of price points, and manage our inventories more dynamically. We offer a mix of merchandise for young men, young women, boys and girls across the apparel, footwear and accessories categories. We believe this category mix contributes to our broad demographic appeal. Our apparel merchandise includes branded, fashion, and core styles for tops, outerwear, bottoms, and dresses. Accessories merchandise includes backpacks, hydration bottles, hats, sunglasses, small electronics and accessories, handbags, watches, jewelry, and more. We focus on our merchandise presentation and vary the visual displays in our stores and windows throughout the month, presenting new looks and fashion combinations to our customers.
Our ability to maintain an image consistent with our customers' lifestyles is important to our branded vendors and provides us better access to a wide assortment of products and styles. Our third-party and proprietary branded merchandise includes a broad selection of lifestyle and emerging brands. We strive to keep our merchandise mix current by continuously introducing emerging brands and styles not available at many other specialty retailers in order to identify and respond to the evolving desires of our customers. Our third-party brands represented approximately 74%, 75% and 75% of our total net sales in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In fiscal 2020, our proprietary RSQ brand was our top selling brand overall and accounted for approximately 11% of our total net sales, while Vans (a third-party brand) and our proprietary Full Tilt brand accounted for 8% and 6% of our total net sales, respectively. No other brand, whether third-party or proprietary, exceeded 5% of our total net sales during fiscal 2020.
Selected third-party brands (in alphabetical order) include:
Adidas            BDG            Billabong        BirkenstockBrixton            Champion        Converse        Diamond Supply
Dickies            Dr. Martens        Ethika            Free People            
G-Shock            Herschel Supply Co.    HUF            Hurley    
Hydro Flask        Jansport            Levi's            Neff
Nike SB            O'Neill            Obey            Primitive        
RayBan            Riot Society        Rip Curl            Roxy
RVCA            Salty Crew        Santa Cruz        Spy
Stance            The North Face        Vans            Volcom            
We supplement our third-party merchandise assortment with our own proprietary brands across many of our product categories. We utilize our own proprietary, branded merchandise to expand our price point range, identify and respond to changing fashion trends quickly, fill merchandise gaps and provide a deeper selection of styles and colors for proven fashion items. Our proprietary brands represented approximately 26%, 25% and 25% of our total net sales in fiscal 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Examples of our proprietary brands include:

Brand | Category 
 | Denim, apparel and fragrance brand for young men, young women and kids
 | Apparel and accessories brand for young women and girls 
 | Apparel and accessories brand for young men and boys 
 | Apparel, beauty and fragrance brand for young women 
 | Apparel for girls 
 | Apparel for young women 
 | Fragrance brand for young men 
 | Apparel and accessories for young women 

We believe that our extensive selection of merchandise, from established and emerging third-party brands as well as our proprietary brands, caters to a wide demographic of core customers and enhances our image as a destination for the most sought-after apparel, footwear and accessories.
Merchandise Purchasing
Our merchandising team is organized by category and product type under our Senior Vice President, General Merchandising Manager and includes divisional merchandise managers, a technical design and fashion trend team, buyers, associate buyers and assistant buyers. We believe a key element of our success is our team’s ability to identify and source the proven and emerging fashion trends and core styles that are most relevant to our customers.
Our purchasing approach focuses on product relevance, quality, fit, availability, cost and speed of production in order to provide timely frequent delivery of merchandise to our stores. Our purchasing group and planning and allocation team are highly coordinated and maintain a disciplined buying strategy.
To ensure a relevant assortment, our teams:
•perform comprehensive analysis of sales trends for both stores and e-commerce;
•constantly seek out new emerging brands, while maintaining close partnerships with existing brands;
•utilize trend and color forecasting services;
•attend trade shows and youth culture events;
•conduct store visits to gather feedback from our customers and staff; and
•maintain market and consumer insight through shopping trends of leading retailers, direct competitors and relevant social media influencers. 
We have developed and maintain strong and, in many cases, long-standing relationships with our third-party vendors and we have a history of identifying and growing with emerging brands. We believe the Tillys brand, shopping experience and core customer lifestyle is highly consistent with the image and philosophy of our key vendors. This, in addition to our customer connectivity, facilitates a partnership culture with our key vendors and provides us access to an extensive variety of products and styles, as well as certain merchandise that is exclusive to our stores and website. Our merchandise purchasing group also works closely with independent third parties who design and procure merchandise for our proprietary brands. Our proprietary brand capabilities enhance our ability to rapidly identify and respond to trends and consistently offer proven fashion items that provide a broader demographic appeal. We work with numerous vendors based in the United States to supply us with our proprietary branded product. These vendors source from both domestic and international markets and either have their own factories or contract with owners of factories to source finished product. By sourcing merchandise for our proprietary brands both domestically and internationally, we have the flexibility to benefit from shorter lead times associated with domestic manufacturing and lower costs associated with international manufacturing.
Planning and Allocation
We have developed inventory planning and allocation processes to support our merchandising strategies. Working closely with our merchandise purchasing team, the planning and allocation team utilizes a disciplined approach to buying, forecasting, inventory control and allocation. Our planning and allocation team continually analyzes inventory levels and sell-through data to regularly adjust the assortment at each store and the inventory levels for our company as a whole. Our broad third-party vendor base allows us to shift merchandise purchases to react quickly to changing consumer preferences and market conditions. Furthermore, the vendor base for our proprietary products provides us flexibility to develop our own branded products to quickly address emerging fashion trends and provide a deeper selection of styles, colors, and price points for proven fashion items. We modify our merchandising mix based upon store size, the season, and consumer preferences in different parts of the country. We are also able to react quickly to changing customer needs because we ship merchandise to our stores multiple times per week. Finally, we coordinate closely with our visual merchandise managers and marketing group in order to manage inventory levels in connection with our promotions and seasonality.
Stores
As of January 30, 2021, we operated 238 stores in 33 states averaging approximately 7,400 square feet per store. Our stores are located in regional mall, off-mall and outlet locations. Our stores generated average net sales of $1.5 million per store, or $202 per square foot, in fiscal 2020. 
The table below shows our number of stores by type of retail center as of the end of each of the last three fiscal years:

Distinctive Store Experience
Tillys is a customer-driven lifestyle brand. We are energized and inspired by our customers’ individuality and passion for an active, outdoor and social lifestyle. Our stores bring these interests together in a vibrant, stimulating and authentic environment that is an extension of our customers’ multitasking lifestyles. We do this by blending the most relevant brands and styles with music videos, product-related visuals, and a dedicated team of store associates. Our associates share the same passion as our customers for action sports, music, art and fashion, enabling them to easily engage with our customers and make shopping at Tillys a fun, social experience. Outside of our stores, we connect with our consumers using the same authentic approach, including social media, community outreach and sponsorship of contests, demos, and other events. We believe the Tillys experience drives customer awareness, loyalty and repeat visits while generating excitement for our brand.
Store Expansion Opportunities and Site Selection
The following table shows the number of stores opened and closed in each of our last five fiscal years:
 
Fiscal Year | StoresOpened | StoresClosed | Total Numberof Stores atEnd of Period
2016 | | | 223 
2017 | 2 | 6 | 219 
2018 | 16 | 6 | 229 
2019 | 14 | 3 | 240 
2020 | 2 | 4 | 238 
 | 37 | 23 | 

We currently expect to open seven new stores during fiscal 2021 which had been originally signed and planned for opening during fiscal 2020. We intend to continue to maintain a disciplined approach to store growth in the future by targeting existing markets with room for growth and new markets with high population density, clustering to build brand awareness. We focus on opening new stores in locations that have above-average incomes and an ability to draw from a sufficient population. We may also close a limited number of stores in any given year based on market conditions, under-performance, or lease negotiations with landlords.
Store Management, Culture and Training 
We believe that a key to our success is our ability to attract, train, retain and motivate qualified employees at all levels of our organization. Each of our stores typically operates with a three to five member store management team. In addition, each store typically has 10 or more full time equivalent store associates who reflect our customers' lifestyles and promote the Tillys brand not only inside the store, but also in their schools and communities. The number of store associates we employ generally increases during peak selling seasons, particularly the back-to-school and the winter holiday seasons, and will increase to the extent that we open new stores.
We have developed a corporate culture that we believe empowers the individual store managers to make store-level business decisions and we reward them when they exceed sales targets. We are committed to improving the skills and careers of our workforce and providing advancement opportunities for employees. We evaluate our store associates weekly on measures such as sales per hour, units per transaction and dollars per transaction to ensure productivity, to recognize top performers and to identify potential training opportunities. We endeavor to design incentive programs for store associates that promote a competitive, yet fun, culture that is consistent with our image.
We provide our managers with the knowledge and tools to succeed through comprehensive training programs, focusing on both operational expertise and supervisory skills. Our training programs and workshops are offered at the store, district and regional levels, allowing managers from multiple locations to interact with each other and exchange ideas to better operate stores. Store associates receive training from their managers to improve their product expertise and selling skills.
We believe Tillys is a place where people have a voice, will be heard, and have bias-free opportunities. Accordingly, our work place is built upon the foundation of equity and inclusion where its people are diverse in their backgrounds, communities, and points of view, yet all share the same core cultural values of working hard, giving back, and empowering others. In this regard, the Company aims to be an inclusive reflection of its customers, employees, and business partners. Pay equity, without regard for race or gender, is a base line component of this focus on equity and inclusion. 
As a result of the pandemic, we have health and safety measures in place and implemented new operating standards and procedures in order to keep employees and customers at all levels of Tillys as safe as possible. For example, we have established safety protocols, limitations on non-essential business travel, and daily health and safety screenings that include temperature checks and health screening questions for every employee upon entry into any of our stores, distribution centers or corporate offices. All employees are provided with personal protective equipment according to their tasks and hygiene conditions. Employees that are not needed on-site, including certain corporate employees, are encouraged to work remotely with additional technical support and resources provided as needed.
E-Commerce
Our e-commerce platform generated total net sales of $173 million during fiscal 2020, or 32.6% of our total net sales. We believe our digital platform is an extension of our brand and retail stores and we seek to maintain an extensive selection of our newest and best merchandise assortments online at any point in time, providing our customers a seamless shopping experience. We believe that our target customer regularly shops online through various digital channels and mobile applications in addition to visiting stores. Our website serves both as a sales channel and a marketing tool to our extended customer base, including those customers in markets where we do not currently have stores. For example, we sell merchandise to customers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia even though we have brick-and-mortar stores in only 33 states. We also believe our fully-integrated digital platform reinforces the Tillys brand image and serves as an effective advertising vehicle for our retail stores. Our digital platform provides substantially the same assortment available in our brick-and-mortar stores, supplemented by additional online-only styles. Similar to the merchandising approach in our stores, we frequently change the look of our website to highlight new brands and products. We utilize multiple tools to drive traffic online, including our catalog, postcards, marketing materials in our retail stores, search engine marketing, online ad placement, shopping site partnerships, third-party affiliations, email marketing, digital marketing and direct mail. In addition, we utilize the website to offer current information on our upcoming events, promotions and store locations.
Marketing and Advertising
Our marketing approach is designed to create an authentic connection with our customers by consistently generating excitement for our brand and the active, outdoor and social lifestyle we represent. We utilize a multi-pronged marketing strategy to connect with our customers and drive traffic to our stores and online platform, comprised of the following:
•Loyalty Program. We have a customer loyalty program wherein customers accumulate points based on purchase activity. Once a loyalty member achieves a certain point level, the member earns awards that may be used towards purchase of merchandise. Once an award is earned, our loyalty program allows customers to redeem their award instantly towards the purchase of merchandise or to continue to build up to additional awards over time. We currently expire unredeemed awards and accumulated partial points 365 days after the last purchase activity. This program is designed to interact with our customers in a more direct and targeted manner, and to provide more insight into their shopping behaviors and 
preferences. We are actively engaging with customers through Tilly's Rewards and offering loyalty members-only events and offerings. We are also using the data and information provided by loyalty members to personalize the experience to the user and improve the communication and offering. We plan to continue to further enhance this program during fiscal 2021. 
•Email Marketing. We utilize email marketing to build awareness, drive traffic to our stores and online platform and to promote local in-store promotions and events. We periodically send emails to the customers in our proprietary database to introduce new brands and products, offer promotions on select merchandise, highlight key events and announce new store openings. We personalize emails and communications to customers and audiences. 
•Digital Marketing. We use digital marketing to drive new customers to Tillys.com and the Tillys stores. We use multiple forms of digital advertising, including Pay Per Click, Display, Retargeting, Social and Affiliate Marketing. We continue to invest in digital marketing to grow our digital business. We are also partnering with brands in co-op marketing to grow awareness and increase brand sales. 
•Social Media. Our customers rely heavily on the opinions of their peers, often expressed through social media. We engage on a variety of social medial platforms to communicate directly with our customers, while allowing customers to interact with one another, and provide feedback on the products they care about and our company. Our influencer strategy, in support of driving brand awareness and growth, is designed to connect customers to key categories, trends, and activities in an authentic way. 
•Brand Partnerships. We partner and collaborate with our vendors for exclusive events such as autograph signings, in-store performances, contests, demos, online marketing, giveaways, shopping sprees and VIP trips. We organize a variety of events, many involving musicians, celebrities and athletes in the entertainment, music and action sports industries. Through brand partnerships such as these, we are able to connect with and engage our customers in an exciting, authentic way.
•Catalog and Postcards. We view our print-format catalog and postcards and our digital-format catalog primarily as sales and marketing tools to drive online and store traffic from both existing and new customers. We also believe our marketing materials reinforce the Tillys brand and showcase our comprehensive selection of products in settings designed to reflect our brand’s lifestyle image. We send these marketing materials, which include coupons that can be redeemed at stores or online, to the customers in our database several times a year, primarily around key shopping periods such as spring break, back-to-school, and the winter holidays.
•Community Outreach. Through our “We Care Program” and in partnership with our vendors, we support and participate in various academic, art, and athletic programs at local schools and other organizations in communities surrounding our stores. We also support Tilly’s Life Center ("TLC"), a non-profit foundation started by our co-founder, Tilly Levine, which provides underprivileged youth a healthy and caring environment to help create a well-defined sense of self, cultivate community mindedness, and release negative emotional stress. We have given our customers the opportunity to support TLC with point-of-sale donations by allowing them to elect to "round up" their purchases to the nearest dollar and donate the rounded up portion to TLC. 
Distribution 
We distribute all of our store merchandise through a 126,000 square foot distribution facility co-located with our headquarters in Irvine, California. Our lease expires in December 2027. Extensive investments have been made to the distribution-center infrastructure, focused around systems automation, material-handling equipment, radio frequency technologies, and automated sorters in order to enhance our processing speed and long term scalability in support of our planned growth.
We also operate a dedicated e-commerce fulfillment center in Irvine, California to handle all e-commerce orders in a highly automated environment that leverages material handling equipment, automated systems and other technologies consistent with our current distribution facility. This infrastructure supports our e-commerce growth initiatives.
We ship merchandise to our stores multiple times per week, providing them with a steady flow of both new and replenishment products. Merchandise is shipped in a floor-ready format (carrying price tickets, sensor tags and with hangers where appropriate) which allows store employees to spend less time processing the merchandise and more time with our customers. We use our own fleet of trucks to transport merchandise to our Southern California stores and third-party distributors to transport merchandise to stores outside of our local area.
We believe our distribution and fulfillment infrastructure can support future growth of our e-commerce platform and additional stores with minimal incremental capital investment.
Information Technology
Our information technology systems provide a full range of business process support and information to our store, merchandising, financial, real estate and other business teams. We selected, customized and integrated our information systems to enable and support our dynamic merchandise model. We believe our systems provide us with improved operational 
efficiencies, scalability, management control and timely reporting that allow us to identify and quickly respond to changes in our business. We believe that our information systems are scalable, flexible and have the capacity to accommodate our current growth plans.
We have recently implemented new point-of-sale, order management, and customer relationship management systems through an end-to-end, cloud-based suite of technology additions, which included a re-platforming of our e-commerce website to a cloud-based, more cost-effective solution. We believe that these enhancements have improved customer engagement, increased sales opportunities, enhanced our real-time inventory visibility and order management, facilitated seamless omni-channel execution integrated across mobile devices and stores, and allowed for effective customer relations management capabilities. We plan to further upgrade our e-commerce platform and mobile application during fiscal 2021.
Competition
The teenage and young adult retail apparel, accessories and footwear industry is highly competitive. We compete with various publicly-traded and privately-held teen-oriented apparel retailers for customers, store locations, store associates and management personnel, including but not limited to Abercrombie & Fitch, Aeropostale, American Eagle Outfitters, The Buckle, Forever 21, Hot Topic, Pacific Sunwear, Urban Outfitters, and Zumiez. In addition, we compete with independent specialty shops, department stores, off-price retailers, online marketplaces such as Amazon, stores and websites operated by our third-party brands and direct marketers that sell similar lines of merchandise and that target customers through catalogs and e-commerce. Further, we may face new competitors and increased competition from existing competitors as we expand into new markets and increase our presence in existing markets. Given the extensive number and types of retailers with which Tillys competes for customers, we believe that our target market is highly fragmented and we do not believe we have a significant share of this market.
Competition in our sector is based, among other things, upon merchandise offerings, store location, price and the ability to identify with the customer. We believe that we compete favorably with many of our competitors based on our differentiated merchandising strategy, store environment, flexible real estate strategy and company culture. However, many of our competitors are larger, have significantly more stores, and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Moreover, we recognize that we do not possess exclusive rights to many of the elements that comprise our in-store experience and product offerings. Our competitors can emulate facets of our business strategy and in-store experience, which could result in a reduction of any competitive advantage or special appeal that we might possess. For more details, see Item 1A. “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business. We face intense competition in our industry and we may not be able to compete effectively.”

Employees
As of January 30, 2021, we employed approximately 1,400 full-time and approximately 3,700 part-time employees, of which approximately 450 were employed at our corporate office and distribution facilities and approximately 4,650 were employed at our store locations. However, the number of total employees, especially part-time employees, fluctuates depending upon our seasonal needs and, in fiscal 2020, varied between approximately 3,600 and 6,700 employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union and we consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
Government Regulation
We are subject to labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising and promotions, privacy laws, safety regulations, consumer protection regulations, intellectual property laws, and other laws that regulate retailers and govern the promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of stores and warehouse facilities, as well as laws governing public companies. We monitor changes in these laws and believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws.
Insurance
We use insurance to address or reduce our exposure to actual or potential enterprise risks, including but not limited to workers’ compensation claims, property damage or loss, directors' and officers' liability, cyber/data security risks, fiduciary liability, general liability claims, automobile liability, employment practices liability, and employee-related health care, a portion of which is paid by the employees. We evaluate our insurance requirements on an ongoing basis to maintain what we believe to be adequate levels of coverage for these risks.
Seasonality
Due to the seasonal nature of the retail industry, we have historically experienced and expect to continue to experience fluctuations in our revenues and net income. Net revenues are typically smallest in the first quarter and largest during the fourth quarter of a given fiscal year. Our net sales fluctuate significantly in relation to various holidays and other peak shopping periods, including but not limited to the Thanksgiving and year-end holiday season, the back-to-school season, spring break periods, and other holidays. If, for any reason, our revenues were below seasonal norms or expectations during these quarters, particularly during peak selling periods, our annual results of operations could be adversely affected. The level of our working capital reflects the seasonality of our business. We expect inventory levels, along with an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses, generally to reach their highest levels in anticipation of the increased revenues during these periods.
