Addentax Group Corp. was incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 28, 2014. We were originally incorporated to produce images on multiple surfaces, such as glass, leather, plastic, ceramic, textile, and others using a 3D sublimation vacuum heat transfer machine. We no longer pursue opportunities related to 3D printing positioning.
 
We have a fiscal year-end of March 31. The business office is located at Kingkey 100, Block A, Room 5403, Luohu District, Shenzhen City, China 518000. Our telephone number is +(86) 755 8233 0336.
 
Current Business
 
Effective December 28, 2016, Addentax Group Corp. (“ATXG” or the “Company”) executed a Sale & Purchase Agreement (“S&P”) for the acquisition of 100% of the shares of Yingxi Industrial Chain Group Co., Ltd. (“YICG”), a company incorporated under the laws of the Republic of Seychelles. Pursuant to the S&P, the Company agreed to issue five hundred million (500,000,000) restricted common shares of the company to the owners of YICG.
 
After the completion of the S&P, YICG’s business became our business. We are a garment manufacturer and logistics service provider based in China. We are listed on the OTCQB under the symbol of “ATXG”. We classify our businesses into four segments: garment manufacturing, logistics services, property management and subleasing, and epidemic prevention supplies.
 
Our garment manufacturing business consists of sales made principally to wholesaler located in the People’s Republic of China (“PRC”). We have our own manufacturing facilities, with sufficient production capacity and skilled workers on production lines to ensure that we meet our high quality control standards and timely meet the delivery requirements for our customers. We conduct our garment manufacturing operations through four-wholly owned subsidiaries, namely Dongguan Heng Sheng Wei Garments Co., Ltd (“HSW”), Dongguan Yushang Clothing Co., Ltd (“YS”), Shantou Yi Bai Yi Garment Co., Ltd (“YBY”), and Shantou Chenghai Dai Tou Garments Co., Ltd (“DT”), which are located in the Guangdong province, China. In October, the Company disposed of DT to a third party at fair value, which was also its carrying value as of September 30, 2020.
 
Our logistics business consists of delivery and courier services covering approximately seven provinces in China. Although we have our own motor vehicles and drivers, we currently outsource some of the business to our contractors. We believe outsourcing allows us to maximize our capacity and maintain flexibility while reducing capital expenditures and the costs of keeping drivers during slow seasons. We conduct our logistic operations through three wholly owned subsidiaries, namely Shenzhen Xin Kuai Jie Transportation Co., Ltd (“XKJ”), Shenzhen Hua Peng Fa Logistic Co., Ltd (“HPF”), and Shenzhen Yingxi Peng Fa Logistic Co., Ltd (“PF”) which are located in the Guangdong province, China. In November, the Company disposed of HPF to a third party at fair value, which was also its carrying value as of November 30, 2020.
 
The business operations, customers and suppliers of DT and HPF were retained by the Company; therefore, the disposition of the two subsidiaries did not qualify as discontinued operations.
 
Our property management and subleasing business provides shops subleasing and property management services for garment wholesalers and retailers in garment market. We conduct our property management and subleasing operation through a wholly owned subsidiary, namely Dongguan Yingxi Daying Commercial Co., Ltd (“DY”).
 
Our epidemic prevention supplies business consists of manufacturing and distribution of epidemic prevention products and reselling of epidemic prevention supplies purchased from third parties in both domestic and overseas markets. We conduct our manufacturing of the epidemic prevention products in YS. We conduct the trading of epidemic prevention suppliers through Addentax Group Corp. (“ATXG”) and Shenzhen Qianhai Yingxi Industrial Chain Services Co., Ltd (“YX”), an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.

Competitive Strengths
 
We believe we have the following competitive strengths:
 
Cost-effective production. We have adopted a vertical integration production process. We produce garments in our own production facilities and employ our in-house transport teams to deliver garments to our customers. This one-stop service optimizes production efficiency and saves costs by lowering the cost per unit, thereby achieving economies of scale.
 
Stringent quality control process. As of March 31, 2021, we had seven employees in the production department that are responsible for conducting our quality control process. We implement a stringent quality control process which monitors various stages of our garment manufacturing business, including sampling checks of semi-finished products and finished products. We prepare inspection reports to address the quality problems and make recommendations to improve the quality of our products. During final product inspection, we pay special attention to the measurements, workmanship, ironing and packaging of our products to help best ensure that the quality of our products comply with the specifications, standards and requirements of our customers.
 
Strong design capabilities. Our design team works closely with our customers to understand their needs and make recommendations to them. Our design team also conducts market research and attends industry exhibitions to understand the latest market trends. As of March 31, 2021, our design team consisted of five members.
 
Extensive delivery network. Our logistics business has nine routes and covers 79 cities in seven provinces and two municipalities in the PRC.
 
Stable Production Supply Chain. We integrated various epidemic prevention suppliers located in China & Malaysia and established strategic cooperation relationship with them, which can help us to purchase the epidemic prevention products in competitive lower price and stable supply. We also received mask production license from relevant governance and some of the products we manufactured passed the inspection of quality inspection agency.


Business Strategies
 
Key elements of our business and growth strategies include the following:
 
Sales of raw materials. We intend to enter into exclusive agreements with textile and garment suppliers in Southeast China to be their exclusive agent and supply their textiles and garments to our customers. To execute this plan, we intend to set up several retailers for the sales of textiles and garments to retail customers and supply the textiles and garments exclusively to various high-end fashion brands.
 
Development of our own brands. We intend to develop our own brands that focus on fast fashion with teenagers being our primary target customers. We plan to adopt a low-cost strategy at the early stage and improve the quality of our products after increasing our market share. We are in the process of registering a trademark for our own brand and intend to start our advertising campaign after the registration of this trademark. We plan to distribute our products in different channels, including our own retailers, co-operative retailers and franchisees.
 
Expand our delivery network. As of March 31, 2021, we provided logistics services to over 79 cities in seven provinces and two municipalities in the PRC. We plan to open our logistics points in 20 more cities in the PRC in the third and fourth quarters of 2021.
 
Develop international logistics services and warehousing services. We intend to develop international logistics services for customers located all over the world and international warehousing services.
 
Development of international trading. We developed our international trading during the global epidemic situation of Covid-19 to import and export diverse epidemic protection products including medical masks, latex gloves etc.
 
Develop E-commerce business. We integrated resources in shopping mall, intend to develop e-commerce bases and the internet celebrity economy together to drive to increase the value of the stores in the area.

According to PRC regulations, we must participate in various employee social security plans organized by local governments, including pension, unemployment insurance, childbirth insurance, work-related injury insurance, medical insurance and housing insurance.

We believe that we maintain a good working relationship with our employees, and to date we have not experienced any significant labor disputes.
 
Government Regulations
 
Currently, apart from customary business laws and regulations, the PRC government does not regulate the garment manufacturing business and logistics business. The PRC government may, however, from time to time institute rules and regulations on such businesses which makes it difficult or impossible for us to operate successfully, if at all, in the PRC. Please see the section on “Risk Factors” for further details.
