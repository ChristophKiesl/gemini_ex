Item 1. Business
Apria 
We are a leading provider of integrated home healthcare equipment and related services in the United States. We offer a comprehensive range of products and services for in-home care and delivery across three core service lines: (1) home respiratory therapy (including home oxygen and non-invasive ventilation (“NIV”) services); (2) obstructive sleep apnea (“OSA”) treatment (including continuous positive airway pressure (“CPAP”) and bi-level positive airway pressure devices, and patient support services); and (3) negative pressure wound therapy (“NPWT”). Additionally, we supply a wide range of home medical equipment and other products and services to help improve the quality of life for patients with home care needs. Our revenues are generated through fee-for-service and capitation arrangements with Payors for equipment, supplies, services and other items we rent or sell to patients. Through our offerings, we also provide patients with a variety of clinical and administrative support services and related products and supplies, most of which are prescribed by a physician as part of a care plan. We are focused on being the industry’s highest-quality provider of home healthcare equipment and related services, while maintaining our commitment to being a low-cost operator. We offer a compelling value proposition to patients, providers and Payors by allowing patients to receive necessary care and services in the comfort of their own home, while, at the same time, reducing the costs of treatment. We generated over $1.1 billion of net revenue in 2021, of which approximately 83% was from home respiratory therapy and OSA treatment, service categories in which we believe we have a leading market position.
We believe our integrated product and service offerings, combined with our national scale and strong reputation, provide us with a strategic advantage in being a preferred home healthcare provider for patients, providers and Payors. Our Payors include substantially all of the national and regional insurers, managed care organizations and government Payors in the United States. We benefit from long-standing relationships with a community of providers and referral sources for post-acute services across the acuity spectrum because of the consistency and reliability of our high quality clinical support, our national distribution footprint and our breadth of Payor relationships.

Our product and service offerings are distinguished by the complexity and sophistication required in their clinical delivery, logistical coordination and payment arrangements. We offer patients and providers differentiated clinical service, leveraging our protocols and expertise to improve outcomes across our service lines. With an expansive network of delivery technicians and therapists that is not readily replicated, we are able to provide home healthcare therapies that require high-touch service, providing a bridge from the acute care setting to the home. In 2021, we served over 2 million patients, made over 2.4 million deliveries and conducted approximately 736,000 clinician interactions with our patients.
Pending Merger with Owens & Minor Inc. (“Owens & Minor”)
On January 7, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”) with Owens & Minor under which Owens & Minor will acquire Apria for $37.50 in cash per share of common stock, representing an equity value of approximately $1.45 billion, as well as the assumption of debt and cash for a total transaction value of approximately $1.6 billion. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions and other regulatory approvals and the approval of our stockholders and is expected to close during the first half of 2022. See further discussion at Note 13 – Subsequent Event in our audited financial statements. and “Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Related to Proposed Merger – The failure to complete the transaction announced on January 7, 2022 in a timely manner or at all could negatively impact the market price of our common stock, as well as our future business and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.”
Service Lines 
Our business activities comprise a single operating segment focused on three core service lines: (1) home respiratory therapy (including oxygen and NIV services); (2) OSA treatment (including CPAP and bi-level positive airway pressure devices, and patient support services); and (3) NPWT. Additionally, we supply a wide range of home medical equipment, other products and services to help improve the quality of life for patients with home care needs. Through 

6



our offerings, we also provide a broad range of home healthcare products and services, and provide patients with a variety of clinical and administrative support services and supplies, most of which are prescribed by a physician as part of a care plan. We provide substantial benefits to both patients and Payors by allowing patients to receive necessary care and services in the comfort of their own home while reducing the cost of treatment. Our services include:

● | providing in-home delivery, set-up and maintenance of equipment and/or supplies;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | educating patients and caregivers about health conditions or illnesses and providing instructions about home safety, self-care and the proper use of equipment;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | monitoring therapy compliance and intervening to enhance compliance;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | clinical monitoring of complex respiratory service patients’ individualized treatment plans;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reporting patient progress and status to the physician, national and regional insurers and/or managed care organizations; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | processing claims to Payors on behalf of patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------

The following table sets forth a summary of total net revenues by service line, expressed as percentages of total net revenues:
​

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
-----------------------------+---+-------------------------+---+------+------+------+---+------+--
​ | ​ | Year Ended December 31,
​ | | 2021 | ​ | 2020 | ​ | 2019
Home respiratory therapy | | 40.8 | % | ​ | 40.9 | % | ​ | 40.0 | %
OSA treatment | | 41.9 | | ​ | 41.0 | | ​ | 40.3 | ​

Other equipment and services | | 13.8 | | ​ | 14.2 | | ​ | 15.8 | ​
Total | | 100 | % | ​ | 100 | % | ​ | 100 | %

​
Home Respiratory Therapy. $467.4 million, $453.8 million and $435.7 million, or 40.8%, 40.9% and 40.0%, of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We are one of the largest providers of home respiratory therapies in the United States, which includes the supply of stationary and portable home oxygen equipment and non-invasive ventilators. Our distribution model allows our respiratory care practitioners to educate, on a timely and efficient basis, newly-diagnosed patients about their condition, the equipment their physician has prescribed for them, and the long-term importance of complying with the physician’s order. Our services offer a compelling relative cost advantage to our patients and Payors. Patients utilize our products to treat a variety of conditions, including chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis (collectively, the third leading cause of death in the United States), neuromuscular disorders and restrictive thoracic disorder.
We employ a nationwide clinical staff of approximately 410 respiratory care professionals, including home respiratory therapists who perform patient assessments and set-ups for highly complex clinical equipment, and provide direct patient care, monitoring and 24-hour support services under physician-directed treatment plans and in accordance with our proprietary program.
OSA Treatment. $480.2 million, $454.4 million and $438.6 million, or 41.9%, 41.0% and 40.3%, of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We are one of the largest providers of OSA therapy devices, including CPAP and bi-level positive airway pressure devices, and patient support services in the United States. The incidence and diagnosis of OSA continues to increase in the United States. We believe that the strength of our position in this market is partly due to our significant presence in 

7



the commercial Payor market, since the initial diagnosis of OSA typically occurs among adults between the ages of 35 and 65 rather than the population served by Medicare. To manage our significant new and recurring patient volumes in a cost-effective, clinically sound manner, we developed an innovative care model, which includes initial delivery and instructional services, an ongoing customer service relationship, and offering sleep supplies to patients for convenience purposes and continuing to provide such supplies to the patients into the future. We believe that an increasing focus on our user-friendly e-commerce platform will help contribute to this provision of sleep supplies. In addition, we operate a comprehensive patient compliance model to ensure that commercially insured patients and Medicare beneficiaries adhere to their therapy according to their physician’s prescription and the established guidelines for reimbursement, and a Payor compliance and monitoring model. The patient compliance model includes both one-on-one patient education and teaching performed in group settings, as well as remote monitoring technologies.
NPWT. $40.5 million, $43.0 million and $42.1 million, or 3.5%, 3.9% and 3.9%, of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We provide NPWT pumps, supplies, and the dressings needed for patients’ individualized therapy. The most common types of wounds treated with NPWT are pressure ulcers, diabetic ulcers, post-surgical wounds, burns or other wounds developed as a result of traumatic injury. Our strength comes from partnering with manufacturers who are proven leaders in wound care to provide state-of-the-art pumps, supplies and dressings with an individualized patient care model to help promote wound healing while minimizing dressing-related pain and trauma. In order to facilitate a streamlined care transition, we leverage our national distribution network to deliver the initial kit either before the patient is transitioned from the hospital or shortly after they return home. We continue to provide supplies to the patient to ensure continuity in therapy as prescribed by their physician. This service integrates well with our goal of being the home healthcare provider that helps transition patients from the hospital setting to home healthcare.
Other Equipment and Services. $157.2 million, $157.5 million and $172.5 million, or 13.7%, 14.2% and 15.8%, of our net revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
In addition to the core services described above, we also supply a wide range of home medical equipment, other respiratory services and other products to help improve the quality of life for patients with home care needs. Our integrated service approach allows patients, hospital and physician referral sources and managed care organizations accessing any of our service offerings to also access needed home medical equipment and other respiratory services through a single source. The use of home medical equipment provides a significant relative cost advantage to our patients and Payors.
Patients and Payors
Patients and Payors rely on the equipment and high quality services that we provide in managing patients with chronic conditions.
Patients. In contrast to many healthcare services which are single transaction in nature, Apria develops long-term relationships with its patients through the provision of recurring services over time to treat chronic conditions. Home healthcare patients are generally diagnosed at a point in their disease progression where the proper use of durable medical equipment allows them to manage their diseases at home over an extended period of time. For respiratory therapy and OSA treatment, these therapies are often provided for multiple years, during which time Apria provides continued equipment servicing and certain supplies, such as sleep supplies, used in conjunction with the equipment. While the length of care for NPWT is normally shorter in duration, it is typically longer than one month and often extends for multiple months. In addition to providing equipment and ongoing service, Apria also bills and collects payments from the Payor source, on behalf of the patients. Starting at the patient’s initial admission and extending through the length of service, Apria collects the necessary paperwork and information needed for reimbursement from the patient’s Payor source. In order to meet any established utilization management guidelines required for ongoing reimbursement, Apria also coordinates with the patient and their Payor throughout the patient’s time as a customer.
Commercial Payors. National and regional insurers and managed care organizations continue to represent a significant portion of our business and we have long-standing relationships with most of the commercial Payors that we 

8



contract with. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 78% of our revenue was from commercial Payors (which includes all Payors other than government Payors), including approximately 24% from Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. One additional third-party Payor accounts for more than 10% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. Most of our commercial Payor contracts have two to five year terms with an automatic extension unless it otherwise terminates. Most of our commercial Payor contracts are based on price – we generally do not have contracted volume. We believe that our long-term relationships with national and regional insurers and managed care organizations provides considerable stability to our business. We have more than 1,600 agreements in place with various commercial Payors, from large nationals to regional and local Payors. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 59% of our revenues were from commercial Payors with whom we have been contracted for over 20 years.

Medicare. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 21% of our revenue was from servicing patients with traditional Medicare coverage. While in previous rounds of the DMEPOS CBP we had CBP contracts in many of the competitive bidding areas (“CBAs”), in recent years, we have reduced our reliance on Medicare business in response to the expansion of the DMEPOS CBP. CMS made a number of improvements when implementing the latest round of the DMEPOS CBP, beginning on January 1, 2021 (“Round 2021”). Round 2021 was originally expected to include a number of products in our product lines. However, CMS announced on October 27, 2020 that only two out of the original 16 product categories would be included in Round 2021 of the DMEPOS CBP. Accordingly, none of our products will be subject to the DMEPOS CBP for the three-year period in which Round 2021 is in effect, and we are not restricted from supplying our products in any regions of the country during this period. Nonetheless, we have maintained critical mass with traditional Medicare to maintain flexibility and growth.
Sales and Marketing 
Our sales and marketing strategy is tailored around our Payors and referral sources. In order to effectively serve our Payors and referral sources, we have a managed care sales team and a field sales team. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 26 managed care sales professionals whose primary responsibilities are to build and maintain existing referral relationships with Payors and negotiate Payor pricing and contract terms. We also employed approximately 330 sales professionals whose primary responsibilities are to obtain new referrals and to maintain existing referral relationships for all of our service lines. We provide our sales professionals with the necessary clinical and technical training to represent our service offerings. Our sales structure and strategies are designed to adapt to changing market factors and will continue to adjust as further changes in the industry occur. While in most cases the ultimate referral decision is made by an individual referral source, our relationships with commercial Payors are important to ensure broad market access given that most of our patients are their members.
Marketing Initiatives. We have developed and put into practice several marketing initiatives to enhance the attractiveness of our service offerings, including:

● | Comprehensive, Patient-Centric Clinical and Therapy Management Programs. We offer a number of clinical management programs, such as Premium Care SleepTM, which are designed to help improve patients’ quality of life and clinical outcomes, and to reduce costs for providers and Payors through reduced hospital and emergency admissions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Patient Satisfaction and Complaint Resolution Process. We have a centralized patient satisfaction survey function that periodically conducts patient surveys and targeted member satisfaction studies for key national and regional insurers and managed care organizations as specified by various contractual arrangements. We also have a centralized team that administers a portal where patients’ complaints can be addressed. This team routes patient complaints to specific subject matter experts throughout the Company to resolve complaints. This process has enriched our data collection and analysis which is used to better manage resolutions and capture trends, allowing us to focus our improvement efforts. We believe that both centralized processes afford us visibility to centralized performance improvement data and trends that enable us to amend policies and procedures as necessary to meet the needs of patients.

Organization and Operations 
Organization. Our approximately 6,400 employees deliver home healthcare products and services to patients in their homes and to other care sites with the support of our approximately 280 branch locations, six regional distribution and repair centers, consolidated billing team, delivery fleet and qualified delivery professionals and clinical employees. Our home respiratory therapy, OSA treatment, NPWT and other equipment and service lines are organized into geographic divisions and markets that provide management oversight.
Corporate Compliance. As a leader in the home healthcare industry, we have a robust compliance program that is designed to further our commitment to providing quality home healthcare products and services while maintaining high standards of ethical and legal conduct. Our enterprise-wide corporate compliance program applies to all operating divisions and is grounded in existing laws, rules and regulations and guidelines for healthcare organizations issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS OIG”) and the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”). We believe that it is essential to operate our business with integrity and in full compliance with applicable laws. Our corporate compliance program is headed by an experienced corporate compliance officer who reports directly to the board of directors and our Chief Executive Officer. The program also includes a written code of ethical business conduct that employees receive as part of their initial orientation process and which management reviews with employees under their supervision through a periodic review and attestation process. The program is designed to accomplish the goals described above through employee education, a confidential disclosure program, written policy guidelines, excluded parties, checks, periodic reviews, frequent reinforcement, compliance audits, a formal disciplinary component and other programs. Compliance oversight is provided by our corporate compliance committee, which meets quarterly and consists of senior and mid-level management personnel from various functional disciplines. In addition to updates provided to the board of directors during its regular meetings, a written compliance program report is submitted annually to the board of directors for review and discussion. On December 18, 2020, a federal judge approved a civil and administrative settlement we entered into with the United States and certain state Medicaid programs. As part of the settlement, we also entered into a five-year Corporate Integrity Agreement (“CIA”) with the HHS OIG, under which we agreed to undertake certain obligations designed to promote compliance with federal healthcare programs. In addition, we entered into settlements to resolve claims brought under the laws of the states of California and Illinois on behalf of private insurers. 
Operating Systems and Controls. Our operating and field information operating systems, policies and procedures for proper contract administration, accurate order entry and pricing, billing and collections, and inventory and patient equipment management enable us to monitor operational performance. Our information services department works closely with all of the operating areas of our business to ensure that our information technology policies, procedures and functions are compliant with government regulations and Payor requirements and to support their business improvement initiatives with technological solutions.
We have established performance indicators which measure operating results against expected thresholds for the purpose of allowing all levels of management to identify and modify areas requiring improvement and to monitor the resulting progress. Operating models with strategic targets have been developed to move us toward more effective management of the sales, customer service, accounts receivable, clinical and distribution areas of our business.
Receivables Management. We operate in an environment with complex requirements governing billing and reimbursement for our products and services. We have ongoing initiatives focused specifically on accounts receivables management such as system enhancements, process refinements and organizational changes.
We are continuing to expand our use of technology in areas such as web portals/electronic ordering, electronic claims submission and electronic funds transfer with managed care organizations to more efficiently process business transactions. This use of technology can improve the initial patient admission process, expedite claims processing and reduce the administrative costs associated with this activity for both us and our providers and Payors. We now submit almost all of our home respiratory and other equipment and services claims electronically. We have also developed and are continuing to develop internal expertise with the unique reimbursement requirements of certain large Payors and continue to negotiate simplifications in the claims submission process in an effort to reduce subsequent denials and shorten related collection periods. Our policy is to collect co-payments from the patient or applicable secondary Payor. In the absence of a secondary Payor, we generally require the co-payment at the time the patient is initially established 

10



with the product/service. Subsequent months’ co-payments are billed to the patient. We are also seeking to streamline related processes in order to improve the co-payment collection and initial claim denial rates. Certain accounts receivable administrative functions continue to be administered by third-party providers while others have been incorporated into our existing customer service and billing centers. We have established policies and procedures and provide training for all contracted service providers to perform effectively on our behalf.
Suppliers. Virtually all products used in our business are purchased from third parties. We have a number of key supplier relationships.
We believe that we are not wholly dependent upon any single product supplier and that our product needs can be met by several similar suppliers if any one supplier became unable to continue our current business relationship. Our sourcing strategy leverages relationships with industry-leading suppliers but maintains competition and standardization that allows us to source from any supplier in a given category. However, a change in suppliers could cause delays in service delivery. In June 2021, one of the Company’s suppliers, Philips Respironics, announced a voluntary recall for continuous and non-continuous ventilators (certain CPAP, BiLevel positive airway pressure and ventilator devices) related to polyurethane foam used in those devices. The Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) has since identified this as a Class I recall, the most serious category of recall. We have since onboarded another supplier to help meet our equipment needs.
Nationwide Accreditation. All of our operations, including our branch locations, are accredited by The Joint Commission. As the home healthcare industry has grown, accreditation has become a mandatory requirement for Medicare DMEPOS providers and the need for objective quality measurements has increased. Accreditation by The Joint Commission entails a lengthy voluntary review process that is conducted every three years. Accreditation is also widely considered a prerequisite for entering into contracts with managed care organizations.
Essential Care Model. We have developed the Essential Care Model, a proprietary model that outlines Apria’s product formulary and defines the base-line levels of services, supplies and products offered in conjunction with key prescribed home healthcare equipment and therapies. The Essential Care Model is used to establish consistent and clear base-line expectations for patients, providers and Payors.
Outsourced Activities
We engage third-party providers for certain billing, collections, administrative and information systems and other services. As part of our outsourcing strategy, we seek to minimize the risk of business disruption by contracting with multiple vendors across multiple locations.
Competition
The segment of the healthcare market in which we operate is highly fragmented and highly competitive. In each of our service lines there are a limited number of national providers and numerous regional and local providers. Ultimately, our services are provided to an individual patient that is usually referred to Apria by a third-party healthcare professional. The competitive factors most important in the referral process are: reputation with referral sources, including local physicians and hospital-based professionals; accessibility and an efficient, responsive referral process; speed and quality of services; overall ease of doing business; quality of patient care and associated services; range of home healthcare products and services; and being an in-network provider for the commercial Payor(s) specific to an individual patient.
We compete with other large national providers, including Lincare Holdings, Inc., AdaptHealth, Rotech and Aerocare. Other types of healthcare providers, including individual hospitals and hospital systems, physicians and physician groups, home healthcare agencies, health maintenance organizations and managed services intermediaries have entered and may continue to enter the market to compete with our various service lines.

11



Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive government regulation, including numerous federal, state and local laws directed at regulating reimbursement of our products and services under various government programs and preventing fraud and abuse, as more fully described below. We maintain certain safeguards intended to reduce the likelihood that we will engage in conduct or enter into arrangements in violation of these restrictions. Legal department personnel review and approve written contracts, such as agreements with physicians, subject to these laws. We also maintain various educational and audit programs designed to keep our managers and employees updated and informed regarding developments on these topics and to reinforce to employees our policy of strict compliance in this area. Notwithstanding these measures, violations of these laws and regulations may still occur, which could subject us to civil and criminal enforcement actions; licensure revocation, suspension, or non-renewal; severe fines and penalties; the repayment of amounts previously paid to us; and even the termination of our ability to provide services under certain government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors— Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation — Reductions in Medicare, Medicaid and commercial Payor reimbursement rates and/or exclusion from markets or product lines, including due to the DMEPOS CBP, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.”
Medicare and Medicaid Revenues. For the year ended December 31, 2021, approximately 21% and 1% of our net revenues were reimbursed under arrangements with Medicare and state Medicaid programs, respectively. Contracts with two national payors each represented more than 10% of the Company's total net revenues constituting 24% and 11% of total net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021. Kaiser Foundation Health Plan, Inc. represented approximately 24% of our revenues during the period. The majority of our revenues are derived from rental income on equipment rented and related services provided to patients, and the sales of equipment, supplies and other items we sell to patients for patient care under fee-for-service arrangements.
Medicare Reimbursement. There are a number of historic and ongoing legislative and regulatory activities in Congress and at CMS that affect or may affect Medicare reimbursement policies for products and services we provide. Specifically, a number of important legislative changes that affect our business were included in the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “MMA”), the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 (the “DRA”) and the Medicare Improvements for Patients & Providers Act of 2008 (the “MIPPA”). The MMA, DRA and MIPPA and their implementing regulations and guidelines contain numerous provisions that were significant to us when enacted and continue to have an impact on our operations today, as described below. In addition, more recent legislative changes that will have an ongoing effect on our business were included in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (the “PPACA”), the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (the “MACRA”), the 21st Century Cures Act and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the “BBA”).
DMEPOS Competitive Bidding. A significant regulatory activity affecting Medicare reimbursement is the DMEPOS CBP, which was mandated by Congress through the MMA. The DMEPOS CBP impacts the Medicare reimbursement amounts for suppliers of certain DMEPOS items, and in the past, included some DMEPOS items that we provide to our patients. Cumulatively, in previous competition rounds of the DMEPOS CBP in effect between 2011 and 2018, we were offered contracts for a substantial majority of the CBAs and product categories for which we submitted bids for oxygen, CPAP and NPWT.
In general, when a DMEPOS CBP competition round becomes effective in a CBA, beneficiaries under the Medicare fee-for-service program must obtain competitively bid DMEPOS items from a contract supplier. However, suppliers who are not awarded contracts through a DMEPOS CBP competition round, but who are furnishing competitively bid DMEPOS items at the time a DMEPOS CBP competition round begins, may continue furnishing certain items to beneficiaries if the supplier chooses to become a “grandfathered” supplier. 
In January 2017, CMS announced plans to consolidate all rounds and areas of the DMEPOS CBP into a single round of competition that would go into effect on January 1, 2019 in 141 CBAs for 11 product categories. However, CMS subsequently rescinded the originally published guidance. In March 2019, CMS announced that it would consolidate all rounds and areas of the DMEPOS CBP into a single round of competition that would not go into effect until January 1, 2021 (“Round 2021”). From January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020, there was a temporary gap in 

12



the DMEPOS CBP. During that time, any Medicare-enrolled DMEPOS supplier was able to furnish DMEPOS equipment and services in all areas of the country.
Round 2021 contracts became effective January 1, 2021 and are expected to extend through December 31, 2023. For each CBA included in Round 2021, providers submitted bids in September 2019 to CMS offering to supply certain covered items of DME in the CBA at certain prices. A number of products in our product lines originally were included on the list of products subject to Round 2021, including oxygen and oxygen equipment, CPAP devices and RADs, nebulizers and NPWT pumps. Although NIVs were originally included in the list of products subject to Round 2021, on April 9, 2020, CMS announced that the NIV product category was removed from Round 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. By removing NIVs from Round 2021, any Medicare-enrolled DMEPOS supplier can furnish any of the types of ventilators covered under the Medicare program. On October 27, 2020, CMS announced further revisions to Round 2021 of the DMEPOS CBP. Namely, only two out of the original 16 product categories, off-the-shelf (“OTS”) back braces and OTS knee braces, were included in Round 2021 of the DMEPOS CBP. All other product categories were removed from Round 2021. Accordingly, there are no longer any products in our product lines included on the list of products subject to Round 2021 of the DMEPOS CBP.
Competitive bidding contracts are expected to be re-bid at least every three years. Although none of our products are subject to Round 2021 of the DMEPOS CBP, we cannot guarantee that our products will be excluded from any subsequent rounds of the DMEPOS CBP. Our exclusion from certain markets or product lines could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Further, the competitive bidding process has historically put downward pressure on the amount we are reimbursed in the markets in which we operate, as well as in areas that are not subject to the DMEPOS CBP. The rates required to win future competitive bids could continue to depress reimbursement rates. While we cannot predict the outcome of the DMEPOS CBP on our business in the future nor the Medicare payment rates that will be in effect in future years for the items subjected to competitive bidding, the program may materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.
Medicare Fee Schedule for DMEPOS and CPI Adjustments. DMEPOS items that are not subject to the CBP are paid for under the Medicare DMEPOS fee schedule. The fee schedule amounts are calculated on a statewide basis. Further, the fee schedule amounts are updated annually by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (“CPI-U”) and adjusted by the change in economy-wide productivity that is equal to the 10-year moving average of changes in the annual economy-wide private non-farm business Multi-Factor Productivity (“MFP”). For 2022, the CPI-U percentage increase is 5.4% and the MFP adjustment is 0.3%, resulting in a net increase of 5.1% for the update factor that is applied to the DMEPOS fee schedule amounts.
Effective January 1, 2016, DMEPOS items that are subject to CBP but furnished in all non-CBAs have experienced reductions in the Medicare DMEPOS fee schedule. The fee schedules for those items in the non-CBAs have been adjusted based on regional averages of the single payment amounts (“SPAs”) that apply to the DMEPOS CBP (referred to as the “Adjusted Fee Schedule”). Fee schedule amounts that are adjusted using information from the DMEPOS CBP are not subject to the annual CPI-U adjustments discussed above, but are updated when information from the DMEPOS CBP is updated.
The 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in December 2016, included a provision to roll back the full application of the Adjusted Fee Schedule amount to the non-CBAs that was in effect from July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. Effective from January 1, 2017, non-CBA rates were set at 100% of the Adjusted Fee Schedule amount, based on the regional competitive bidding rates. In May 2018, CMS issued an interim final rule that resumed the transition period for phasing in adjustments to the Adjusted Fee Schedule amount in rural areas and non-contiguous areas (Alaska, Hawaii and U.S. territories) not subject to the DMEPOS CBP from June 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018. For this 7-month time period, DMEPOS items furnished in rural and non-contiguous areas were paid for based on a blended rate of 50% of the non-Adjusted Fee Schedule amount and 50% of the Adjusted Fee Schedule amount. “Other non-CBAs” (i.e., those that are not defined as rural or non-contiguous) were not impacted by this interim final rule and DMEPOS items furnished in these areas were paid at 100% of the Adjusted Fee Schedule amount.
During the temporary gap in the DMEPOS CBP, from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2020, CMS established separate fee schedule adjustment methodologies for three geographic areas: (1) other non-CBAs (those that

are not defined as rural or non-contiguous), (2) rural/non-contiguous areas, and (3) former CBAs. In the “other non-CBAs” category, the payment amounts for DMEPOS items have been adjusted based on 100% of the Adjusted Fee Schedule amount. Because the SPAs generated from the DMEPOS CBP competitions expired on January 1, 2019, the Adjusted Fee Schedule amount has been increased each year by the percentage change in the CPI-U for the 12-month period ending June 30 of the year prior to the update going into effect. Accordingly, the Adjusted Fee Schedule was increased by 1.6% for 2020, by 0.6% for 2021, and by 5.4% for 2022. In rural/non-contiguous areas, the payment amounts for DMEPOS items are based on a blended rate of 50% of the non-Adjusted Fee Schedule amount and 50% of the Adjusted Fee Schedule amount. The Adjusted Fee Schedule amount of the blended rate also has been increased each year, by 1.6% for 2020, by 0.6% for 2021, and by 5.4% for 2022. In former CBAs, the payment amounts for DMEPOS items are based on the lower of the supplier’s charge for the item or fee schedule amounts that are based on the SPAs that were in effect in the CBA before the CBP contract ended, increased by the projected percentage change in the CPI-U for the 12-month period on the date after the contract period ended. Accordingly, for 2019, the fee schedule amounts were based on the SPAs in effect on December 31, 2018 for each specific CBA, increased by 2.5%; for 2020, the fee schedule amounts were increased by 2.4%; for 2021, the fee schedule amounts were increased by 0.6%; and for 2022, the fee schedule amounts were increased by 5%. 
In addition, for items provided in CBAs that were included in Round 2021, but were not awarded contracts, the 2022 fee schedule amounts were increased by 5% (the projected percentage change in the CPI-U for the 12-month period ending January 1, 2022). 
For items provided in CBAs that were included in Round 2021, but were not awarded contracts, the 2022 fee schedule amounts were increased by 5% (the projected percentage change in the CPI-U for the 12-month period ending January 1, 2022). 
The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (“CARES”) Act introduced a new blended rate for DMEPOS items furnished in “other non-CBAs” that is based on 25% of the non-Adjusted Fee Schedule amount and 75% of the Adjusted Fee Schedule amount, effective March 6, 2020 through the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. For rural/non-contiguous areas, the payment amount for DMEPOS items will continue to be based on a blended rate of 50% of the non-Adjusted Fee Schedule amount and 50% of the Adjusted Fee Schedule amount until December 31, 2020 or the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, whichever is later. The COVID-19 pandemic has not ended yet, and therefore the payment adjustments required by the CARES Act are still in effect.
In December 2021, CMS issued a final rule establishing methodologies for adjusting the fee schedule payment amounts for DMEPOS items furnished in non-CBAs, effective February 28, 2022 or the date immediately following the duration of the public health emergency period (which was recently extended to expire on April 16, 2022), whichever is later. CMS will continue paying suppliers the 50/50 blended rate for furnishing DMEPOS items in rural/non-contiguous areas and will pay 100% of the Adjusted Fee Schedule amount in “other non-CBAs”. For former CBAs, CMS will pay the SPAs that were in effect in the CBA before the CBP contract ended, increased by the projected percentage change in the CPI-U for the 12-month period on the date after the contract period ended. Similarly, for items that were originally included in Round 2021 but for which contracts were not awarded, CMS will continue to pay the SPAs that were in effect in the CBA before the CBP contract ended with annual CPI-U adjustments, until those items are competitively bid again in future rounds of the CBP. 
We furnish DMEPOS items in both rural/non-contiguous areas, as well as “other non-CBAs”. While some relief has been provided for rural/non-contiguous areas and, recently, but only on a temporary basis, to “other non-CBAs” through the CARES Act, the overall impact has been a reduction in payments for DMEPOS items in these areas that reflect competitively bid prices. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors— Risks Related to Regulation and Litigation – Reductions in Medicare, Medicaid and commercial Payor reimbursement rates and/or exclusion from markets or product lines, including due to the DMEPOS CBP, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.”
Reimbursement for Capped Rentals and Oxygen Equipment. Medicare covers certain DMEPOS items, including CPAP and RAD under its category for “capped rentals.” In general, items in this category are rented to Medicare beneficiaries, and Medicare payment is based on a monthly rental payment that covers the cost of the base device and 

14



any necessary maintenance and service of the device. DMEPOS suppliers may bill Medicare separately for any related accessories (e.g., masks, filters, humidifiers) that are used with the capped rental device. The rental period for these items is limited to 13 months of continuous use, after which time the Medicare monthly payment for the base equipment ceases and the Medicare beneficiary takes ownership of the device. After the capped rental period ends, Medicare continues to pay for replacement of the accessories that are used with the beneficiary-owned device. At the end of the five-year useful life of the equipment, the beneficiary may obtain replacement equipment and, if he or she can be requalified for the Medicare benefit, a new maximum 13-month payment and five-year useful life cycle would begin.
Medicare reimbursement for oxygen and oxygen equipment is limited to a maximum of 36 months within a 60-month service period. The supplier that billed Medicare for the 36th month of service continues to be responsible for the beneficiary’s oxygen therapy needs for months 37 through 60, and generally there is no additional reimbursement for oxygen-generating portable equipment for these later months. CMS does not separately reimburse DMEPOS suppliers for any oxygen tubing, cannulas and supplies that may be required for the beneficiary. The DMEPOS supplier is required to keep the equipment provided in working order and in some cases, CMS will provide reimbursement for repair costs. At the end of the five-year useful life of the equipment, the beneficiary may obtain replacement equipment and, if he or she can be requalified for the Medicare benefit, a new maximum 36-month payment cycle would begin for the next 60 months of service. Unlike capped rental items, the oxygen equipment always remains the property of the DMEPOS supplier. Note that, for 2019, CMS added a new oxygen payment class and set the rental payment for portable liquid oxygen equivalent to the rental payment made for portable concentrators and transfilling equipment. CMS also added a new payment class for high-flow portable liquid oxygen contents when a patient’s prescribed flow rate exceeds 4 liters per minute. This new high-flow oxygen content class allows for the continuation of high-flow oxygen volume adjustment payments beyond the initial 36 months of continuous use. CMS implemented these changes in a budget neutral manner. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 eliminates the budget neutrality requirement for separate classes and separate national limited monthly payment rates established for any item of oxygen and oxygen equipment, effective April 1, 2021. Accordingly, in 2021 and 2022, CMS has adjusted the fee schedule amounts to remove the percentage reduction necessary to meet the budget neutrality requirement for certain items of oxygen and oxygen equipment for claims with dates of service on or after April 1, 2021.
Reimbursement for Inhalation and Infusion Therapy Drugs. Inhalation therapy drugs are typically paid under the Medicare Part B fee schedule. Inhalation drugs have been paid based on the Average Sales Price (“ASP”) plus 6% for the drug since January 1, 2005. Effective January 1, 2017, the payment amount for infusion therapy drugs furnished through DME also began to be based on ASP plus 6%, rather than the historical payment amount based on 95% of the manufacturers’ Average Wholesale Price (“AWP”). This change in payment for infusion therapy drugs followed reports from the HHS OIG that found that the then-current AWP methodology may have resulted in excessive reimbursement for certain drugs while underpaying for other drugs. Inhalation and infusion therapy drugs are not subject to the DMEPOS CBP. However, the durable medical equipment used to deliver the inhalation and infusion therapy drugs (e.g., nebulizers, external infusion pumps and supplies) have been subject to various competition rounds under the DMEPOS CBP.
Reimbursement for Non-Invasive Pressure Support Ventilators. For patients experiencing chronic respiratory failure, we offer NIV therapy. Medicare pays for NIV therapy under the DME benefit category for items requiring frequent and substantial servicing, and payments may continue until medical necessity ends (rather than being capped after a certain period of time). CMS and its contractors have expressed concerns about the substantial increase in Medicare billing for non-invasive pressure support ventilators. As described by the HHS OIG in a September 2016 data brief, ventilator technology has evolved so that it is possible for a single device to treat numerous respiratory conditions by operating in several different modes. According to the HHS OIG, this creates an opportunity for abuse if DMEPOS suppliers were to bill Medicare for the device as if it were being used as a ventilator, when use of a lower cost device (e.g., CPAP, RAD) is indicated based on the beneficiary’s medical condition. The HHS OIG’s data brief examined the results of prepayment reviews conducted by two of the Durable Medical Equipment Medicare Administrative Contractors (“DME MACs”) that resulted in the denial of more than 90% of claims for NIVs. The primary reason cited for many of these denials was insufficient clinical documentation. In order to address various concerns about Medicare program abuse related to ventilator claims, which were highlighted in the HHS OIG’s 2016 data brief, CMS consolidated billing codes for ventilators effective January 1, 2016 and decreased the reimbursement amount for non-invasive pressure support ventilators. The HHS OIG recommended that CMS monitor providers with the largest market shares of 

15



ventilator beneficiaries; both CMS and the HHS OIG have continued to review DMEPOS supplier billing for ventilators and other respiratory equipment.
On July 22, 2020, CMS conducted a virtual Medicare Evidence Development & Coverage Advisory Committee (“MEDCAC”) meeting to review the evidence specific to the home use of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation by patients with chronic respiratory failure consequent to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (“COPD”). Devices to be considered are home mechanical ventilators, bi-level positive airway pressure (BPAP) devices, and CPAP devices. Following the MEDCAC panel, an informal Technical Expert Panel (“TEP”) led by the American College of Chest Physicians (“CHEST”) with representatives from the American Association for Respiratory Care (“AARC”), the American Thoracic Society (“ATS”), and the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (“AASM”) was convened to develop recommendations to inform CMS coverage policy regarding the use of at-home NIV devices for patients in five diagnostic categories. The five categories include: (1) Bilevel Transition from CPAP When Therapeutic Benefit Was Not Achieved; (2) Severe COPD; (3) Hypoventilation Syndrome; (4) Thoracic Restrictive Disorders; and (5) Complex/Central Sleep Apnea. The outcomes and recommendations of the TEP were published on July 30, 2021. Together, the efforts of the MEDCAC panel and the TEP are likely to be used by CMS to shape a Medicare national coverage determination (“NCD”) related to the use of at-home NIV devices in COPD patients in the future.
Claims Auditing and Monitoring and Medical Necessity Documentation Requirements. As a Medicare provider, we are subject to extensive government regulation, including laws and regulations directed at ascertaining the appropriateness of reimbursement, preventing fraud and abuse, and otherwise regulating reimbursement under the Medicare program. The federal government has contracted with private entities to audit and recover revenue resulting from payments made in excess of those permitted by federal and state benefit program rules. These entities include but are not limited to comprehensive error rate testing program contractors that are responsible for measuring improper payments on Medicare fee-for-service claims and Unified Program Integrity Contractors (UPICs) that are responsible for the identification of suspected fraud through medical record review.
In order to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries only receive medically necessary items and services, the Medicare program has adopted a number of documentation requirements. Additionally, to ensure compliance with Medicare, the DME MACs conduct pre- and post-payment audits or other types of inquiries, and request patient records and other documentation, to support claims we submit for payment for services and products we render to Medicare beneficiaries. These audits typically involve a complex medical review, by CMS, or its designated contractors and representatives, of documentation supporting the services and products provided. In connection with a Medicare request for supporting documentation, we are obligated to procure and submit the underlying medical records retained by various clinical providers, medical facilities and prescribers. Obtaining these medical records in connection with a claims audit may be challenging and, in any event, all of these records are subject to further examination, interpretation and dispute by the auditing authority. Under standard Medicare procedures, we are entitled to demonstrate the sufficiency of documentation and the establishment of medical necessity and we have the right to appeal any adverse determinations. If a determination is made that our records or the patients’ medical records are insufficient to meet medical necessity or Medicare coverage or reimbursement requirements for the claims, we could be subject to denials or overpayment demands for claims submitted for Medicare reimbursement. In the rare event that such an audit results in major discrepancies of claims records which lacked medical necessity, CMS may be entitled to take additional corrective measures, including extrapolation of audit results across a wider population of claims, submission of recoupment demands for claims other than those examined in the audit, or placing the provider on a full pre-payment review.
Face-to-Face Provisions for DMEPOS. In November 2012, CMS issued a final rule that implemented a provision of the PPACA establishing requirements for a face-to-face encounter with a Medicare beneficiary and written orders prior to delivery for certain items of DMEPOS. As written, the final rule would have required a physician to document that the physician, or a nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist, had a face-to-face encounter with the beneficiary prior to issuing a written order to the beneficiary for certain DMEPOS items. The MACRA eliminated this face-to-face requirement as originally written, and revised the requirement to be that a physician, nurse practitioner, physician assistant, or clinical nurse specialist must document they have written an order for a DMEPOS item pursuant to a face-to-face encounter with the beneficiary, but that encounter could have occurred anytime within the six months before the order was written for the DMEPOS item.

16



In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, CMS has exercised enforcement discretion with respect to the clinical conditions and face-to-face encounter requirements established under certain national and local coverage determinations applicable to certain items and supplies, including respiratory items (oxygen, CPAP, RADs, nebulizers) and infusion pumps. Accordingly, on an interim basis, requirements related to face-to-face or in-person encounters for evaluations, assessments, certifications or other implied face-to-face services would not apply. This enforcement discretion is temporary, as it is only in effect for the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is subject to ongoing and evolving interpretation by CMS and the DME MACs. As such, we may be required to modify our policies and procedures to remain in compliance with these CMS requirements.
Prior Authorization Rules for DMEPOS. In December 2015, CMS issued a final rule to require prior authorization (“PA”) by Medicare for certain DMEPOS items that the agency characterizes as frequently subject to unnecessary utilization. The final rule specifies a master list of DMEPOS items that potentially could be subject to PA and CMS updates this master list annually. The first two DMEPOS items requiring PA are two types of power wheelchairs (single and multiple power options) and in March 2017 the DME MACs began accepting PA requests for these items. The PA final rule did not create any new clinical documentation requirements; instead, the same information necessary to support Medicare payment was required, but simply prior to the DMEPOS item being furnished to the Medicare beneficiary.
CMS has established a list of DMEPOS items frequently subject to unnecessary utilization. Items on this list could be subject to PA as a condition of Medicare payment. Since 2012, CMS also has maintained a list of categories of DMEPOS items that require face-to-face encounters with practitioners and written orders before the DMEPOS supplier may furnish the items to Medicare beneficiaries. In a final rule published in November 2019, CMS combined these two lists to create a single, unified “master list” that CMS will use to identify DMEPOS items for which face-to-face encounters, written orders prior to delivery, and/or PA will be required. This expanded master list increases the number of DMEPOS items potentially eligible to be subject to prior authorization, face-to-face encounters, and written order prior to delivery requirements as a condition of payment. In January 2022, CMS issued a notice updating the DMEPOS items included on the master list, identifying the initial list of DMEPOS items for which face-to-face encounters and written orders prior to delivery are required, and adding certain DMEPOS items to the PA list.
While the current list of DMEPOS items requiring PA does not affect any of our products other than support surfaces, CMS may include products from our product lines on the required PA list in future phases of the PA process. If any of our products are ultimately subject to PA, it could reduce the number of our patients qualified to come on service using their Medicare benefits, it could delay the start of those patients’ service while we wait for PA to be received, and/or it could decrease our sales productivity. As a result, this could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity.
Reimbursement Under Medicare Part C (Medicare Advantage). We maintain contracts to provide home respiratory, home medical equipment and related services to a significant number of managed care companies that maintain Medicare Advantage plans nationwide. While Medicare Advantage plans are required to cover all benefits to which beneficiaries are entitled under the Medicare Parts A and B programs, these plans have flexibility to negotiate and set payment rates that differ from the Medicare rates. Further, the DMEPOS CBP only applies to the Medicare fee-for-service program and therefore does not apply to Medicare Advantage plans. Enrollment in Medicare Advantage plans continues to grow and these plans are likely to continue to be attractive alternatives to traditional Medicare fee-for-service for those beneficiaries who choose them and we intend to continue to contract with these plans.
We cannot estimate the combined possible impact of all legislative, regulatory, and contemplated reimbursement changes that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, our estimates of the impact of certain of these changes appearing in this “Government Regulation” section are based on a number of assumptions and there can be no assurance that the actual impact was not or will not be different from our estimates.
Medicaid Reimbursement. State Medicaid programs implement reimbursement policies for the products and services we provide. Such policies may or may not be similar to those of the Medicare program. Budget pressures on state Medicaid programs often result in pricing and coverage changes that may have a detrimental impact on our 

17



operations. States sometimes have adopted alternative pricing methods for certain drugs and home medical equipment under their Medicaid programs that reduce the level of reimbursement received by us, without a corresponding offset or increase to compensate for the service costs incurred.
The 21st Century Cures Act accelerated the implementation of the omnibus spending bill passed in December 2015 that requires state Medicaid agencies to match Medicare reimbursement rates for certain durable medical equipment items, including oxygen, to be effective beginning January 1, 2018. Through passage of the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress added section 1903(i)(27) to the SSA, which prohibits federal Medicaid reimbursement to states for certain durable medical equipment expenditures that are, in the aggregate, in excess of what Medicare would have paid for such items. As such, a state’s Medicaid expenditures for DME items that are subject to this provision will be determined in the aggregate and any expenditures in excess of what Medicare would have paid for such items in the aggregate, either on a fee schedule basis or under its competitive bidding process, are not eligible for federal financial participation. CMS issued guidance through a federal register notice published on November 28, 2017 and in a state Medicaid director letter dated December 27, 2017 regarding state implementation of this Medicaid program requirement. However, most states did not take the appropriate action before this became effective on January 1, 2018. States then worked to enact changes to their fee schedules. In addition, states considered whether to make such changes retroactive to January 1, 2018. The impact of this Medicaid program requirement has varied by state, depending on how much the state’s Medicaid fee-for-service rate differs from the applicable Medicare rate.
On January 30, 2020, CMS, on behalf of the Trump Administration, announced a new opportunity called the Healthy Adult Opportunity (“HAO”) to support states with greater flexibility to improve the health of their Medicaid populations. According to the Trump Administration, the HAO “emphasizes the concept of value-based care while granting states with extensive flexibility to administer and design their programs within a defined budget.” As a part of HAO, CMS encourages states to implement evidence-based payment and delivery system reforms, including a combination of fee-for-service and managed care delivery systems that can be altered over the course of the demonstration. On January 8, 2021, CMS approved Tennessee’s block grant waiver amendment application, which CMS stated leverages many of the flexibilities outlined in the HAO guidance released in 2020. However, this waiver approval is facing legal challenges and, consistent with President Biden’s January 28, 2021 Executive Order on Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, the Biden Administration is likely to significantly modify or repeal the HAO.
Historically, when states have adopted alternative pricing methodologies, we have sometimes elected to stop accepting new Medicaid patient referrals for the affected drugs and/or home medical equipment. We continuously evaluate the possibility of stopping or reducing our Medicaid business in certain states with reimbursement policies that make it difficult for us to conduct our operations profitably. We cannot currently predict the adverse impact, if any, that any such reduction in our Medicaid business might have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, but such impact could be material. In addition, we cannot predict whether states may consider adopting additional reimbursement reductions or whether any such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
HIPAA / HITECH / Federal and State Consumer Protection and Privacy and Security Requirements. HIPAA is comprised of a number of components pertaining to the privacy and security of certain protected health information (“PHI”), as well as the standard formatting of certain electronic health transactions. The Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (“HITECH”) (enacted under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009) further limited how covered entities, business associates and business associate subcontractors may use and disclose PHI and the security measures that must be taken in connection with protecting that information and related systems. In addition, HIPAA and the PPACA require healthcare providers, health plans, payors, and other HIPAA-covered entities to use the electronic standard transactions, operating rules, code sets and unique identifiers that have been adopted through regulation by the Secretary. Under the 21st Century Cures Act, Congress authorized the HHS Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (“ONC”) to engage in rulemaking that would drive interoperability, prohibit information blocking, and provide timely access to health information through standardized application programming interfaces (APIs) to seamlessly coordinate care, improve outcomes and reduce the cost of care. CMS also finalized regulations under their authority to regulate Medicare and Medicaid managed care plans, qualified health plans offered on the federally-facilitated Exchange, and hospitals that improve patient access to their health information and encourage provider-to-provider and payor-to-payor exchanges of health information that are 

18



designed to reduce the burden on payors and providers. Due to the public health emergency (which has periodically been extended and most recently was extended to expire on April 16, 2022) and in response to the healthcare industry’s need to focus on responding to COVID-19, both CMS and ONC exercised their enforcement discretion to allow for flexibility with respect to compliance and applicability of their respective Interoperability and Patient Access rules. Then, in October 2020, ONC published an Interim Final Rule that extended the applicability date for the Information Blocking provisions until April 2021. The Interim Final Rule also laid out a compliance timeline that extends through December 31. 2023. In addition, in December 2020, the HHS Office for Civil Rights (“HHS OCR”) proposed changes to the HIPAA Privacy Rule that have the potential to impact patients, covered entities, and business associates. Certain of the proposed changes are focused on the patient right of access requirements and processes, while other proposed changes would impact how covered entities may share information and would relax the requirements for providers to document how their Notice of Privacy Practices is provided to patients. 
We are subject to HIPAA as a covered entity. HIPAA also applies to business associates of covered entities, which are individuals and entities that provide services for or on behalf of those covered entities. We enter into contracts with our business associates that provide services to us to require those business associates to safeguard PHI in accordance with the requirements of HIPAA and HITECH and sometimes enter into contracts as the business associate of another covered entity. In addition, we may be impacted by the ONC Interoperability and Information Blocking Rules and the CMS Interoperability and Patient Right of Access Rules (collectively “the Interoperability Rules”), or we may participate in a health information exchange or network, and will have to follow the rules for information exchange that are influenced by the Interoperability Rules. However, at this time we do not believe Apria is required to comply with these rules. Since the majority of the health care providers that we coordinate care for our patients with are required to comply with the Interoperability Rules, it is likely that we will choose to comply with this new regulatory framework in the future. 
Numerous other federal and state laws that protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and security of PHI and healthcare related data also apply to us. In many cases, these laws are more restrictive than, and not preempted by, the HIPAA and HITECH rules and requirements, and may be subject to varying interpretation by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and potentially exposing us to additional expenses, adverse publicity and liability.
Further, federal and state consumer laws are being applied increasingly by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) and state enforcement authorities, to regulate the collection, use and disclosure of personal information or patient health information, and to ensure that appropriate data safeguards are implemented by business and organizations that are maintaining personal information about individuals. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which became effective on January 1, 2020, gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used by requiring covered businesses to provide new disclosures to California consumers (as that term is broadly defined) and provide such consumers new ways to opt-out of certain sales of personal information. In November 2020, Californians approved the California Privacy Rights Act (the “CPRA”), which modified and expanded the CCPA and established a new California Privacy Protection Agency. The CPRA established January 1, 2023 as the new compliance date for most of the other substantive provisions of the CPRA. See “Item 1A—Risk Factors” below for additional information. Virginia and Colorado have enacted similar laws to provide for the protection of consumer privacy, while numerous other states have similar laws under consideration. In addition, courts also may adopt the standards for fair information practices promulgated by the FTC that concern consumer notice, choice, security and access. 
With respect to data safeguards laws, there are a number of states that have passed legislation, most notably New York’s Stop Hacks and Improve Electronic Data Security Act (the “SHIELD Act”), signed into law in July 2019, that requires any person or business owning or licensing computerized data that includes the private information of a resident of New York to implement and maintain reasonable safeguards to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the private information. While entities subject to HIPAA are deemed to be in compliance with the security provisions of the SHIELD Act, the SHIELD Act does require such entities to provide notice to the New York Attorney General in the event of a breach of personal information.

New information standards, whether implemented pursuant to federal or state laws, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we must handle healthcare related data, and the cost of complying with such standards could be significant. We have implemented various compliance measures in connection with the HIPAA, HITECH and 21st Century Cures Act rules and requirements, and other federal and state privacy and security rules and requirements, but we may be required to take additional steps, including costly system purchases and modifications, to comply with these rules and requirements as they may evolve over time. We face potential administrative, civil and criminal sanctions if we do not comply with the existing or new laws and regulations dealing with the privacy and security of PHI and patient information. Imposition of any such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Similarly, if we, or any of our business associates, experience a breach of PHI, the breach reporting requirements required by HITECH and state laws could result in substantial financial liability and reputational harm.
Enforcement of Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws. The federal government, and its various state counterparts, have made policy decisions to continue increasing the financial resources allocated to enforcing healthcare fraud and abuse laws. In fact, at the federal level, enforcement actions under the Biden Administration have increased. Commercial Payors also have increased their level of scrutiny of healthcare claims, in an effort to identify and prosecute fraudulent and abusive practices in the healthcare industry. Violation of these federal and state laws can result in the imposition of criminal and civil monetary penalties, as well as exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs. Exclusion for a minimum of five years is mandatory for a conviction, and the presence of aggravating circumstances in a case can lead to an even longer period of exclusion. The federal government also has the discretion to exclude providers for certain conduct even absent a criminal conviction. Such conduct includes, but is not limited to, participation in a fraud scheme, payment or receipt of kickbacks and/or failing to provide services of a quality that meets professionally recognized standards. The HHS OIG also has authority under certain circumstances to suspend or terminate Medicare billing privileges during the course of an investigation.
We seek to structure our business operations, our financial relationships with referral sources, our billing and documentation practices and other practices to comply with the laws discussed below. However, we cannot assure you that a federal or state agency charged with enforcement of these various laws might not assert a contrary position or that new federal or state laws might not be enacted that would cause these arrangements to become illegal or result in the imposition of penalties on us or certain of our facilities and operations. If any of those allegations were successfully asserted against us or even if there is an assertion of a potential violation, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity.
Anti-Kickback Prohibitions. As a provider of services under the Medicare and Medicaid programs, we must comply with the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”). The AKS prohibits the offer or receipt of any bribe, kickback, or rebate in return for the referral of patients, products, or services covered by federal healthcare programs. Federal healthcare programs have been defined to include plans and programs that provide healthcare benefits funded by the United States government, including Medicare, Medicaid and TRICARE (formerly known as the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uniformed Services), among others. Some courts and the HHS OIG have interpreted the AKS to cover any arrangement where even one purpose of the remuneration is to influence referrals. Violations of the AKS may result in civil and criminal penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs.
Despite the breadth of the AKS prohibitions, there are only a limited number of statutory exceptions that protect various common business transactions and arrangements from prosecution. In addition, the HHS OIG has published safe harbor regulations, with the most recent major modifications occurring in 2020, that outline other types of arrangements that also are deemed protected from prosecution under the AKS, provided all applicable criteria are met. The failure to meet all of the applicable safe harbor criteria does not necessarily mean that the particular arrangement in question violates the AKS; rather, these arrangements could be subject to greater scrutiny by enforcement agencies. A determination that a financial arrangement violates the AKS could subject us to liability under the SSA, including civil and criminal penalties, as well as exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.
In order to obtain additional clarification on the AKS, a provider can obtain written interpretative advisory opinions from the HHS OIG regarding existing or contemplated transactions. Pursuant to a new HHS Final Rule effective February 10, 2022, the HHS OIG will have more flexibility to issue advisory opinions and potentially provide industry 

20



stakeholders with greater transparency regarding factors that the government may consider in evaluating compliance with certain federal fraud and abuse laws and distinguishing between similar arrangements. Under the revised regulations, OIG will no longer be barred from issuing an advisory opinion when an arrangement presented in an advisory opinion involves conduct that is the same or substantially the same as conduct that is under investigation or subject to a governmental proceeding. Advisory opinions are binding as to HHS but only with respect to the requesting party or parties. The advisory opinions are not binding as to other governmental agencies (e.g., the DOJ) and certain matters (e.g., whether certain payments made in conjunction with conduct seeking to meet certain safe harbor protections are at fair market value) are not within the purview of an advisory opinion.
Certain states in which we operate have enacted statutes and regulations similar to the AKS that prohibit some direct or indirect payments if those payments are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to a particular provider. Most states have anti-kickback statutes that prohibit kickbacks relating to the state’s Medicaid program, but some state anti-kickback statutes are broader and apply not only to the federal and state healthcare programs but also to other Payor sources (e.g., national and regional insurers and managed care organizations). These state laws may contain exceptions and/or safe harbors that are different from those at the federal level and may vary widely from state to state. A number of states in which we operate also have laws that prohibit fee-splitting arrangements between healthcare providers, if such arrangements are designed to induce or encourage the referral of patients to a particular provider. Possible sanctions for violations of these laws include exclusion from state-funded healthcare programs, loss of licensure and civil and criminal penalties. These laws vary from state to state, often are vague and often have been subject to only limited court and/or regulatory agency interpretation.
Physician Self-Referral Prohibitions. The federal physician self-referral law, commonly referred to as the “Stark Law,” prohibits a physician (and certain other healthcare professionals) from making a referral of Medicare and Medicaid patients for a designated health service to an entity, such as us, if the physician or a member of the physician’s immediate family has a financial relationship with the entity, unless an exception applies. The term “designated health services” includes several services commonly performed or supplied by us, including durable medical equipment and pharmacy items and services. In addition, the term “financial relationship” is broadly defined to include any ownership or investment interest, or compensation arrangement, pursuant to which a physician receives remuneration from the provider at issue. The Stark Law prohibition applies regardless of the reasons for the financial relationship and the referral; and, therefore, unlike the AKS, an intent to violate the law is not required. Violations of the Stark Law may result in loss of Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, civil penalties and exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Stark Law contains a number of statutory and regulatory exceptions intended to protect certain types of transactions and business arrangements from penalty. In order to qualify an arrangement under a particular Stark Law exception, compliance with all of the exception’s requirements is necessary. Since the Stark Law was enacted in 1989, there have continued to be ongoing changes and clarifications to a number of the provisions in the legislation and regulations. In 2019, the 2020 Physician Fee Schedule final rule finalized changes to the Stark advisory opinion process, amending the process such that HHS will not pursue sanctions against any party to an arrangement that CMS determines is “indistinguishable in all material aspects” from an arrangement described in a favorable advisory opinion. The final rule allows individuals and entities to rely on advisory opinions as “non-binding guidance.” In addition, in 2020, CMS issued a final rule, “Modernizing and Clarifying the Physician Self-Referral Regulations,” which creates new permanent exceptions to the Stark Law for value-based arrangements, as well as provides additional guidance on several key requirements that must be met in order for physicians and healthcare providers to comply with the Stark Law, though the implementation of some of these changes has been delayed. For example, compensation provided to a physician by another healthcare provider generally must be at fair market value, and the final rule provides guidance on how to determine if compensation meets this requirement. The Stark Law has also been subject to varying, and sometimes contradictory, decisions by the courts.
In addition, a number of the states in which we operate have similar prohibitions against physician self-referrals, which are not limited to just the federal healthcare program. These state prohibitions may differ from the Stark Law’s prohibitions and exceptions may apply to a broader or narrower range of services, arrangements and financial relationships and may apply to other healthcare professionals in addition to physicians. Violations of these state laws may result in prohibition of payment for services rendered, loss of licenses, fines and criminal penalties. State statutes and regulations also may require physicians and/or other healthcare professionals to disclose to patients any financial relationships the physicians and/or healthcare professionals have with healthcare providers who are recommended to 

21



patients. These laws vary from state to state, often are vague, and in many cases, have not been interpreted by courts or regulatory agencies.
False Claims Act. The federal False Claims Act (“FCA”) imposes civil and criminal liability on individuals or entities that submit false or fraudulent claims for payment to the government. Violations of the FCA may result in treble damages, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from the Medicare, Medicaid and other federally funded healthcare programs. If certain criteria are satisfied, the FCA allows a private individual to bring a qui tam suit on behalf of the government and, if the case is successful, to share in any recovery. FCA suits brought directly by the government or private individuals against healthcare providers, like us, are increasingly common and are expected to increase. For those individuals or entities that are presently subject to FCA qui tam suits, audits, denials of claims, or other audit or enforcement actions based exclusively on allegations of noncompliance with guidance documents, a 2020 HHS final rule, titled “Good Guidance Practices,” provides a new basis to rebut these allegations.
The federal government has used the FCA to prosecute a wide variety of alleged false claims and other frauds allegedly perpetrated against Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state funded healthcare programs. In addition, violation of other statutes (such as the AKS) can be considered to trigger violations of the FCA. In December 2020, HHS announced the establishment of an FCA Working Group to enhance HHS’ partnership with DOJ to combat those who seek to defraud HHS programs. Based on this development, there may be an increase in enforcement coordination between HHS and DOJ in pursuing actions under the FCA. DOJ’s total Fiscal Year 2021 False Claims Act settlements and judgments was the second largest annual total in False Claims Act history, and the largest since 2014.
On December 18, 2020, a federal judge approved a civil and administrative settlement Apria entered into with the United States and certain state Medicaid programs, in a complaint filed by three relators under the qui tam provisions of the FCA, 31 U.S.C. § 3729 et seq., as well as comparable state false claims laws, in connection with the rental of NIVs. Apria also entered into separate settlements to resolve the relators’ claims brought on behalf of the states of California and Illinois related to NIV covered by private insurers. The matter had been pending since 2017.
The government had alleged that Apria violated the FCA by submitting false claims seeking reimbursement for NIVs which were not being used, or not being used sufficiently, by patients, for NIVs which were being used pursuant to physician orders on a device setting which was available from other less expensive devices, and for improperly waiving co-pays to induce beneficiaries to rent NIVs. To resolve any potential liability, Apria agreed to enter a civil settlement agreement and to pay $40 million to the federal government and the states. Apria also agreed with the California Department of Insurance to pay $500,000 to resolve claims asserted by the relators under the California Insurance Frauds Prevention Act, Cal. Ins. Code § 1871 et seq. Apria separately agreed with the relators to settle all remaining claims from their complaint, including: (1) claims for retaliation in violation of federal and state laws; (2) claims for attorneys’ fees and costs available under federal and state law; and (3) claims under the Illinois Insurance Claims Fraud Prevention Act, 740 Ill. Comp. Stat. 92/1 et seq. Apria did not admit that any of its conduct was illegal or otherwise improper.
As part of the federal and state Medicaid settlement, Apria also entered into a five-year CIA with the HHS OIG. The CIA requires Apria to maintain its ongoing corporate compliance program and obligates Apria to implement or continue, as applicable, a set of defined corporate integrity activities for a period of five years from the effective date of the CIA. Among other things, the CIA requires Apria to impose certain oversight obligations on Apria’s board of directors; provide certain management certifications; continue or implement, as applicable, certain compliance training and education; and engage an Independent Review Organization to perform certain reviews. The CIA also includes certain reporting, certification, record retention, and notification requirements. In the event of a breach of the CIA, Apria could become liable for payment of certain stipulated penalties or could be excluded from participation in federal healthcare programs.
In addition to federal enforcement of the FCA, a number of states have enacted false claims acts that are similar to the FCA. Generally, these state laws allow for the recovery of money that was fraudulently obtained by a healthcare provider from the state, such as Medicaid funds provided by the state, or in some cases, from private Payors and to assess fines and penalties. As a result of these state laws, there has been a corresponding increase in state-initiated false 

22



claims enforcement efforts. See “Item 3—Legal Proceedings—Civil Investigative Demand Issued by the United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York” below for more information.
Other Fraud and Abuse Laws. In addition to the laws described above, various other laws and regulations prohibit fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry and provide for significant penalties. For example, the knowing and willful defrauding of, or attempt to defraud, a healthcare benefit program, including both governmental and private healthcare programs and plans, may result in criminal penalties. Further, the payment of inducements to Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries intended to influence those beneficiaries to order or receive services from a particular provider or practitioner may result in civil penalties. Federal enforcement officials have numerous enforcement mechanisms to combat fraud and abuse, including an incentive program under which individuals can receive up to $1,000 for providing information on Medicare fraud and abuse that leads to the recovery of at least $100 of Medicare funds. In addition, federal enforcement officials have the ability to exclude from Medicare and Medicaid any investors, officers and managing employees associated with business entities that have committed healthcare fraud.
There have also been new statutes enacted to prevent fraud and abuse in healthcare, as well as existing statutes used in new ways to target healthcare fraud. In addition, in recent years the DOJ has started using the federal Travel Act as a basis for prosecuting healthcare fraud defendants based on violations of state anti-kickback or anti-bribery laws.
Marketing and Transparency Reporting Laws. Because of the products and services that we provide to patients, we are subject to certain federal and state laws and regulations regarding our marketing activities and the nature of our interactions with physicians and other healthcare providers. For example, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (“Sunshine Act”) requires manufacturers of, and distributors that hold title to, certain drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies covered by Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, to annually report information related to (i) payments or other transfers of value made to physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified nurse midwives, and teaching hospitals, and (ii) ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level. In addition, laws may require us to comply with certain codes of conduct, limit or report certain marketing expenses and disclose certain physician and other provider arrangements. Violations of these laws and regulations, to the extent they are applicable, could subject us to civil and criminal fines and penalties, as well as possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. From time to time, we may be the subject of investigations or audits, or be a party to litigation which alleges violations of these laws and regulations. If any of those allegations were successfully asserted against us, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Corporate Compliance Program. We have developed a corporate compliance program in an effort to monitor compliance with federal and state laws and regulations applicable to healthcare organizations and to implement policies, procedures and processes designed to ensure that our employees act in compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and company policies. The HHS OIG has issued a series of compliance program guidance documents in which it has set out the elements of an effective compliance program. The HHS OIG has followed the model of the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, which are used by federal judges in determining sentences in federal criminal cases. The guidelines are advisory, not mandatory, and with respect to corporations, state that having an effective ethics and compliance program may be a relevant mitigating factor in determining sentencing. To comply with the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines, a corporate compliance program must be reasonably designed, implemented and enforced such that it is generally effective in preventing and detecting criminal conduct. The U.S. Sentencing Guidelines also state that corporations should take certain steps such as periodic monitoring and responding appropriately to detected criminal conduct.
The DOJ also updated its guidance to Criminal Division prosecutors regarding how to evaluate an organization’s compliance program when making charging decisions (the “2020 DOJ Revisions”). The 2020 DOJ Revisions guidance focuses on three fundamental questions for prosecutors to consider when evaluating corporate compliance programs: (1) whether the corporation’s compliance program is well designed; (2) whether the corporation’s compliance program is being applied earnestly and in good faith (i.e., is the program adequately resourced and empowered to function effectively); and (3) whether the corporation’s compliance program works in practice. The major emphasis in the 2020 DOJ Revisions guidance is that corporations must continue to review and update their corporate compliance programs in light of changing circumstances within the organization and also within the industries in which the corporation operates. 

23



Our compliance program has been structured to include these elements. The primary compliance program components recommended by the HHS OIG, all of which we have attempted to implement, include: formal policies and written procedures; designation of a compliance officer; education and training programs; auditing, monitoring and risk assessments; a process for responding appropriately to detected misconduct; open lines of communication; and discipline and accountability. We conduct routine compliance auditing and monitoring, including checks of relevant governmental exclusion and debarment lists, and we audit compliance with our corporate compliance program on a regular basis. We have attempted to customize our compliance program to our organization’s environment and we periodically refine the program to address evolving circumstances within the organization and within the industry more generally. From time to time, issues identified through our compliance program may trigger internal or external reviews related to our compliance with federal and state healthcare laws and regulations. These internal and external reviews may result in changes to our coding, billing and claims adjudication process for our claims.
While we have attempted to develop our corporate compliance program to be consistent with these guidelines, we cannot be certain that a court, the HHS OIG, the DOJ, or a state, would agree. Although we believe our compliance program reflects a reasonable and accepted approach in the healthcare industry, we cannot assure you that our program will prevent, detect and/or rectify all compliance issues in all markets we serve and in all applicable time periods. If we fail to prevent, detect and/or rectify such issues, depending on the nature and scope of such issues, we could face future claims for recoupment of overpayments, civil fines and other penalties, or other material adverse consequences.
Finally, pursuant to the December 2020 settlement agreement with the United States and state Medicaid programs, we also have entered into a five-year CIA with the HHS OIG. Under this CIA, we agreed to undertake certain obligations designed to promote compliance with federal healthcare programs. For further information, see “—Government Regulation—False Claims Act” above.
Facility and Clinician Licensure. Various federal and state authorities and clinical practice boards regulate the licensure of our facilities and clinical specialists working for us, either directly as employees or on a per diem or contractual basis. Regulations and requirements vary from state to state. We are committed to complying with all applicable licensing requirements and maintain centralized functions to manage over 2,000 facility licenses and/or permits that are required to operate our business.
Healthcare Reform. Economic, political and regulatory influences are continuously causing fundamental changes in the healthcare industry in the United States. In 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted and President Obama signed into law, significant reforms to the U.S. healthcare system. These reforms, contained primarily in the PPACA and its companion act, the Health Care Education and Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”), significantly altered the U.S. healthcare system by authorizing, among many other things: (i) increased access to health insurance benefits for the uninsured and underinsured populations; (ii) new facilitators and providers of health insurance, as well as new health insurance purchasing access points (i.e., exchanges); (iii) incentives for certain employer groups to purchase health insurance for their employees; (iv) opportunities for subsidies to certain qualifying individuals to help defray the cost of premiums and other out-of-pocket costs associated with the purchase of health insurance, and over the longer term; and (v) mechanisms to foster alternative payment and reimbursement methodologies focused on outcomes, quality and care coordination. In addition, certain states in which we operate are periodically considering various healthcare reform proposals.
Since their passage in 2010, the Health Reform Laws have triggered many changes to the U.S. healthcare system, some of which took effect (e.g., the subsequently eliminated individual mandate penalty) while others have continued to be delayed and subsequently repealed (e.g., the medical device tax). The Health Reform Laws also have faced several challenges and remain subject to ongoing efforts to repeal or modify the laws. For example, President Trump issued an Executive Order 13765 (Minimizing the Economic Burden of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act Pending Repeal) on January 20, 2017 granting authority to certain executive departments and agencies to minimize the economic burden of the PPACA. However, President Biden revoked this Executive Order on January 28, 2021 (as part of President Biden’s Executive Order on Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act) and directed heads of departments to “consider whether to suspend, revise, or rescind — and, as applicable, publish for notice and comment proposed rules suspending, revising, or rescinding” actions taken by the Trump Administration which may hinder the operation of the Health Reform Laws.

24



Nevertheless, the core tenets of the Health Reform Laws remain in effect with several exceptions. The individual mandate penalty was eliminated beginning in 2019 through the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In addition, on December 20, 2019, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 was signed into law which repealed several provisions that were included in the Health Reform Laws to pay for the increased federal spending associated with the Health Reform Laws. Specifically, Congress: (i) repealed the Medical Device Excise Tax, which imposed a 2.3% excise tax on manufacturers, producers and importers of certain medical devices; (ii) repealed the health insurance tax, which applies to most fully insured plans, beginning in 2021; and (iii) repealed the so-called Cadillac Tax, which imposed an excise tax of 40% on premiums for employer-sponsored individuals and families that exceeded a certain minimum threshold. Prior to these changes Congress had passed a short-term spending bill as part of the Continuing Appropriations Act of 2018 that delayed the implementation of these provisions and eliminated the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which was a 15-member panel of healthcare experts created by the Health Reform Laws and tasked with making annual cost-cutting recommendations for Medicare if Medicare spending exceeded a specified growth rate.
The Health Reform Laws also are the subject of ongoing litigation. In particular, a collection of 20 state governors and state attorneys general (subsequently two states have dropped out) filed a lawsuit against the federal government in the Northern District of Texas seeking to enjoin the entire Health Reform Laws following the elimination of the individual mandate penalty in 2019. The District Court ruled that without the penalty the individual mandate was unconstitutional and that all other provisions of the Health Reform Laws should be overturned as well. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit affirmed the trial court’s decision; however, instead of deciding whether the rest of the PPACA must be struck down, the 5th Circuit sent the case back to the trial court for additional analysis. In March of 2020 the United States Supreme Court granted cert in the case and heard oral arguments on November 10, 2020. On June 17, 2021, the Supreme Court held that the plaintiffs lacked standing and reversed the Fifth Circuit’s judgment in respect to standing, vacated the Fifth Circuit’s judgment, and remanded the case with instructions to dismiss the case. Subsequently the Fifth Circuit vacated the judgement of the District Court in its entirety and remanded the case to the District Court with instructions to dismiss. The District Court dismissed the case on July 27, 2021. 
The Trump Administration made a number of changes that have affected the individual and small group exchange markets, including modifications to the open enrollment periods, funding cuts to patient support resources, including the patient navigator program, and failing to issue cost-sharing reduction payments to insurers participating in the exchanges. In June 2018, the Trump Administration published a final rule that allows small businesses and self-employed individuals to band together to create associations that are considered “employers” under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act such that these associations are eligible to access large group health plans, which are typically less expensive and are not subject to as many of the consumer protections imposed by the PPACA on small group and individual health plans. In addition, the Trump Administration published a final rule which makes short term, limited duration plans more accessible, providing individuals with another product offering that is generally less expensive but has fewer protections than under the PPACA plans. This final rule combined with the association health plan final rule, may increase instability in the healthcare exchanges by siphoning off potentially healthier people from the risk pool. However, in 2021 President Biden issued an Executive Order on Strengthening Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act, directing heads of departments to review and potentially revoke or revise these Trump-era actions.
In light of the ongoing efforts to alter the Health Reform Laws, we are unable at this time to predict the full impact that potential changes will have on our business, including provisions in the Health Reform Laws related to Medicare payments, mechanisms to foster alternative payment and reimbursement methodologies focused on outcomes, quality and care coordination, Medicare enrollment and claims submission requirements and revisions to other federal healthcare laws such as the AKS, the Stark Law and the FCA. We anticipate, however, that federal and state governments will continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies, and that public debate regarding these issues will continue in the future. Changes in the law or new interpretations of existing laws can have a substantial effect on permissible activities, the relative costs associated with doing business in the healthcare industry, and the amount of reimbursement available from government and other Payors. Any repeal or modification of the Health Reform Laws may materially adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flow, capital resources and liquidity. In addition, the potential proposals for alternative legislation to replace the Health Reform Laws may have an adverse impact on our business.

FDA. Apria is governed by various regulations that affect the manufacture, distribution, importation, marketing and sale of medical gases and related oxygen medical devices and supplies. Our medical gas facilities and operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal and state authorities. The FDA regulates medical gases, including medical oxygen, pursuant to its authority under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“ FFDCA”). Among other requirements, the FDA’s Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) regulations impose certain quality control, documentation and recordkeeping requirements on the receipt, processing and distribution of medical gas. Further, in each state where we operate medical gas facilities, we are subject to regulation under state health and safety laws, which vary from state to state. The FDA and state authorities conduct periodic, unannounced inspections at medical gas facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs and other regulations. We expend significant time, money and resources in an effort to achieve substantial compliance with cGMP regulations and other federal and state law requirements at each of our medical gas facilities. There can be no assurance, however, that these efforts will be successful and that our medical gas facilities will achieve and maintain compliance with federal and state laws and regulations. Our failure to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance at our medical gas facilities could result in enforcement action, including warning letters, fines, product recalls or seizures, temporary or permanent injunctions, or suspensions in operations at one or more locations, as well as civil or criminal penalties, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Our facilities must comply with applicable federal and state laws, regulations and licensing standards. For example, all of our locations that fill and distribute medical oxygen containers must register with the FDA as a medical gas manufacturer, and these registered locations must comply with all applicable Company and cGMP policies and practices. Regulations are subject to change as a result of legislative, administrative or judicial action, which may further increase our costs or reduce sales. From time to time, we may undertake field corrective actions to correct product issues that may arise. These actions are necessary to ensure the products we distribute adhere to high standards of quality and safety. Additionally, we have policies and procedures in place that address the process for taking field corrective actions should we become aware of any issue related to the medical oxygen products that we fill and distribute. We continue to operate these programs to ensure compliance with applicable regulations and actively monitor proposed changes in the FDA’s regulation of medical gases and related products, particularly those which could have a material adverse effect on the products we manufacture or distribute, or us as a whole.
We have facilities in certain states that manufacture medical gases, including medical oxygen. In the United States, medical gases, which are products that are recognized by an official pharmacopoeia or formulary, or intended for use in the diagnosis, cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, are regulated as finished pharmaceuticals (drugs). The production, distribution and sale of medical gases and medical devices are regulated by the U.S. federal government under FFDCA, as well as by various state and local laws and other regulations. Before a medical gas can be marketed in the United States, the FDA must approve a request to certify the product as a “designated medical gas.” The FDA reviews requests for certification to confirm that the gas to which the request applies is a designated medical gas and contains the information required by regulation. Certification of a designated medical gas has the effect of a drug approval under section 505 of the FFDCA (for gases intended for human use). If changes are made to the original certification request, such as information about the requestor or the formulation of a medical gas, an amendment may be submitted to the FDA explaining the change. Apria has obtained this certification, and in accordance with cGMPs, we verify the reliability of the medical gas supplier’s analytical methodology to ensure the bulk oxygen we receive has been tested in conformance with cGMP requirements. In addition, all bulk oxygen deliveries must be accompanied with a certificate of analysis that meets cGMP specifications. Each delivery of bulk oxygen provided to our bulk stand tanks must be tested by trained Apria personnel in accordance with the mandated analytical methodology defined by cGMPs. We also conduct primary source verification of the FDA registration and state licensure held by each medical gas supplier that provides bulk oxygen to any of our facilities.
The FDA requires entities that manufacture or engage in certain processing operations related to medical gases (e.g., combining gases or transfilling a gas from one container to another) to comply with all establishment and drug registration and listing requirements and to follow cGMPs regarding quality, personnel, facilities, equipment design and calibration, production, testing processes, container and closure specifications, labeling requirements and records and complaint management. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMPs, which impose extensive procedural and record keeping requirements. While the FDA temporarily paused on-site routine surveillance inspections starting in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in a guidance issued in August 2020, 

26



the FDA explained that it resumed prioritized domestic inspections, such as pre-approval and surveillance inspections, as of July 2020, and that, for the foreseeable future, such prioritized domestic inspections would be pre-announced. The FDA has continued, on a case-by case basis, to conduct “mission-critical” inspections based on its evaluation of a number of factors related to the public health benefit of U.S. patients having access to the product subject to inspection (e.g., whether the product may have received breakthrough therapy designation or is used to diagnose, treat, or prevent a serious disease or medical condition for which there is no other appropriate substitute). Further, the FDA released a Resiliency Roadmap in May 2021, and an update in November 2021, in which the agency explained that routine surveillance inspections would continue to be conducted based on risk, with a priority to higher-tiered needs. Although the FDA remains committed to conducting mission-critical domestic inspections, there may be future disruptions in the FDA’s ongoing inspectional activities. For example, as recently as January 2022, the FDA temporarily postponed, and subsequently resumed in February 2022, certain inspectional activities (e.g., domestic surveillance inspections) due to concerns relating to the safety of its employees and those of the firms it regulates. The FDA has stated that it will continue to reassess its inspectional plans as needed due to the evolving COVID-19 pandemic. Since January 2020, no Apria facilities have been subject to inspection by the FDA, and we are not aware of any planned FDA inspections of any Apria facility. Quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to cGMPs after certification as a designated medical gas. Additionally, under the FDA’s regulations, we are subject to ongoing post-market requirements. For example, drug manufacturers must report adverse reactions (any undesirable experience associated with the use of a drug, including serious drug side effects, product use errors, product quality problems and therapeutic failures), provide updated safety and efficacy information and comply with requirements concerning advertising and promotional materials and activities. Any post-market regulatory obligations, and the cost of complying with such obligations, could expand in the future.
​
As a medical device distributor, we must rely on device manufacturers and suppliers to comply with regulatory requirements and adhere to the FDA’s cGMP and other quality requirements. We cannot predict whether any issues may arise out of any FDA inspection of their sites or regulation of their operations.
In the United States, the FFDCA, FDA regulations and other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, medical device design and development, preclinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, registration and listing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, advertising and promotion, sales and distribution and post-market surveillance. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or legal sanctions, such as warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Unlike manufacturers of medical devices, distributors are generally only required to comply with certain post-market requirements for medical devices, including reporting of complaints and adverse events related to device malfunctions, serious injuries or deaths associated with the medical device. In May 2020, the FDA issued guidance on temporary exceptions for post-market adverse event reporting for companies experiencing reduced workforces due to employee absenteeism as a result of COVID-19. Although continued, regular post-market adverse event reporting is encouraged during the pandemic, the FDA intends to exercise enforcement discretion if certain reports are not submitted to the FDA within the timeframes typically required by statute and regulation, provided that any delayed reports are submitted within six months of the restoration of adverse event reporting processes to their pre-pandemic state. This temporary guidance is limited to the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, or another period of time as determined by the FDA, after which post-market adverse event reporting requirements will apply in full force and effect.
We distribute an array of “legend devices” or medical devices that are regulated by the FDA and which only can be dispensed pursuant to a valid prescription from an appropriately licensed healthcare provider or restricted to use by a prescribing healthcare provider. Examples of such legend devices include CPAPs, ventilators and concentrators. Note that, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has issued guidance on temporary exceptions to the prescription requirement for ventilators in order to expand access to the devices. For example, the FDA is temporarily allowing NIV patient interfaces capable of prescribed breath to be used for patients requiring such ventilatory support. Under the same guidance, CPAP machines may be used to support patients with respiratory insufficiency under appropriate monitoring. These legend devices are commercially available finished medical devices and are not manufactured to our particular specifications. From time to time, for business and competitive reasons, we have entered into primary source agreements with manufacturers of these legend devices. Generally, we do not believe that such agreements pose a material risk that we will be unable to obtain needed devices in the event the manufacturer is disabled from providing a device or in the 

27



event we are prohibited from distributing devices in its inventory due to regulatory issues encountered by the manufacturer. However, these potential risks, and the resulting shortages of product that may occur, can interfere with our business.
Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Some of our operations may be subject to compliance with certain provisions of the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and comparable statutes in many states. Under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, a third-party collection company is restricted in the methods it uses to contact consumer debtors and elicit payments with respect to placed accounts. Requirements under state collection agency statutes vary, with most requiring compliance similar to that required under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and comparable state statutes where applicable. If our collection practices are viewed as inconsistent with these standards, we may be subject to damages and penalties.
Federal CAN-SPAM Act, Telephone Consumer Protection Act and Telemarketing Sales Rule. Some of our operations may be subject to compliance with certain provisions of the Federal CAN-SPAM Act, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991 (“TCPA”) and the Telemarketing Sales Rule and Medicare regulations. Under such regulations, companies are restricted in the methods used to contact consumers by email, telephone, and text message, for example, through the use of random or sequential “auto-dialer” type devices. Numerous class-action suits under federal and state laws have been filed in recent years against companies that conduct SMS texting programs, with many resulting in multi-million-dollar settlements to the plaintiffs. While the Supreme Court limited the scope of the TCPA’s reach in Facebook v. Duguid, requirements under state telephone contact laws will vary, with some requiring compliance more stringent than that required under the federal TCPA in light of the Supreme Court’s holding. We believe we are in substantial compliance with the federal regulations we are subject to, as well as state equivalents where applicable. The scope and interpretation of the laws that are or may be applicable to the delivery of consumer phone calls, emails and text messages are continuously evolving and developing. If we do not comply with these laws or regulations or if we become liable under these laws or regulations, we could face direct liability, could be required to change some portions of our business model, could face negative publicity and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.
Antitrust Laws. The federal government and most states have enacted antitrust laws that prohibit certain types of conduct deemed to be anti-competitive. These laws prohibit price fixing, market allocation, bid-rigging, concerted refusal to deal, market monopolization, price discrimination, tying arrangements, acquisitions of competitors and other practices that have, or may have, an adverse effect on competition. Violations of federal or state antitrust laws can result in various sanctions, including criminal and civil penalties. Antitrust enforcement in the healthcare sector is currently a priority of the FTC and the DOJ. In addition, the DOJ has been pursuing criminal antitrust enforcement actions for conduct of parties that the DOJ is alleging to be fixing wages or limiting worker mobility. We believe we are in compliance with such federal and state laws, but courts or regulatory authorities may reach a determination in the future that could adversely affect our operations.
Environmental Matters. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to hazardous materials, pollution and the protection of the environment. Such regulations include those governing emissions to air, discharges to water, storage, treatment and disposal of wastes, including medical waste, remediation of contaminated sites and protection of worker health and safety. These laws and regulations frequently change and have become increasingly stringent over time. Non-compliance with these laws and regulations may result in significant fines or penalties or limitations on our operations or claims for remediation costs, as well as alleged personal injury or property damages. We believe our current operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental, health and safety requirements and that we maintain all material permits required to operate our business.
Certain environmental laws and regulations impose strict, and under certain circumstances joint and several, liability for investigation and remediation of the release of regulated substances into the environment. Such liability can be imposed on current or former owners or operators of contaminated sites, or on persons who dispose or arrange for disposal of wastes at a contaminated site. Based on available information, we do not believe that any known compliance obligations, releases or investigations under environmental laws or regulations will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.

Seasonality
Our business is sensitive to seasonal fluctuations. Our patients are generally responsible for a greater percentage of the cost of their treatment or therapy during the early months of the year due to co-insurance, co-payments and deductibles, and therefore may defer treatment and services of certain therapies until meeting their annual deductibles. In addition, changes to employer insurance coverage often go into effect at the beginning of each calendar year which may impact eligibility requirements and delay or defer treatment or recognition of revenues. These factors may lead to lower total net revenues and cash flow in the early part of the year and higher total net revenues and cash flow in the latter half of the year. Additionally, the increased incidence of respiratory infections during the winter season may result in initiation of additional respiratory services such as oxygen therapy for certain patient populations. The Company earned 24% of annual net revenues during the three months ended March 31, 2021 and 2020 and earned 26% of annual net revenues during the three months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly in the future depending on these and other factors.
