 Overview
We are a pharmaceutical company focused on the acquisition, development, and commercialization of therapies for serious rare and life-threatening diseases with significant unmet medical needs. We identify and develop treatments where science can be applied in new ways for use in diseases with high unmet need.
In the U.S., OLPRUVA (sodium phenylbutyrate) for oral suspension was recently approved for the treatment of urea cycle disorders (“UCDs”) involving deficiencies of carbamylphosphate synthetase (“CPS”), ornithine transcarbamylase (“OTC”), or argininosuccinic acid synthetase (“AS”).1 We are also advancing a pipeline of investigational product candidates, including EDSIVO (celiprolol) for the treatment of vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (“vEDS”) patients with a confirmed type III collagen (COL3A1) mutation, and ACER-801 (osanetant) for the treatment of vasomotor symptoms (“VMS”), post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”), and prostate cancer, although the ACER-801 programs have all been paused due to top-line results announced in March 2023 from a Phase 2a proof of concept clinical trial to evaluate ACER-801 in VMS. We also intend to explore additional lifecycle opportunities for OLPRUVA (sodium phenylbutyrate) in various disorders where proof of concept data exists, subject to additional capital.

Our Approved Product
 OLPRUVA (sodium phenylbutyrate) for Oral Suspension
 
In December 2022, we and our collaboration partner, RELIEF THERAPEUTICS Holding SA (“Relief”), announced that the FDA has approved OLPRUVA (sodium phenylbutyrate) for oral suspension in the U.S. OLPRUVA is a prescription medicine used along with certain therapy, including changes in diet, for the long-term management of adults and children weighing 44 pounds (20 kg) or greater and with a body surface

 area (“BSA”) of 1.2 m2 or greater, with UCDs, involving deficiencies of CPS, OTC or AS. OLPRUVA is not used to treat rapid increase of ammonia in the blood (acute hyperammonemia), which can be life-threatening and requires emergency medical treatment.
 OLPRUVA is a proprietary and novel formulation of sodium phenylbutyrate powder, packaged for the first time in single-dose envelopes, that has shown bioequivalence to existing sodium phenylbutyrate powder but with a pH-sensitive polymer coating that is designed to minimize dissolution of the coating for up to five minutes after preparation.
 UCDs are a group of rare, genetic disorders that can cause harmful ammonia to build up in the blood, potentially resulting in brain damage and neurocognitive impairments, if ammonia levels are not controlled. Any increase in ammonia over time is serious. Therefore, it is important to adhere to any dietary protein restrictions and have alternative medication options to help control ammonia levels.
 OLPRUVA received FDA approval under section 505(b)(2) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), a regulatory pathway that allows applicants to rely, at least in part, on third party data for approval. In our New Drug Application (“NDA”), we cited preclinical and clinical safety and efficacy data from the reference listed drug (“RLD”), BUPHENYL® powder, which is approved as adjunctive therapy in the chronic management of patients with UCDs involving deficiencies of CPS, OTC or AS. In our NDA, we also provided additional data including studies that evaluated the bioavailability and bioequivalence of OLPRUVA compared to BUPHENYL® powder. The data from these studies, presented at the Society for Inherited Metabolic Disorders (SIMD) Annual Meeting in April 2022 and the Genetic Metabolic Dieticians International (GMDI) Conference in May 2022, showed that OLPRUVA was bioequivalent to BUPHENYL® powder.4,5
 Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA), the FDA deferred studies of OLPRUVA, a new dosage form of sodium phenylbutyrate, until Q4 2023. The PREA studies require development of dosage strength(s) to accommodate pediatric patients who weigh less than 20 kg and patients who weigh more than 20 kg with a body surface area of less than 1.2 m2. The FDA considers that OLPRUVA is appropriately labeled for use in pediatric patients weighing 20 kg or more and with a BSA of 1.2 m2 or more for this indication and therefore, no additional studies are needed in this pediatric population.
The FDA also required in vitro post-marketing requirement (PMR) studies to determine the feasibility of administering OLPRUVA suspension through enteral feeding tubes and to assess the potential drug interactions for sodium phenylbutyrate and its active metabolite, phenylacetate. Drug interaction studies for sodium phenylbutyrate and its active metabolite, phenylacetate, were not conducted on the 505(b)(2) reference product and are required by all recently approved new formulations of sodium phenylbutyrate.

To support the launch of OLPRUVA in the second quarter of 2023, subject to additional capital, we intend to continue to actively add resources to establish our commercial and medical affairs presence in the U.S. As a part of our OLPRUVA commercialization strategy, we have recently introduced our patient support service, OLPRUVA Navigator by Acer Therapeutics, that is designed to assist UCD patients with support, access, education, and patient adherence to treatment. Representatives will begin accepting prescriptions late in the second quarter of 2023. We are also actively engaged in negotiations regarding access for OLPRUVA with the major commercial payers and state Medicaid organizations.
In connection with the Company’s ongoing support for the rare disease patient community, we have also established a pricing strategy that reflects our commitment to deliver innovative treatments that are responsibly priced and accessible to those in need. As a result, we intend to price OLPRUVA competitively, at a significant discount to the currently available commercial product RAVICTI®, while implementing predictable pricing that will not increase beyond the rate of inflation. We also plan to invest a portion of OLPRUVA revenue back into additional solutions aimed at improving outcomes for UCD patients.
Important OLPRUVA Safety Information
Certain medicines may increase the level of ammonia in your blood or cause serious side effects when taken during treatment with OLPRUVA. Tell your doctor about all the medicines you or your child takes especially if you or your child takes corticosteroids, valproic acid, haloperidol, and/or probenecid.
 OLPRUVA can cause serious side effects, including: 1) nervous system problems (neurotoxicity). Symptoms include sleepiness, tiredness, lightheadedness, vomiting, nausea, headache, confusion, 2) low potassium levels in your blood (hypokalemia) and 3) conditions related to swelling (edema). OLPRUVA contains salt (sodium), which can cause swelling from salt and water retention. Tell your doctor right away if you or your child get any of these symptoms. Your doctor may do certain blood tests to check for side effects during treatment with OLPRUVA. If you have certain medical conditions such as heart, liver or kidney problems, are pregnant, planning to get pregnant or breast-feeding, your doctor will decide if OLPRUVA is right for you.
 The most common side effects of OLPRUVA include absent or irregular menstrual periods, decreased appetite, body odor, bad taste or avoiding foods you ate prior to getting sick (taste aversion). These are not all of the possible side effects of OLPRUVA. Call your doctor for medical advice about side effects. You may report side effects to the FDA at 1-800-FDA-1088.

 Collaboration Agreement with Relief Therapeutics Holding AG
 On January 25, 2021, we entered into an option agreement with Relief (the “Option Agreement”), pursuant to which we granted Relief an exclusive option (the “Exclusivity Option”) to pursue a potential collaboration and license arrangement with us for the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of OLPRUVA for the treatment of various inborn errors of metabolism, including UCDs and MSUD. The Option Agreement provided a period of time up to June 30, 2021, for the parties to perform additional due diligence and to work toward negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement with respect to the potential collaboration for OLPRUVA. In
consideration for the grant of the Exclusivity Option, (i) we received from Relief an upfront nonrefundable payment of $1.0 million, (ii) Relief provided to us a 12-month secured loan in the principal amount of $4.0 million, as evidenced by a Promissory Note (the “Note”) issued by us to Relief, and (iii) we granted to Relief a security interest in all of our assets to secure performance of the Note, as evidenced by a Security Agreement (the “Security Agreement”). The Note was repayable in one lump sum within 12 months from issuance and bore interest at a rate equal to 6% per annum.
On March 19, 2021, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Relief (the “Collaboration Agreement”) providing for the development and commercialization of OLPRUVA for the treatment of various inborn errors of metabolism, including for the treatment of UCDs and MSUD. We received a $10.0 million cash payment from Relief (i.e., a $14.0 million “Reimbursement Payment” offset by repayment of the $4.0 million outstanding balance of the Note, plus interest earned through the date of the Collaboration Agreement, and Relief released its security interest in all of our assets. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Relief committed to pay us up to an additional $20.0 million for U.S. development and commercial launch costs for the UCDs and MSUD indications (the “Development Payments”). During the three months ended June 30, 2021, we received from Relief the $10.0 million First Development Payment. We were contractually entitled to receive from Relief an additional $10.0 million Second Development Payment conditioned upon the FDA’s acceptance of an NDA for OLPRUVA in a UCD for filing and review. This acceptance was received on October 4, 2021. On October 6, 2021, we entered into a Waiver and Agreement with Relief to amend the timing for the Second Development Payment. We received the Second Development Payment in two $5.0 million tranches on each of October 12, 2021, and January 14, 2022. Further, we retained development and commercialization rights in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Turkey and Japan (“Acer Territory”). The companies will split net profits from the Acer Territory 60%:40% in favor of Relief. Relief licensed the rights for the rest of the world (“Relief Territory”), where we will receive from Relief a 15% royalty on all net sales received in the Relief Territory. We could also receive a total of $6.0 million in milestone payments based on the first European (EU) marketing approvals of OLPRUVA for a UCD and MSUD. There is no guarantee that OLPRUVA will receive regulatory authority approval in any territory outside the U.S. or become commercially available for indications still under investigation.
Our Investigational Product Candidates
 EDSIVO (celiprolol)
 EDSIVO is a selective adrenergic modulator (“SAM”) and, if approved for marketing by the FDA, would be a New Chemical Entity (“NCE”) in the U.S. Celiprolol is currently approved in the EU for the treatment of hypertension and angina. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (“EDS”) is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the genes responsible for the structure, production, or processing of collagen, an important component of the connective tissues in the human body, or proteins that interact with collagen. EDS is a spectrum disorder where patients present with various forms, the most serious of which is vascular EDS, also known as vEDS type IV, which is generally caused by a mutation in the COL3A1 gene. vEDS causes abnormal fragility in blood vessels, which can give rise to aneurysms, abnormal connections between blood vessels known as arteriovenous fistulas, arterial dissections, and spontaneous vascular ruptures, all of which can be potentially life-threatening. Gastrointestinal and uterine fragility or rupture also commonly occur in vEDS patients. Spontaneous arterial rupture has a peak incidence in the third or fourth decade of life in vEDS patients but may occur earlier and is the most common cause of sudden death in vEDS patients. Arterial rupture or dissection events occur in about 25% of patients before the age of 20 but increase to roughly 90% of patients by the age of 40. The median survival age of vEDS patients in the U.S. is 51 years, with arterial rupture being the most common cause of sudden death. Pregnancy-related complications also occur in women with vEDS and include arterial dissection or rupture, uterine rupture, hemorrhage, premature rupture of membranes, lacerations, and complications during and after surgery.
vEDS Diagnosis and Incidence
vEDS is diagnosed through clinical observation, which is usually confirmed by mutational analysis of the COL3A1 gene. In the absence of a family history of the disorder, however, most vEDS patients are not diagnosed until the occurrence of an arterial aneurysm or dissection, bowel perforation, or organ rupture. Currently, it is estimated that there are up to 7,500 COL3A1-positive vEDS patients in the U.S.
Current Treatment Options for vEDS
Currently, there are no approved pharmacologic therapies anywhere in the world for vEDS. However, celiprolol, prescribed off label, has become the standard of care therapy for vEDS in Europe. Medical intervention for vEDS focuses on surgery, symptomatic treatment, genetic counseling, and prophylactic measures, such as avoiding intense physical activity, scuba diving, and violent sports. Arterial, digestive, or uterine complications in vEDS patients typically require immediate hospitalization, observation in an intensive care unit, and sometimes surgery. Pregnant women with vEDS are considered to be at risk and receive special care.
While vEDS patients are encouraged to take steps to minimize the chances of an arterial rupture or dissection, there are no pharmacologic options to reduce the likelihood of such an event, and accordingly current treatments for vEDS focus on the repair of arterial ruptures or dissection. Therefore, patients must adopt a “watch and wait” approach following any confirmed diagnosis. Unfortunately, many of these arterial events have high mortality associated with them, and thus, a pharmacologic intervention that reduces the rate of events would be clinically meaningful.
Rationale for EDSIVO (celiprolol) Treatment in vEDS
BBEST Trial
 In October 2010, researchers at Assistance Publique—Hôpitaux de Paris, Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou (“AP-HP”) in Paris, France, published in the Lancet results from its BBEST trial designed to assess the preventive effect of celiprolol for major cardiovascular events in patients with vEDS via a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open trial with blinded evaluation of clinical events.
 Fifty-three participants were enrolled in the BBEST trial and randomly assigned to a five-year intervention, receiving either celiprolol or no treatment with important phenotype characteristics equally balanced between the celiprolol group and the control group. Thirty-three of the 53 patients participating in the study had proven mutations in the COL3A1 gene. Of those patients with proven mutations, demographic and arterial characteristics did not differ from those of the study population as a whole. The duration of follow-up was five years or until the first qualifying cardiac or arterial event. The primary endpoint was a composite of cardiac or arterial events (rupture or dissection, fatal or not) during follow-up. Secondary endpoints were gastrointestinal or uterine rupture. The study was ended early after a consensus decision of the safety monitoring board, the methodologist of AP-HP, and the principal investigator because significant differences were recorded between the treatment group and the control group after 64 months. Mean duration of follow-up was 47 months prior to trial halt. Five of 25 patients on celiprolol a primary endpoint was recorded, compared with 14 of 28 patients in the control group. The hazard ratio (“HR”) for event-free survival, was 0.36, (95% CI 0.15—0.88; p=0.040), meaning that with celiprolol the risk of having a cardiac or arterial event was reduced by 64% compared to control. Combined primary and secondary endpoints affected 6 patients on celiprolol and 17 patients in the control group, (HR 0.31; 95% CI 0.14—0.71; p=0.0097).
 As described in the figure below, in the 33 patients with COL3A1 mutations, the primary endpoint was noted in 2 of the 13 patients in the treatment group, compared with 11 of the 20 patients in the control group, (HR 0.24; 95% CI 0.08—0.71; p=0.0406). Combined primary and secondary endpoints were recorded in 3 of 13 patients on celiprolol and 14 of the patients in the control group, (HR 0.25; 95% CI 0.10—0.64; p=0.0167), correlating to a three times reduction in arterial events among treated patients compared to non-treated patients. The results in the trial did not vary significantly between those patients who had a confirmed mutation in the COL3A1 gene versus the overall 53-patient population:

 AP-HP granted us an exclusive right to access and use the data generated by the BBEST trial. We have conducted a retrospective, source-verified analysis of that data, including the primary and secondary endpoints, which confirmed the published results of the BBEST trial.
 Long-Term Observational Study: France
 In addition to the BBEST trial, in April 2019, long-term data from a cohort of COL3A1-positive vEDS patients was published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology (“JACC”). The publication, entitled “Vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome: Long-Term Observational Study,” was authored by Michael Frank, MD, Xavier Jeunemaitre, MD, PhD, and Pierre Boutouyrie, MD, PhD, et al. This published study describes outcomes in 144 COL3A1-positive vEDS patients clinically monitored and treated at the French National Referral Center for Rare Vascular Diseases (Paris, France) between 2000 and 2017. Patients were followed for a median of 5.3 years, and up to 20 years. At the initial work up, 50% of patients were not treated regularly and only 33.3% were taking celiprolol; by the end of the study period, the majority (90.3%) were treated with celiprolol alone or in combination with other medications. Once the maximum tolerated dose of celiprolol was reached, 90 (62.5%) patients remained at this dose throughout their follow-up. Only five (3.5%) patients required dose reduction due to fatigue, and no serious drug-related adverse event was recorded.
 Patients had a lower mortality rate than that expected from the natural history of the disease as described in previous U.S. reports. Survival curve analysis showed that those not treated with celiprolol had a significantly worse outcome than celiprolol-treated patients: survival was 80.7% (95% CI 67.8%–93.6%) in those treated with celiprolol versus 48.5% (95% CI 19.7%–77.4%) in those not treated (p<0.001) after 11.1 years of follow-up. Survival was significantly higher in patients treated with a median dose of celiprolol of 400mg/day (n=83) vs. patients treated with a lower median dose of 217mg/d [100-300mg/day] (n=27), suggesting a dose effect and that 400mg/day should be considered the optimal dose. The authors also observed a relative decrease in hospitalization rates for acute arterial events during the time period in which the majority of patients were on celiprolol, suggesting a positive
effect of celiprolol on the incidence and/or severity of new arterial events. The authors concluded that in this large, long-term cohort study, vEDS patients had a higher survival rate than expected relative to the known natural history of the disease and a lower annual occurrence of arterial complications, and that celiprolol use was potentially associated with these significant improvements in clinical outcomes.
Long-Term Observational Study: Sweden
 In November 2020, long-term data from COL3A1-positive vEDS patients was published in the European Journal of Vascular and Endovascular Surgery (“EJVES”), “Celiprolol treatment in patients with vascular Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome.” This published study describes outcomes in 40 patients with COL3A1-positive vEDS that were clinically monitored and treated with celiprolol in a single center retrospective study at Uppsala University Hospital, a national referral center for vEDS patients in Sweden, between the years 2011 and 2019. Patients were followed for a median of 22 months (range 1-98 months) with a total follow up of 106 patient years. Assessments were conducted by a multidisciplinary team, including vascular surgeons, angiologists and clinical geneticists. Celiprolol was administered twice daily and titrated up by 100 mg steps to a maximum of 400 mg per day. Some patients were treated concomitantly or separately with other medications. Sixty-five percent of the patients reached the target dose of 400mg, and the medication was generally well tolerated.
 The annual risk of a major vascular event was 4.7% in this study, noted as being similar to that observed in the celiprolol treatment-arm of the BBEST trial (5%) and lower than in the BBEST trial control arm (12%). Five patients suffered major vascular events, four of which were fatal. No significant predictor of vascular events was identified by the authors.
 Registration Plan
 Celiprolol has not been approved for any indication in the U.S. Celiprolol has been approved for the treatment of hypertension in the EU since 1984. An NDA for celiprolol for the treatment for hypertension was submitted to the FDA by Rorer (subsequently acquired by Aventis Pharma SA (“Aventis”)) in June 1987 but was withdrawn prior to FDA review and therefore never approved. We have obtained the exclusive right in North and South America from Aventis to reference the celiprolol data included in the marketing authorization dossier filed with and approved by the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”). We have also licensed from AP-HP exclusive worldwide rights to the data from the BBEST trial.
We are developing EDSIVO (celiprolol), an NCE in the U.S., for the treatment of COL3A1 positive vEDS patients. Celiprolol received FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of vEDS in 2015. A Celiprolol NDA was originally submitted based on data obtained from the BBEST trial and accepted for filing in October 2018 with priority review. Following FDA review, we received a Complete Response Letter from the FDA stating that it will be necessary to conduct an adequate and well-controlled trial to determine whether celiprolol reduces the risk of clinical events in patients with vEDS. We subsequently appealed the FDA decision and while the FDA denied the appeal, it described possible paths forward for us to explore. In a Type B meeting in May 2021, we discussed with the FDA the conduct of an U.S.-based prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, decentralized clinical trial in patients with COL3A1 positive vEDS, and sought the FDA’s opinion on various proposed design features of the study. The official Type B meeting minutes confirmed: the acceptability of a decentralized (virtual) clinical trial design and use of an independent centralized adjudication committee; acceptability of a primary endpoint based on clinical events associated with disease outcome; agreement with modest safety data collection (based on the known safety profile of the drug9,10,12); and a statistical plan that considers the rare disease classification of vEDS.
 In April 2022 the FDA granted celiprolol Breakthrough Therapy designation (“BTD”) in the U.S. for the treatment of patients with COL3A1-positive vEDS. In May 2022 we reached agreement with the FDA under a Special Protocol Assessment (“SPA”) for our pivotal Phase 3 DiSCOVER (Decentralized Study of Celiprolol on vEDS-related Event Reduction) clinical trial of EDSIVO (celiprolol) for the treatment of patients with COL3A1-positive vEDS. In June 2022, we announced the initiation of patient screening in our Phase 3 DiSCOVER clinical trial of EDSIVO (celiprolol) and anticipate enrollment completion in Q4 2023. The primary objective of the DiSCOVER trial is to compare time to first occurrence of a confirmed clinical event between the celiprolol group and the placebo group among confirmed COL3A1-positive vEDS patients. The double-blind portion of the
DiSCOVER trial is intended to end if statistical significance is reached at an interim analysis which occurs at accrual of 28 vEDS-related events, estimated to occur as early as approximately 18 months after completion of full enrollment, or after accrual of 46 vEDS-related clinical events.
EDSIVO is an investigational drug and is not currently FDA approved for any indication. There can be no assurance that the clinical trial will be successful, or that any resubmission of an NDA will be approved.
 ACER-801 (osanetant)
 ACER-801 (osanetant) is an investigational non-hormonal, neurokinin 3 receptor (“NK3R”) antagonist that is being developed as a potential treatment option for patients with VMS, including menopause related VMS (“MR-VMS”) and induced VMS (“iVMS”), as well as post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”), and prostate cancer. In December 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Sanofi to acquire worldwide rights to ACER-801.
 In March 2023, we announced that topline results from our Phase 2a proof of concept clinical trial to evaluate ACER-801 as a potential treatment for moderate to severe VMS associated with menopause showed that ACER-801 was safe and well-tolerated but did not achieve statistical significance when evaluating ACER-801’s ability to decrease the frequency or severity of hot flashes in postmenopausal women. As a result, we are pausing the ACER-801 program until we have conducted a thorough review of the full data set.
 MR-VMS and iVMS Background
VMS are caused by a disruption in sex hormone signaling in the brain, resulting in menopausal-like symptoms (hot flashes, night sweats, etc.) and most often occur in women during menopausal transition or in menopause (MR-VMS). VMS are causally related to decreasing estradiol concentrations, mainly in the serum and subsequently also in the temperature regulating center located in the hypothalamus. The lack of estrogen alters neurotransmitter activity, especially in the neurokinin-B, serotonergic, and noradrenergic pathways.
 Menopausal transition (“MT”) begins in women between ages 45 and 55 and can last up to 10 years. During MT up to 80% of women experience MR-VMS and 64% of women with VMS experience moderate to severe symptoms. VMS leads to significant impact on patient quality of life, including sleep deprivation, lack of focus, and anxiety/depression. We believe an effective non-hormonal treatment is needed to address the needs of women with moderate to severe MR-VMS.
VMS can also be induced (“iVMS”) by anti-androgen and anti-estrogen cancer therapies and surgical procedures altering sex hormone production.13,14 VMS are caused by low estrogen levels leading to increased stimulatory signaling of NKB on the Kisspeptin/Neurokinin B/Dynorphin (“KNDy”) neurons in the hypothalamus. A non-hormonal treatment to manage iVMS is needed as estrogen is contraindicated for the management of VMS in patients with hormone-positive tumors, including breast and prostate tumors.
 iVMS are well documented with the use of cancer therapies and certain surgical procedures. Symptoms such as hot flashes can appear immediately and be severe. Cancer therapy side effects can lead to treatment non-adherence which increases the mortality risk and/or shortens the time to recurrence. We believe a treatment for iVMS is needed to help certain cancer patients to be more likely to start and stay on critical cancer therapies.

 Rationale for Evaluation of ACER-801 Treatment for VMS
 NKB/NK3R is implicated in a variety of human functions and affects the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadal axis, which plays a critical part in the development and regulation of a number of the body’s systems, such as the reproductive and immune systems. Clinical proof of concept studies with other NK3R antagonists have shown rapid and clinically meaningful improvement in vasomotor symptoms in post-menopausal women.
 ACER-801 was originally developed by Sanofi as osanetant (SR142801) for the treatment of symptoms associated with schizophrenia. Development was discontinued in 2005. Direct human safety evidence is available from 23 completed Phase 1 and 2 studies of whom approximately 400 healthy subjects and 820 patients were treated with osanetant for schizophrenia, depression, and other indications. Data from these studies indicated no major safety concerns after single-dose and repeat-dose administration. ACER-801 is orally bioavailable and readily crosses the blood-brain barrier.

Recent Clinical Trial Results
 As noted above, in March 2023, we announced that topline results from our Phase 2a proof of concept clinical trial to evaluate ACER-801 (osanetant) as a potential treatment for moderate to severe Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS) associated with menopause showed that ACER-801 was safe and well-tolerated but did not achieve statistical significance when evaluating ACER-801’s ability to decrease the frequency or severity of hot flashes in postmenopausal women. As a result, we are pausing the ACER-801 program until we have conducted a thorough review of the full data set.
 In the Phase 2a study, forty-nine postmenopausal women aged 40-65 who experienced moderate to severe hot flashes were randomized 1:1:1:1 and received either twice daily 50 mg, 100 mg, 200 mg of ACER-801 or placebo over a 14-day treatment period, followed by a 14-day safety follow-up assessment. Primary endpoints were safety and pharmacokinetics, with efficacy compared to placebo as a secondary endpoint.
Acute Stress Disorder and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder Background
 Acute stress disorder (“ASD”) refers to the body’s immediate response to trauma, whereas post-traumatic stress disorder (“PTSD”) is defined as the long-term effects of trauma. While the role of the neurokinin 3 receptor (“NK3R”) pathway in the hypothalamus to manage thermoregulation is well-established in clinical trials, evaluation of osanetant in these indications would provide an opportunity to explore a different mechanism of action for the drug candidate.
 In May 2021, we entered into an agreement with Emory University for an exclusive worldwide license to U.S. Patent No. 10,314,835, US Application 15/320,952, and European Patent No. EP3160469 covering certain methods of treating or preventing PTSD with osanetant.
 ASD and PTSD Diagnosis and Incidence
 According to the National Center for PTSD, in the U.S. about 60% of men and 50% of women experience at least one trauma in their lives leading to approximately 12 million adults in the U.S. experiencing PTSD during a given year.19 In the U.S. alone, one-third of emergency department visits are for evaluation after trauma exposures and up to 20% of people who have experienced a traumatic event will develop PTSD. In addition, within one month of a trauma, survivors show rates of ASD ranging from 6% to 33% depending on the type of trauma.20,21
 Rationale for ACER-801 Treatment for ASD and PTSD
 Studies conducted at Emory University screened thousands of genes that were activated in the brains of mice following fear conditioning events. The top gene identified was Tac2, which is responsible for the production of the peptide, Neurokinin B (NKB), in mice. The researchers showed that the Tac2 gene, expressed by neurons specifically within the amygdala, is required for modulating fear memories, and that NKB, and its specific receptor, NK3R, are also involved in the consolidation of fear memories. By administering the potent and specific NK3R antagonist, osanetant, they were able to block fear memory consolidation shortly after exposure to a trauma, supporting development of a potential novel therapeutic approach for disorders with altered fear learning such as PTSD.
 The Tac3 gene encodes tachykinin receptor 3 (NK3R), which belongs to the tachykinin receptor family. This family of proteins includes typical G protein-coupled receptors and belongs to the rhodopsin subfamily. NK3R functions by binding to its high-affinity ligand, neurokinin B (“NKB”), which is encoded by the Tac3 (human) gene. The role of NKB-NK3R in growth and reproduction has been extensively studied, but NKB-NK3R is also widely expressed in the nervous system from the spinal cord to the brain and is involved in both physiological and pathological processes in the nervous system. In animal models, Tac2 (mice) mRNA levels are rapidly up-regulated during fear consolidation 30 minutes after fear conditioning, and subsequent NKB-NK3R activation can lead to over stress sensitization and the consolidation of fear, and treatment with osanetant has been shown to
block a critical fear/stress sensitization step in the brain.23,25,26 An effective therapeutic to reduce acute and persistent/long-term psychological and somatic symptoms would fulfill a large unmet need.
 Registration Status in ASD and PTSD
 In October 2022, following our announced expansion of our ACER-801 program into ASD and PTSD, we reported that the University of North Carolina Institute for Trauma Recovery has been awarded a $3.0 million grant from the Department of Defense to investigate the potential of ACER-801 to reduce the frequency and severity of acute stress disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. We are pausing the ACER-801 program in all indications until we have conducted a thorough review of the full data from our Phase 2a proof of concept clinical trial to evaluate ACER-801 (osanetant) as a potential treatment for moderate to severe Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS) associated with menopause. Topline results from this trial showed that ACER-801 was safe and well-tolerated but did not achieve statistical significance when evaluating ACER-801’s ability, when compared to placebo, to decrease the frequency or severity of hot flashes in postmenopausal women.

 Commercialization Strategy
We expect that the majority of UCDs, and/or vEDS patients (if EDSIVO is approved) would be treated at tertiary care centers, and therefore could be addressed with a targeted sales force. UCD patients are primarily managed by metabolic geneticists and dietitians, while vEDS patients would primarily be treated by vascular medicine or cardiology specialists. We intend to build our own commercial infrastructure in the U.S. to target these centers and will evaluate whether to commercialize in other geographies ourselves or with an experienced partner, such as Relief for OLPRUVA (sodium phenylbutyrate) for oral suspension.
Competition
The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. We face competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Given the significant unmet medical needs for novel therapies to treat UCDs, vEDS, iVMS, PTSD, and prostate cancer, many companies, public and private universities, and research organizations are actively engaged in the discovery, research and development of product candidates to treat these conditions. As a result, there are and will likely continue to be extensive resources invested in the discovery and development of new products to treat these unmet medical needs. We anticipate facing intense and increasing competition as new products enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
Our potential competitors and the related stage of development for their product candidates in our target indications for OLPRUVA (sodium phenylbutyrate) for oral suspension, EDSIVO (celiprolol), and ACER-801 (osanetant), include the following:
•UCDs: Horizon Pharma plc / Immedica Group (Marketed); Medunik USA (Marketed)
 •vEDS: Aytu BioPharma (AR101/enzastaurin development indefinitely suspended October 2022)
 •iVMS: Astellas (Phase 3); Bayer (Phase 3); Veru (Phase 2); Que Oncology (Phase 2)
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with strategic partners, have or will have substantially greater financial, technical, and human resources compared with us. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful in developing or marketing products and technologies that are more effective, safer or less costly. Additionally, our
competitors may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly and may achieve more widespread market acceptance. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies and acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.
There are other non-pharmaceutical therapeutic approaches that are used or may be used for our targeted indications. For example, liver transplantation may be used in some cases to treat UCDs in pediatric patients who have developed acute liver failure.
We believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the development and commercial success of our product candidates are efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, convenience in dosing, product labeling, price, product access and continuity of supply, and the availability of reimbursement.
License Agreements
 Baylor College of Medicine
 In April 2014, we obtained exclusive rights to patents and certain other intellectual property relating to OLPRUVA for the treatment of inborn errors of BCAA metabolism, including MSUD, and preclinical and clinical data, through an exclusive license agreement with BCM. Under the terms of the agreement, as amended, we have worldwide exclusive rights to develop, manufacture, use, sell and import products incorporating the licensed intellectual property. The license agreement requires us to make upfront and annual payments to BCM, reimburse certain of BCM’s legal costs, make payments upon achievement of defined milestones, and pay low single-digit percent royalties on net sales of any developed product over the royalty term.
Aventis Pharma SA
In June 2016, we entered into an agreement with Aventis Pharma SA (now Sanofi) granting us the exclusive access and exclusive right to use the data included in the marketing authorization application dossier filed with and approved by the MHRA in 1986 for the treatment of mild to moderate hypertension pursuant to the UK regulatory approval procedure, for the sole purpose of allowing us to further develop, manufacture, register and commercialize celiprolol in the U.S. and Brazil for the treatment of EDS, Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome. We have paid in full for the exclusive access and right to use the data. Subsequently we amended our agreement with Sanofi to provide the same rights to data access and use for potential marketing approval in all of North and South America.
 Assistance Publique—Hôpitaux de Paris, Hôpital Européen Georges Pompidou (“AP-HP”)
In August 2016, we entered into an agreement with AP-HP granting us the exclusive worldwide rights to access and use data from a multicenter, prospective, randomized, open trial related to the use of celiprolol for the treatment of vEDS. We utilized this clinical data to support the initial NDA filing for EDSIVOTM for the treatment of vEDS. The agreement requires us to make certain upfront payments to AP-HP, reimburse certain of AP-HP’s costs, make payments upon achievement of defined milestones, and pay low single-digit percent royalties on net sales of celiprolol over the royalty term.
In September 2018, we entered into an additional agreement with AP-HP to acquire the exclusive worldwide intellectual property rights to three European patent applications relating to certain uses of celiprolol including (i) the optimal dose of celiprolol in treating vEDS patients, (ii) the use of celiprolol during pregnancy, and (iii) the use of celiprolol to treat kyphoscoliotic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (type VI). Pursuant to the agreement, we will reimburse AP-HP for certain costs and will pay annual maintenance fee payments. Subject to a minimum royalty amount, we will also pay royalty payments on annual net sales of celiprolol during the royalty term in the low single digit percent range, depending upon whether there is a valid claim of a licensed patent. Under the agreement, we will control and pay the costs of ongoing patent prosecution and maintenance for the licensed applications. We subsequently filed three U.S. patent applications on this subject matter in October 2018. We may choose to limit our pursuit of patent applications to specific territories, in which case AP-HP would have the right to revise our territorial license rights accordingly. For example, we have notified AP-HP we will not further pursue any patent
rights for the pregnancy and type VI use in any country.
 Sanofi
 In December 2018, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with Sanofi granting us worldwide rights to ACER-801 (osanetant), a clinical-stage, selective, non-peptide tachykinin NK3 receptor antagonist. The agreement requires us to make certain upfront payments to Sanofi, make payments upon achievement of defined development and sales milestones, and pay royalties on net sales of ACER-801 over the royalty term.
Relief
 On January 25, 2021, we entered into the Option Agreement with Relief, pursuant to which we granted Relief the Exclusivity Option to pursue a potential collaboration and license arrangement with us for the development, regulatory approval and commercialization of OLPRUVA for the treatment of various inborn errors of metabolism, including UCDs and MSUD. The Option Agreement provided a period of time up to June 30, 2021, for the parties to perform additional due diligence and to work toward negotiation and execution of a definitive agreement with respect to the potential collaboration for OLPRUVA. In consideration for the grant of the Exclusivity Option, (i) we received from Relief an upfront nonrefundable payment of $1.0 million, (ii) Relief provided to us a 12-month secured loan in the principal amount of $4.0 million, as evidenced by the Note issued by us to Relief, and (iii) we granted to Relief a security interest in all of our assets to secure performance of the Note, as evidenced by the Security Agreement. The Note was repayable in one lump sum within 12 months from issuance and bore interest at a rate equal to 6% per annum.
On March 19, 2021, we entered into the Collaboration Agreement with Relief providing for the development and commercialization of OLPRUVA for the treatment of various inborn errors of metabolism, including for the treatment of UCDs and MSUD. We received a $10.0 million cash payment from Relief (i.e., a $14.0 million “Reimbursement Payment,” offset by repayment of the $4.0 million outstanding balance of the Note plus interest earned through the date of the Collaboration Agreement), and Relief released its security interest in all of our assets. Under the terms of the Collaboration Agreement, Relief committed to pay us up to an additional $20.0 million for U.S. development and commercial launch costs for the UCDs and MSUD indications (the “Development Payments”). During the three months ended June 30, 2021, we received from Relief the $10.0 million First Development Payment. We were contractually entitled to receive from Relief an additional $10.0 million Second Development Payment conditioned upon the FDA’s acceptance of an NDA for OLPRUVA in a UCD for filing and review. This acceptance was received on October 4, 2021. On October 6, 2021, we entered into a Waiver and Agreement with Relief to amend the timing for the Second Development Payment. We received the Second Development Payment in two $5.0 million tranches on each of October 12, 2021, and January 14, 2022. Further, we retained development and commercialization rights in the U.S., Canada, Brazil, Turkey and Japan (“Acer Territory”). The companies will split net profits from the Acer Territory 60%:40% in favor of Relief. Relief licensed the rights for the rest of the world (“Relief Territory”), where we will receive from Relief a 15% royalty on all net sales received in the Relief Territory. We could also receive a total of $6.0 million in milestone payments based on the first European (EU) marketing approvals of OLPRUVA for a UCD and MSUD. There is no guarantee that OLPRUVA will receive regulatory authority approval in territories outside the U.S. or become commercially available for indications still under investigation.
Emory University
 In May 2021, we entered into an agreement with Emory University to acquire the exclusive worldwide intellectual property rights to a family of patents and patent applications related to the use of neurokinin receptor antagonists in managing conditioned fear and treating anxiety disorders including post-traumatic stress disorder. We have obtained issued claims in both Europe and the United States and continue to pursue additional claim scope in both jurisdictions. Pursuant to the agreement, we reimburse Emory for certain patent prosecution costs and annual maintenance fees. Should we obtain approval for a treatment method within the scope of a valid claim of a licensed patent, we will be obligated to make royalty payments on annual net sales of osanetant either in the low single digit
percent range, or alternatively, that meet an agreed minimum royalty.
 Manufacturing
We contract with third parties for the manufacture, testing, and storage of our approved product and product candidates and intend to continue to do so in the future. We do not own and have no plans to build our own manufacturing capabilities for clinical or commercial supply. We have hired both internal resources and consultants with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical, regulatory and quality assurance and control experience to oversee contract manufacturing and testing activities, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions.
Intellectual Property
OLPRUVA (sodium phenylbutyrate)
 We have obtained both U.S. and foreign patents with claims related to OLPRUVATM. U.S. Pat. Nos. 11,154,521 (October 2021 press release) and 11,433,041(issued Sept. 6, 2022) are directed to pharmaceutical compositions, including OLPRUVA’s polymer coated, multi-particulate dosage formulation for oral administration. U.S. Pat. No. 11,202,767 (December 2021 press release) covers certain methods of use claims related to OLPRUVA. Additionally, we have obtained patents in Europe, Israel, and Mexico related to pharmaceutical compositions, including OLPRUVA’s polymer coated, multi-particulate dosage formulation for oral administration. These patents expire in 2036.
 In October 2022 we announced that the USPTO issued a Notice of Allowance to Acer for US patent application No. 16/624,834 for claims related to a kit comprising a combination therapeutic product composed of sodium phenylbutyrate or glycerol phenylbutyrate and sodium benzoate. That application has now issued as U.S. Patent No. 11,517,547 and is exclusively licensed to Acer from Baylor College of Medicine, with an expiration date of June 28, 2038.
In July 2022, we announced that the China National Intellectual Property Administration (“CNIPA”) issued Electronic Patent Certificate ZL202122004991.9 on May 24, 2022, for Utility Model directed to OLPRUVA (sodium phenylbutyrate). Specifically, the newly issued patent covers dosage form claims related to OLPRUVA’s polymer coated formulation for oral administration as a potential treatment for UCDs and MSUD. The newly issued patent has an expiration date of August 24, 2031.
 We obtained exclusive rights to certain patents and other intellectual property from BCM for the use of sodium phenylbutyrate (NaPB) for the treatment of inborn errors of BCAA metabolism, including MSUD. The licensed patents cover methods and compositions for treating humans (and animals) with various formulations and prodrugs of NaPB for inborn errors of BCAA metabolism, including MSUD, and the latest expires in 2032. We made filings in the geographic regions that represent the largest incidence and prevalence of MSUD: the U.S., selected countries in Europe (including Turkey), and Brazil. BCM has been issued three patents in the U.S. and one in the European Union with respect to OLPRUVA, each of which was exclusively licensed to us pursuant to our agreement with BCM.
We also expect to benefit from potential commercial exclusivity afforded to the first drug approved after obtaining Orphan Drug designation for the treatment of MSUD. Orphan Drug exclusivity provides, upon the approval by the FDA of a drug intended to treat a rare condition, seven years of marketing exclusivity, during which time the FDA will not approve the same drug for the same indication unless it demonstrates clinical superiority. Orphan Drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving the same drug for a different indication, or a different drug for the same indication. We were granted Orphan Drug designation for OLPRUVA for the treatment of MSUD by the FDA in August 2014.
 Furthermore, we may qualify to receive an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity in the U.S., which runs consecutively to an existing exclusivity, if we conduct a successful pediatric study of OLPRUVA for the treatment of MSUD, approved by the FDA for this purpose.

EDSIVO
We intend to protect our commercial rights to EDSIVOTM (celiprolol) in the U.S. via multiple pathways. We believe that we will be eligible for NCE exclusivity for EDSIVOTM, which provides upon approval as an NCE five years of marketing exclusivity, during which time the FDA will not approve another drug with the same active ingredient, regardless of the indication for use, in the U.S. In January 2015, the FDA granted celiprolol Orphan Drug Designation, which provides upon the approval of a drug intended to treat a rare condition seven years of marketing exclusivity during which time the FDA will not approve the same drug for the same indication, unless it demonstrates clinical superiority. Orphan Drug exclusivity does not prevent the FDA from approving the same drug for a different indication, or a different drug for the same indication. NCE exclusivity and Orphan Drug exclusivity run concurrently. Furthermore, EDSIVOTM may qualify for an additional six months of pediatric exclusivity in the U.S., which requires the submission of one or more studies in pediatric subjects that meet requirements to be specified by the FDA in a written request for pediatric studies. Pediatric exclusivity can be obtained either before or after NDA approval. Pediatric exclusivity is attached to the end of an existing exclusivity and runs consecutively. We may also consider making modifications to the formulation to seek to obtain additional intellectual property. While unapproved drugs may be imported into the U.S. under specified circumstances, such as for use in clinical studies under a valid and effective IND or for further manufacture into an IND drug or an approved drug, we intend to aggressively assert our rights, via regulatory and legal means, to limit the importation of non-FDA approved versions of celiprolol. We intend to provide a robust patient assistance program (“PAP”) to offset costs associated with a high priced therapeutic to minimize the incentive for vEDS patients in the U.S. to seek to obtain celiprolol elsewhere.
In October 2022, we announced that the USPTO issued a Notice of Allowance for our patent application No. 16/930,208, exclusively licensed from Assistance Publique—Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), for claims related to certain methods of vEDS with celiprolol. This application, titled “Method of Providing Celiprolol Therapy to a Patient,” has now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 11,523,997, with an expiration date of November 19, 2038. The issued patent claims include the dosing regimen in our ongoing Phase 3 DiSCOVER clinical trial of EDSIVO (celiprolol) for the treatment of patients with COL3A1-positive vEDS.
 In October 2018, we entered into an additional agreement with AP-HP for exclusive rights to three U.S. patent applications, as described above in License Agreements.
 ACER-801
 We believe that ACER-801 (osanetant), if approved today by the FDA for marketing, would qualify as a new chemical entity (“NCE”) in the U.S., and as such, would be eligible for five years of market exclusivity following potential FDA approval. Additional exclusivity would depend on the indications selected and the development pathway that is chosen. We intend to explore various pathways to protect our commercial rights to ACER-801 in multiple rare and life-threatening neuroendocrine disorders. These potentially include various conditions associated with cancer, VMS, and trauma. In support of these development pathways, we continue to evaluate filing patent applications and acquiring existing intellectual property. For example, we have obtained exclusive rights to certain patent rights from Emory University for the use of neurokinin receptor antagonists in treatment of conditioned fear and post-traumatic stress disorder. The licensed patents have issued in the United States as U.S. Pat. No. 10,314,835 and select countries in Europe as EP 3160469 and have an expiration date of 2035.
 If our products are approved, we intend to submit our patents, to the extent eligible, for listing by the FDA in its Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, or Orange Book.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Government authorities in the U.S. at the federal, state and local level and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the use of unapproved drugs, preclinical and clinical studies, development, testing, quality control, manufacture, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, labeling, advertising, promotion, distribution, import, and export of pharmaceutical products such as those we are developing. The process for obtaining approvals or authorizations to market a drug product in the U.S. and in foreign countries and jurisdictions, along with pre- and
post-approval compliance with applicable statutes and regulations, require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. This section discusses, in general terms, the typical approval process. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and by the appropriate foreign regulatory agency before they may be legally marketed in foreign countries. Generally, our activities in other countries will be subject to regulation that is similar in nature and scope as that imposed in the U.S., although there can be important differences. Additionally, some significant aspects of approval requirements within the European Union are addressed uniformly, while country-specific requirements must also be met.
U.S. Drug Approval Process. In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the FFDCA and the FDA’s implementing regulations. Drugs are also subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining marketing approvals and pre- and post-approval compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time before or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s complete response to a pending NDA, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold on a clinical study or studies, issuance of a warning letter or untitled letter, product recall, product seizure, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunction, fines, refusals or cancellation of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement, or civil or criminal penalties.
The standard process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s current good laboratory practice (“cGLP”) regulations 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND to which the FDA has no objections and which must become effective before clinical trials in the U.S. may begin 
 •approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) for each clinical site before each trial may be initiated 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug candidate for each proposed indication in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Clinical Practice (“cGCP”) regulations, IND regulations, and human subject protection regulations
 •meet Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) requirements, if applicable
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA
 •satisfactory review by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) regulation and to assure that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, manufacture, processing, and packing are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity
 •FDA review of the NDA and decision (approved or issue a complete response letter)
 Preclinical Studies. Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product. An IND sponsor must submit, directly or by cross-reference, the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical trial protocol, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises questions or concerns, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks, related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials. Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug (“IND”) to subjects or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with IND regulations and human subject protection regulations as well as cGCP standards, which include the requirement that all research patients undergo an informed consent process and provide their informed consent for participation in any clinical trial and that an IRB approve each study before it begins. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB for each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve each protocol and protocol amendment for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the NIH for public dissemination on their ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three or four sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into a small number of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion or, on occasion, in patients with severe problems or life-threatening disease to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for a specific targeted disease, gather additional safety information and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage, and method of delivery.
Phase 3: The drug is administered to a larger patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product to determine effectiveness, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product and ultimately to support approval.
Phase 4: In some cases, the FDA may condition approval of an NDA for a product candidate on the sponsor’s agreement to conduct additional clinical trials after NDA approval. In other cases, a sponsor may voluntarily conduct additional clinical trials post-approval to gain more information about the drug. Such post-approval trials are typically referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials.
Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious and unexpected adverse reactions occur. Trial sponsors must monitor other information including published as well as unpublished scientific papers, reports from foreign regulatory authorities and reports of foreign commercial marketing experience for the investigational drug and notify the FDA and clinical trial investigators of certain information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may fail to be completed successfully within a specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA may impose a clinical hold on one or more or all of the clinical studies or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial or development of an investigational product at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Development, or the aspects of development, that are affected by the clinical hold may not continue unless and until the sponsor addresses all of the FDA’s concerns and has been notified that the hold is removed. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate its approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the protocol or the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Nearly all Phase 3 trials and some other trials are overseen by a Data and Safety Monitoring Board (“DSMB”) which is composed of doctors, statisticians, and others who are independent of the clinical trial sponsor. Similar to IRBs, the DSMBs review the progress of a clinical trial and participant safety, but they also review data on the effectiveness of the drug being studied. DSMB members can stop a trial early if safety concerns arise or if they determine that the trial should be stopped due to “futility” meaning that the trial will not be able to answer the question or questions it set out to explore, or due to ethical considerations.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may need to complete additional animal trials and must develop information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the drug in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the drug candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must
develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be completed to establish an expiration date and demonstrate that the drug candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration prior to the expiration date.
The NDA Approval Process. Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls, and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA to support approval to market the product for one or more indications. Under standard approval processes, in most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee.
The FDA is required to conduct a preliminary review of an NDA within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting it for filing, to determine whether it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may accept the NDA for filing, potentially refuse to file the NDA due to deficiencies but work with the applicant to rectify the deficiencies (in which case the NDA is filed upon resolution of the deficiencies) or refuse to file the NDA. The FDA must notify the applicant of a refusal to file a decision within 60 days after the original receipt date of the application. If the FDA refuses to file the NDA the applicant may resubmit the NDA with the deficiencies addressed. The resubmitted NDA is considered a new application subject to a new six- or ten-month review goal, as described below. If the NDA is resubmitted for the same product (by the same person) a new application fee will not be required. The resubmitted application is also subject to the 60-day review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once an NDA is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under PDUFA and the FDA’s commitments under the current PDUFA Reauthorization Act, the FDA has a goal of reviewing and acting on 90% of standard non-priority NDA applications within six or ten months from the filing date of the NDA.
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or stored meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. The FDA is required to refer an application for a novel drug or class to an advisory committee or explain why such referral was not made. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation in response to specific questions raised by the FDA, which may include whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA inspects the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect and audit data at one or more clinical sites to evaluate the integrity of the data and confirm compliance with cGCP.
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts its inspections, it may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug subject to specific prescribing information for specific indication(s) and, if applicable, specific post-approval requirements. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete but the application is not ready for approval. After receiving a Complete Response Letter, the applicant must decide within 12 months (subject to extension), if it plans to resubmit the NDA addressing the deficiencies identified by the FDA in the Complete Response Letter, withdraw the NDA, or request an opportunity for a hearing to challenge the FDA’s determination. A Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, nonclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the data in the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret this data differently than we interpret the data.
The FDA also may require implementation of a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to mitigate any identified or suspected serious risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans and elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries or other risk minimization tools.
The drug testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and may take several years to complete. Data obtained from clinical activities are not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations, which could delay, limit or prevent marketing approval. The FDA may not grant marketing approval on a timely basis, or at all.
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use for the product. The FDA requires that the approved product labeling include information regarding contraindications, warnings, or precautions. It may also require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, including a long-term registry, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution restrictions or other risk management mechanisms, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or data to the labeling or manufacturing changes, may be subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. Also, after approval, the FDA may require labeling changes as new information becomes known, particularly if new risks are identified following commercial use, such as unexpected adverse events. The FDA has the authority to prevent or limit further marketing of a drug based on the results of these post-marketing studies and programs or other information that may become known after approval.
Hatch-Waxman Amendments and Exclusivity. The Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, amended the FFDCA and established abbreviated pathways to market, as well as incentives for the development of new drug products. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments established section 505(b)(2) of the FFDCA that provides an alternative pathway for submission of an NDA, referred to as the 505(b)(2) application, when some or all of the safety and efficacy investigations relied on for approval were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, but for which the information is publicly available. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also established the abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) approval pathway, which provides an expedient route for generic drugs that have the same active ingredient as a previously approved drug. At the same time, to incentivize continued pharmaceutical innovation, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments authorized periods of market exclusivity to protect certain approved new drugs from competition for five- or three-year periods.
Under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments, a new drug containing an active ingredient that had never before been approved in any other NDA, ANDA, or 505(b)(2) NDA is provided five years of market exclusivity upon approval. The FDA refers to this exclusivity as NCE exclusivity. During the NCE exclusivity period, the FDA cannot approve an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) application for a drug containing the same active ingredient. For NCE exclusivity, FDA regulations interpret “active ingredient” to mean “active moiety,” which is defined as “the molecule or ion, excluding those appended portions of the molecule that cause the drug to be an ester, salt . . . , or other noncovalent derivative . . . of the molecule, responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance.” Although the FDA may not approve an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA with the same active ingredient during the five-year NCE exclusivity period, an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted to the FDA after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement.
The Hatch-Waxman Amendments also provide three years of market exclusivity for an NDA, a 505(b)(2) NDA, or a supplement to either of these applications for a drug product containing an active moiety that has been previously approved, if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant, are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application. During this three-year exclusivity period, the FDA will not make effective the approval of any ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA for the same active moiety for the same conditions of use. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a new drug containing the same active moiety if it is the subject of a full NDA for which the applicant conducted, sponsored, or obtained a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Other Regulatory Requirements. Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, annual establishment registration and product listing and associated user fees, compliance with the cGMP, recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion, and adverse drug experience monitoring and reporting with
the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product labeling, such as adding new indications are subject to prior FDA review and approval. Also, any post-approval changes in the drug substance, drug product, production process, quality controls, equipment, or facilities that have a substantial potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug product is subject to FDA review and approval. Any such changes that have a moderate potential to have an adverse effect on the identity, strength, quality, purity, or potency of the drug product must be submitted to the FDA for review 30 days prior to implementation. All manufacturing facilities, as well as records required to be maintained under FDA regulations, are subject to inspection or audit by the FDA. In addition, manufacturers are required to pay annual user fees for establishment registration and user fees for the submission of each new or supplemental application with clinical data.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-approval testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 gave the FDA the authority to require a REMS from drug manufacturers to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with the drug and to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. Examples of a REMS include, but are not limited to, a Medication Guide, a patient package insert to help mitigate a serious risk of the drug, and a communication plan to health care providers to support the implementation of an element of the REMS.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and register or obtain permits or licenses in states where they do business and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and state regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over their activities to determine compliance with regulatory requirements. A drug manufacturer is responsible for ensuring that its third-party contractors operate in compliance with applicable laws and regulations including the cGMP regulation. The failure of a drug manufacturer or any of its third-party contractors to comply with federal or state laws or regulations may subject the drug manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as an untitled letter, warning letter, recall, suspension of manufacturing or distribution or both, suspension of state permit or license, seizure of product, import detention, injunctive action, civil and criminal penalties.
Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require a drug manufacturer to conduct investigations and implement appropriate corrective actions to address any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the manufacturer and any third-party contractors (including contract manufacturers and laboratories) involved in the manufacture of a drug product. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend significant time, money and effort to maintain and ensure ongoing cGMP compliance and to confirm and ensure ongoing cGMP compliance of their third-party contractors.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if there is new information or evidence that the drug is unsafe or not shown to be safe for use under the conditions of its approval, or that new information shows there is a lack of substantial evidence of effectiveness, or that the approved application contained an untrue statement of material fact, or that the required patent information was not submitted within 30 days after receiving notice from the FDA of the failure to submit such information. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety and risk information; imposition of a post-market study requirement to assess new safety risks; or implementation of a REMS that may include distribution or other restrictions.
The FDA closely regulates drug advertising and promotional activities, including promotion of an unapproved drug, direct-to-consumer advertising, dissemination of scientific information about a drug not on the approved labeling, off-label promotion, communications with payors and formulary committees, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet and social media. A company’s promotional product claims must be true and not misleading, provide fair balance, provide adequate risk information, and be consistent with the product label approved by the FDA. Failure to comply with these
requirements can lead to regulatory actions including, among other things, warning letters, corrective advertising, injunction, violation and related penalties under the False Claims Act and result in reputational and economic harm.
Physicians may prescribe FDA-approved drugs for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those uses tested by the manufacturer. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments for their individual patients. The FDA does, however, regulate manufacturers’ communications about their drug products and interprets the FFDCA to prohibit pharmaceutical companies from promoting their FDA-approved drug products for uses that are not specified in the FDA-approved labeling. Companies that market drugs for off-label uses have been subject to warning letters, related costly litigation, criminal prosecution, and civil liability under the FFDCA and the False Claims Act.
In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act (“PDMA”) which regulates the distribution of drug and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of wholesale drug distributors by the states.
Orphan Designation. The Orphan Drug Act of 1983 provides incentives, including marketing exclusivity, user fee waivers and tax benefits, to companies that undertake development and marketing of products to treat rare diseases, which are defined as diseases for which there is a patient population of fewer than 200,000 persons in the U.S. or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the U.S. where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the U.S. A drug that receives Orphan Drug designation may receive up to seven years of exclusive marketing in the U.S. for that indication, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity. A drug may be entitled to an additional six months of exclusive marketing if it satisfies the requirements for pediatric exclusivity.
The European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”) grants Orphan Drug designation to promote the development of products that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than five in 10,000 persons in the European Union Community and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for products intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the medicinal product. In the European Union, Orphan Drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and ten years of market exclusivity is granted following medicinal product approval. This period may be reduced to six years if the Orphan Drug designation criteria are no longer met, including where it is shown that the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify maintenance of market exclusivity.
New Legislation and Regulations. From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, and marketing of products regulated by the FDA. In addition to new legislation, FDA regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and product candidates. It is impossible to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any drug products for which we may obtain marketing approval. Sales of any of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of the products will be covered by third-party payors, including government health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial health insurers and managed care organizations. Some third-party payors may limit coverage to specific drug products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the approved drugs for a particular indication.
In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Whether or not we conduct such studies, our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage, and adequate reimbursement, for the product. Third-party reimbursement may not be sufficient to enable us to maintain price levels high enough to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.
The containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal, state and foreign governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drug products and medical services and questioning safety and efficacy. Emphasis on managed care in the U.S. has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on drug pricing. If third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover the products for which we receive FDA approval.
The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs and drug prices in general, including for therapies for rare diseases. These measures include price controls, transparency requirements triggered by the introduction of new high-cost drugs into the market, drug re-importation, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. Some laws and regulations have already been enacted in these areas, and additional measures have been introduced or are under consideration at both the federal and state levels. Additionally, legislation that affects reimbursement for drugs with small patient populations could be adopted, limiting payments for pharmaceuticals such as our product candidates, which could adversely affect our potential future net revenue and results.
In addition, in the U.S., the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“the Affordable Care Act”) and the Inflation Reduction Act contain provisions that have the potential to substantially change healthcare delivery and financing, including impacting the profitability of drugs. For example, the Affordable Care Act revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers for covered outpatient drugs are calculated under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of covered drugs dispensed to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations and subjected manufacturers to new annual fees for certain branded prescription drugs. Given the complexity of the Affordable Care Act and the substantial requirements for regulation thereunder, the impact of the Affordable Care Act on our financial conditions and operations cannot be predicted, whether in its current form or as amended or repealed.
 Pricing and reimbursement methodologies vary widely from country to country. Some countries require that drug products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of drug products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. European Union member states may approve a specific price for a drug product or they may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on our profitability in placing the drug product on the market. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for drug products but monitor and control company profits. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert competitive pressure that may reduce pricing within a country. Any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for drug products may not allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products.
Coverage policies, third-party reimbursement rates, and drug pricing regulation may change at any time, and there is the potential for significant movement in these areas in the foreseeable future. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive marketing approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Healthcare Law and Regulation. Healthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors play a primary role in the recommendation and prescribing of any product candidates for which we may obtain marketing approval. Our business operations and arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, manufacture, market, promote, sell and distribute our products that obtain marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws include, but are not limited to, the following:
 •the federal healthcare Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid
 •the federal False Claims Act and civil monetary penalties law impose penalties and provide for civil whistleblower or qui tam actions against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment or approval that are false or fraudulent or making a false record or statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government
 •the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent
 •the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) among other things, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, also imposes certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information without proper written authorization
 •the federal transparency requirements under the Affordable Care Act requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies to annually report to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) information related to payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians and teaching hospitals and certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members
 •analogous state and foreign laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts
 Further, the Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal statutes governing healthcare fraud. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided
that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the False Claims Act.
Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to it, we may be subject to significant administrative, civil, and/or criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to administrative, civil, and/or criminal sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.
Foreign Regulation. In order to market any product outside of the U.S., we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. The cost of establishing a regulatory compliance system for numerous varying jurisdictions can be very significant. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the U.S. apply similarly in the context of the EU and/or other jurisdictions, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Other Anti-Corruption Laws
We may be subject to a variety of domestic and foreign anti-corruption laws with respect to our regulatory compliance efforts and operations. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) is a criminal statute that prohibits an individual or business from paying, offering, promising or authorizing the provision of money (such as a bribe or kickback) or anything else of value (such as an improper gift, hospitality, or favor), directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining, retaining, or directing business or other advantages (such as favorable regulatory rulings). The FCPA also obligates companies with securities listed in the U.S. to comply with certain accounting provisions. Those provisions require a company such as ours to (i) maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions, expenses, and asset dispositions, and (ii) devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions are properly authorized, executed and recorded. The FCPA is subject to broad interpretation by the U.S. government. The past decade has seen a significant increase in enforcement activity. In addition to the FCPA, there are a number of other federal and state anti-corruption laws to which we may be subject, including, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 USC § 201 (which prohibits bribing U.S. government officials) and the U.S. Travel Act (which in some instances addresses private-sector or commercial bribery both within and outside the U.S.). Also, a number of the countries in which we may conduct activities have their own domestic and international anti-corruption laws, such as the UK Bribery Act 2010. There have been cases where companies have faced multi-jurisdictional liability under the FCPA and the anti-corruption laws of other countries for the same illegal act.
We can be held liable under the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws for the illegal activities of our employees, representatives, contractors, collaborators, agents, subsidiaries, or affiliates, even if we did not explicitly authorize such activity. Although we will seek to comply with anti-corruption laws, there can be no assurance that all of our employees, representatives, contractors, collaborators, agents, subsidiaries or affiliates will comply with these laws at all times. Noncompliance with these laws could subject us to whistleblower complaints, investigations, sanctions, settlements, prosecution, other enforcement actions, disgorgement of profits, significant fines, damages, other civil and criminal penalties or injunctions, suspension and/or debarment from contracting with certain governments or other persons, the loss of export privileges, reputational harm, adverse media coverage, and other collateral consequences. In addition, our directors, officers, employees, and other representatives who engage in violations of the FCPA and certain other anti-corruption statutes may face imprisonment, fines, and penalties. If any subpoenas or investigations are launched, or governmental or other sanctions are imposed, or if we do not prevail in any possible civil or criminal litigation, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be materially harmed. In addition, responding to any action will likely result in a materially significant diversion of our management’s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees. Enforcement actions and sanctions could further harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
Human Capital/Employees
Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, our human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay and benefits; enhance our culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing and diverse workforce. As of March 24, 2023, we had 33 full-time employees, in addition to several consultants or independent contractors working for us. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced a work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good.
