ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Dicerna™ Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company,” or “Dicerna”) is a biopharmaceutical company using ribonucleic acid (“RNA”) interference (“RNAi”) to develop medicines that silence genes that cause or contribute to disease. The Company’s proprietary GalXC™ technology is being applied to develop what we believe will be potent, selective, and safe RNAi therapies to treat diseases involving the liver, including rare diseases, chronic liver diseases, cardiometabolic diseases, and viral infectious diseases. As we further enhance our GalXC technology, we aim to extend our focus beyond the liver to include central nervous system (“CNS”) diseases and diseases involving other bodily tissues. Dicerna aims to treat a broad range of diseases by addressing the underlying causes of illness, focusing on target genes where connections between gene and disease are well understood and documented. Dicerna intends to discover, develop, and commercialize novel therapeutics either on its own or in collaboration with pharmaceutical partners. Dicerna has strategic collaborations with Novo Nordisk A/S (“Novo”), F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd and Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (together, “Roche”), Eli Lilly and Company (“Lilly”), Alexion Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (together with its affiliates, “Alexion”), and Boehringer Ingelheim International GmbH (“BI”).
All of our GalXC drug discovery and development efforts are based on the therapeutic modality of RNAi, a highly potent and specific mechanism for silencing the activity of a targeted gene. In this naturally occurring biological process, double-stranded RNA molecules induce the enzymatic destruction of the messenger ribonucleic acid (“mRNA”) of a target gene that contains sequences that are complementary to one strand of the therapeutic double-stranded RNA molecule. Our approach is to design proprietary double-stranded RNA molecules that have the potential to engage the enzyme Dicer and initiate an RNAi process to silence a specific target gene. Our GalXC RNAi platform utilizes a proprietary structure of double-stranded RNA molecules. For our current clinical programs, our GalXC RNAi platform has been configured for subcutaneous delivery to the liver. Due to the enzymatic nature of RNAi, a single GalXC molecule incorporated into the RNAi machinery can destroy hundreds or thousands of mRNAs from the targeted gene.
Strategy
We are committed to delivering transformative therapies based on our GalXC RNAi platform to patients with serious diseases, and currently our focus includes rare diseases, chronic liver diseases, cardiometabolic diseases, and viral infectious diseases. We and our collaborators have qualified dozens of disease-associated genes with clinical indications, in which an RNAi-based inhibitor may provide substantial benefit to patients.
The key elements of our strategy are as follows:

• | Create new programs in indication areas with high unmet medical need. We intend to continue to use our proprietary GalXC RNAi technology platform to create new, high-value pharmaceutical programs. Our areas of primary focus are: (1) rare inherited diseases involving genes in the liver; (2) other therapeutic areas involving the expression of therapeutic gene targets in the liver such as chronic liver diseases, cardiometabolic diseases, and viral infectious diseases; and (3) further leveraging our successes with the GalXC platform to explore therapeutic gene targets in the CNS and other tissues.


• | Validate our product candidates and our platform in clinical proof-of-concept studies. On September 5, 2018, we declared attainment of clinical proof-of-concept for nedosiran (formerly DCR-PHXC, which is in clinical development for primary hyperoxaluria (“PH”) type 1 (“PH1”), PH type 2 (“PH2”), and PH type 3 (“PH3”)) and are currently conducting clinical proof-of-concept studies for our RG6346 (formerly DCR-HBVS) and DCR-A1AT programs. Based on precedents in the RNAi field, we are optimistic that our preclinical studies, which showed significant knockdown of target mRNA activity and disease biomarker activity, may translate into beneficial clinical results for current and future programs.


• | Retain significant portions of the commercial rights for certain rare disease programs. We seek to retain, subject to the evaluation of potential licensing opportunities as they may arise, a full or substantial ownership stake and to invest internally in programs for diseases with focused patient populations, such as certain rare diseases. These certain rare disease programs, which include our nedosiran and DCR-A1AT programs, represent opportunities that we believe carry a higher probability of success relative to other therapeutic platforms or modalities, with genetically and molecularly defined disease markers, high unmet medical need, a focused number of centers of excellence to facilitate reaching these patients, and the potential for more rapid clinical development paths to approval.


• | Enter into collaborations with pharmaceutical companies either for our GalXC RNAi technology platform or specific indications or therapeutic areas. For more complex diseases with multiple gene dysfunctions and/or larger patient populations, we plan to pursue collaborations that can provide the enhanced scale, resources, and commercial infrastructure required to maximize these prospects. Our collaborations with Roche, Novo, Lilly, Alexion, and BI

5

exemplify this element of our strategy. We may establish collaborations with pharmaceutical companies across multiple programs or specific indication areas, either before or after clinical proof-of-concept, depending on the attractiveness of the opportunities. These collaborations have the potential to provide us with further validation of our technology platform, funding to advance our proprietary product candidates, or access to development, manufacturing, and commercial capabilities.

• | Expand the reach of GalXC to therapeutic targets beyond the liver. Our research suggests that our GalXC platform, which was originally developed to target hepatocytes in the liver, may be adaptable to target other diverse tissues, including the CNS. Our collaboration with Lilly includes joint research involving our proprietary GalXC platform in order to generate new medicines for CNS diseases, such as neurodegenerative diseases and chronic pain, as well as for non-liver-based cardiometabolic diseases. We are also pursuing research internally to expand the reach of our GalXC platform to additional non-liver tissues and are increasing our investment in this area.


• | Leverage the experience and the expertise of our executive management team. To execute on our strategy, we have assembled an executive management team that has extensive experience in the biopharmaceutical industry. In addition, various members of our management team and our board of directors have contributed to the progress of pharmaceutical development and commercialization through their substantial involvement in companies such as Cephalon Inc., Genta Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Shire plc, Pfizer Inc., NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Millennium Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, Biogen, Inc., Sirna Therapeutics, Inc. (“Sirna”), and other companies. Our co-founder and chief executive officer, Douglas M. Fambrough III, Ph.D., was a lead venture capital investor and board member of Sirna, an early RNAi company acquired by Merck & Co., Inc. in 2006 for $1.1 billion.

RNAi and Our GalXC Technology Platform
The RNAi Therapeutic Modality
All of our GalXC drug discovery and development efforts are based on the therapeutic modality of RNAi. RNAi therapeutics represent a novel advance in drug development. Historically, the pharmaceutical industry had developed only small molecules or recombinant proteins to inhibit the activity of disease-causing proteins. While this approach is effective for many diseases, many proteins cannot be inhibited by either small molecules or recombinant proteins. Some proteins lack the binding pockets small molecules require for interaction. Other proteins are solely intracellular and therefore inaccessible to recombinant protein-based therapeutics, which are limited to cell surface and extracellular proteins. The unique advantage of RNAi is that, instead of targeting proteins, RNAi silences the genes themselves via the targeted destruction of the mRNAs made from the gene. Rather than seeking to inhibit a protein directly, the RNAi approach is to prevent its creation in the first place.
The GalXC RNAi Technology Platform
Dicerna’s GalXC technology consists of a set of proprietary double-stranded RNA structures capable of inducing RNAi and associated chemical modifications and additions to these structures that enhance their properties and help confer useful ‘drug-like’ properties. RNAi-inducing RNA structures consist of two strands of RNA. One of these strands, called the guide strand, is complementary to the mRNA sequence one is seeking to inhibit. The other strand, called the passenger strand, includes sequences complementary to the guide strand, forming a double-stranded RNA duplex with it. In the case of our GalXC technology, additional sequences are added to the passenger strand, which help improve the properties of the molecules and can serve as an attachment point for various chemical additions. We have spent several years optimizing the structure, chemical modifications, and chemical additions in our GalXC RNAi platform and will continue to do so to create what we believe is an efficient, effective, and well-tolerated pharmaceutical platform to rapidly identify and develop RNAi therapeutics for delivery to the liver and other tissues. 
We believe our GalXC RNAi technology platform provides the following qualities and has advantages compared to other therapeutic modalities:

• | Our GalXC molecules have been optimized for use in humans. For therapeutic use in humans, our GalXC molecules are optimized both with respect to base sequence and chemical modifications to increase stability and mask them from mechanisms that recognize foreign RNA, in order to avoid inducing immune system stimulation. Our optimization process begins with an analysis of the target gene sequence using our proprietary GalXC prediction algorithm, which we developed based on the results of testing thousands of sequences for RNAi activity. We select the sequences with the highest predicted RNAi activity and apply patterns of chemical modifications and additions, including a four-base sequence, known as a tetraloop, on the passenger strand, which is designed to enhance stability and engineer out immunostimulatory activity.


• | Our GalXC RNAi platform enables subcutaneous dosing for delivery to the liver. The GalXC RNAi platform is designed to enable convenient subcutaneous delivery for our growing pipeline of liver-targeted RNAi programs. Our liver-targeted GalXC molecules are conjugated on the tetraloop structure to a simple sugar, N-acetyl-D-galactosamine

6

(“GalNAc”), that is specifically recognized by a receptor on the surface of hepatocytes. With the liver-targeted GalXC RNAi platform, a full human dose may be administered via a single subcutaneous injection. After injection, the GalXC molecules enter the bloodstream and are exposed to the hepatocytes expressing the GalNAc receptor. After binding to the receptor, the GalXC molecules are internalized by the hepatocyte, ultimately enabling the GalXC molecules to access the RNAi machinery inside the hepatocyte. Our liver-targeted GalXC molecules routinely achieve high potencies, with EC50 values in the liver (i.e., the amount of material required to silence a target gene by 50 percent) typically in the 0.1 to 1.0 milligram per kilogram bodyweight (mg/kg) range in in vivo studies in mice. We have routinely generated GalXC molecules of this potency within 30 days of doing the initial algorithmic gene sequence analysis, which allows us to explore a large number of potential target genes when selecting programs for ourselves and with our collaborators.

• | Our GalXC molecules have a long duration of action. We believe our GalXC RNAi platform allows us to build a broad pipeline of therapeutics designed to have attractive pharmaceutical properties, including infrequent dosing (e.g., dosing that is on a monthly, quarterly, or an even less frequent basis) due to a long duration of action and higher potency of RNAi-based gene silencing.


• | Our GalXC molecules are highly specific to the gene to which they are targeted. Due to the gene-sequence-based nature of how our GalXC molecules interact with their gene mRNA targets, facilitated by the RNAi pathway proteins inside the cell, we believe our GalXC molecules generally lack any direct effect on other gene targets. This specificity compares favorably to many small molecule-based therapeutics, which may inhibit additional proteins beyond the intended protein target.


• | Our GalXC molecules have demonstrated a high therapeutic index. In both preclinical studies and clinical studies, our GalXC molecules have been shown to be well-tolerated, even at dose levels far exceeding the expected efficacious dose level. We believe this property reduces the risk that our GalXC molecules may have tolerability liabilities that may preclude further development.


• | Our GalXC molecules can be manufactured by existing, standard methods. Our GalXC molecules consist of RNA oligonucleotides, which can be manufactured with well-understood chemistries on existing readily available equipment. Such equipment is available, at various manufacturing scales, in multiple contract manufacturing organizations with good manufacturing practice capabilities. We believe this reduces the risks associated with commercial manufacturing of our candidates.


• | Unlike gene therapy and gene editing, our GalXC RNAi therapy is fully reversible.

Development Approach
In choosing which development programs to internally advance, we apply the scientific, clinical, and commercial criteria listed below that we believe allow us to best leverage our GalXC RNAi platform and maximize value. We believe that our current development programs meet many or all of these criteria:

• | Strength of therapeutic hypothesis. We seek to target genes with a therapeutic intervention that are likely to have substantial benefit for the patient.


• | Readily-identified patient population. We seek disease indications where patients can be readily identified by the presence of characteristic genetic mutations or other readily-accessible disease features. In the case of genetic diseases, these are heritable genetic mutations that can be identified with available routine genetic tests.


• | Predictivity of biomarkers for early efficacy assessment. We seek these markers to allow us to determine in early stages of clinical development whether our GalXC molecules are likely to have the expected biological and clinical effects in patients.


• | High unmet medical need. We seek to provide patients with significant benefit and alleviation of disease. The indications we choose to approach have high unmet medical need, which is intended to enable us to better access patients and qualify for pricing and reimbursement that justify our development efforts.


• | Rapid development path to proof-of-concept or approval. We seek indications with the potential for rapid development to proof-of-concept or marketing approval in order to reach commercialization expeditiously and to help ensure our ability to finance development of our product candidates. When appropriate, we will seek breakthrough therapy designation from the United States (“U.S.”) Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).

The Dicerna Pipeline 
Using our GalXC RNAi technology, and applying the criteria of our development focus, we have created a pipeline of core therapeutic programs for development by Dicerna. For opportunities that were not selected as a core program opportunity, we have 
7

sought partners to fund the discovery, and subsequently drive the development of, these non-core opportunities in exchange for upfront payments, milestone payments, royalties on product sales, and potentially other economic and operational arrangements. Our current collaborations with Novo, Lilly, Alexion, and BI resulted from this effort. For core programs targeting rare diseases, we intend to develop these programs internally through approval. For core programs targeting larger populations, we may seek collaborative partners, such as our collaboration with Roche on RG6346, under various economic and operational arrangements. Together, our core program pipeline and our pipeline of non-core collaborative programs constitute a broad and growing therapeutic pipeline that we believe may result in multiple valuable approved products based on our GalXC technology.
In addition to the programs listed in our pipeline, we are exploring a variety of potential programs involving gene targets in the liver, CNS, and other tissues, which we may elevate in the future to be either core programs or non-core collaborative programs. Under our collaborations with Novo, Lilly, and Roche, our collaborators have rights to nominate additional programs for discovery by Dicerna and subsequent development by the nominating collaborator, and which will become part of our non-core pipeline.
The tables below set forth the state of development of our various GalXC RNAi platform product candidates as of February 27, 2020.

Nedosiran for Primary Hyperoxaluria
We are developing our lead GalXC product candidate, nedosiran, for the treatment of PH1, PH2, and PH3. Nedosiran is in the pivotal phase of clinical development. PH is a family of severe, ultra-rare, genetic liver disorders characterized by the overproduction of oxalate, a highly insoluble metabolic end-product that is eliminated from the body mainly by the kidneys. In patients with PH, the kidneys are unable to eliminate fully the large amount of oxalate that is produced. This accumulation of oxalate compromises the renal system, which may result in severe damage to the kidneys and other organs. 
PH encompasses three genetically distinct, autosomal-recessive, inborn errors of glyoxylate metabolism characterized by the overproduction of oxalate. PH1, PH2, and PH3 are each characterized by a specific enzyme deficiency. PH1 is caused by a deficiency of glyoxylate-aminotransferase, PH2 is caused by a deficiency of glyoxylate reductase/hydroxypyruvate reductase, and PH3 is caused by a deficiency of 4-hydroxy-2-oxoglutarate aldolase. Patients with PH are predisposed to the development of recurrent urinary tract (urolithiasis) and kidney (nephrolithiasis) stones, composed of calcium oxalate crystals. Stone formation is accompanied by nephrocalcinosis in some patients with PH1 and PH2. This deposition of calcium oxalate crystals in the renal parenchyma produces tubular toxicity and renal damage that is compounded by the effects of renal calculi-related obstruction and frequent superimposed infections. Based on evaluation of genome sequence databases, there may be as many as 16,000 people with PH in the U.S. and major European countries.
Most patients are diagnosed with PH in childhood or early adulthood. At present, no therapies are approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of patients with PH. A number of supportive therapies are used in an attempt to mitigate some effects of the disease. Current medical management, before renal failure develops, is underpinned by hyperhydration recommendations of at least three liters of fluid per day per square meter of body-surface area (5 L/day for a 70-kg adult). These regimens can be problematic in infants and toddlers, necessitating placement of a gastrostomy tube to ensure adequate nighttime fluid administration. Affected patients are at considerable risk of serious renal complications during periods of increased fluid loss (fever, diarrhea/vomiting, and urinary tract infections) or when oral hydration is compromised (following surgical procedures). Oral potassium citrate administration multiple times daily is used to potentially alleviate crystallization and alkalinize the urine. In PH1, between 10-30% of patients are responsive (i.e., greater than 30% reduction of urinary oxalate) to high daily administration of pyridoxine (vitamin B6), but only rarely do these patients reach normal or near-normal urinary oxalate levels. 
For PH1 and PH2 patients with more advanced disease, dialysis may be used in an attempt to remove stored and concurrent overproduction of oxalate. In contrast to the typical three times weekly hemodialysis regimens used in other types of renal failure, patients with PH may require hemodialysis six or seven days per week. This intensive regimen may still not be able to keep up with the endogenous oxalate production. Given the limitations of dialysis and the inability to impact oxalate overproduction substantially in most patients with PH1, most centers now consider liver transplantation approaches earlier in the disease course to minimize the risk of irreversible tissue damage. Current treatments may include sequential or combined liver-kidney transplantation. As with organ transplantation in other diseases, these procedures are associated with significant medical risk and a requirement for long-term treatment with immunosuppressive drugs that are also associated with significant side effects. We believe this level of unmet need provides a strong rationale for our initial focus on the treatment of PH.
Our GalXC-containing nedosiran product candidate seeks to block production of the lactate dehydrogenase A enzyme by silencing the LDHA gene. PH is characterized by overproduction of oxalate in the liver. The last step in the production of oxalate in the liver involves the LDHA gene, making LDHA silencing a potentially highly promising approach to the treatment of PH1, PH2, and PH3. In preclinical studies of PH1 and PH2 animal models, we have observed a near-linear correlation between LDHA silencing and oxalate reduction. In addition, LDHA silencing in the liver appears to be a minimal metabolic intervention, as it does not cause measurable changes to known blood and urinary biomarkers of metabolic activity. There are numerous case reports of LDHA deficiency naturally occurring in humans, with no reported adverse effects due to deficiency in the liver. For these reasons among others, we believe that LDHA silencing is an ideal approach to blocking oxalate over-production in PH1, PH2, and PH3.
In May 2018, we received notice from the FDA granting Orphan Drug Designation to nedosiran for the treatment of PH. In August 2018, the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”)’s Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products (“COMP”) designated nedosiran as an orphan medicinal product for the treatment of PH in the European Union (“EU”). 
As of November 2019, we completed all study participant dosing and follow-up in PHYOX™1, a Phase 1 single-ascending-dose study of nedosiran in healthy volunteers and study participants with PH1 and PH2. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single-ascending doses of nedosiran. Secondary endpoints included the change in 24-hour urinary oxalate excretion from baseline, defined as the mean of two 24-hour collections during screening. The trial was divided into two groups:

• | Group A was a placebo-controlled, single-blind study and included 25 healthy volunteers at a single site in the United Kingdom with five cohorts dosed at 0.3, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, or 12.0 mg/kg of nedosiran or placebo (3:2 randomization).

9


• | Group B was an open-label study and included 18 participants, 15 with PH1 and three with PH2, and included three cohorts of participants dosed at 1.5, 3.0, and 6.0 mg/kg of nedosiran and a fourth cohort with mixed dosing. Group B participants were enrolled among three sites in the European Union, one in the United Kingdom, and one site in the United States.

Group A dosing was completed in March 2018, and Group B dosing was completed in January 2019. We first reported interim results from the PHYOX1 trial on September 5, 2018 and subsequently presented updated results at the American Society of Nephrology’s (“ASN”) Kidney Week in San Diego on October 25, 2018, at the German Society of Pediatric Nephrology 50th Annual Meeting in Cologne, Germany on March 28, 2019, at the Oxalosis and Hyperoxaluria Foundation International Hyperoxaluria Workshop in Boston, Massachusetts on June 20, 2019, and at the ASN’s Kidney Week Annual Meeting in Washington, D.C. on November 7, 2019.
With respect to efficacy data in PHYOX1, as of September 2019, nedosiran was associated with normalization or near-normalization of urinary oxalate levels in 14 of 18 adult patients with PH1 and PH2 following single-dose administration. 
The PHYOX1 investigators also reported that the three participants with PH2 (one of whom received a single 1.5 mg/kg dose of nedosiran; the other two received a 3.0 mg/kg dose) achieved a mean maximal reduction of 24-hour urinary oxalate of 49% (range: 39% to 66%) with one participant reaching normalization and another participant reaching near-normalization at one or more post-dose time points. The PH2 patient that did not achieve normalization or near-normalization was dosed at the 1.5 mg/kg level.
Preliminary data from the PHYOX1 trial presented in November 2019 showed that nedosiran was well tolerated based on data from 18 participants (15 adults and three adolescents [participants 13-16 years old]) with PH1 (n=15) and PH2 (n=3) and 25 adult healthy volunteers. To date, seven serious adverse events (“SAEs”) have occurred in six participants in Group B; none was deemed related to the study drug, and all seven SAEs have resolved. A total of seven participants dosed with nedosiran experienced mild or moderate injection-site reactions, all of which resolved without intervention in a mean of 25 hours. No clinically meaningful safety signals were observed, including from liver function tests.
We received approval to proceed with the Phase 2 (“PHYOX2”) and Phase 3 (“PHYOX3”) studies in 2019 in a subset of the countries in which we intend to open trial sites. We initiated dosing of participants rolling over from the PHYOX1 trial into the recently approved PHYOX3 study, a long-term, multi-dose, open-label, roll-over extension study. We expect initial multi-dose data from this trial to be available in March 2020. Additionally, we are currently enrolling patients in our registration trial, PHYOX2, for which enrollment is expected to be completed by the end of the first half of 2020. The last patient visit in the PHYOX2 trial is expected by the end of 2020. In addition to the PHYOX2 clinical trial, we have multiple additional trials planned. In the first half of 2020, further clinical studies will be initiated in patients with PH3 (PHYOX4) and in PH1 and PH2 patients with severe renal impairment, including those in dialysis (PHYOX7), pending regulatory approvals. A study in PH1 and PH2 patients aged 2-5 years, with relatively intact renal function (PHYOX8), is planned for the second half of 2020, pending regulatory approvals.
 In discussions with the FDA, we received feedback indicating alignment on a path to the full approval of nedosiran for the treatment of PH1 and PH2 based on achievement of substantial reduction of high baseline urinary oxalate in patients with PH1 and PH2 in the PHYOX2 pivotal trial. With this feedback, we believe we have a path to seek full approval in both PH1 and PH2 based on PHYOX2 results. In July 2019, we received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for the development of nedosiran for the treatment of PH1. We plan to continue our dialogue with the FDA regarding endpoints for studies involving patients with PH3 as part of the PHYOX clinical development program for nedosiran and potentially an expansion of the Breakthrough Therapy Designation to include PH2.
The ultimate goal of any PH therapy is for patients to live a normal life without the need to comply with hyperhydration and urine alkalization supporting therapies in order to prevent the formation of new calcium oxalate crystals. The PHYOX3 study will evaluate nedosiran’s long-term effect in reducing urinary oxalate levels to the normal range, enabling patients’ supportive therapies to be gradually decreased or eliminated. To best achieve this ultimate goal, Dicerna has developed a once-monthly fixed-dose injection regimen of nedosiran. This once-monthly formulation of nedosiran is designed to avoid the sudden oxalate spikes that could occur with less frequent administration or missed dosages and which could result in the formation of kidney stones and renal failure. To maximize patient convenience, we are developing pre-filled syringes to enable self-administration by most PH patients without the need for involvement of a healthcare provider.
RG6346 for Chronic Hepatitis B Virus Infection
Our GalXC RNAi platform-based product candidate for the treatment of chronic HBV infection, RG6346, is currently being tested in a Phase 1 clinical trial. HBV is reported to be the most common serious liver infection affecting an estimated 292 million people globally. Chronic HBV is characterized by the presence of the hepatitis B surface antigen (“HBsAg”) for six months or more.
10

Current therapies for HBV include nucleoside analogs (“NUCs”) and pegylated interferon regimens. Interferons are less effective at suppressing viral replication and are associated with several side effects. NUCs are relatively safe to use but usually require indefinite therapy that increases the risk of non-adherence. Furthermore, the vast majority of patients treated with these agents do not achieve an immunological cure of chronic HBV infection as defined by the sustained clearance of HBsAg and HBV deoxyribonucleic acid (“DNA”) suppression in patient blood or serum. The chance of achieving a long-term immunological cure may be significantly enhanced with the introduction of novel drugs, such as RG6346, designed to reduce intrahepatic and serum HBsAg, as well as HBV DNA. These novel drugs may be used in combination with each other and existing therapies, such as NUCs.
RG6346 targets HBV messenger RNA and has shown a greater than 99.9% reduction in circulated HBsAg in mouse models of HBV infection. We are evaluating the potential of RG6346 to reduce HBsAg expression and HBV DNA in HBV patients in a subcutaneous dosing paradigm in a Phase 1 clinical trial. We received Clinical Trial Application (“CTA”) and ethics committee approvals for this trial in healthy volunteers and patients with chronic HBV infection in New Zealand in December 2018 and in Australia, Hong Kong, South Korea, and Thailand in 2019. The Phase 1 study was initiated in December 2018 and the first participants were dosed in January 2019. We anticipate human proof-of-concept data from the existing cohorts of our RG6346 Phase 1 clinical trial to be available in the third quarter of 2020.
The DCR-HBVS-101 clinical trial is a Phase 1 randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of RG6346 in healthy volunteers and in patients with non-cirrhotic chronic HBV. Secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of RG6346 and to evaluate preliminary antiviral efficacy, as well as characterize the pharmacodynamics of RG6346 on HBsAg and HBV DNA levels in blood. The DCR-HBVS-101 clinical trial is divided into three phases or groups:

• | Group A is a single-ascending-dose arm in which 30 healthy volunteers received a dose of RG6346 (0.1, 1.5, 3.0, 6.0, or 12.0 mg/kg) or placebo, with a four-week follow-up period. Group A dosing was completed in August 2019.


• | Group B is a single-dose arm in which eight participants with chronic HBV who are naïve to NUC therapy receive a 3.0 mg/kg dose of RG6346 or placebo; these participants will be followed for at least 12 weeks. We initiated Group B dosing in the third quarter of 2019, in parallel with Group C at the 3.0 mg/kg dose level. Group B dosing is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020.


• | Group C is a multiple-ascending-dose arm in which RG6346 (1.5, 3.0, or 6.0 mg/kg) or placebo will be administered to 18 participants with chronic HBV who are already being treated with NUCs, with a treatment and follow-up period of 16 weeks or more.


◦ | We dosed the first patient, from Group C, at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, in May 2019. The final patient’s last dose in the 1.5 mg/kg dose group was administered in October 2019.


◦ | We dosed the first patient in 3.0 mg/kg cohort in August 2019. The final patient’s last dose in the 3.0 mg/kg dose group was administered in January 2020.


◦ | We dosed the first patient in the 6.0 mg/kg cohort in December 2019 and are enrolling the remainder of the cohort.

Participants with chronic HBV in Groups B and C, in whom HBsAg will have dropped equal to or more than 1 log10 IU/mL below their baseline at the time of their last scheduled study visit, will continue to be followed until their HBsAg level is less than 1 log10 IU/mL below their baseline value. Multiple patients had achieved this level of HBsAg reduction at their last scheduled visit.
In order to facilitate development and potential commercialization of our product candidate, RG6346, in combination with other novel drugs, we entered into a research collaboration and licensing agreement with Roche in October 2019. Under the terms of the agreement, we will be leading the development of RG6346 through the current Phase 1 trial, and pending favorable results, Roche intends to further develop RG6346 with the overall goal of developing a combination regimen to achieve a long-term immunological cure of chronic HBV in combination with additional Roche product candidates in Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials.
DCR-A1AT for Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency-Associated Liver Disease 
Our GalXC RNAi platform-based product candidate for the treatment of A1AT deficiency-associated liver disease, DCR-A1AT, is currently being tested in a Phase 1/2 clinical study. A1AT deficiency is an inherited disorder that can lead to liver disease in children and adults and lung disease in adults. The disorder is caused by mutations in a gene called SERPINA1. This gene, when functioning normally, provides instructions for making the A1AT protein, which protects the body from an enzyme called neutrophil elastase. This enzyme is released from white blood cells to fight infection, but it can attack normal tissues if not tightly controlled by A1AT. Mutations in the SERPINA1 gene can result in a deficiency of A1AT or, most commonly, an abnormal form of the protein that cannot control neutrophil elastase. Accumulation of abnormal A1AT protein in the liver can lead to liver disease. Uncontrolled neutrophil elastase can also destroy alveoli (small air sacs in the lungs) and cause lung disease.
11

Approximately 7% of children with A1AT deficiency who develop liver disease develop cirrhosis, and over 15% require liver transplantation. About 10% of adults with A1AT deficiency who develop liver disease develop cirrhosis due to formation of scar tissue in the liver, and over 15% of those require liver transplantation. Individuals affected by A1AT deficiency are also at risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma, a type of liver cancer. Liver transplantation is currently the only effective treatment for A1AT deficiency-associated liver disease.
A1AT deficiency occurs all over the world, though its prevalence varies by population. The disorder affects roughly one in 1,500 to 3,500 individuals with European ancestry but is uncommon in people of Asian descent. Congenital A1AT deficiency is estimated to affect 2.4 people out of every 10,000 in the EU. It is estimated that less than 10% of individuals with A1AT deficiency are diagnosed. The diagnosis of A1AT-associated liver or lung disease is a diagnosis of exclusion, as no specific clinical diagnostic criteria exist for these diseases. Therefore, according to the Journal of the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Foundation Clinical Practice Guidelines, all individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should be tested for A1AT deficiency, and all individuals with unexplained chronic liver disease should be tested for A1AT deficiency as well. Nevertheless, even in symptomatic patients, the correct diagnosis is often delayed by many years. 
In December 2019, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation to DCR-A1AT for the treatment of congenital A1AT deficiency based on a positive opinion from the COMP of the EMA. We submitted a CTA to the Swedish Medical Products Agency in June 2019 to conduct a first-in-human Phase 1/2 study of DCR-A1AT, an investigational therapy from our GalXC™ technology platform. We expect dosing of the first patient in this Phase 1/2 study, named ESTRELLA, to occur in the second half of 2020.
The initial DCR-A1AT-101 clinical trial is a Phase 1/2 randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of DCR-A1AT in healthy volunteers and in patients with A1AT deficiency-associated liver disease. Secondary objectives are to characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of DCR-A1AT, to evaluate preliminary pharmacodynamics on serum A1AT protein concentrations, and to characterize the effect of DCR-A1AT on A1AT deficiency-associated liver disease evaluated by liver biopsy. Exploratory objectives include characterization of the effect of DCR-A1AT on A1AT deficiency-associated liver disease evaluated by biochemical markers as well as the effect on liver stiffness. The DCR-A1AT-101 clinical trial is divided into two phases or groups:

• | Group A is a single-ascending-dose arm in which a single dose of DCR-A1AT (0.1, 1.0, 3.0, 6.0, or 12.0 mg/kg) or placebo will be administered to up to 36 healthy volunteers, with a minimum 8-week follow-up. The first participant in Group A was dosed in November 2019; we expect dosing of Group A to be completed in the second half of 2020.


• | Group B is a multiple-ascending-dose arm in which DCR-A1AT (doses yet to be determined) or placebo will be administered to up to 24 participants with A1AT with a treatment and follow-up period of 12 weeks or more.

DCR-Undisclosed
We are currently pursuing preclinical development of an undisclosed candidate for the treatment of a common disease involving the liver. We expect to begin a Phase 1 study for this program in 2021.
Partner Development Programs
Novo Collaboration
On November 15, 2019, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Novo (the “Novo Collaboration Agreement”). Under the terms of the Novo Collaboration Agreement, we and Novo will seek to use Dicerna’s proprietary GalXC™ RNAi platform technology to progress novel therapies for the treatment of liver-related cardiometabolic diseases towards clinical development and commercialization. Under the Novo Collaboration Agreement, we and Novo plan to explore more than 30 gene targets associated with liver disease with the goal of delivering multiple clinical candidates for disorders including chronic liver disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), type 2 diabetes, obesity, and rare diseases. We will conduct and fund discovery and preclinical development to clinical candidate selection for each liver cell target. Novo will be responsible for all further development and commercialization, with Dicerna manufacturing clinical candidates selected for Phase-1-related clinical development, subject to reimbursement for its manufacturing costs. We also retain the ability to opt in to co-development of two programs during clinical development in Phases 1-3, subject to limitations in the event of a change in control of the Company. If we exercise the co-development option, we also have an option to co-promote the products in the United States, subject to limitations in the event of a change of control. Additionally, we may lead the development and commercialization of two programs targeting orphan liver diseases, with Novo retaining the ability to opt in to both programs in Phases 1-3. We and Novo will share profit and loss for the Company’s orphan liver and Novo products should both parties elect to co-develop.
12

The Novo Collaboration Agreement provides that we will work exclusively with Novo during the research collaboration period on the discovery, research, development, and commercialization of hepatocyte targets not otherwise subject to our existing partnerships and that Novo will, during a specified discovery period, work exclusively with Dicerna in any new research and development of compounds and products directed to collaboration targets using small interfering RNA (“siRNA”) conjugated to the sugar GalNAc to reduce the expression of specific target genes in the liver. Under the Novo Collaboration Agreement, we will provide Novo with exclusive and non-exclusive licenses and manufacturing support to enable Novo to commercialize products derived from or containing compounds developed pursuant to such agreement.
Under the terms of the Novo Collaboration Agreement, Novo paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $175.0 million in January 2020. Also, in December 2019, Novo made a $50.0 million equity investment in Dicerna at a premium pursuant to a share issuance agreement between the parties (the “Novo Share Issuance Agreement”). We are also eligible to receive an additional $75.0 million ($25.0 million at the end of each of the first three years of the Novo Collaboration Agreement), contingent upon us delivering GalXC™ molecules for a defined number of targets, and additional payments totaling up to $357.5 million per target upon achievement of specified development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. In addition, the Novo Collaboration Agreement provides that Novo will pay us mid-single-digits to mid-teens royalties on product sales on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of 10 years after the date of first commercial sale of each product in such country, expiration of specified patent rights in such country, or the expiration of specified regulatory exclusivity in such country for GalXC products, subject to royalty step-down provisions set forth in the agreement. 
Roche Collaboration
On October 30, 2019, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Roche (the “Roche Collaboration Agreement”). Under the terms of the Roche Collaboration Agreement, we and Roche will seek to progress RG6346, our investigational therapy in Phase 1 clinical development, toward worldwide development and commercialization. The Roche Collaboration Agreement also provides an option for the companies to collaborate in the discovery, development, and commercialization of oligonucleotide therapeutics intended for the treatment of HBV infection. 
The Roche Collaboration Agreement requires that we complete the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial, along with additional Phase 1 cohorts upon the request of Roche, who will reimburse us for the cost of the additional cohorts, after which Roche will lead the development and commercialization of the RG6346 program. Roche also has until receipt of interim Phase 1 data from the RG6346 Phase 1 study (but no later than December 31, 2020) to initiate a research and development collaboration with us to pursue up to five targets selected by Roche, which are intended primarily to treat HBV. Under the terms of the Roche Collaboration Agreement, the goal of such research and development will be to select compounds developed by us or Roche for Roche’s continued development and commercialization. The Roche Collaboration Agreement provides that we and Roche’s research and early development organization will work exclusively with each other during the research and development collaboration period on the discovery, research, and development of such targets selected by Roche, which includes our performance of certain services. Under the Roche Collaboration Agreement, we will provide Roche with exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to support Roche’s activities and to enable Roche to commercialize products derived from or containing compounds developed pursuant to such agreement. 
Under the terms of the Roche Collaboration Agreement, Roche paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $200.0 million in January 2020. We are also eligible to receive additional payments totaling up to approximately $1.47 billion, which includes payments upon achievement of specified development, regulatory, and commercial milestones. In addition, the Roche Collaboration Agreement provides that Roche will pay us up to mid-teens percent royalties on product sales. Royalties are payable until the later of 10 years after first commercial sale of each product in a country, expiration of patent rights in a country, or for products containing RG6346 in a given country, the expiration of data or regulatory exclusivity, subject to certain royalty step-down provisions set forth in the agreement. In addition, we have an option to co-fund the development of products including RG6346 under the agreement and, if exercised, receive high-twenties to mid-thirties royalty rates on the net sales of products in the U.S. If we exercise the co-funding option, we also have an option to co-promote products containing RG6346 in the U.S. 
Lilly Collaboration
On October 25, 2018, we entered into a Collaboration and License Agreement with Lilly (the “Lilly Collaboration Agreement”). The Lilly Collaboration Agreement is for the discovery, development, and commercialization of potential new medicines in the areas of cardiometabolic disease, neurodegeneration, and pain. Under the terms of the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, we and Lilly will seek to use our proprietary GalXC RNAi technology platform to progress new drug targets toward clinical development and commercialization. In addition, we will collaborate with Lilly to extend the GalXC RNAi platform technology to non-liver tissues, including neural tissues.
The Lilly Collaboration Agreement provides that we will work exclusively with Lilly in the neurodegeneration and pain fields with the exception of mutually agreed upon orphan indications. Additionally, we will work exclusively with Lilly on select targets in 
13

the cardiometabolic field. Under the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, we will provide Lilly with exclusive and non-exclusive licenses to support the companies’ activities and to enable Lilly to commercialize products derived from or containing compounds developed pursuant to such agreement. The Lilly Collaboration Agreement contemplates in excess of 10 targets.
Under the terms of the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, Lilly paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $100.0 million, and made a concurrent $100.0 million equity investment in Dicerna at a premium pursuant to a share issuance agreement between the parties (the “Lilly Share Issuance Agreement”). Under the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, we are also eligible to potentially receive up to approximately $350.0 million per target in development and commercialization milestones, in addition to a $5.0 million payment due for each of the non-hepatocyte targets when a product achieves proof of principle in an animal model. In addition, the Lilly Collaboration Agreement also provides that Lilly will pay us mid-single to low-double-digit royalties on product sales on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of expiration of patent rights in a country, the expiration of data or regulatory exclusivity in such country, or 10 years after the first product sale in such country, subject to certain royalty step-down provisions set forth in the agreement. 
We expect Lilly to submit an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application or CTA filing for the first GalXC molecule being developed under the Lilly Collaboration Agreement, LY3561774, in late 2020.
Alexion Collaboration
On October 22, 2018, we entered into a Collaborative Research and License Agreement (the “Alexion Collaboration Agreement”) with Alexion for the joint discovery and development of RNAi therapies for complement-mediated diseases. Under the terms of the Alexion Collaboration Agreement, we will collaborate with Alexion on the discovery and development of GalXC candidates for the treatment of complement-mediated diseases with potential global commercialization by Alexion. We will lead the joint discovery and research efforts through the preclinical stage, and Alexion will lead development efforts beginning with Phase 1 studies. We will be responsible for manufacturing of the GalXC candidates for use through the completion of Phase 1, the costs of which, after an initial cost-sharing period, will be paid by Alexion. Alexion will generally be responsible for the manufacturing of any product candidate subsequent to the completion of Phase 1. 
Under the terms of the Alexion Collaboration Agreement, Alexion paid us a non-refundable upfront payment of $22.0 million, with Alexion Pharmaceuticals making a concurrent $15.0 million equity investment in Dicerna at a premium pursuant to a share issuance agreement between us and Alexion Pharmaceuticals (the “Alexion Share Issuance Agreement”). The Alexion Collaboration Agreement also provides for potential additional payments to Dicerna of up to $600.0 million from proceeds from target option exercises and development and sales milestones, as defined in the agreement, which includes option exercise fees of up to $20.0 million, representing $10.0 million for each of the additional candidates selected; development milestones of up to $105.0 million for each product; and aggregate sales milestones of up to $160.0 million. Under the agreement, Alexion will also pay us mid-single to low-double-digit royalties on potential product sales on a country-by-country, product-by-product basis until the later of the expiration of patent rights in a country, the expiration of market or regulatory exclusivity in such country, or 10 years after the first product sale in such country, subject to certain royalty step-down provisions set forth in the agreement. 
In November 2019, the Company and Alexion amended the Alexion Collaboration Agreement to clarify funding of certain manufacturing costs for each of the two initial targets and increased milestone payments for the additional targets if Alexion exercised its options for the two additional targets.
In December 2019, Alexion exercised its options for the exclusive rights to two additional targets within the complement pathway for the discovery and development of GalXC™ RNAi molecules. These exercises expand the companies’ existing research collaboration and license agreement to now encompass four targets within the complement pathway, and provide Alexion with exclusive worldwide licenses, as well as development and commercial rights to the GalXC RNAi molecules developed in the collaboration. In connection with the option exercises, Alexion paid Dicerna a total of $20.0 million, or $10.0 million in option exercise fees per additional new target that will be recognized into revenue as the related services are performed. 
BI Collaboration
On October 27, 2017, we entered into a Collaborative Research and License Agreement with BI (the “BI Agreement”), pursuant to which we and BI agreed to jointly research and develop product candidates for the treatment of chronic liver diseases, with an initial focus on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”) using our GalXC platform. NASH is caused by the buildup of fat in the liver, potentially leading to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. NASH has an especially high prevalence among obese and diabetic patients and is an area of high unmet medical need. 
The BI Agreement is for the development of product candidates against one target gene with an option for BI to add the development of product candidates that target a second gene (the “Second Target”). We are responsible for the discovery and initial 
14

profiling, including primary preclinical studies, synthesis, and delivery of the product candidates. BI is responsible for evaluating and selecting the product candidates for further development. If BI selects one or more product candidates, it will be responsible for further preclinical development, clinical development, manufacturing, and commercialization of those products. Also pursuant to the BI Agreement, we granted BI a worldwide license in connection with the research and development of the product candidates and have transferred to BI certain intellectual property rights of the product candidates selected by BI for clinical development and commercialization. We also may provide assistance to BI in order to help BI further develop selected product candidates.
Under the terms of the BI Agreement, BI agreed to pay us a non-refundable upfront payment of $10.0 million for the first target. During the term of the research program, BI will reimburse Dicerna the cost of materials and third-party expenses that have been included in the preclinical studies up to an agreed-upon limit. We are eligible to receive up to $191.0 million in potential development and commercial milestones related to the initial target. We are also eligible to receive royalty payments tiered from high single digits up to low double-digits on potential net sales on a country-by-country (or territory-by-territory), product-by-product basis until the later of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of any product patent right covering the composition of matter of such product or 10 years after the first product sale in such country or territory, subject to certain royalty step-down provisions set forth in the agreement. BI’s Second Target option provided for an option fee payment of $5.0 million and success-based development and commercialization milestones and royalty payments to Dicerna.
In October 2018, BI exercised its Second Target option, which entitled the Company to a non-refundable payment of $5.0 million and reimbursement of $0.7 million for certain third-party expenses upon the agreement of a research work plan and budget for the Second Target. The terms of the Second Target option exercise and related rights and obligations associated with the Second Target were agreed between the Company and BI in an Additional Target Agreement (the “ATA”), which was entered into on December 31, 2018. Under the terms of the ATA, during the term of the research program, BI will reimburse us for certain expenses. We are eligible to receive up to $170.0 million in potential development and commercial milestones related to the Second Target. We are also eligible to receive tiered royalty payments on potential global net sales, subject to certain adjustments, in the mid-single digits. Other than as set forth in the ATA, development of the Second Target will be subject to the terms of the BI Agreement.
In addition to establishing the terms of the Second Target option exercise, the ATA also amends the BI Agreement to provide the parties with the opportunity to consider the development of product candidates targeting a further additional target gene (the “Third Target” option). 
Intellectual Property
We are seeking multifaceted and multi-layered protection for our intellectual property on a global level that includes licenses, confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements, copyrights, patents, trademarks, and trade secrets. We enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements with our employees, consultants, collaborators, subcontractors, and other third parties and generally seek to control access to our documentation and proprietary information as well as ownership to nascent intellectual property.
Patents and proprietary rights
We own U.S. patents and pending patent applications with claims to methods and compositions of matter that cover various aspects of our RNAi technology and our discovery technologies, including our proprietary GalXC technology. These U.S. patents include the following platform patents that protect our ability to make our structures: U.S. 8,349,809 (issued in January 2013, with a projected expiration date of January 2030); U.S. 8,513,207 (issued in August 2013, with a projected expiration date of May 2030); and U.S. 8,927,705 (issued in January 2015, with a projected expiration date of July 2030). These patents are from the same family of patents and constitute the core patents for our GalXC technology. We also own numerous patents and patent applications covering specific RNAi sequences that drive activity against a substantial number of high-value disease targets, including targets for our disclosed core and non-core programs. We have issued or pending claims to RNAi molecules, pharmaceutical compositions/formulations, methods of use, including in vitro and in vivo methods of reducing target gene expression, methods of treatment, methods of inhibiting cell growth, and methods of synthesis.
Our strategy around protection of our proprietary technology, including any innovations and improvements, is to obtain patent coverage in various jurisdictions around the world with a focus on jurisdictions that represent significant global pharmaceutical markets. Generally, patents have a term of 20 years from the earliest non-provisional priority date, assuming that all maintenance fees are paid, no portion of the patent has been terminally disclaimed, and the patent in question has not been invalidated by a court with proper jurisdiction. In certain jurisdictions, and in certain circumstances, patent terms can be extended or shortened. We are obtaining worldwide patent protection for novel molecules, composition of matter, pharmaceutical formulations, methods of use, including treatment of disease, methods of manufacture, and other novel uses for the inventive molecules originating from our research and development efforts, and other things. We continuously assess whether it is strategically more favorable to maintain confidentiality for the “know-how” regarding a novel invention or the trade secrets that may be inherent in a given process or method rather than pursue 
15

patent protection. For each patent application that is filed, we strategically tailor our claims in accordance with the existing patent landscape around a particular patentable matter.
We cannot predict with any certainty if any third-party U.S. or foreign patent rights, or other proprietary rights, will be deemed infringed by the use of our technology. Nor can we predict with certainty which, if any, of these rights will or may be asserted against us by third parties. Should we need to defend ourselves and our collaborators against any such claims, substantial costs may be incurred. Furthermore, parties making such claims may be able to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief, which could effectively block our ability to develop or commercialize some or all of our products in the U.S. and abroad and could result in the award of substantial damages. In the event of a claim of infringement, we or our collaborators may be required to obtain one or more licenses from a third party. There can be no assurance that we can obtain a license on a reasonable basis should we deem it necessary to obtain rights to an alternative technology that meets our needs. The failure to obtain a license may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.
We also rely on trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information. No assurance can be given that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets on a continuing basis. Others may independently develop substantially equivalent confidential and proprietary information or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.
It is our policy to require our employees and consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors who receive confidential information from us, to execute confidentiality agreements upon the commencement of employment or consulting relationships. These agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to these individuals during the course of the individual’s relationship with us is to be kept confidential and is not to be disclosed to third parties except in specific circumstances. The agreements provide that all inventions conceived by an employee shall be our property, except that employees are permitted to invent in unrelated fields during non-work hours, and such inventions would not be our property. There can be no assurance, however, that these agreements will provide meaningful protection or adequate remedies for our trade secrets in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of such information.
See Item 1A – “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Intellectual Property” for a more detailed discussion of the risks to our intellectual property.
Competition
To our knowledge, there are no companies other than ourselves and our collaborators developing GalXC molecules for therapeutic use. We believe that our scientific knowledge and expertise in RNAi-based therapies provide us with competitive advantages over the various companies and other entities that are attempting to develop similar treatments. However, many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals, and marketing approved products than we do. Our competition can be grouped into three broad categories:

• | Commercialized products and product candidates, as well as development programs that treat the same diseases for which we are also developing treatments. These companies include Oxthera AB, Allena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and Arbutus Biopharma;


• | Other companies working to develop RNAi therapeutic products. These companies include Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Silence Therapeutics Plc, Quark Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Avidity Biosciences, Inc.; and


• | Companies developing technology known as antisense, which, similar to the RNAi therapy we use, attempts to silence specific genes. These companies include Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Wave Life Sciences Ltd.

Our success will be based, in part, upon our ability to identify, develop, and manage a portfolio of drugs that offer competitive advantages such as improved safety, more convenient dosing, and greater efficacy than competing products for the treatment of our targeted patients. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are superior to the products we may develop. 
Summarized below is information on perceived competition for our most advanced product candidates.
Primary Hyperoxaluria
Currently, there are no approved drugs to treat primary hyperoxaluria. We believe that the following product candidates in clinical development, if approved, could compete with nedosiran:
16


Company | Drug | Drug Description | Phase 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | Lumasiran | RNAi therapeutic targeting glycolate oxidase specifically for the treatment of PH1 | Rolling NDA submission
Oxthera AB | Oxabact | Bacteria intended to interact with the intestinal epithelial cells and promote secretion of oxalate from the body | Phase 3 
Allena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | Reloxaliase(formerly ALLN-177) | RNAi enzyme to reduce oxalate levels | Phase 2 

There are also other companies that have preclinical development programs for the potential treatment of PH.
Hepatitis B Virus
Many companies across the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are seeking improved treatments for chronic HBV infection. It is generally accepted that improved treatments will consist of combinations of therapeutic agents, acting via different mechanisms of action. We consider our competitors to be those developing potential treatments for chronic HBV that act via a similar mechanism of action as our RG6346 product candidate; specifically, potential treatments that block or lead to the destruction of the mRNA and pgRNA of HBV. It may be possible for others to develop an improved treatment for chronic HBV that does not include this mechanism of action.
We believe that the following product candidates in clinical development, if approved, could compete with RG6346:    
Company | Drug | Drug Description | Phase 
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Collaborative Partner: Vir Biotechnology | ALN-HBV02VIR-2218 | RNAi-GalNAc conjugate | Phase 1/2 
Arbutus Biopharma | AB-729 | RNAi-GalNAc conjugate | Phase 1a/1b
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Collaborative Partner: Janssen | JNJ-3989 | RNAi-GalNAc conjugate | Phase 2 
Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Collaborative Partner: GlaxoSmithKline | IONIS-HBVRX | RNA-targeted antisense oligonucleotide | Phase 2 
Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.Collaborative Partner: GlaxoSmithKline | IONIS-HBV-LRX | RNA-targeted antisense oligonucleotide-GalNAc conjugate | Phase 2 

There are also other companies that have preclinical development programs for the potential treatment of HBV.
Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency-Associated Liver Disease
Currently, there are no approved drugs to treat alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency-associated liver disease. We believe that the following product candidates in clinical development, if approved, could compete with DCR-A1AT:

Company | Drug | Drug Description | Phase 
Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | ARO-AAT | RNAi-GalNAc conjugate | Phase 2/3
Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | ALN-AAT02 | RNAi-GalNAc conjugate | Phase 1/2
Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | VX-814 | Oral small-molecule corrector of misfolded AAT protein | Phase 1 
Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. | VX-864 | Oral small-molecule corrector of misfolded AAT protein | Phase 1 

If our lead product candidates are approved for the indications for which we undertake clinical trials, they may compete with therapies that are either in development or currently marketed by our competitors. However, notwithstanding the availability of existing drugs or drug candidates, we believe sufficient unmet medical need exists to warrant the continuing advancement of our investigational RNAi therapeutic programs.
17

Sales and Marketing
Our current focus is on the development of our existing portfolio, the initiation and completion of clinical trials, and, where appropriate, the registration of our product candidates. We currently do not have marketing, sales, or distribution capabilities, although we are actively developing such capabilities. If we receive marketing and commercialization approval for any of our product candidates, we intend to market the product either directly or through strategic alliances and distribution agreements with third parties. The ultimate implementation of our strategy for realizing the financial value of our product candidates is dependent on the results of clinical trials for our product candidates, the availability of funds, our ability to obtain adequate coverage of and reimbursement for our products, compliance with laws governing our sales and marketing activities, and the ability to negotiate acceptable commercial terms with third parties.
Manufacturing and Supply
We do not currently own or operate any manufacturing facilities for the production of preclinical, clinical, or commercial quantities of any of our product candidates. For each product candidate, we currently contract with third-party manufacturers and suppliers for certain drug materials, and we expect to continue to do so to meet the preclinical and clinical requirements of our product candidates. 
In November 2019, we entered into an initial five-year agreement with a supplier for the development, manufacture, and supply of clinical and commercial product. In January 2020, we executed an amendment to this agreement which allows for advance preferential scheduling to the manufacturing line. 
We typically order raw materials and services on a purchase order basis. We have not entered into long-term purchase commitments; however, from time to time, we make binding demand-based forecasts nine to 18 months ahead of planned supply requirements.
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern record-keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control, and quality assurance, among others. Our contract manufacturing organizations manufacture our product candidates under current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of pharmaceuticals that will be used in humans.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, record-keeping, advertising, distribution, sampling, pricing, sales and marketing, safety, post-approval monitoring and reporting, and export and import of products such as those we are developing. Our product candidates must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the U.S. and will be subject to similar requirements in other countries prior to marketing in those countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and the extensive laws and regulations that apply to drug products and product candidates in the U.S. are subject to change.
U.S. government regulation
NDA approval processes
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development or approval process, or after approval, may result in a delay of approval or subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:

• | refusal to approve pending applications;


• | withdrawal of an approval;


• | imposition of a clinical hold;


• | issuance of warning or untitled letters;


• | product recalls;

18


• | product seizures;


• | refusals of government contracts;


• | total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or


• | injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, civil penalties or criminal prosecution.

The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the U.S. generally includes the following:

• | completion of non-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies conducted according to Good Laboratory Practices (“GLPs”) or other applicable laws and regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;


• | approval by an institutional review board (“IRB”) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance and inspection of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials and clinical data according to FDA regulations and Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;


• | submission of an NDA to the FDA and the FDA’s acceptance of the NDA for filing;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product candidate is produced to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the major investigational sites to ensure data integrity and assess compliance with GCP requirements; and


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA.

Once a pharmaceutical candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or non-clinical testing stage. Non-clinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the non-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some non-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. In addition to including the results of the non-clinical studies, manufacturing, and quality information, the IND will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with FDA regulations and GCP. They must be conducted under protocols detailing the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. Each protocol and protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must timely report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigation brochure or any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the drug. All research subjects or their legally authorized representatives must provide their informed consent in writing prior to their participation in a clinical trial. An IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol and the informed consent form before a clinical trial commences at that institution, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations. Information about most clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”) to be publicly posted on the ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined.

• | Phase 1 – The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and elimination. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.


• | Phase 2 – Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.

19


• | Phase 3 – Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling.

Human clinical trials are inherently uncertain, and Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed. The FDA, the sponsor, or a data safety monitoring board, may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
During the development of a new product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to meet with the FDA at certain points prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2, and before an NDA is submitted. Meetings at other times may be requested. These meetings can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the meeting at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that they believe will support the approval of an NDA. If a Phase 2 clinical trial is the subject of discussion at the end of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA, a sponsor may be able to request a Special Protocol Assessment, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. In the case of Breakthrough Therapy Designation, communication with the FDA may occur more frequently than as outlined above.
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies and also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the safety, identity, strength, purity, and quality of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured and tested and will not approve the product unless cGMP compliance is satisfactory. The FDA will also typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with FDA regulations and GCP.
The results of product development, non-clinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product. The submission of an NDA is subject to the payment of user fees, but a waiver of such fees may be obtained under specified circumstances. The FDA reviews all NDAs submitted to ensure that they are sufficiently complete for substantive review before it accepts them for filing. It may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the NDA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a product is safe and effective for its intended use and whether its manufacturing is cGMP-compliant. The FDA typically requires that an NDA include data from two adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, but approval may be based upon a single adequate and well-controlled clinical trial in certain circumstances. The FDA may refuse to approve an NDA if the applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied or may require additional clinical or other data. Even if such data are submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA may refer the NDA to an advisory committee for review and recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may condition approval on the completion of post approval studies. Such studies may involve clinical trials designed to further assess a product’s safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. If the FDA determines that it is necessary to ensure the safe use of the drug, the FDA may also condition approval on the implementation of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (“REMS”). The REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.

Expedited review and approval
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, breakthrough, and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing product candidates. Generally, product candidates that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. A sponsor can request application of these programs either alone or in combination with each other, depending on the circumstances. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be shortened. None of the expedited approval programs change the NDA approval standard applied to a product.
New drugs are eligible for Fast Track status if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. Fast Track status entitles such a drug to expedited review and frequent contact with the FDA review division. Unlike other expedited review programs, Fast Track designation allows the FDA to accept for review individual sections of the NDA on a rolling basis. The FDA may also grant a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months from filing of an NDA, rather than the standard review of ten months from filing under current Prescription Drug User Fee Act guidelines. Most products that are eligible for Fast Track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
Drug products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions may receive accelerated approval upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA typically requires that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval conduct post-approval clinical trials. As an additional condition of approval, the FDA currently requires pre-approval of all promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
The FDA may expedite the approval of a designated breakthrough therapy, which is a drug that is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition for which preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. A sponsor may request that a drug be designated as a breakthrough therapy at any time during the clinical development of the product. If the FDA designates a drug as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA must take the appropriate steps to expedite the development and review of the application, which may include holding meetings with the sponsor and the review team throughout the development of the drug; providing timely advice to the sponsor regarding the development of the drug to ensure that the development program is as efficient as practicable; involving senior managers and experienced review staff, as appropriate, in a collaborative, cross-disciplinary review; and taking steps to ensure that the design of the clinical trials is as efficient as practicable.
In December 2016, the 21st Century Cures Act (“Cures Act”), was signed into law. The Cures Act included numerous provisions that may be relevant to our product candidates, including provisions designed to speed development of innovative and breakthrough therapies. The Cures Act amends the FDCA and the Public Health Service Act, to reauthorize and expand funding for the NIH and to authorize the FDA to increase spending on innovation projects. Central to the Cures Act are provisions that enhance and accelerate the FDA’s processes for reviewing and approving new drugs and supplements to approved NDAs. The Cures Act also includes a provision that requires certain manufacturers or distributors of an investigational drug to make their policies on the availability of certain expanded access programs publicly available. Because the Cures Act was enacted relatively recently and the FDA may take several years to develop these policies, it is difficult to know the full extent of how the Cures Act will affect our business.
Patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product candidate’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one half of the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of an NDA, plus the time between the submission date of an NDA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product candidate is eligible for the extension and the application for extension must be made prior to expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned or licensed patents to add 
21

patent life beyond their current expiration date, depending on the expected length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the submission of the relevant NDA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A product candidate is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new product candidate containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the product candidate substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) or a 505(b)(2) NDA (i.e., an NDA that contains full safety and effectiveness reports but allows at least some of the information required for NDA approval to come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant) submitted by another company for another version of such product candidate where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an approved NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing product candidate. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for product candidates containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Orphan drug designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to product candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. or more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a product candidate for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that product candidate. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product candidate that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications including a full NDA to market the same product candidate for the same indication, except in very limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our product candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same product candidate as defined by the FDA prior to us.
On August 8, 2017, the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (“FDARA”) was enacted. FDARA, among other things, codified the FDA’s pre-existing regulatory interpretation, to require that a drug sponsor demonstrate the clinical superiority of an orphan drug that is otherwise the same as a previously approved drug for the same rare disease in order to receive orphan drug exclusivity. The new legislation reverses prior precedent holding that the Orphan Drug Act unambiguously requires that the FDA recognize the orphan exclusivity period regardless of a showing of clinical superiority. The FDA may further reevaluate the Orphan Drug Act, including the FDARA amendment, its regulations and policies. We do not know if, when, or how the FDA may change the orphan drug regulations and policies in the future, and it is uncertain how any changes might affect our business. Depending on what changes the FDA may make to its orphan drug regulations and policies, our business could be adversely impacted.
Pediatric exclusivity, pediatric use and rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, certain product candidates may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA (a “Written Request”) relating to the use of the active moiety of the product candidate in children. The FDA may not issue a Written Request for studies on unapproved or approved indications or where it determines that information relating to the use of a product candidate in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may not produce health benefits in that population.
FDARA amended the FDCA to provide that a drug, for which an application has been submitted or approved pursuant to section 505(b)(2) or 505(j) of the FDCA, will not be considered ineligible for approval or misbranded because the labeling of such drug omits a pediatric indication or other pediatric labeling information when the omitted pediatric information is protected by patent or marketing exclusivity. FDARA further permits FDA to require specific labeling for such products related to the omitted pediatric indication and information to, among other things, make clear that the omission of the information is related to the exclusivity. We do not know if or how such changes to the pediatric exclusivity provisions might affect our business.
22

In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (“PREA”) requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most product candidates and biologics, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs, biologics license applications and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The sponsor or the FDA may request a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product candidate or biologic is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. After April 2013, the FDA must send a noncompliance letter to any sponsor that fails to submit the required assessment, keep a deferral current or fails to submit a request for approval of a pediatric formulation. PREA does not apply to any drug for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. However, if only one indication for a product has orphan designation, a pediatric assessment may still be required for any applications to market that same product for the non-orphan indication(s).
Section 529 of the FDCA is intended to encourage development of new drug and biological products for prevention and treatment of certain rare pediatric diseases. Although there are existing incentive programs to encourage the development and study of drugs for rare diseases, pediatric populations, and unmet medical needs, section 529 provides an additional incentive for rare pediatric diseases, which may be used alone or in combination with other incentive programs. “Rare pediatric disease” is defined as a disease that:

• | is “a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years, including age groups often called neonates, infants, children, and adolescents”; and


• | is “a rare disease or condition” as defined in the FDCA, which includes diseases and conditions that affect fewer than 200,000 persons in the U.S. and diseases and conditions that affect a larger number of persons and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the costs of developing and making available the drug in the U.S. can be recovered from sales of the drug in the U.S.

Under section 529, the sponsor of a human drug application for a rare pediatric disease drug product may be eligible for a voucher that can be used (or sold) to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug application submitted under section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA or section 351 of the Public Health Service Act after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug product. The rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers program was re-authorized by Congress in the Cures Act, extending the program through 2020. The FDA has issued draft Guidance for Industry for Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Vouchers.
Post-approval requirements
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product candidate reaches the market. Requirements for additional Phase 4 trials (post-approval marketing studies) to confirm safety and efficacy may be imposed as a condition of approval. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product candidate may result in REMS or even complete withdrawal of the product candidate from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product candidate, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling changes, are subject to further FDA review and approval. In addition, the FDA may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved product candidates that have been commercialized, and the FDA has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product candidate based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
Any product candidates manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:

• | record-keeping requirements;


• | reporting of adverse experiences with the product candidate;


• | submission of periodic reports;


• | providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information;


• | drug sampling, stability and distribution requirements;


• | notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes; and


• | complying with statutory and regulatory requirements for promotion and advertising.

23

Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved product candidates are required to register their establishments and provide product listing information to the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws.
Regulation outside of the U.S.
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we will be subject to regulations of other jurisdictions governing any clinical trials and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain approval by the comparable regulatory authorities of countries outside of the U.S. before we can commence clinical trials in such countries, and approval of the regulators of such countries or supranational areas, such as the European Union (“EU”), before we may market products in those countries or areas. The approval process and requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from place to place, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval.
Under EU regulatory systems, a company may submit marketing authorization applications either under a centralized or decentralized procedure. The centralized procedure, which is compulsory for certain medicines, including those produced by biotechnology or those intended to treat HIV, AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases or diabetes and is optional for those medicines which are a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or whose authorization would be in the interest of public health, provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all EU member states. Through the decentralized procedure, a medicinal product that has not yet been authorized in the EU can be simultaneously authorized in several EU member states. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment reports, each member state must decide whether to recognize the approval. If a member state does not recognize the marketing authorization, the disputed points are eventually referred to the European Commission, whose decision is binding on all member states.
As in the U.S., we may apply for designation of a product candidate as an orphan drug for the treatment of a specific indication in the EU before the application for marketing authorization is made. Sponsors of orphan drugs in the EU can enjoy economic and marketing benefits, including up to 10 years of market exclusivity for the approved indication. During such period, marketing authorization applications for “similar” medicinal products will not be accepted, unless another applicant can show that its product is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the orphan-designated product. In the EU, a “similar medicinal product” is a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in a currently authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication.
Coverage and Reimbursement
In the U.S. and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely only on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Thus, sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which the costs of our products will be covered and paid for by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. In the United States, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price or reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or another alternative is available. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity, and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products and services and imposing controls to manage costs.
In order to secure coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, a company may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of the product, in addition to the costs required to obtain FDA or other comparable regulatory approvals. Additionally, companies may also need to provide discounts to purchases, private health plans, or government healthcare programs. Nonetheless, products may not be considered medically necessary or cost effective. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician utilization once the product is approved and have a material adverse effect on sales, results of operations, and financial condition. Additionally, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, one payor’s determination to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payors will also provide coverage and reimbursement for the product, and the level of coverage and reimbursement can differ significantly from payor to payor. 
24

Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs has become a priority of federal and state governments, and the prices of drugs have been a focus in this effort. The U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. For example, the current U.S. administration has indicated support for possible new measures to regulate drug pricing. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could significantly limit our net revenue and financial results. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis.
The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (“MMA”) imposed new requirements for the distribution and pricing of prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities which will provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Part D plans include both stand-alone prescription drug benefit plans and prescription drug coverage as a supplement to Medicare Advantage plans. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for our products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan will likely be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. Any reduction in payment that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from non-governmental payors.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had a significant impact on the health care industry by, for example, expanding coverage for the uninsured and seeking to contain overall healthcare costs. Regarding pharmaceutical products, among other things, the ACA contains provisions of importance to our potential product candidates, including among other things, provisions that:

• | created an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports specified branded prescription drugs and biologic products, apportioned among these entities according to their market share in certain government healthcare programs;


• | expanded eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs by, among other things, allowing states to offer Medicaid coverage to certain individuals with income at or below 133% of the federal poverty level, thereby potentially increasing a manufacturer’s Medicaid rebate liability;


• | expanded manufacturers’ rebate liability under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program by increasing the minimum rebate for both branded and generic drugs and revising the definition of average manufacturer price (“AMP”) for calculating and reporting Medicaid drug rebates on outpatient prescription drug prices;


• | addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected;


• | expanded the types of entities eligible for the 340B drug discount program; and


• | created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.

Recently, the current U.S. administration and U.S. Congress have expressed a desire to modify, repeal, or otherwise invalidate all, or certain provisions of, the ACA, which has contributed to the uncertainty of the ongoing implementation and impact of the ACA and also underscores the potential for additional health care reform going forward. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision effective January 1, 2019, repealing the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. On December 18, 2019, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that the individual mandate is unconstitutional, and remanded the case to the lower court to reconsider its earlier invalidation of the full ACA. Congress may consider other legislation that would alter other aspects of the ACA.
There is still uncertainty with respect to the impact the current U.S. administration, the U.S. Congress, and the courts may have, if any, and any changes will likely take time to unfold. Such reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from 
25

product candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop product candidates.
Further legislation or regulation could be passed that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, in August 2011, President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal years 2012 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect beginning on April 1, 2013 and will stay in effect through 2027 unless additional Congressional action is taken. In addition, on February 9, 2018, Congress passed the Bipartisan Budget Act that made several healthcare reforms. For example, the law changes the discounts manufacturers are required to apply to their drugs under the Coverage Gap Discount Program from 50% to 70% of the negotiated price starting in 2019. In addition, the law increases civil and criminal penalties for fraud and abuse laws, including, for example, increases in both criminal fines for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute and corresponding prison sentences.
 Also, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which have resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed bills designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. For example, on September 25, 2019, the Senate Finance Committee introduced the Prescription Drug Pricing Reduction Action of 2019, a bill intended to reduce Medicare and Medicaid prescription drug prices. The proposed legislation would restructure the Part D benefit, modify payment methodologies for certain drugs, and impose an inflation cap on drug price increases. An even more restrictive bill, the Lower Drugs Costs Now Act of 2019 has passed out of the House and was delivered to the Senate on December 16, 2019, and would require Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers. It is unclear whether either of these bills will make it through both chambers and be signed into law, and if either is enacted, what effect it would have on our business. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly aggressive in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures. For example, in September 2017, the California State Assembly approved SB17 which requires pharmaceutical companies to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before certain scheduled increases in the prices of their products, and further requiring pharmaceutical companies to explain the reasons for such increases. Effective in 2016, Vermont passed a law requiring a certain manufacturer identified by the state to justify their price increases.
In addition, in some non-U.S. jurisdictions, the proposed pricing for a product candidate must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing vary widely from country to country. For example, the EU provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls and/or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our product candidates. Historically, product candidates launched in the EU do not follow price structures of the U.S. and generally tend to have price structures that are significantly lower.
Other Healthcare Fraud and Laws
In the U.S., our activities are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”), other divisions of the HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (“HIPAA”) and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between therapeutic product manufacturers on one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other. There are a number of statutory 
26

exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all of its facts and circumstances. Additionally, the intent standard under the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the ACA to a stricter standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act (the “FCA”) (discussed below).
The federal false claims and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which imposes significant penalties and can be enforced by private citizens through civil qui tam actions, prohibit any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal healthcare programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Like the Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA amended the intent standard for certain healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
Also, many states have similar, and typically more prohibitive, fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Additionally, to the extent that our product candidates may in the future be sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
We may be subject to data privacy and security regulations by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and its implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to business associates, independent contractors, or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce HIPAA and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in specified circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not preempted by HIPAA, and may have a more prohibitive effect than HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. Additionally, more general personal privacy laws have also been enacted by various States and by other countries where we do business, such as member countries of the European Union, that require adoption of policies and procedures to protect, properly store, and to obtain permission to use in our business and clinical research. 
For example, in California, the California Consumer Protection Act (“CCPA”), which went into effect on January 1, 2020, established a new privacy framework for covered businesses by creating an expanded definition of personal information, establishing new data privacy rights for consumers in the State of California, imposing special rules on the collection of consumer data from minors, and creating a new and potentially severe statutory damages framework for violations of the CCPA and for businesses that fail to implement reasonable security procedures and practices to prevent data breaches. While clinical trial data and information governed by HIPAA are currently exempt from the current version of the CCPA, other personal information may be applicable and possible changes to the CCPA may broaden its scope. The collection and use of personal health information in the European Union is governed by the provisions of the Data Protection Directive, and as of May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). This directive imposes several requirements relating to the consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, the information provided to the individuals, notification of data processing obligations to the competent national data protection authorities, and the security and confidentiality of the personal data. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU to the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the Data Protection Directive (which governs the collection and use of personal health data in the EU), the GDPR, and the related national data protection laws of the EU member states may result in fines and other administrative penalties. The GDPR introduced new data protection requirements in the EU and substantial fines for 
27

breaches of the data protection rules. This may be onerous and may adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.
Failure to comply could result in penalties and interruption of our business should a violation occur.
We expect our product candidates, once approved, may be eligible for coverage under Medicare, the federal health care program that provides health care benefits to the aged and disabled, and covers outpatient services and supplies, including certain pharmaceutical products, that are medically necessary to treat a beneficiary’s health condition. In addition, our product candidates may be covered and reimbursed under other government programs, such as Medicaid and the 340B Drug Pricing Program. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Under the 340B Drug Pricing Program, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities that participate in the program. As part of the requirements to participate in certain government programs, many pharmaceutical manufacturers must calculate and report certain price reporting metrics to the government, such as average manufacturer price, or AMP, and best price. Penalties may apply in some cases when such metrics are not submitted accurately and timely.
Additionally, the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act (the “Sunshine Act”), within the ACA, and its implementing regulations, require that certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biological and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) report annually to CMS information related to certain payments or other transfers of value made or distributed to physicians and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians and teaching hospitals and to report annually certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to report accurately could result in penalties. In addition, many states also govern the reporting of payments or other transfers of value, many of which differ from each other in significant ways, are often not preempted, and may have a more prohibitive effect than the Sunshine Act, thus further complicating compliance efforts.
Environment
Our third-party manufacturers are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state, and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently, and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure we are in compliance with these laws and regulations. We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations.
Employees
As of December 31, 2019, we had 187 full-time employees, of whom 138 are engaged in research and development and 49 in administration. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Geographically, 154 of our employees are located in Massachusetts, 25 in Colorado, and one each in Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, and Wisconsin, United States. Two of our employees are located in Germany.
