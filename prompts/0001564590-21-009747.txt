Company Overview 
 
We are a television broadcasting and digital media company focused on the acquisition, development and operation of television stations and interactive community websites and digital media services throughout the United States. We also own WGN America, a national general entertainment cable network and the home of our national newscast “NewsNation,” digital multicast network services, various digital products, services and content, a 31.3% ownership stake in Television Food Network, G.P. (“TV Food Network”), and a portfolio of real estate assets. 
 
As of December 31, 2020, we owned, operated, programmed or provided sales and other services to 198 full power television stations, including those owned by VIEs, and one AM radio station in 116 markets in 39 states and the District of Columbia. The stations are affiliates of ABC, NBC, FOX, CBS, The CW, the MyNetworkTV (“MNTV”) and other broadcast television networks. As of December 31, 2020, we reached approximately 39% of U.S. television households (applying the Federal Communications Commission’s (“FCC”) ultra-high-frequency (“UHF”) discount).
 
The stations we own and operate or provide services to provide free programming to our markets’ television viewing audiences. This programming includes programs produced by networks with which the stations are affiliated, programs that the stations produce, and first-run and rerun syndicated programs that the stations acquire. Our cable network delivers a growing national newscast and quality television series and movies. Our primary sources of revenue include the sale of commercial air time on our stations to local advertisers, the sale of commercial time on our stations and cable network to national advertisers, the sale of advertising on each of our stations’ websites and mobile applications where we deliver community focused content, and the revenues earned from our retransmission consent and carriage agreements with traditional multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”), such as cable and satellite providers, and online video distributors (“OVDs”), companies that provide video content through internet streaming.  
 
Our digital businesses include video and display advertising platforms that are delivered locally or nationally through our own and various third party websites and mobile applications, a recently acquired consumer product reviews platform and other digital media solutions to media publishers and advertisers. We are focused on new technologies and growing our portfolio of digital products, services and content complementary to our vision of providing local news, entertainment and sports content through broadcast and digital platforms.
 
We seek to grow our revenue, operating income, EBITDA and cash flow by increasing the audience and revenue shares of the stations we own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to, as well as through our growing portfolio of digital products, services and content. We strive to increase the audience share of the stations by creating a strong local broadcasting presence based on highly rated local news, local sports coverage and active community sponsorship. We seek to improve revenue share by employing and supporting a high-quality local sales force that leverages the stations’ strong local brands and community presence with local advertisers. We further improve broadcast cash flow by maintaining strict control over operating and programming costs. The benefits achieved through these initiatives are magnified in our duopoly markets by owning or providing services to stations affiliated with multiple networks, capitalizing on multiple sales forces and achieving an increased level of operational efficiency. As a result of our operational enhancements, we expect revenue from the stations we have acquired or begun providing services to in the last four years to grow faster than that of our more mature stations. 
 
We hold a variety of investments. TV Food Network, in which we have a 31.3% interest, operates two 24-hour television networks, Food Network and Cooking Channel, as well as their related websites. Food Network is a fully distributed network in the United States with content distributed internationally. Cooking Channel is a digital-tier network available nationally and airs popular off-Food Network programming as well as originally produced programming. We also own attractive real estate in key markets, including development rights for certain of our real estate assets.
 
We are a Delaware corporation formed in 1996. Our principal offices are at 545 E. John Carpenter Freeway, Suite 700, Irving, TX 75062. Our telephone number is (972) 373-8800 and our website is http://www.nexstar.tv.

 See Notes 3 and 9 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the above transactions.
 Operating Strategy 
 We seek to generate revenue, operating income, EBITDA and cash flow growth through the following strategies: 
 Develop Leading Local Franchises. Each of the stations that we own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to creates a highly recognizable local brand, primarily through the quality of local news programming and community presence. Based on internally generated analysis, we believe that in over 74% of our markets in which we produce local newscasts, we rank among the top two stations in local news viewership. Strong local news typically generates higher ratings among attractive demographic profiles and enhances audience loyalty, which may result in higher ratings for programs both preceding and following the news. High ratings and strong community identity make the stations that we own, operate, program, or provide sales and other services to more attractive to local advertisers. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we earned approximately 43% of our advertising revenue from spots aired during local news programming. Currently, our stations and the stations we provide services to typically provide between 15 to 40 hours per week of local news programming, but as high as 80 hours per week in stations with enhanced time periods for local news. Extensive local sports coverage, active sponsorship of community events and the local news stories our Washington, D.C. bureau focuses on further differentiate us from our competitors and strengthen our community relationships and our local advertising appeal. 
 Invest in Digital Media. We are focused on new technologies and growing our portfolio of digital products, services and content. Our station websites provide access to our local news and information, as well as community centric businesses and services. We delivered digital content to audiences across all of our station web sites in 2020, with approximately 91 million unique monthly users who utilized nearly 7.8 billion page views. Also in 2020, our mobile websites and mobile application accounted for 43% and 38%, respectively, of our station websites’ overall page views by year end. We are committed to serving our local markets by providing local content to both online and mobile users wherever and whenever they want. We have also invested in various digital product lines, including video and display advertising platforms that are delivered locally or nationally through our own and various third party websites and mobile applications, a recently acquired consumer product reviews platform and other digital media solutions to media publishers and advertisers.
 Emphasize Local Sales. We employ a high-quality local sales force in each of our markets to increase revenue from local advertisers by capitalizing on our investment in local programming and community websites. We believe that local advertising is attractive because our sales force is more effective with local advertisers, giving us a greater ability to influence this revenue source. Additionally, local advertising has historically been a more stable source of revenue than national advertising for television broadcasters. For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue generated by our stations from core local advertising represented approximately 69% of our stations’ consolidated core advertising net revenue (total of core local and national advertising net revenue, excluding political advertising revenue). In most of our markets, we have increased the size and quality of our local sales force. We also invest in our sales efforts by implementing comprehensive training programs and employing a sophisticated inventory tracking system to help maximize advertising rates and the amount of inventory sold in each time period. 
 Capitalize on Diverse Network Affiliations.  We currently own, operate, program or provide sales and other services to a balanced portfolio of television stations with diverse network affiliations, including ABC, NBC, CBS, and FOX affiliated stations, which represented approximately 11.9%, 21%, 22.8% and 25.3%, respectively, of our 2020 combined core (local and national) and political advertising net revenue. The networks provide these stations with quality programming and numerous sporting events such as NBA basketball, Major League baseball, NFL football, NCAA sports, PGA golf and the Olympic Games. Because network programming and ratings change frequently, the diversity of our station portfolio’s network affiliations reduces our reliance on the quality of programming from a single network.
 Operate Duopoly Markets. Owning or providing services to more than one station in a given market enables us to broaden our audience share, enhance our revenue share and achieve significant operating efficiencies. Duopoly markets broaden audience share by providing programming from multiple networks with different targeted demographics. These markets increase revenue share by capitalizing on multiple sales forces. Additionally, we achieve significant operating efficiencies by consolidating physical facilities, eliminating redundant management and leveraging capital expenditures between stations. We derived approximately 53% of our stations’ net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 from our duopoly markets.

Operate and Expand NewsNation.  In September 2020, WGN America successfully launched NewsNation, a live daily three-hour national newscast during prime time. By aggregating our current news resources of 5,500 journalists in 110 newsrooms to produce a national newscast, we can leverage WGN America’s strong reach across the United States. Beginning on March 1, 2021, we will rebrand WGN America as NewsNation, rename our national prime time newscast to “NewsNationPrime” to air every night from 8 p.m. to 10 p.m. Eastern Time and launch “Banfield,” an hour-long news and talk show, to air weeknights at 10 p.m. Eastern Time. We are also expanding NewsNation’s programming to five hours on weeknights with the launch of two new hour-long shows: “NewsNation Early Edition” at 6 p.m. Eastern Time and “The Donlon Report” at 7 p.m. Eastern Time. WGN America is currently available in approximately 74 million households as estimated by The Nielsen Company (US), LLC.
 Maintain Strict Cost Controls. We emphasize strict controls on operating and programming costs in order to increase EBITDA and free cash flow. We continually seek to identify and implement cost savings at each of our stations, the stations we provide services to and other business units, and our overall size benefits each station or business unit with respect to negotiating favorable terms with programming suppliers and other vendors. By leveraging our size and corporate management expertise, we are able to achieve economies of scale by providing programming, financial, sales and marketing support to our stations, the stations we provide services to and other business units. 
 Monetization of Real Estate Assets.  We intend to maximize the monetization of our real estate assets by continuously assessing market conditions and executing on what we believe are the best strategies for each of the properties such as opportunistic divestitures, including select properties as part of an accelerated monetization program and improving entitlements of properties to increase value prior to monetization.
 Attract and Retain High Quality Management. We seek to attract and retain station general managers with proven track records in larger television markets by providing equity incentives not typically offered by other station operators in our markets. Most of our station general managers have been granted restricted stock units and stock options and have extensive experience in the television broadcasting industry. 
Acquisition Strategy 
 We selectively pursue acquisitions of television stations where we believe we can improve revenue, operating income, EBITDA and cash flow through active management. When considering an acquisition, we evaluate the target audience share, revenue share, overall cost structure and proximity to our regional clusters. Additionally, we seek to acquire or enter into local service agreements with stations to create duopoly markets. We selectively pursue acquisitions of digital properties, including new technologies and growing our portfolio of digital products, services and content, that leverage our capabilities and complementary to our vision of providing local news, entertainment and sports content through broadcast and digital platforms. 
 
Relationship with VIEs
 Through various local service agreements, as of December 31, 2020, we provided sales, programming and other services to 36 full power television stations owned by consolidated VIEs and one full power television station owned by an unconsolidated VIE. As of December 31, 2020, all of the VIEs and their stations are 100% owned by independent third parties. In compliance with FCC regulations for all the parties, the VIEs maintain complete responsibility for and control over programming, finances, personnel and operations of their stations. However, for the consolidated VIEs, we are deemed under U.S. GAAP to have controlling financial interests in these entities because of (1) the local service agreements Nexstar has with the consolidated VIEs’ stations, (2) Nexstar’s guarantee of the obligations incurred under Mission’s senior secured credit facility, (3) Nexstar having power over significant activities affecting the consolidated VIEs’ economic performance, including budgeting for advertising revenue, certain advertising sales and, in some cases, hiring and firing of sales force personnel and (4) purchase options granted by each consolidated VIE which permit Nexstar to acquire the assets and assume the liabilities of all but three of the consolidated VIEs’ stations at any time, subject to FCC consent. These purchase options are freely exercisable or assignable by Nexstar without consent or approval by the VIEs. These option agreements expire on various dates between 2021 and 2028. We expect to renew these option agreements upon expiration. Therefore, these VIEs are consolidated into these financial statements.
 For additional information on VIEs, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Industry Background 
 Commercial television broadcasting began in the United States on a regular basis in the 1940s. A limited number of channels are available for over-the-air broadcasting in any one geographic area and a license to operate a television station must be granted by the FCC. All television stations in the country are grouped by The Nielsen Company (US), LLC, a national audience measuring service, into 210 generally recognized television markets, known as DMAs, that are ranked in size according to various metrics based upon actual or potential audience. Each DMA is an exclusive geographic area consisting of all counties in which the home-market commercial stations receive the greatest percentage of total viewing hours. The Nielsen Company (US), LLC publishes data on estimated audiences for the television stations in each DMA on a quarterly basis. The estimates are expressed in terms of a “rating,” which is a station’s percentage of the total potential audience in the market, or a “share,” which is the station’s percentage of the audience actually watching television. A station’s rating in the market can be a factor in determining advertising rates. 
 Most television stations are affiliated with networks and receive a significant part of their programming, including prime-time hours, from networks. Whether or not a station is affiliated with one of the four major networks (NBC, CBS, FOX or ABC) has a significant impact on the composition of the station’s revenue, expenses and operations. Network programming is provided to the affiliate by the network in exchange for the payment to the network of affiliation fees and the network’s retention of a substantial majority of the advertising time during network programs. The network then sells this advertising time and retains the revenue. The affiliate retains the revenue from the remaining advertising time it sells during network programs and from advertising time it sells during non-network programs. 
 Broadcast television stations compete for advertising revenue primarily with other commercial broadcast television stations, MVPDs, OVDs, Google, Facebook and other online media, newspapers and radio stations serving the same market. Non-commercial, religious and Spanish-language broadcasting stations in many markets also compete with commercial stations for viewers. In addition, the Internet and other leisure activities may draw viewers away from commercial television stations. 
 Advertising Sales 
 General 
 Television station revenue is derived from the sale of local and national advertising. All network-affiliated stations are required to carry advertising sold by their networks which reduces the amount of advertising time available for sale by stations. Our stations sell the remaining advertising to be inserted in network programming and the advertising in non-network programming, retaining all of the revenue received from these sales. A national syndicated program distributor will often retain a portion of the available advertising time for programming it supplies in exchange for no fees or reduced fees charged to stations for such programming. These programming arrangements are referred to as barter programming. 
 Advertisers wishing to reach a national audience usually purchase time directly from the networks or advertise nationwide on a case-by-case basis. National advertisers who wish to reach a particular region or local audience often buy advertising time directly from local stations through national advertising sales representative firms. Local businesses purchase advertising time directly from the station’s local sales staff. 
 Advertising rates are based upon a number of factors, including: 
  
• | a program’s popularity among the viewers that an advertiser wishes to target;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the number of advertisers competing for the available time;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | the size and the demographic composition of the market served by the station;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the availability of alternative advertising media in the market;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | the effectiveness of the station’s sales force;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | development of projects, features and programs that tie advertiser messages to programming; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the level of spending commitment made by the advertiser.
--+---------------------------------------------------------

 Advertising rates are also determined by a station’s overall ability to attract viewers in its market area, as well as the station’s ability to attract viewers among particular demographic groups that an advertiser may be targeting. Advertising revenue is positively affected by strong local economies. Conversely, declines in advertising budgets of advertisers, particularly in recessionary periods, adversely affect the broadcast industry and, as a result, may contribute to a decrease in the revenue of broadcast television stations. 
 13

Seasonality 
 Advertising revenue is positively affected by national and regional political election campaigns, and certain events such as the Olympic Games or the Super Bowl. Stations’ advertising revenue is generally highest in the second and fourth quarters of each year, due in part to increases in consumer advertising in the spring and retail advertising in the period leading up to, and including, the holiday season. In addition, advertising revenue is generally higher during even-numbered years when state, congressional and presidential elections occur and advertising is aired during the Olympic Games. 
Local Sales 
 Local advertising time is sold by each station’s local sales staff who call upon advertising agencies and local businesses, which typically include car dealerships, retail stores and restaurants. Compared to revenue from national advertising accounts, revenue from local advertising is generally more stable and more predictable. We seek to attract new advertisers to our television stations and websites and to increase the amount of advertising time sold to existing local advertisers by relying on experienced local sales forces with strong community ties, producing news and other programming with local advertising appeal and sponsoring or co-promoting local events and activities. We place a strong emphasis on the experience of our local sales staff and maintain an on-going training program for sales personnel. 
National Sales 
 National advertising time is sold through national sales representative firms which call upon advertising agencies, whose clients typically include automobile manufacturers and dealer groups, telecommunications companies, fast food franchisers and national retailers (some of which may advertise locally). 
Distribution Revenue
 We receive compensation from cable, satellite and other MVPDs and OVDs in return for our consent to the retransmission of the signals of our television stations and the carriage of WGN America. The revenues primarily represent payments from the MVPDs and OVDs and are typically based on the number of subscribers they have. Our successful negotiations with these distributors have created agreements that now produce meaningful sustainable revenue streams.
Network Affiliations 
 Except for WGN-TV, WDVM and KAUT (independent stations), all of the full power television stations that we own and operate, program or provide sales and other services to as of December 31, 2020 are affiliated with a network pursuant to an affiliation agreement. The agreements with ABC, FOX, NBC, and CBS are the most significant to our operations. The terms of these agreements expire as discussed below:

Network Affiliations | Expiration Date 
---------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ABC | 29 agreements expire in December 2022. 
FOX | Of the 43 agreements, one(1) expires in December 2021 and 42 expire in August 2023. 
NBC | 35 agreements expire in December 2024. 
CBS | Of the 49 agreements, 13 expire in December 2021, 22 expire in December 2022, and 11 expire in June 2023 and 3 expire in June 2024.

(1)The affiliation agreement is owned by a station to which we provide sales and other services. We do not consolidate this station in our financial statements due to lack of a controlling financial interest.
 
Each affiliation agreement provides the affiliated station with the right to broadcast all programs transmitted by the network with which it is affiliated. In exchange, the network receives affiliation fees and has the right to sell a substantial majority of the advertising time during these broadcasts. We expect the network affiliation agreements listed above to be renewed upon expiration.

Investments
 We hold a variety of investments as further described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. Currently, we derive significant cash flows from our largest equity method investment, a 31.3% interest in TV Food Network which operates two 24-hour television networks, Food Network and Cooking Channel, as well as their related websites. During 2020, we received cash distributions from TV Food Network totaling $223.3 million. Our partner in TV Food Network is Discovery, Inc. (“Discovery”), which owns a 68.7% interest in TV Food Network and operates the networks on behalf of the partnership. Food Network programming content attracts audiences interested in food-related topics such as food preparation, dining out, entertaining, food manufacturing, nutrition and healthy eating. Food Network engages audiences by creating original programming that is entertaining, instructional and informative. Food Network is a fully distributed network in the United States with content distributed internationally. Cooking Channel caters to avid food lovers by focusing on food information and instructional cooking programming and delivers content focused on baking, ethnic cuisine, wine and spirits, healthy and vegetarian cooking and kids’ foods. Cooking Channel is a digital-tier network, available nationally and airs popular off-Food Network programming as well as originally produced programming.
Competition 
 Competition in the television industry takes place on several levels: competition for audience, competition for programming and competition for advertising.
 Audience. We compete for audience share specifically on the basis of program popularity. The popularity of a station’s programming has a direct effect on the advertising rates it can charge its advertisers. A portion of the daily programming on the stations that we own or provide services to is supplied by the network with which each station is affiliated. In those periods, the stations are dependent upon the performance of the network programs in attracting viewers. Stations program non-network time periods with a combination of self-produced news, public affairs and other entertainment programming, including movies and syndicated programs. The major television networks have also begun to provide their programming directly to the consumer via portable digital devices, such as tablets and cell phones, which present an additional source of competition for television broadcaster audience share. Other sources of competition for audience include home entertainment systems (such as DVDs and DVRs), video-on-demand and pay-per-view, the Internet (including network distribution of programming through websites and mobile platforms) and gaming devices.
 Although the commercial television broadcast industry historically has been dominated by the ABC, NBC, CBS and FOX television networks, other newer television networks and the growth in popularity of subscription systems, such as local cable and direct broadcast satellite (“DBS”) systems and video streaming services, which air exclusive programming not otherwise available in a market, have become significant competitors for the over-the-air television audience.
 WGN America’s NewsNation, our growing national newscast, competes with other established national newscasts such as CNN, FOX News and MSNBC for viewers. WGN America’s entertainment programming also competes for viewers with other distribution technologies.
 Programming. Competition for programming involves negotiating with national program distributors or syndicators that sell first-run and rerun packages of programming. Stations compete against in-market broadcast station operators for exclusive access to off-network reruns and first-run product in their respective markets. Cable systems generally do not compete with local stations for programming, although various national cable networks from time to time have acquired programs that would have otherwise been offered to local television stations. Warner Media, LLC, Comcast Corporation, Viacom Inc., CBS Corporation, The News Corporation Limited and the Walt Disney Company each owns a television network and multiple cable networks and also owns or controls major production studios, which are the primary sources of programming for the networks. It is uncertain whether in the future such programming, which is generally subject to short-term agreements between the studios and the networks, will be moved from or to the networks. Television broadcasters also compete for non-network programming unique to the markets they serve. As such, stations strive to provide exclusive news stories and unique features such as investigative reporting and coverage of community events and to secure broadcast rights for regional and local sporting events. 
 Advertising. Our stations compete for advertising revenue with other television stations in their respective markets and other advertising media such as newspapers, radio stations, magazines, outdoor advertising, transit advertising, yellow page directories, direct mail, MVPDs, OVDs and online media (e.g. Google, Facebook, etc.). Competition for advertising dollars in the broadcasting industry occurs primarily within individual markets. Generally, a television broadcast station in a particular market does not compete with stations in other market areas. Our national newscast cable network also competes for advertising revenue with other advertising media and with other established national newscasts such as CNN, FOX News and MSNBC.

The broadcasting industry is continually faced with technological change and innovation which increase the popularity of competing entertainment and communications media. Further advances in technology may increase competition for household audiences and advertisers. An increase in the popularity of OVDs may result in popular product offerings that do not include television broadcast stations. The increased use of digital technology by MVPDs, along with video compression techniques, will reduce the bandwidth required for television signal transmission. These technological developments are applicable to all video delivery systems, including over-the-air broadcasting, and have the potential to provide vastly expanded programming to highly targeted audiences. Reductions in the cost of creating additional channel capacity could lower entry barriers for new channels and encourage the development of increasingly specialized “niche” programming. This ability to reach very narrowly defined audiences is expected to alter the competitive dynamics for advertising expenditures. We are unable to predict the effect that these or other technological changes will have on the broadcast television industry or on the future results of our operations or the operations of the stations to which we provide services. 
 Federal Regulation 
 Television broadcasting is subject to the jurisdiction of the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the “Communications Act”). The following is a brief discussion of certain (but not all) provisions of the Communications Act and the FCC’s regulations and policies that affect the business operations of television broadcast stations. Over the years, the U.S. Congress and the FCC have added, amended and deleted statutory and regulatory requirements to which station owners are subject. Some of these changes have a minimal business impact whereas others may significantly affect the business or operation of individual stations or the broadcast industry as a whole. For more information about the nature and extent of FCC regulation of television broadcast stations, refer to the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules, case precedent, public notices and policies. 
 License Grant and Renewal.  The Communications Act prohibits the operation of broadcast stations except under licenses issued by the FCC. Television broadcast licenses are granted for a maximum term of eight years and are subject to renewal upon application to the FCC. The FCC is required to grant an application for license renewal if during the preceding term the station served the public interest, the licensee did not commit any serious violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules, and the licensee committed no other violations of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules which, taken together, would constitute a pattern of abuse. A majority of renewal applications are routinely granted under this standard. If a licensee fails to meet this standard the FCC may still grant renewal on terms and conditions that it deems appropriate, including a monetary forfeiture or renewal for a term less than the normal eight-year period.
 After a renewal application is filed, interested parties, including members of the public, may file petitions to deny the application, to which the licensee/renewal applicant is entitled to respond. After reviewing the pleadings, if the FCC determines that there is a substantial and material question of fact whether grant of the renewal application would serve the public interest, the FCC is required to hold a hearing on the issues presented. If, after the hearing, the FCC determines that the renewal applicant has met the renewal standard, the FCC will grant the renewal application. If the licensee/renewal applicant fails to meet the renewal standard or show that there are mitigating factors entitling it to renewal subject to appropriate sanctions, the FCC can deny the renewal application. In the vast majority of cases where a petition to deny is filed against a renewal application, the FCC ultimately grants the renewal without a hearing. No competing application for authority to operate a station and replace the incumbent licensee may be filed against a renewal application. 
 In addition to considering rule violations in connection with a license renewal application, the FCC may sanction a station licensee for failing to observe FCC rules and policies during the license term, including the imposition of a monetary forfeiture. 
 Under the Communications Act, the term of a broadcast license is automatically extended during the pendency of the FCC’s processing of a timely renewal application. We initiated the license renewal process for our stations in June 2020 and will continue these filings through April 2023.
 Station Transfer. The Communications Act prohibits the assignment or the transfer of control of a broadcast license without prior FCC approval. 
 Ownership Restrictions. The Communications Act limits the extent of non-U.S. ownership of companies that own U.S. broadcast stations. Under this restriction, the holder of a U.S. broadcast license may have no more than 20% non-U.S. ownership (by vote and by equity). The Communications Act further prohibits more than 25% indirect foreign ownership or control of a licensee through a parent company if the FCC determines the public interest will be served by enforcement of such restriction. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before indirect foreign ownership of a broadcast licensee may exceed 25%. The FCC will entertain and authorize, on a case-by-case basis and upon a sufficient public interest showing and favorable executive branch review, proposals to exceed the 25% indirect foreign ownership limit in broadcast licensees. 

16

The FCC also has rules which establish limits on the ownership of broadcast stations. These ownership limits apply to attributable interests in a station licensee held by an individual, corporation, partnership or other entity. In the case of corporations, officers, directors and voting stock interests of 5% or more (20% or more in the case of certain passive investors, such as insurance companies and bank trust departments) are considered attributable interests. For partnerships, all general partners and non-insulated limited partners are attributable. Limited liability companies are treated the same as partnerships. The FCC also considers attributable the holder of more than 33% of a licensee’s total assets (defined as total debt plus total equity), if that person or entity also provides over 15% of the station’s total weekly broadcast programming or has an attributable interest in another media entity in the same market which is subject to the FCC’s ownership rules. If a shareholder of Nexstar holds a voting stock interest of 5% or more (20% or more in the case of certain passive investors, such as insurance companies and bank trust departments), we must report that shareholder, its parent entities, and attributable individuals and entities of both, as attributable interest holders in Nexstar. 
 The FCC is required to review its media ownership rules every four years to eliminate those rules it finds no longer serve the “public interest, convenience and necessity.” In August 2016, the FCC adopted a Second Report and Order (the “2016 Ownership Order”) concluding the agency’s 2010 and 2014 quadrennial reviews. The 2016 Ownership Order (1) retained the local television ownership rule and radio/television cross-ownership rule with minor technical modifications, (2) extended the ban on common ownership of two top-four television stations in a market to network affiliation swaps, (3) retained the ban on newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership in local markets while considering waivers and providing an exception for failed or failing entities, (4) retained the dual network rule, (5) made television JSA relationships attributable interests and (6) defined a category of sharing agreements designated as SSAs between commercial television stations and required public disclosure of those SSAs (while not considering them attributable). Nexstar and other parties filed petitions seeking reconsideration of various aspects of the 2016 Ownership Order. On November 16, 2017, the FCC adopted an order (the “Reconsideration Order”) addressing the petitions for reconsideration. The Reconsideration Order (1) eliminated the rules prohibiting newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership and limiting television/radio cross-ownership, (2) eliminated the requirement that eight or more independently-owned television stations remain in a market for common ownership of two television stations in the market to be permissible (the “eight voices test”), (3) retained the general prohibition on common ownership of two “top four” stations in a local market but provided for case-by-case review, (4) eliminated the television JSA attribution rule, and (5) retained the SSA definition and disclosure requirement for television stations. These rule modifications took effect on February 7, 2018, when the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (the “Third Circuit”) denied a mandamus petition which had sought to stay their effectiveness. On September 23, 2019, however, the Third Circuit issued an opinion vacating the Reconsideration Order on the ground that the FCC had failed to adequately analyze the effect of the Reconsideration Order’s deregulatory rule changes on minority and woman ownership of broadcast stations. The Third Circuit later denied petitions for en banc rehearing and its decision took effect on November 29, 2019. On December 20, 2019, the FCC issued an order reinstating the local television ownership rule, the radio/television cross-ownership rule, the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule and the television JSA attribution rule as they existed prior to the Reconsideration Order (including the eight voices test with respect to local television ownership). On April 17, 2020, the FCC and a group of media industry stakeholders (including Nexstar) filed separate petitions for certiorari requesting that the U.S. Supreme Court review the Third Circuit’s decision. The Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 2, 2020. It held oral argument in the case on January 19, 2021, and a decision is expected later in 2021.
 In December 2018, the FCC initiated its 2018 quadrennial review with the issuance of a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking. Among other things, the FCC seeks comment on all aspects of the local television ownership rule’s implementation and whether the current version of the rule remains necessary in the public interest. Comments and reply comments in the 2018 quadrennial review were filed in the second quarter of 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the proceeding remains open.
 Local Television Ownership (Duopoly Rule). Under the current local television ownership, or “duopoly,” rule, a single entity is allowed to own or have attributable interests in two television stations in a market if (1) the two stations do not have overlapping service areas, or (2) after the combination there are at least eight independently owned and operating full-power television stations in the DMA with overlapping service contours and one of the combining stations is not ranked among the top four stations in the DMA. The duopoly rule also allows the FCC to consider waivers to permit the ownership of a second station, where otherwise prohibited, where the second station has failed or is failing or unbuilt. In its November 2017 Reconsideration Order, the FCC modified the duopoly rule to eliminate the “eight voices” test and permit case-by-case review of proposed “top four” combinations. As a result of the Third Circuit’s September 2019 opinion vacating the Reconsideration Order, the duopoly rule has been reinstated to the form in which it existed prior to the Reconsideration Order, although the Third Circuit’s decision is under review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
 The FCC attributes toward the local television ownership limits another in-market station when one station owner programs that station pursuant to a TBA or LMA, if the programmer provides more than 15% of the second station’s weekly broadcast programming. However, LMAs entered into prior to November 5, 1996 are exempt attributable interests until the FCC determines otherwise. This “grandfathering,” when reviewed by the FCC, is subject to possible extension or termination. 
 In its 2016 Ownership Order, the FCC reinstated a rule that attributed another in-market station toward the local television ownership limits when one station owner sells more than 15% of the second station’s weekly advertising inventory under a JSA. Parties to JSAs entered into prior to March 31, 2014 were permitted to continue to operate under these JSAs until September 30, 2025. In the Reconsideration Order, the FCC eliminated the JSA attribution rule in its entirety. As a result of the Third Circuit’s September 2019 opinion vacating the Reconsideration Order, the rule has been reinstated, although the Third Circuit’s decision is under review by the U.S. Supreme Court. 
 17

In certain markets, the Company owns and operates both full-power and low-power television broadcast stations. The FCC’s duopoly rule and policies regarding ownership of television stations in the same market apply only to full-power television stations and not low-power television stations. 
 In a number of markets, the Company owns two stations in compliance with the duopoly rule. We also are permitted to own two or more stations in various other markets pursuant to waivers under the FCC’s rules permitting common ownership of a “satellite” television station in a market where a licensee also owns the “primary” station. Additionally, we are permitted to own two stations in the Quad Cities, Illinois/Iowa, Greenville-Spartanburg, South Carolina-Asheville, North Carolina and Hartford-New Haven, Connecticut markets pursuant to waivers allowing ownership of a second station where that station is “failing.”  We also own two “top four” stations in the Indianapolis, Indiana market pursuant to an FCC determination that prohibition of such ownership would not serve the public interest.
 In all of the markets where we have entered into local service agreements, except for six, we provide programming comprising less than 15% of the second station’s programming. In five of the markets where we provide more programming to the second station—WFXP in Erie, Pennsylvania, KHMT in Billings, Montana, KFQX in Grand Junction, Colorado, KNVA in Austin, Texas and WNAC-TV in Providence, Rhode Island—the TBAs or LMAs were entered into prior to November 5, 1996 and are considered grandfathered. Therefore, we may continue to program these stations under the terms of these agreements until the FCC determines otherwise. Our LMA with Mission for WPIX in New York is not attributable because we do not own a station in that market.
 With respect to our other local service agreements, a majority of our JSAs are once again attributable as a result of the JSA attribution rule’s reinstatement following the September 2019 Third Circuit decision, but we are allowed to maintain those agreements in effect through September 2025. Our SSAs with independently owned same-market stations are non-attributable. We may therefore retain our existing SSAs in effect indefinitely, but we must disclose them, and the FCC may in the future consider regulations with respect to such agreements. 
 National Television Ownership.  There is no limit on the number of television stations which a party may own nationally. However, the FCC’s rules limit the percentage of U.S. television households which a party may reach through its attributable interests in television stations to 39%. This rule originally provided that when calculating a party’s nationwide aggregate audience coverage, the ownership of a UHF station would be counted as 50% of a market’s percentage of total national audience. In August 2016, the FCC adopted an order eliminating this “UHF discount,” and that rule change became effective in October 2016. On April 20, 2017, the FCC adopted an order on reconsideration that reinstated the discount, which took effect once again in June 2017. A federal appeals court dismissed a petition for review of the discount’s reinstatement in July 2018. In December 2017, the FCC initiated a proceeding to broadly reexamine its national television ownership rule, including the percentage reach cap and the UHF discount. Comments and reply comments in this proceeding were filed in 2018, and the proceeding remains open. 
 
The stations that Nexstar owns and provides services to have a combined national audience reach of approximately 39% of all U.S. television households (applying the FCC’s UHF discount). 
 
Radio/Television Cross-Ownership Rule (One-to-a-Market Rule). In markets with at least 20 independently owned media “voices,” ownership of one television station and up to seven radio stations, or two television stations (if allowed under the television duopoly rule) and six radio stations is permitted. If the number of independently owned media “voices” is fewer than 20 but greater than or equal to 10, ownership of one television station (or two if allowed) and four radio stations is permitted. In markets with fewer than 10 independent media “voices,” ownership of one television station (or two if allowed) and one radio station is permitted. In calculating the number of independent media “voices” in a market, the FCC includes all independently owned radio and television stations, independently owned cable systems (counted as one voice), and independently owned daily newspapers which have circulation that exceeds 5% of the households in the market. In all cases, the television and radio components of the combination must also comply, respectively, with the local television ownership rule and the local radio ownership rule. The FCC eliminated the radio/television cross-ownership rule in its November 2017 Reconsideration Order but reinstated it following the Third Circuit’s September 2019 decision, although the Third Circuit’s decision is under review by the U.S. Supreme Court.
 
Local Newspaper/Broadcast Cross-Ownership Rule. Under this rule, a party is prohibited from having an attributable interest in a television (or radio) station and a daily newspaper in the same market. The FCC eliminated the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule in its November 2017 Reconsideration Order but reinstated it following the Third Circuit’s September 2019 decision, although the Third Circuit’s decision is under review by the U.S. Supreme Court. The FCC may consider waivers or grant exemptions from the rule in certain circumstances.
 
18

Local Television/Cable Cross-Ownership.  There is no FCC rule prohibiting common ownership of a cable television system and a television broadcast station in the same area. 
 
MVPD Carriage of Local Television Signals. Broadcasters may obtain carriage of their stations’ signals on cable, satellite and other MVPDs through either mandatory carriage or through “retransmission consent.” Every three years all stations must formally elect either mandatory carriage (“must-carry” for cable distributors and “carry one-carry all” for satellite television providers) or retransmission consent. The next election must be made by October 1, 2023 and will be effective January 1, 2024. Must-carry elections require that the MVPD carry one station programming stream and related data in the station’s local market. However, MVPDs may decline a must-carry election in certain circumstances. MVPDs do not pay a fee to stations that elect mandatory carriage.
 
A broadcaster that elects retransmission consent waives its mandatory carriage rights, and the broadcaster and the MVPD must negotiate in good faith for carriage of the station’s signal. Negotiated terms may include channel position, service tier carriage, carriage of multiple program streams, compensation and other consideration. If a broadcaster elects to negotiate retransmission terms, it is possible that the broadcaster and the MVPD will not reach agreement and that the MVPD will not carry the station’s signal.
 
MVPD operators have actively sought to change the regulations under which retransmission consent is negotiated before both the U.S. Congress and the FCC in order to increase their bargaining leverage with television stations. On March 3, 2011, the FCC initiated a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to reexamine its rules (i) governing the requirements for good faith negotiations between MVPDs and broadcasters, including implementing a prohibition on one station negotiating retransmission consent terms for another station under a local service agreement; (ii) for providing advance notice to consumers in the event of dispute; and (iii) to extend certain cable-only obligations to all MVPDs. The FCC also asked for comment on eliminating the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity protection rules, which may permit MVPDs to import out-of-market television stations in certain circumstances.
 
In March 2014, the FCC amended its rules governing “good faith” retransmission consent negotiations to provide that it is a per se violation of the statutory duty to negotiate in good faith for a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top-four stations in a market (as measured by audience share) to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another top-four station in the same market if the stations are not commonly owned. On December 5, 2014, the U.S. Congress extended the joint negotiation prohibition to all non-commonly owned television stations in a market. Under this rule and the subsequent legislation, stations may not (1) delegate authority to negotiate or approve a retransmission consent agreement to another non-commonly owned station located in the same DMA or to a third-party that negotiates on behalf of another non-commonly owned station in the same DMA; or (2) if located in the same DMA and not commonly owned, facilitate or agree to facilitate coordinated negotiation of retransmission consent terms between themselves, including through the sharing of information. Accordingly, the in-market VIEs with which we have sharing agreements must separately negotiate their respective retransmission consent agreements with MVPDs. Concurrently with its adoption of the prohibition on certain joint retransmission consent negotiations, the FCC adopted a further notice of proposed rulemaking which sought additional comment on the elimination or modification of the network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules. Comments and reply comments on the further notice were filed in 2014, and the proceeding remains open.
 
Congress’s December 5, 2014 legislation also directed the FCC to commence a rulemaking to “review its totality of the circumstances test for good faith [retransmission consent] negotiations.” The FCC commenced this proceeding in September 2015, and comments and reply comments were filed in 2015 and 2016. In July 2016, the then-Chairman of the FCC publicly announced that the agency would not adopt additional rules in this proceeding. However, the proceeding remains open.
 
The FCC’s rules also govern which local television signals a satellite subscriber may receive. The U.S. Congress and the FCC have also imposed certain requirements relating to satellite distribution of local television signals to “unserved” households that do not receive a useable signal from a local network-affiliated station and to cable and satellite carriage of out-of-market signals. 
 
Certain OVDs have begun streaming broadcast programming over the Internet. In June 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court held that an OVD’s retransmissions of broadcast television signals without the consent of the broadcast station violate copyright holders’ exclusive right to perform their works publicly as provided under the Copyright Act of 1976, as amended (the “Copyright Act”). In December 2014, the FCC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking proposing to interpret the term “MVPD” to encompass OVDs that make available for purchase multiple streams of video programming distributed at a prescheduled time and seeking comment on the effects of applying MVPD rules to such OVDs. Comments and reply comments were filed in 2015. Although the FCC has not classified OVDs as MVPDs to date, several OVDs have signed agreements for retransmission of local stations within their markets, and others are actively seeking to negotiate such agreements.
 
The Company has elected to exercise retransmission consent rights for all of its stations where it has legal rights to do so. The Company has negotiated retransmission consent agreements with the majority of MVPDs serving its markets to carry the stations’ signals and, where permitted by its network affiliation agreements, will negotiate agreements with OVDs.

Human Capital Management
 Values. Our key human capital management objectives are to attract, develop, and retain top industry talent that reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate and provide services. We encourage every individual’s contributions and personal growth and foster work environments that provide personal pride through job satisfaction and a balanced life. We embrace the communities in which we operate and promote open communications, innovation and creativity. 
 Engagement and Opportunities. With markets ranging from small to major, we offer a broad range of opportunities for every experience level, including for those who are just starting their broadcasting career or are ready to make the leap into a larger market. Our market diversity allows us to give our employees room to grow and progress in their careers. Our management team supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce, enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions. As of December 31, 2020, our voluntary retention rate for employees was approximately 71%. We offer our employees a broad range of company-paid benefits and we believe our compensation package and benefits are competitive with others in our industry. Our employee wages are competitive and consistent with employee positions, experience, knowledge and location. In addition, in 2019, the Company initiated a company-wide minimum wage above the federal requirement, which has been increased effective January 1, 2021. Annual wage increases and incentive payments are based on merit and are communicated to employees as a part of the annual review process. 
 Community Outreach. At Nexstar, we pride ourselves on the opportunities we provide for our employees to give back to their communities. On our 20th anniversary in June 2016, we organized our inaugural Founders Day of Caring, an employee driven effort focused on local non-profits and charities. Our employees fanned out across the country to contribute thousands of hours of community services. Founders Day has continued to be a success for our employees and their communities, with a pause in 2020. We anticipate resuming our Founders Day activities in 2021.
 Diversity and Inclusion. We strive to foster a culture of diversity and inclusion so all of our employees feel respected and none of them feels discriminated against.  In 2020, we launched our Diversity and Inclusion Council, a working committee dedicated to creating a path toward a more diverse and inclusive workplace, where diverse talent can flourish and build a career. The Council is comprised of ten members from throughout the Company, with membership changing periodically. In 2020, the Council, initiated our Employee Resource Groups and established a model mentorship program that rolled out Company-wide in 2020. We value diversity at all levels and continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce. We believe a diverse workforce fosters innovation and cultivates an environment of unique perspectives. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 41% and 32% of our employees and our management, respectively, were women. In the U.S., approximately 30% and 23% of our employees and our management, respectively, were racially/ethnically diverse. In order to ensure accountability in making progress in our diversity goals, a portion of our managers’ bonuses are tied to diversity metrics in their markets. In addition, we have implemented Employee Resource Groups in the categories of Latinx, Women, African American, Veterans and LGBTQ+. These groups are designed to bring together employees who share similar cultures, backgrounds, and/or interests, as well as those employees who wish to provide support to that group. 
 Training and Mentorship.  We are committed to developing the talents of our employees. We have partnered with Everfi, a leading provider of online workplace training, to deliver engaging and compelling content to all employees. Our catalog of courses includes harassment prevention, diversity/equity/inclusion, ethics, managing bias, supervisor/manager skills, and most recently, COVID-19 safety. In addition, during the fourth quarter of 2020, our Corporate Human Resources team conducted a successful pilot for a new mentorship program that will be launched company-wide in March 2021. The program matches mentors and mentees across the company and provides the pairs with a 12-topic curriculum covering skills such as communications, networking, work/life balance, and goal setting.
 In 2018, Nexstar settled a U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division investigation, as did a number of other television broadcasting companies. Nexstar did not admit any wrongdoing but, as a part of the settlement agreement, it agreed to take certain actions, including providing training programs to all officers and sales related employees to ensure they understand the antitrust laws, how those laws apply to Nexstar and our employees and to help them spot common patterns that may implicate antitrust laws. 
 Nexstar sales employees also participate in a media sales training program provided by The Center for Sales Strategy, a third party vendor.

Safety and COVID-19 Response. We value our employees and are committed to providing a safe and healthy workplace. All employees are required to comply with our safety rules and are expected to actively contribute to making our company a safer place to work. In response to COVID-19, we implemented remote working for many of our employees. Our work locations developed and implemented their own plans for staffing during the pandemic, with a focus on reducing headcounts within our facilities to reduce the risk for those employees whose job functions could not be performed remotely, and in compliance with applicable state and local safety requirements and protocols. Currently, a majority of our workforce have returned to working in a facility under strong safety protocols. In allowing additional employees to return to our facilities, we considered and continue to consider guidance from the Centers for Disease Control, other health organizations, federal, state and local governmental authorities, and our customers, among others. We have taken, and continue to take, robust actions to help protect the health, safety and well-being of our employees, to support our suppliers and local communities, and to continue to serve our customers.
 Employees. As of December 31, 2020, we had a total of 12,412 employees, comprised of 11,086 full-time and 1,326 part-time employees. As of December 31, 2020, 1,548 of our employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements. We believe that our employee relations are satisfactory, and we have not experienced any work stoppages at any of our facilities. However, we cannot assure you that our collective bargaining agreements will be renewed in the future, or that we will not experience a prolonged labor dispute, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. 
Legal Proceedings 
 From time to time, we are involved in litigation that arises from the ordinary operations of business, such as contractual or employment disputes or other general actions. In the event of an adverse outcome of these proceedings, we believe the resulting liabilities would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. See Note 17 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K is incorporated herein by reference.
