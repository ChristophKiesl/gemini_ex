Item 1. Business
General
 
Sugarmade, Inc. (hereinafter referred to as “we”, “us” or “the/our Company”) is a publicly-traded company incorporated in the state of Delaware. Our previous legal name was Diversified Opportunities, Inc. Our Company, Sugarmade, Inc. operates much of its business activities through our subsidiaries, SWC Group, Inc., a California corporation (“SWC’’), NUG Avenue, Inc., a California corporation (“NUG Avenue”), and Lemon Glow Company, Inc., a California corporation (“Lemon Glow”). Sugarmade, Inc. was founded in 2010. In 2014, CarryOutSupplies.com was acquired by Sugarmade, Inc., creating the Company as it is today.
 
Shares of our common stock are quoted on the OTC Markets, which is a quotation system for early-stage and developing companies. Our trading symbol is “SGMD”. Our corporate website is www.Sugarmade.com.
 
As of the date of this filing, we are involved in several business sectors and business ventures:
 
Paper and paper-based products: The supply of consumable products to the quick-service restaurant sub-sector of the restaurant industry, and as an importer and distributor of non-medical personal protection equipment to business and consumers, via our CarryOutSupplies.com subsidiary (“Carryout Supplies”). Carryout Supplies is a producer and wholesaler of custom printed and generic supplies, servicing more than 2,000 quick-service restaurants. The primary products are plastic cold cups, paper coffee cups, yogurt cups, ice cream cups, cup lids, cup sleeves, edible packaging, food containers, soup containers, plastic spoons, and similar products for this market sector. This subsidiary, which was formed in 2009, was recently expanded to also offer non-medical personal protective equipment.
 
NUG Avenue, Inc. investment into licensed cannabis delivery in Los Angeles area markets. During February 2021, we became a majority owner of NUG Avenue, Inc., a California corporation (“NUG Avenue”), which operates a licensed and regulated cannabis delivery service out of Lynwood, California, serving the greater Los Angeles Metropolitan area (the “Lynwood Operations”). The Company currently owns a majority stake of seventy percent (70%) of NUG Avenue’s Lynwood Operations and holds first rights of refusal on NUG Avenue’s business expansion relative to the cannabis marketplace. By way of our capital injection made into NUG Avenue and by via our 70% ownership position, we consolidate and recognize 100% of the revenues and 70% of profits or loss generated by NUG Ave for its Lynwood Operation.
 
We believe our investment into NUG Avenue will allow us to expand our presence into the licensed and regulated cannabis marketplace. The California cannabis market continues its rapid growth, with the Southern California sub-market representing the world’s largest single cannabis marketplace. According to the California Department of Tax and Fee Administration, the most recently reported quarterly period posted a significant increase in cannabis tax compared to the year-ago period. Much of this growth was driven by increased use of delivery services, as consumers are increasingly relying on home delivery for many goods, including cannabis.
 
Cannabis products delivery service and sales: As a joint owner in the Budcars licensed cannabis delivery service brand (“Budcars” or the “Budcars Brand”). Budcars operates a licensed cannabis delivery service in the Sacramento, California area. During early 2020, the Company entered into an agreement with Indigo Dye Group (“Indigo”) to acquire a 40% stake in the Budcars Brand and in the Sacramento delivery operations. Under the terms of the agreement with Indigo, Sugarmade acquired an option to purchase an additional 30% interest in Budcars. Upon exercise of this option, the Company would acquire a controlling interest in Indigo. As of June 30, 2021, the option has not yet been exercised and the Company’s stake in Budcars was at 40%. Starting on October 1, 2020, the Company plans to open new locations via purchasing equity in other Brand/Franchises to cover delivery for the entire California. Therefore, the Company is not likely at this time to exercise its option to acquire the additional 30% interest in Indigo. In addition, the Company is no longer involved in day-to-day operations of Indigo and going forward, the Company intends to pursue cannabis delivery independent of Indigo. As of October 1, 2020, the Company ceased to have control over the day-to-day business of Indigo and it was deconsolidated and recorded as an investment in nonconsolidated affiliate at its $505,449 estimated fair value and changed to equity method of accounting. Pursuant to the terms of the Indigo agreement, if the Company determines, in its discretion not to continue to make monthly payments, its 40% ownership interest in Indigo will be decreased according to the payment then made. As of December 31, 2020, the Company made $59,370 additional payments, and hold approximately 32% of the ownership of Indigo. As of June 30, 2021, the Company recorded equity method investment in affiliates at $441,407, net with $123,412 loss from equity method investment.
 
Selected cannabis and hemp projects: On May 12, 2021, SugarMade, Inc. entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, as amended (the “Merger Agreement”) by and between Lemon Glow Corporation, a California corporation (“Lemon Glow”), Carnaby Spot Bay Corp, a California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), and Ryan Santiago (the “Shareholder Representative”), pursuant to which, on May 25, 2021 and upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, Merger Sub merged with and into Lemon Glow, with Lemon Glow being the surviving corporation (the “Merger”). As a result of the Merger, Lemon Glow became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company.

Government Regulations
 
There can be no assurance of continued inaction by U.S. federal authorities relative to our operations. Our business is at least partially focused on cannabis, hemp, and associated products and the legal sales of cannabis permitted under California law. Cannabis is a Schedule 1 illegal drug under the Controlled Substances Act, 21 U.S.C. § 811 (hereafter referred to as the “CSA”). As is discussed below, Hemp containing less than 0.3 percent THC is not a Schedule 1 drug under the CSA. Any actions by U.S. federal agencies could have a significant negative impact on our abilities to generate revenue and/or profits.
 
As of the date of this filing, thirty-five states, the District of Columbia, and four U.S. Territories currently have laws broadly legalizing cannabis in some form for either medicinal or recreational use governed by state-specific laws and regulations. Although legalized in some states, cannabis, and hemp containing more than 0.3 percent THC are “Schedule 1” drugs under the CSA and are illegal under federal law. Active enforcement of the current CSA regarding cannabis and hemp containing more than 0.3 percent THC may directly and adversely affect our revenues and profits. The risk of strict enforcement of the CSA in light of Congressional activity, judicial holdings, and stated federal policy remain uncertain.
 
On August 29, 2013, The Department of Justice set out its prosecutorial priorities in light of various states legalizing cannabis for medicinal and/or recreational use. The “Cole Memorandum” provided that when states have implemented strong and effective regulatory and enforcement systems to control the cultivation, distribution, sale, and possession of cannabis, conduct in compliance with those laws and regulations is less likely to threaten the federal priorities. Indeed, a robust system may affirmatively address those priorities by, for example, implementing effective measures to prevent diversion of cannabis outside of the regulated system and to other states, prohibiting access to cannabis by minors, and replacing an illicit cannabis trade that funds criminal enterprises with a tightly regulated market in which revenues are tracked and accounted for. In those circumstances, consistent with the traditional allocation of federal-state efforts in this area, the Cole Memorandum provided that enforcement of state law by state and local law enforcement and regulatory bodies should remain the primary means of addressing cannabis-related activity. If state enforcement efforts are not sufficiently robust to protect against the harms set forth above, the federal government may seek to challenge the regulatory structure itself in addition to continuing to bring individual enforcement actions, including criminal prosecutions, focused on those harms.
 
On January 4, 2018, Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued a memorandum for all United States Attorneys concerning cannabis enforcement under the CSA. Mr. Sessions rescinded all previous prosecutorial guidance issued by the Department of Justice regarding cannabis, including the August 29, 2013 “Cole Memorandum”.
 
In rescinding the Cole Memorandum, Mr. Sessions stated that U.S. Attorneys must decide whether or not to pursue prosecution of cannabis activity based upon factors including the seriousness of the crime, the deterrent effect of criminal prosecution, and the cumulative impact of particular crimes on the community. Mr. Sessions reiterated that the cultivation, distribution, and possession of marijuana continues to be a crime under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act.
 
On March 23, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law a $1.3 trillion-dollar spending bill that included an amendment known as “Rohrabacher-Blumenauer,” which prohibits the Justice Department from using federal funds to prevent certain states “from implementing their own State laws that authorize the use, distribution, possession or cultivation of medical cannabis.”
 
On December 20, 2018, President Donald J. Trump signed into law the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, otherwise known as the “Farm Bill”. Prior to its passage, hemp, a member of the cannabis family, was classified as a Schedule 1 controlled substance, and so illegal under the federal CSA.
 
With the passage of the Farm Bill, hemp cultivation containing less than 0.3 percent THC is now broadly permitted. The Farm Bill explicitly allows the transfer of hemp-derived products across state lines for commercial or other purposes. It also puts no restrictions on the sale, transport, or possession of hemp-derived products, so long as those items are produced in a manner consistent with the law.
 
Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, hemp cannot contain more than 0.3 percent THC. THC refers to the chemical compound found in cannabis that produces the psychoactive “high” associated with cannabis. Any cannabis plant that contains more than 0.3 percent THC would be considered non-hemp cannabis—or marijuana—under the CSA and would not be legally protected under this new legislation and would be treated as an illegal Schedule 1 drug.

Additionally, there will be significant, shared state-federal regulatory power over hemp cultivation and production. Under Section 10113 of the Farm Bill, state departments of agriculture must consult with the state’s governor and chief law enforcement officer to devise a plan that must be submitted to the Secretary of the United States Department of Agriculture (hereafter referred to as the “USDA”). A state’s plan to license and regulate hemp can only commence once the Secretary of USDA approves that state’s plan. In states opting not to devise a hemp regulatory program, USDA will construct a regulatory program under which hemp cultivators in those states must apply for licenses and comply with a federally run program. This system of shared regulatory programming is similar to options states had in other policy areas such as health insurance marketplaces under Affordable Care Act, or workplace safety plans under Occupational Health and Safety Act—both of which had federally-run systems for states opting not to set up their own systems.
 
The Farm Bill outlines actions that are considered violations of federal hemp law (including such activities as cultivating without a license or producing cannabis with more than 0.3 percent THC). The Farm Bill details possible punishments for such violations, pathways for violators to become compliant, and even which activities qualify as felonies under the law, such as repeated offenses.
 
One of the goals of the previous 2014 Farm Bill was to generate and protect research into hemp. The 2018 Farm Bill continues this effort. Section 7605 re-extends the protections for hemp research and the conditions under which such research can and should be conducted. Further, section 7501 of the Farm Bill extends hemp research by including hemp under the Critical Agricultural Materials Act. This provision recognizes the importance, diversity, and opportunity of the plant and the products that can be derived from it, but also recognizes that there is still a lot to learn about hemp and its products from commercial and market perspectives.
 
In late January 2021, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said lawmakers are in the process of merging various cannabis bills, including his own legalization legislation. He is working to enact reform in this Congressional session. This would include the Marijuana Freedom and Opportunity Act, which would federally de-schedule cannabis, reinvest tax revenue into communities most affected by the drug war, and fund efforts to expunge prior cannabis records. It is likely that the Marijuana Opportunity, Reinvestment, and Expungement (MORE) Act would be incorporated.
 
Other federal legislation under review for possible submission includes the SAFE Banking Act (or Secure and Fair Enforcement Act), a bill that would allow cannabis companies to access the federally insured banking system and capital markets without the risk of federal enforcement action, and the Strengthening the Tenth Amendment Through Entrusting States Act (or STATES Act), a bill that seeks protection for businesses and individuals in states that have legalized and comply with state laws).
 
Our operations may also be affected by regulations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Enforced by FinCEN, the act requires us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000, including identification of the customer by name and social security number, to the IRS. This regulation also requires us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000 that we know, suspect, or have reason to believe involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements and to verify sources of funds. Substantial penalties can be imposed against us if we fail to comply with this regulation. If we fail to comply with these laws and regulations, the imposition of a substantial penalty could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Active enforcement of the current CSA on cannabis and hemp containing more than 0.3 percent THC may directly and adversely affect our revenues and profits. The risk of strict enforcement of the CSA considering Congressional activity, judicial holdings, and stated federal policy remains uncertain.
 
As a result of the conflicting state and federal laws regarding cannabis, our investments and operations of cannabis businesses in the U.S. are subject to inconsistent laws and regulations. Laws and regulations affecting the cannabis industry are constantly changing, which could detrimentally affect our operations. Local, state, and federal cannabis laws and regulations are broad in scope and subject to evolving interpretations, which could require us to incur substantial costs associated with compliance or alter our business plan. In addition, violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our operations. It is also possible that regulations may be enacted in the future that will be directly applicable to our business. These ever-changing regulations could even affect federal tax policies that may make it difficult to claim tax deductions on our returns. We cannot predict the nature of any future laws, regulations, interpretations, or applications, nor can we determine what effect additional governmental regulations or administrative policies and procedures, when and if promulgated, could have on our business.
 
Any changes relative to the above areas, could significantly negatively impact our abilities to generate both revenue and profits.

Environmental - Climate Change, Wild Fires, and Drought Conditions
 
Hemp and cannabis cultivation can be impacted by weather patterns and these unpredictable weather patterns may affect our operations in that our supplier might not be able to fully our operations on a consistent basis. Severe weather, including drought, hail and excessive heat, can destroy a cannabis crop, which could result in us having no cannabis to sell to our customers. These situations could substantially affect our ability to generate revenue and profits.
 
In the future, our operations could also be affected by global climate change. Earth’s climate has changed over the past century. The atmosphere and oceans have warmed, sea levels have risen, and glaciers and ice sheets have decreased in size. The best available evidence indicates that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities are the leading cause. Continuing increases in greenhouse gases will produce further warming and other changes in Earth’s physical environment and ecosystems. While our business operations have seen no adverse effects from climate change, such issues could affect our operations in the future. Over the coming years, we plan to closely monitor weather conditions to determine how changes could affect our future operations and plans for corporate growth.
 
We are also subject to various federal, state, local and non-U.S. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. We continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. Investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. These costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the U.S. government. It is reasonably possible that continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.
 
The 2021 wildfire season in California experienced an unusually early start amid an ongoing drought and historically low rainfall and reservoir levels. According the State of California Division of Forestry, the long-term trend is that wildfires in the state are increasing due to climate change in California. In terms of the amount of fires burned, the 2021 season has been outpacing the 2020 season, which itself was the most significant season in the state’s recorded history. According to the State, as of July 11, 2021 more than three times as many acres have burned compared to the previous year through that date, with drought, extreme heat, and reduced snowpack contributing to the severity of the fires.[ The state also faces an increased risk of post-wildfire landslides. While we have seen no negative effects from such wildfires, our business operations could be affected by such conditions in the future.
 
Our future operations could also be affected by State of California and/or local governmental restrictions on water usage. Droughts are a recurring feature of California’s climate and are becoming increasingly severe due to climate change. According to the State of California. In the last century, the most significant statewide droughts occurred during the six-year period from 1929 to 1934, the two-year period from 1976 to 1977, the six-year period from 1987 to 1992, and the five-year period from 2012 to 2016. The 2012-2016 drought was one of extreme proportions, with record-high temperatures and record-low levels of snowpack and precipitation. In 2021, California finds itself yet again in a drought, with water conditions at the end of the wet season far below normal for the second year in a row. Continued drought in the California could affect our future business in that our suppliers may not be able to provide products for us to sell to our customers, which would affect our ability to generate revenues and produce profits. Drought conditions could also impact our abilities to cultivate cannabis in the future in that we may be unable to obtain adequate water rights or access to suitable water to cultivate future cannabis crops, if we decided in the future to attempt cannabis cultivation, although the Company currently has not such plans.
 
There can be no assurance that global climate changes and ongoing, or worsening, drought conditions and/or issue relative to wildfires within the state of California will not negatively impact our operations during future periods.
 
As a result, such issues could severely impact our ability to generate revenues and profits.
