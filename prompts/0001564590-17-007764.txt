 Overview
 Established in 2002, Vince is a global luxury brand best known for utilizing luxe fabrications and innovative techniques to create a product assortment that combines urban utility and modern effortless style. From its edited core collection of ultra-soft cashmere knits and cotton tees, Vince has evolved into a global lifestyle brand and destination for both women’s and men’s apparel and accessories. Vince products are sold in prestige distribution worldwide, including approximately 2,300 distribution locations across more than 40 countries. We have a small number of wholesale partners who account for a significant portion of our net sales. Net sales to the full-price, off-price and e-commerce operations of our three largest wholesale partners were 45%, 43% and 49% of our total revenue for fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. These partners include Nordstrom, Inc., Hudson’s Bay Company and Neiman Marcus Group LTD, each accounting for more than 10% of our total revenue for fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. We design our products in the U.S. and source the vast majority of our products from contract manufacturers outside the U.S., primarily in Asia.
 We serve our customers through a variety of channels that reinforce the Vince brand image. Our diversified channel strategy allows us to introduce our products to customers through multiple distribution points that are reported in two segments: wholesale and direct-to-consumer. Our wholesale segment is comprised of sales to major department stores and specialty stores in the U.S. and in select international markets, with U.S. wholesale representing 51%, 56% and 67% of our fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 net sales, respectively, and the total wholesale segment representing 63%, 67% and 76% of our sales in for the same periods. International wholesale represented 10%, 10% and 9% of net sales for fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014, respectively. Our wholesale segment also includes our licensing business related to our licensing arrangement for our women’s and men’s footwear.
 Our direct-to-consumer segment includes our company-operated retail and outlet stores and our e-commerce business. During fiscal 2016, we opened six new full-price retail stores. As of January 28, 2017, we operated 54 stores, consisting of 40 company-operated full-price retail stores and 14 company-operated outlet locations. The direct-to-consumer segment also includes our e-commerce website, www.vince.com. The direct-to-consumer segment accounted for 37%, 33% and 24% of fiscal 2016, fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014 net sales, respectively. 
 Vince operates on a fiscal calendar widely used by the retail industry that results in a given fiscal year consisting of a 52 or 53-week period ending on the Saturday closest to January 31.

 Vince Holding Corp., previously named Apparel Holding Corp., was incorporated in Delaware in February 2008 in connection with the acquisition of Kellwood Company by affiliates of Sun Capital Partners, Inc. (“Sun Capital”). In September 2012, Kellwood Company formed Vince, LLC and all assets constituting the Vince business were contributed to Vince, LLC at such time (the “Vince Transfer”). On November 27, 2013, Apparel Holding Corp. was renamed Vince Holding Corp. in connection with the consummation of an IPO. Certain restructuring transactions were completed in connection with the consummation of the IPO. These transactions, among other things, included Kellwood Holding, LLC acquiring the non-Vince businesses, which include Kellwood Company, LLC, from the Company. The Company has since owned and operated the Vince business, which includes Vince, LLC. The restructuring transactions separated the Vince and non-Vince businesses on November 27, 2013. Our principal executive office is located at 500 5th Avenue, 20th Floor, New York, New York 10110 and our telephone number is (212) 515-2600. Our corporate website address is www.vince.com.
 Brand and Products
 Established in 2002, Vince is a global luxury brand best known for utilizing luxe fabrications and innovative techniques to create a product assortment that combines urban utility and modern effortless style. From its edited core collection of ultra-soft cashmere knits and cotton tees, Vince has evolved into a global lifestyle brand and destination for both women’s and men’s apparel

and accessories. We believe that our differentiated design aesthetic and strong attention to detail and fit allow us to maintain premium pricing, and that the combination of quality and value positions Vince as an everyday luxury brand that encourages repeat purchases among our customers. We also believe that we can expand our product assortment and distribute this expanded product assortment through our premier wholesale partners in the U.S. and select international markets, as well as through our branded retail locations and on our e-commerce platform.
 Our women’s collection includes seasonal collections of luxurious cashmere sweaters and silk blouses, leather and suede leggings and jackets, dresses, denim, pants, tanks and t-shirts, footwear and outerwear. Our men’s collection includes t-shirts, knit and woven tops, sweaters, denim, pants, blazers, footwear, outerwear and stylish leather jackets. 
 We continue to evaluate other brand extension opportunities through both in-house development activities as well as through potential partnerships or licensing arrangements with third parties.
 Design and Merchandising
 We are focused on developing an elevated collection of Vince apparel and accessories that builds upon the brand’s product heritage of modern, effortless style and everyday luxury essentials. The current design vision is to create a cohesive and compelling product assortment with sophisticated head-to-toe looks for multiple wear occasions. During fiscal 2016, our product, merchandising and creative efforts were overseen by our co-founders as consultants, whose consultancy subsequently ended in February 2017. Our design efforts are supported by well-established product development and production teams and processes that enable us to bring new products to market quickly. We believe continued collaboration between design and merchandising will ensure we respond to consumer preferences and market trends with new innovative product offerings while maintaining our core fashion foundation.

This includes shop-in-shops, which are operated by our domestic and international wholesale partners, where we sell the merchandise to the partners on a wholesale basis and recognize revenue when goods are shipped in accordance with customer orders. The shop-in-shops are dedicated spaces within the selling floors of select domestic and international wholesale partners where Vince product is prominently displayed and sold. Vince generally provides the shop-in-shop fixtures needed to build out the spaces within the department stores operated by our wholesale partners. As of January 28, 2017, there were 55 shop-in-shops consisting of 36 shop-in-shops with our U.S. wholesale partners and 19 shop-in-shops with our international wholesale partners. We also have four international free-standing stores which are owned and operated by local license and distribution partners whereby Vince provides the merchandise to the distribution partner for sale in the free-standing store which solely sells Vince product. Our wholesale segment also includes our licensing business related to our licensing arrangement for our women’s and men’s footwear line.

Marketing, Advertising and Public Relations
 We use marketing, advertising and public relations as critical tools to deliver a consistent and compelling brand message to consumers. Our brand message and marketing strategies are cultivated by dedicated creative, design, marketing, visual merchandising and public relations teams. These teams work closely together to develop and execute campaigns that appeal to both our core and aspirational customers.
 To execute our marketing strategies, we engage in a wide range of campaign tactics that include traditional media (such as direct mail, print advertising, cooperative advertising with wholesale partners and outdoor advertising), digital media (such as email, search and social display) and experiential campaigns (such as events and collection previews) to drive traffic, brand awareness, conversion and ultimately sales across all channels. In addition, we use social platforms such as Instagram, Facebook, Twitter and Pinterest to engage customers and create excitement about our brand. The visits to www.vince.com, which totaled approximately 5.4 million in fiscal 2016, also provide an opportunity to grow our customer base and communicate directly with our customers.
 Our public relations team conducts a wide variety of press activities to reinforce the Vince brand image and create excitement around the brand. Vince apparel and footwear have appeared in the pages of major fashion magazines such as Vogue, Harper’s Bazaar, Elle, W, GQ, Esquire and WSJ. Well-known trend setters in entertainment and fashion are also regularly seen wearing the Vince brand.
 Sourcing and Manufacturing
 Vince does not own or operate any manufacturing facilities. We contract for the purchase of finished goods with manufacturers who are responsible for the entire manufacturing process, including the purchase of piece goods and trim. Although we do not have long-term written contracts with manufacturers, we have long-standing relationships with a diverse base of vendors which we believe to be mutually satisfactory. We work with 40 manufacturers across five countries, with 92% of our products produced in China in fiscal 2016. For cost and control purposes, we contract with select third-party vendors in the U.S. to produce a small portion of our merchandise that includes woven pants and products manufactured with man-made fibers.
 All of our garments are produced according to our specifications, and we require that all of our manufacturers adhere to strict regulatory compliance and standards of conduct. Our vendors’ factories are monitored by our production team to ensure quality control, and they are monitored by independent third-party inspectors we employ for compliance with local manufacturing standards and regulations on an annual basis. We also monitor our vendors’ manufacturing facilities regularly, providing technical assistance and performing in-line and final audits to ensure the highest possible quality.
 Shared Services Agreement
 In connection with the consummation of the IPO, Vince, LLC entered into a Shared Services Agreement with Kellwood Company, LLC on November 27, 2013 (the “Shared Services Agreement”) pursuant to which Kellwood would provide support services in various areas including, among other things, certain accounting functions, tax, e-commerce operations, distribution, logistics, information technology, accounts payable, credit and collections and payroll and benefits administration. Since the IPO, we had been in the process of transitioning certain functions performed by Kellwood under the Shared Services Agreement and as of the end of fiscal 2016, we have completed the transition of all such functions and systems from Kellwood to our own systems or processes as well as to third-party service providers. Refer to the discussion under “Information Systems” below for further information on our transition of information technology systems and infrastructure in-house from Kellwood. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors—We have completed the transition of certain services, which had been provided to us by Kellwood since our initial public offering, to our own systems or processes as well as external resources. If the newly implemented systems, processes and functions do not operate successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially harmed.” In addition, see “Shared Services Agreement” under Note 12 “Related Party Transactions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.
 In connection with the Kellwood Sale, the Shared Services Agreement was contributed to St. Louis, LLC. St. Louis, LLC continues to provide minor transitional services relating to historical records and legacy functions, which we are in the process of 
 6

winding down. The Shared Services Agreement will terminate automatically upon the termination of all services provided thereunder. After termination of the agreement, St. Louis, LLC will have no obligation to provide any services to us.
 Distribution Facilities
 As of January 28, 2017, we operated out of two distribution centers, one located in the U.S. and one in Belgium. In the U.S., we historically relied on a distribution facility operated by Kellwood in City of Industry, California as part of the Shared Services Agreement. In November 2015, we entered into a service agreement with a new third-party distribution provider in California and we completed the migration of the distribution facility from Kellwood in 2016. This primary warehouse, operated by the third-party distribution provider is located in City of Industry, California, and includes approximately 115,000 square feet dedicated to fulfilling orders for our wholesale partners, retail locations and e-commerce business and utilizes warehouse management systems that are fully customer and vendor compliant. 
 The warehouse in Belgium is operated by a third-party logistics provider and supports our wholesale orders for customers located primarily in Europe. 
 We believe we have sufficient capacity in our domestic and international distribution facilities to support our current and projected business.
 Information Systems
 Our enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system is Microsoft Dynamics AX and is cloud based and integrates with our point-of-sale (“POS”) system, e-commerce platform and other supporting systems. 
 Collectively, these systems replaced all systems used under the Shared Services Agreement. Since the IPO, we relied on certain systems and information technology services of Kellwood pursuant to the terms of the Shared Services Agreement. These services historically included information technology planning and administration, desktop support and help desk, our ERP system, financial applications, warehouse systems, reporting and analysis applications and our retail and e-commerce interfaces. 
 Since the IPO, we had been working on transitioning these systems and information technology services from Kellwood and as of the end of fiscal 2016, we have completed the transition of all such systems from Kellwood to our own systems. This included the implementation of our own ERP and supporting systems, POS system, third-party e-commerce platform, distribution applications, network infrastructure and related IT support services, and human resource payroll and recruitment systems. We no longer rely on Kellwood’s information technology services except for certain minor transitional services relating to historical records and legacy functions.
 See “Shared Services Agreement,” above, Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors—We have completed the transition of certain services, which had been provided to us by Kellwood since our initial public offering, to our own systems or processes as well as external resources. If the newly implemented systems, processes and functions do not operate successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially harmed.” and Part II, Item 9A. “Controls and Procedures.” In addition, see “Shared Services Agreement” under Note 12 “Related Party Transactions” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on form 10-K for further information.
 Seasonality
 The apparel and fashion industry in which we operate is cyclical and, consequently, our revenues are affected by general economic conditions and the seasonal trends characteristic to the apparel and fashion industry. Purchases of apparel are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the level of consumer spending, including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income, consumer debt, interest rates, consumer confidence as well as the impact from adverse weather conditions. In addition, fluctuations in sales in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and events affecting direct-to-consumer sales; as such, the financial results for any particular quarter may not be indicative of results for the fiscal year.
Competition
 We face strong competition in each of the product categories and markets in which we compete on the basis of style, quality, price and brand recognition. Some of our competitors have achieved significant recognition for their brand names or have substantially greater financial, marketing, distribution and other resources compared to us. However, we believe that we have established a sustainable and distinct position in the current marketplace, driven by a product assortment that combines classic and fashion-forward styling, and a pricing strategy that offers customers accessible luxury. Our competitors are varied, but include Theory, Helmut Lang, Rag & Bone, Joie, and J Brand, among others.

Employees
 As of January 28, 2017, we had 597 employees, of which 355 were employed in our company-operated retail stores. Except for six employees in France, who are covered by collective bargaining agreements pursuant to French law, none of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we believe our employee relations are good.

 We own the Vince trademark for the production, marketing and distribution of our products in the U.S. and internationally. We have registered the trademark domestically and have registrations on file or pending in a number of foreign jurisdictions. We intend to continue to strategically register, both domestically and internationally, trademarks that we use today and those we develop in the future.
