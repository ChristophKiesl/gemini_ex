Item 1.          BUSINESS
General
USA Truck is one of North America’s top 25 truckload carriers when measured by operating revenue, and one of North America’s top 60 freight brokerage firms when measured by gross revenue, as determined by Transport Topics’ most recent annual rankings. In 2021, the Company generated $710.4 million in consolidated operating revenue. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s fleet consisted of 2,157 tractors, which included 641 independent contractor tractors, and 6,548 trailers.

​



The Company has two reportable segments: (i) Trucking, consisting of the Company’s truckload and dedicated freight service offerings, and (ii) USAT Logistics, consisting of the Company’s freight brokerage, logistics, and rail intermodal service offerings. Our truckload service offering provides motor carrier services as a medium-haul common and contract carrier, utilizing equipment owned or leased by the Company or independent contractors. Our dedicated freight service offering provides truckload motor carrier services to specific customers for movement of freight over particular routes at specified times. USAT Logistics provides freight brokerage, logistics, and intermodal rail service to its customers by utilizing third party capacity. Each of these service offerings match customer shipments with available equipment of authorized third-party motor carriers and other service providers. 
As of December 31, 2021, our corporate structure included USA Truck Inc., and its wholly owned subsidiaries: International Freight Services, Inc. (“IFS”), a Delaware corporation; USA Truck, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company; USA Truck Fleetco, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company; USA Truck Logistics, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company; Skyraider Risk Retention Group Inc. (“SRRG”), a South Carolina corporation; Davis Transfer Company Inc. (“DTC”), a Georgia corporation; Davis Transfer Logistics Inc. (“DTL”), a Georgia corporation; and B & G Leasing, L.L.C. (“B & G”), a Georgia limited liability company. 
Operations
USA Truck is headquartered in Van Buren, Arkansas. The Company transports freight throughout the contiguous United States, into and out of portions of Canada, and into and out of Mexico by offering through-trailer service from our terminal in Laredo, Texas. During 2021 and 2020, the Company generated approximately 5% and 6%, respectively, of the Company’s operating revenues in Mexico and Canada. All Company-owned tractors are domiciled in the United States. The Company does not separately track domestic and foreign long-lived assets, as substantially all of the Company’s long-lived assets are located within the United States.
The Company’s Trucking segment operations are supported primarily by driver managers, load planners and customer service representatives. Driver managers lead teams of professional drivers and are the primary Company contact for each of our driver team members. Load planners assign loads to available tractors in a manner intended to maximize profit and minimize costs. Customer service representatives work to fulfill shippers’ needs, solicit freight, and ensure on-time delivery by monitoring load movement. The Company strives to operate a safe and productive fleet while providing superior customer service.
The USAT Logistics segment has a network of regional sales offices located throughout the continental United States. We believe that regionalization allows greater market insight and strengthens relationships with customers and carriers alike while capitalizing on the skills and local market insight of the leaders managing these centers. The specific locations of branch offices are selected for the availability of talent and freight in those markets.
The Company has a diversified freight and customer base, and focuses marketing efforts on customers who have consistent shipping needs within the eastern half of the United States, which is the predominant operating area for our Trucking operations. USAT Logistics offers services nationwide, and the cross-marketing of service offerings permits us to strategically position available equipment while providing a full array of supply chain transportation solutions to our customers. USA Truck team members have cultivated a thorough understanding of the needs of shippers in key industries, which the Company believes helps with the development of long-term, service-oriented relationships with its customers. 
While the Company prefers direct relationships with customers, some high volume shippers require their carriers to conduct business with designated third party logistics providers. Obtaining shipments through these providers is a significant opportunity that allows the Company to provide services for high-volume shippers to which it might not otherwise have access. During 2021, one customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company’s consolidated operating revenues. The Company’s largest 10 customers together comprised approximately 47% of the Company’s consolidated operating revenue. Overall in 2021, the Company provided services to more than 600 customers.

The average age of the Company’s in-service tractor fleet was 2.9 years at December 31, 2021 compared to 2.4 years at December 31, 2020. The increased age of the Company-owned fleet was due to delays in receiving new tractors in 2021 which led to longer than anticipated utilization in the Company-owned fleet. 
The Company’s equipment purchase and replacement decisions are based on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, new equipment prices and availability, the used equipment market, trade-in values, demand for freight services, prevailing interest rates, the attractiveness of lease terms, technological improvements, regulatory changes, fuel efficiency, equipment durability, equipment specifications and driver comfort. Therefore, depending on the circumstances, the Company may accelerate or delay the acquisition and disposition of its tractors or trailers from time to time.
To simplify driver and mechanic training, control the cost of spare parts and tire inventory, and provide for a more efficient vehicle maintenance program, the Company purchases tractors and trailers manufactured to its specifications, and has a preventive maintenance program which aims to minimize equipment downtime and maintenance costs.
We equip our tractors with satellite-based tracking devices and communications technology that permits direct communication between drivers and fleet managers. We believe that this system enhances our operating efficiency and improves customer service and fleet management. We also use the system to monitor engine idling time, speed, performance, and other factors that affect operating efficiency. At December 31, 2021, all of our tractors were equipped with electronic logging devices (“ELDs”), which electronically monitor tractor miles and facilitate enforcement of hours-of-service regulations, both forward - and inward facing event recorders, and forward collision mitigation.

The Company finances the purchase of revenue equipment through its cash flows from operations, our revolving credit agreement, finance and operating lease arrangements and proceeds from sales of used equipment. Substantially all of the Company’s tractors and trailers are pledged to secure its obligations under financing arrangements.

Human Capital Resources
As of December 31, 2021, the Company had approximately 2,100 team members, of which approximately 66% were Company drivers. The Company believes team member relations to be good, and no team members are subject to union contracts or are part of a collective bargaining unit. 
Recruitment, training, and retention of a professional driver workforce are essential to the Company’s continued growth and fulfillment of customer needs. The Company hires qualified professional drivers who hold a valid commercial driver’s license, satisfy applicable federal and state safety performance and measurement requirements, and meet our hiring criteria. These guidelines relate primarily to safety history, road test evaluations, and various other evaluations, which include physical examinations and mandatory drug and alcohol testing. In order to attract and retain safe drivers who are committed to safety and customer service, the Company provides late model equipment, encourages direct communication with senior management, pays competitive wages and benefits, and provides other incentives intended to encourage driver safety, retention, and long-term employment. The majority of our professional drivers are compensated on a per mile basis. Drivers are also compensated for accessorial services provided to customers. Drivers and other employees are encouraged to participate in the Company’s 401(k) plan, Company-sponsored health, life, and dental plans, and the Company’s employee stock purchase plan. The Company believes these factors aid in attracting, recruiting, and retaining professional drivers in a competitive driver market.
The Company is committed to hiring, developing and supporting a diverse and inclusive workplace. Our management team and all of our employees are expected to exhibit and promote honest, ethical and respectful conduct in the workplace. All of our non-driver employees are required to complete annual trainings on our Code of Conduct, harassment, bullying and sexual harassment, unconscious bias and emotional intelligence. Additionally, the Company sponsors diversity and inclusion programs periodically throughout the year to promote awareness of different cultures and backgrounds. In 2021, the Company released its first Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) report, which presented the Company’s approach to sustainability, environmental stewardship, corporate governance, and its social impact. 
Beginning in 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols and new procedures to protect our employees. These protocols include compliance with social distancing and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies, taking into consideration guidelines of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other public health authorities. In addition, we modified the way we conduct many aspects of our business to reduce the number of in-person interactions. For example, we significantly expanded the use of virtual interactions in all aspects of our business, including customer facing activities. Many of our administrative and operational functions during this time have required modification as well, including a large portion of our workforce working remotely. For a detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.
Independent Contractors
In addition to Company drivers, we enter into contracts with independent contractors, who provide a tractor and a driver and assume responsibility for all operating expenses in exchange for an agreed upon fee structure. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had 641 independent contractor operated tractors, which comprised approximately 30% of the professional driving fleet during both 2021 and 2020.
Competition
Overall, the U.S. trucking industry is large, fragmented, and highly competitive, including both private fleets and for-hire carriers. Private fleets consist of trucks owned and operated by shippers that move their own goods. For-hire carriers include both truckload and less-than-truckload (“LTL”) operations. The for-hire segment is highly competitive and includes thousands of carriers, none of which controls a meaningful share of the market. Our Trucking segment competes with other carriers for the services of driving associates, independent contractors, and management employees. Our logistics businesses compete with other logistics companies for the services of third-party capacity providers and management employees. 

8
​



Principal competitive factors in the truckload industry are customer service, capacity, and price. Most truckload contracts (other than dedicated contracts) do not guarantee truck availability or shipment volumes. Pricing is influenced by supply and demand. The Company’s focus is to differentiate itself primarily on the basis of customer service.
Safety and Risk Management
The Company emphasizes safety as the top core value throughout our organization, and provides proactive training and education relating to safety concepts, processes and procedures. The Company utilizes the Drug and Alcohol Clearing house to verify that both current drivers and those seeking employment with us meet eligibility requirements. The Company conducts pre-employment, random, reasonable suspicion and post-accident alcohol and substance abuse testing in accordance with the DOT regulations and the Company’s own policies.
Safety training for new drivers begins in orientation, when newly hired team members are taught safe driving and work techniques that emphasize the Company’s strong commitment to safety. Upon completion of orientation, new student drivers are required to undergo on-the-road training for four to six weeks with experienced commercial motor vehicle drivers who have been selected for their professionalism and commitment to safety and who are trained to communicate safe driving techniques to new drivers. New drivers who graduate from the program must also successfully complete post-training classroom and road testing before being assigned to their own tractor. Additionally, all Company drivers participate in on-going training that focuses on collision and injury prevention, among other safety concepts.
The primary risks for which the Company is insured are cargo loss and damage, general liability, personal injury, property damage, workers’ compensation and employee medical expenses. The Company’s self-insurance retention levels are $0.5 million for workers’ compensation claims per occurrence, $0.05 million for cargo loss and damage claims per occurrence and $2.0 million for bodily injury and property damage claims per occurrence. For medical benefits, the Company self-insures up to $0.25 million per plan participant per year with an aggregate claim exposure limit determined by the Company’s year-to-date claims experience and its number of covered team members. The Company is in the third year of a three year structured insurance agreements with two separate insurers in the $2 million to $10 million layer, locking in capacity and premiums for the policy term. While there is increased risk, the Company believes the structure of the agreements appropriately allocates the risk between the Company and insurance providers. The Company maintains insurance above the amounts for which it self-insures, subject to certain limits, with licensed insurance carriers. The Company has excess general, auto and employer’s liability coverage in amounts substantially exceeding minimum legal requirements. The Company is completely self-insured for physical damage to its own tractors and trailers, except that the Company carries catastrophic physical damage coverage to protect against natural disasters.
Environmental Regulation
In August 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (“NHTSA”) and the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) adopted final rules that established the first-ever fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards for medium and heavy-duty vehicles, including the tractors the Company uses (the “Phase 1 Standards”). The Phase 1 Standards applied to tractor model years 2014 to 2018 and required the achievement of an approximate 20 percent reduction in fuel consumption by the 2018 model year, which equates to approximately four fewer gallons of fuel used for every 100 miles traveled. 
In October 2016, the EPA and NHTSA published a final rule mandating a new phase of tighter fuel efficiency and greenhouse gas standards for medium and heavy-duty tractors and trailers (the “Phase 2 Standards”) that apply to trailers beginning with model year 2018 and apply to tractors beginning with model year 2021. The Phase 2 Standards require nine percent and twenty-five percent reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for trailers and tractors, respectively, by 2027. This rule marks the first time federal mandates will be applied to trailers, with respect to aerodynamics and low-rolling resistance tires. The final rule was effective December 2016.
​

​



This rule has, however, faced challenges and delays. In October 2017, the EPA announced a proposal to repeal the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to gliders (which mix refurbished older components, including transmissions and pre-emission-rule engines, with a new frame, cab, steer axle, wheels, and other standard equipment). The outcome of such proposed repeal is still undetermined. Additionally, implementation of the Phase 2 Standards as they relate to trailers has been challenged in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. On November 12, 2021, a panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled in favor of the association challenging the standards and vacated all portions of the Phase 2 Standards that applied to trailers, and consequently, the Phase 2 Standards will only require reductions in emissions and fuel consumption for tractors. The Company’s new tractor purchases in 2021 complied with the emission and fuel consumption reductions required by the Phase 2 Standards.
Generally, the Company believes these Phase 2 Standards could result in increased new tractor prices and additional parts and maintenance costs required to retrofit its tractors with technology to achieve compliance with such standards, which could adversely affect its operating results and profitability, particularly if such costs are not offset by potential fuel savings. The Company cannot predict, however, the extent to which its operations and productivity will be impacted. 
The California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) also adopted emission control regulations that will apply to all heavy-duty tractors that pull 53-foot or longer box-type trailers within the State of California regardless of the state of origin. The tractors and trailers subject to these CARB regulations must be either EPA SmartWay certified or equipped with low-rolling resistance tires and retrofitted with SmartWay-approved aerodynamic technologies. The Company currently purchases SmartWay certified equipment in its new tractor and trailer acquisitions. In addition, in February 2017 CARB proposed additional Phase 2 Standards that generally align with the federal Phase 2 Standards with respect to model years 2018 to 2021 tractors, with some minor additional requirements. As proposed, the enhanced California standards would stay in place even if the federal standards are vacated or otherwise diminished due to legislative or executive action. In February 2019, the California Phase 2 Standards became final. However, in December 2019, due to continuing uncertainty surrounding the federal rules on which the California standards are based, including the Truck Trailer Manufacturer’s Association (“TTMA”) litigation and EPA inaction, CARB suspended enforcement of these standards for at least two years. In June 2020 CARB also passed the Advanced Clean Trucks (“ACT”) regulation, which became effective in March 2021 and generally requires original equipment manufacturers to begin shifting towards greater production of zero-emission heavy duty tractors starting in 2024. Under ACT, by 2045, every new tractor sold in California will need to be zero-emission. While ACT does not apply to those simply operating tractors in California, it could affect the cost and/or supply of traditional diesel tractors and may lead to similar legislation in other states or at the federal level. CARB also has announced intentions to adopt regulations ensuring that all tractors operating in California are operating with battery or fuel cell-electric engines in the future. Whether these regulations will ultimately be adopted remains unclear. We will continue monitoring any developments with respect to CARB regulations.
Federal and state lawmakers also have proposed potential limits on carbon emissions under a variety of climate-change proposals. In December 2018, a coalition of states and the District of Columbia announced an agreement to develop regional limits on carbon emissions from transportation sources. Compliance with such regulations has increased the cost of our new tractors, may increase the cost of any new trailers that we will operate, may require us to retrofit certain of our pre-2011 model year trailers that operate in California, and could impair equipment productivity and increase our operating expenses. The EPA also announced it is seeking input on reducing emissions of nitrogen oxides and other pollutants from heavy-duty trucks. The EPA is aiming to release proposed standards for the new plan, commonly referred to as the “Cleaner Trucks Initiative” or “Clean Trucks Plan,” and anticipates taking final action in 2022. The EPA is targeting 2027 for these new standards to take effect and is also working on enacting more stringent greenhouse gas emission standards (beginning with model year 2030 vehicles) by the end of 2024.
Even though most of these proposals are yet to become law, these adverse effects, combined with the uncertainty as to the reliability of the newly designed diesel engines and the residual values of these vehicles, could materially increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations.

Concerns about global warming, climate change and other conditions provided motivation for policies generally referred to as the “Green New Deal”. Such policies have been advanced by progressive members of the U.S. Congress, are supported by numerous environmental groups and, to a certain extent, the Biden administration. We cannot predict when or whether any of these policies may be enacted or what their effect will be on us.
In order to reduce exhaust emissions, some states and municipalities have begun to restrict the locations and amount of time where diesel-powered tractors may idle. Further, the Phase 2 Standards include requirements to reduce particulate emissions caused by idling diesel engines. These restrictions could force the Company to purchase on-board power units that do not require the engine to idle or to alter our drivers’ behavior, either of which could result in a decrease in productivity, or increase in driver turnover.
The Company’s terminals often are located in industrial areas where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination may have occurred or could occur. The Company’s operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. Certain of the Company’s facilities have oil and/or fuel storage tanks and fueling islands. A small percentage of the Company’s freight consists of low-grade hazardous substances, which subjects it to a wide array of regulations. The Company has instituted programs to monitor and control environmental risks and promote compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations; however, if (i) the Company is involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances; (ii) there are releases of hazardous substances the Company transports; (iii) soil or groundwater contamination is found at or near the Company’s facilities or results from its operations; or (iv) the Company is found to be in violation of, or fails to comply with, applicable environmental laws or regulations, then it could be subject to clean-up costs and liabilities, including substantial fines or penalties or civil and criminal liability, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s business and results of operations.
Other Regulation
The Company’s operations are regulated and licensed by various United States federal and state, Canadian provincial, and Mexican federal agencies. Interstate motor carrier operations are subject to safety requirements prescribed by the DOT. Matters such as weight and equipment dimensions are also subject to United States federal and state regulation and Canadian provincial regulations. The Company operates in the United States pursuant to operating authority granted by the DOT, in various Canadian provinces pursuant to operating authority granted by the Ministries of Transportation and Communications in such provinces, and within Mexico pursuant to operating authority granted by Secretaria de Comunicaciones y Transportes. To the extent that the Company conducts operations outside the United States, it is subject to a wide variety of international and U.S. export, import, business procurement, transparency, and corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits United States companies and their intermediaries from bribing foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining favorable treatment.
The DOT, through the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (“FMCSA”), imposes safety and fitness regulations on the Company and its drivers, including rules that restrict driver hours-of-service (“HOS”). Changes to such HOS rules can negatively impact the Company’s productivity and affect its operations and profitability by reducing the number of hours per day or week its drivers may operate and/or disrupting its network. FMCSA implemented four major changes to HOS rules that went into effect in September 2020. The new HOS rules expanded short-haul limits, updated the adverse driving condition provision, added a split-sleeper option, and modified the 30-minute break requirement. Certain industry groups have challenged these rules in court, but it remains unclear what, if anything, will come from such challenges. While these new rules may alleviate certain burdens on the Company’s productivity and operations, any future changes to HOS rules (including any stemming from the pending challenges) could materially and adversely affect the Company’s operations and profitability.
There are two methods of evaluating the safety and fitness of carriers. The first method is the application of a safety rating which is based on an audit by the FMCSA. The Company currently has a satisfactory DOT safety rating under this method, which is the highest available rating under the current safety rating scale. If the Company were to receive a conditional or unsatisfactory DOT safety rating, it could affect or restrict our operations as well as adversely affect the Company’s business, as some of its existing customer contracts require a satisfactory DOT safety rating. FMCSA has considered revising this safety rating measurement system and related rules could be issued in the future.

11
​



FMCSA also has indicated its intent to perform a new study on the causation of collisions. Although it remains unclear whether such a study will ultimately be undertaken and completed, the results of such a study could spur further proposed and/or final rules in regard to safety and fitness.
In addition to the safety rating system, FMCSA has adopted the CSA program as an additional safety enforcement and compliance model that evaluates and ranks fleets on certain safety-related standards. The CSA program analyzes data from roadside inspections, moving violations, collision reports from the last two years, and investigation results. The data is organized into seven categories. Carriers are grouped by category with other carriers that have a similar number of safety events (e.g., collisions, inspections, or violations), and carriers are ranked and assigned a rating percentile to prioritize them for interventions if they are above a certain threshold. CSA scores are used by FMCSA to identify carriers with potential safety issues for interventions, including warning letters, inspections, and audits that can then lead to more formal agency action. Additionally, a poor score may (i) impact driver recruiting and retention by causing high-quality drivers to seek employment with other carriers, (ii) cause the Company’s customers to direct their business away from the Company and to carriers with higher fleet rankings, (iii) subject the Company to an increase in compliance reviews and roadside inspections, (iv) increase insurance costs, or (v) cause the Company to incur greater than expected expenses in its attempts to improve unfavorable scores, any of which could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations and profitability.
Under the CSA program, these scores were initially made available to the public in five of the seven categories. However, pursuant to the FAST Act, which was signed into law in December 2015, FMCSA was required to remove from public view the previously available CSA scores while it reviews the reliability of the scoring system. The Company, however, continues to have access to its scores and will still be subject to intervention by FMCSA when such scores are above the intervention thresholds. A congressionally mandated report by the National Academy of Sciences related to the CSA program was released in June 2017 which recommended: (i) reconfiguring the underlying statistical model under the CSA’s Safety Measurement System (the percentile ranking categories used to target carriers for intervention) with a so-called item response theory model to more accurately target at-risk carriers, (ii) making the scoring system more transparent and easier for carriers to replicate and understand, and (iii) departing from using relative metrics as the sole means for targeting carriers. In response to this report, FMCSA created a small-scale IRT model but, due to data deficiencies and concerns that the complex model could not be adequately explained to both the trucking industry and the public, FMCSA stated that it would not decide on whether to create and adopt the full-scale IRT model until September 2020. However, FMCSA missed that deadline and is yet to make any further announcements. FMCSA also has updated the CSA website improving data accessibility for enforcement users and carriers subject to the program. Legislative proposals have been introduced that, if passed, would force FMCSA to restore public access to the CSA, but such proposals have yet to advance. Insofar as any of these changes increase the likelihood of us receiving unfavorable scores or mandate the FMCSA to restore public access to scores, our results of operations and profitability could be adversely affected. The Company will continue to monitor FMCSA’s testing and subsequent proposed rules that may affect the scoring methodology in order to continue to promote improvement of scores in all seven categories with ongoing reviews of all safety-related policies, programs and procedures for their effectiveness.
We have on certain occasions exceeded the established intervention thresholds in a number of the seven CSA safety-related categories. Based on these unfavorable ratings, our driver fleet could be prioritized for intervention actions or roadside inspections, either of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, customers may be less likely to assign loads to us. We have put procedures in place to address areas where we have exceeded the thresholds. However, we cannot guarantee these measures will be effective.
In May 2020, the FMCSA announced that effective immediately it is making permanent a pilot program that will not count a collision in which a motor carrier was not at fault when calculating the carrier’s safety measurement profile, called the Crash Preventability Demonstration Program (“CPDP”). The CPDP will expand the types of eligible collisions, modify the CSA’s Safety Measurement System to exclude collisions with “not preventable” determinations from the prioritization algorithm and note the “not preventable” determinations in the FMCSA program reports that provide carriers and other industry participants with access to safety records on drivers. Under the program, carriers with eligible collisions that occurred on or after August 2019, may submit a “Request for Data Review” with the required police accident report and other supporting documents, photos or videos through the FMCSA’s DataQs website. If the FMCSA determines the collision was “not preventable,” it will be listed on the CSA’s Safety Measurement System but 

12
​



not included for purposes of calculating certain of such carrier’s collision and safety indicators/metrics in the CSA’s Safety Measurement System. Additionally, the “not preventable” determinations will be noted on certain FMCSA pre-employment screening reports. We have challenged eligible collisions under the CPDP program successfully. 
In December 2016, FMCSA and DOT published the Commercial Driver’s License Drug and Alcohol Clearinghouse rule as mandated by the Moving Ahead for Progress in the 21st Century Act. The rule establishes and mandates a query to the Clearinghouse by employers and prospective employers to determine if current or prospective drivers have tested positive for drugs or alcohol or have refused to take such a test when requested. The rule went into effect in January 2017 and mandated compliance by January 2020. The Company is in compliance with all query requirements. Pursuant to a new rule finalized by the FMCSA, effective November 2021, states are required to query the Clearinghouse when issuing, renewing, transferring, or upgrading a commercial driver’s license and must revoke a driver’s commercial driving privileges if such driver is prohibited from driving a motor vehicle for one or more drug or alcohol violations.
We are generally subject to FMCSA rules regarding ELD use and prohibitions on driver coercion, and a patchwork of federal, state and municipal rules and regulations regarding security measures, checkpoints and travel restrictions, including those related to drivers who haul hazardous materials. Any changes to these rules and regulations could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our efficiency and operations. 
We currently hold Free and Secure Trade (“FAST”), Business Alliance for Secure Commerce (“BASC”), and Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (“C-TPAT”) statuses with various agencies that assist with our international operations. If any of these statuses were to be revoked or suspended, we may suffer significant border delays.  This could cause our Mexican and Canadian operations to be less efficient than those of competing capacity providers that operate in Mexico or Canada and have FAST, BASC, and C-TPAT status.  We also face additional risks associated with our foreign operations, including restrictive trade policies and duties, taxes, or government royalties imposed by the Mexican or Canadian governments. 
In July 2020, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (“USMCA”) entered into effect, replacing the North American Free Trade Agreement. The USMCA was designed to modernize food and agriculture trade, advance rules of origin for automobiles and trucks, and enhance intellectual property protections, among other matters, according to the Office of the US Trade Representative. It is difficult to predict at this stage what could be the impact of the USMCA on the economy, including the transportation industry. However, given the amount of North American trade that moves by truck, it could have a significant impact on supply and demand in the transportation industry, and could adversely impact the amount, movement, and patterns of freight we transport. These and any other changes in tariffs, retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions could materially adversely affect our international business. 
Effective January 1, 2020, motor carriers are required to perform annual random drug tests for 50 percent of existing drivers, an increase from the previous requirement of only 25 percent. FMCSA must increase the minimum annual random drug and alcohol testing percentage rate when the data received for any calendar year indicate that the reported positive rate is equal to or greater than 1.0 percent. The 2020 rate increase was in response to the results of the 2018 FMCSA Drug and Alcohol Testing Survey, which reported an increase to 1.0 percent of the random testing positive rate for controlled substances. The minimum annual percentage rate for random alcohol testing remains at 10 percent.
In September 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services (“DHHS”) announced proposed mandatory guidelines to allow employers to drug test truck drivers and other federal workers for pre-employment and random testing using hair specimens. However, the proposal also requires a second sample using either urine or an oral swab test if a hair test is positive, if a donor is unable to provide a sufficient amount of hair for faith-based or medical reasons, or due to an insufficient amount or length of hair. The proposal specifically requires that the second test be done simultaneously at the collection event or when directed by the medical review officer after review and verification of laboratory-reported results for the hair specimen. DHHS indicated the two-test approach is intended to protect federal workers from issues that have been identified as limitations of hair testing, and related legal deficiencies identified in two prior court cases. It is unclear if, and when, a final rule may be put in place. Any final rule may reduce the number of available drivers.
​

Other rules have been recently proposed or made final by FMCSA, including a rule imposing a lifetime ban on driving commercial trucks for those who commit certain severe human trafficking offenses, and a rule setting forth minimum driver training standards for new drivers applying for commercial driver’s licenses for the first time and to experienced drivers upgrading their licenses or seeking a hazardous materials endorsement, which was made final in December 2016, with a compliance date now delayed until February 2022. While DOT abandoned proposals to require the use of speed limiting devices in 2017, DOT left open the possibility that it could resume such a pursuit in the future. Additionally, in May 2021 the Cullum Owings Large Truck Safe Operating Speed Act was reintroduced into the House of Representative and would require commercial motor vehicles with a gross weight of more than 26,000 pounds to be equipped with a speed limiter which would limit the vehicle’s speed to no more than 65 M.P.H. The effect of these rules, to the extent they become effective, could result in a decrease in fleet production and driver availability, either of which could adversely affect the Company’s business or operations.
In March 2014, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals held that California state wage and hour laws are not preempted by federal law. The case was appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, which denied certiorari in May 2015, and accordingly, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals decision stood. However, in December 2018, FMCSA granted a petition filed by the American Trucking Associations (the “ATA”) and in doing so determined that federal law does preempt California’s meal and rest break laws, and interstate truck drivers are not subject to such laws. FMCSA’s decision has been appealed by labor groups, and multiple lawsuits have been filed in federal courts seeking to overturn the decision. Despite attempts by labor groups to delay oral argument until the outcome of the 2020 Presidential election, the Ninth Circuit heard oral argument on the appeal on November 16, 2020. In January 2021, the Ninth Circuit upheld the FMCSA’s determination that federal law does preempt California’s meal and rest break laws, as applied to drivers of property-carrying commercial motor vehicles. Other current and future state and local wage and hour laws, including laws related to employee meal breaks and rest periods, may also vary significantly from federal law. Further, driver piece rate compensation, which is an industry standard, has been attacked as non-compliant with state minimum wage laws and lawsuits have recently been filed and/or adjudicated against carriers demanding compensation for sleeper berth time, layovers, rest breaks and pre-trip and post-trip inspections, the outcome of which could have major implications for the treatment of time that drivers spend off-duty (whether in a truck’s sleeper berth or otherwise) under applicable wage laws. Both of these issues are adversely impacting the industry as a whole and the Company specifically, with respect to the practical application of the laws, thereby resulting in additional costs. As a result, we, along with other companies in our industry, are subject to an uneven patchwork of wage and hour laws throughout the United States. In the past, certain legislators have proposed federal legislation to preempt state and local wage and hour laws; however, passage of such legislation is uncertain. If federal legislation is not passed, we will either need to comply with the most restrictive state and local laws across our entire fleet, or revise our management systems to comply with varying state and local laws. Either solution could result in increased compliance and labor costs, driver turnover and decreased efficiency, and amplified legal exposure.
The use of independent contractors in the trucking industry has been challenged by tax and other regulatory authorities and has been the subject of class action lawsuits brought by current and former independent contractors who work, or have worked, in the industry. In general, the regulatory efforts and litigation center around the view that independent contractor drivers in the trucking industry are employees rather than independent contractors. In some cases the targeted companies have used a lease-purchase independent contractor agreement, which may make a company more susceptible to the claims. The regulatory efforts have occurred on the state and in some cases on a federal level. The factors that determine independent contractor versus employee status vary depending on the jurisdiction and the particular statute or law involved. The regulatory effort and litigation include efforts to treat the independent contractors of trucking companies, such as ours, as employees for purposes of workers’ compensation, unemployment compensation, income taxes, minimum wage and overtime claims, expense reimbursement, meal and rest periods, employee benefits (health care, retirement, and other benefits), and other employment-related claims. This issue may also arise in some tort cases. In some cases, claimants have been successful in securing large settlements or have prevailed in their claims that the independent contractors are employees.

In September 2019, California enacted A.B. 5 (“AB5”), a new law that changed the landscape of the state’s treatment of employees and independent contractors. The test is referred to as the “ABC” test, and was originally handed down by the California Supreme Court in Dynamex Operations v. Superior Court in 2018. Under the ABC test, workers performing services for a hiring entity are considered employees unless the hiring entity can demonstrate three things: the worker (A) is free from the hiring entity’s control, (B) performs work that is outside the usual course of the hiring entity’s business, and (C) customarily engages in the independent trade, work or type of business performed for the hiring entity. How AB5 will be enforced is still to be determined. In January 2021, however, the California Supreme Court ruled that the ABC Test could apply retroactively to all cases not yet final as of the date the original decision was rendered, April 2018. While AB5 was set was set to go into effect in January 2020, a federal judge in California issued a preliminary injunction barring the enforcement of AB5 on the trucking industry while the California Trucking Association (“CTA”) moved forward with its suit seeking to invalidate AB5. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the reasoning behind the injunction in April 2021, ruling that AB5 is not pre-empted by federal law, but granted a stay of the AB5 mandate in June 2021 (preventing its application and temporarily continuing the injunction) while the CTA petitioned the United States Supreme Court (the “Supreme Court”) to review the decision. In November 2021, the Supreme Court requested that the U.S. solicitor general weigh in on the case. The injunction will remain in place until the Supreme Court makes a decision on whether to proceed in hearing the case. While this preliminary injunction provides temporary relief to the enforcement of AB5, it remains unclear how long such relief will last, and whether the CTA will ultimately be successful in invalidating the law. As the Company does not utilize a large population of owner-operators in California, if AB5 is upheld, the impact is expected to be insignificant; however, capacity and rates throughout the industry could be widely impacted. It is also possible AB5 will spur similar legislation in states other than California, which could adversely affect our results of operations and profitability. Despite this, opinions issued by the U.S. Department of Labor’s Wage and Hour Division and the National Labor Relations Board (“NLRB”) are consistent with the Company’s current treatment of its workforce. 
Federal legislators continue to introduce legislation concerning the classification of independent contractors as employees, including legislation that proposes to increase the tax and labor penalties against employers who intentionally or unintentionally misclassify employees as independent contractors and are found to have violated employee overtime or wage requirements. The most recent example being the Protecting the Rights to Organize (“PRO”) Act, which was reintroduced into the House of Representatives in February 2021, and passed by the House of Representatives and received by the Senate in March 2021 and remains with the Senate’s Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions. The PRO Act proposes to apply the ABC test for classifying workers under Federal Fair Labor Standards Act claims. It is unknown whether the proposed legislation will become law as currently written or whether any industry based exemptions from any resulting law will be granted. 
Some states have adopted initiatives to increase their revenues from items such as unemployment, workers’ compensation, and income taxes, and the Company believes a reclassification of independent contractor drivers as employees would help states with this initiative. 
If the independent contractors the Company engages were determined to be its employees, the Company would incur additional exposure under federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment, and tort laws, which could potentially include prior periods, as well as potential liability for employee benefits and tax withholdings. The Company currently observes and monitors its compliance with current related and applicable laws and regulations, but it cannot predict whether it will be the subject of regulatory efforts or litigation challenging the independent contractor status of its workforce. The Company cannot predict laws and regulations adopted in the future regarding the classification of the independent contractor drivers it engages or the impact on the Company’s business or operations.
In April 2016, the Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) published a final rule establishing requirements for shippers, loaders, carriers by motor vehicle and rail vehicle, and receivers engaged in the transportation of food, to use sanitary transportation practices to ensure the safety of the food they transport as part of the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 (the “FSMA”). This rule sets forth requirements related to (i) the design and maintenance of equipment used to transport food, (ii) the measures taken during food transportation to ensure food safety, (iii) the training of carrier personnel in sanitary food transportation practices, and (iv) maintenance and retention of records of written procedures, agreements, and training related to the foregoing items. These requirements took effect for larger carriers in April 2017 and are applicable when we perform as a carrier or as a broker. However, if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations related to the FSMA or if we transport food or goods that are contaminated or are found to cause illness

and/or death, we could be subject to substantial fines, lawsuits, penalties and/or criminal and civil liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.
As the FDA continues its efforts to modernize food safety, it is likely additional food safety regulations will take effect in the future. In July 2020, the FDA released its “New Era of Smarter Food Safety” blueprint, which creates a ten year roadmap to create a more digital, traceable and safer food system. This blueprint builds on the work done under the FSMA, and while it is still unclear what, if any, changes to the current governing framework may ultimately take effect, further regulation in this area could negatively affect our business by increasing our compliance obligations and related expenses going forward. 
The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (“IIJA”) was signed into law by President Biden in November 2021. The roughly $1.2 trillion bill contains an estimated $550 billion in new spending which is expected to impact transportation. In particular, it dedicates more than $100 billion for surface transportation networks and of that, roughly $66 billion for freight and passenger rail operations. Among provisions in the law specific to trucking is an apprenticeship program for drivers younger than 21 to qualify to drive commercial trucks in interstate commerce. The FMCSA announced the establishment of this program in January 2022 in an effort to help relieve the industry’s ongoing driver shortage. The program is open to 18 to 20-year-old drivers who hold intrastate commercial driver licenses and sets a strict training regimen for participating drivers and carriers to comply with. Motor carriers interested in this program must complete an application for participation and submit monthly data on an apprentice’s driver activity, safety outcomes, and additional supporting information. It remains unclear whether regulatory changes will stem from the apprenticeship program and how the IIJA will be implemented into and effect our industry. The IIJA may result in increased compliance and implementation related expenses, which could have a negative impact on our operations. 
The Biden Administration also has introduced the Build Back Better Act (“BBB”), which passed through the House of Representatives but is facing resistance in the Senate. As currently proposed, the BBB would impact transportation by allocating funds to address industry related issues such as port congestion and traffic safety enforcement. The bill also promotes low-emission programs, transit services and clean energy projects, as well as funding for climate change research. It is unclear whether these legislative initiatives will be signed into law and what changes they may undergo. However, adoption and implementation could negatively impact our business by increasing our compliance obligations and related expenses. President Biden also has indicated an intention to make substantial changes to the current U.S. tax laws during his administration. Any changes to U.S. tax laws may have an adverse impact on our business and profitability.
In response to COVID-19’s effect on our industry, the FMCSA issued and/or extended various temporary responsive measures throughout the year. These measures have largely been enacted to assist industry participants in operating under adverse circumstances and any further responsive measures remain unclear and could have a negative impact on our operations.
In November 2021, the US Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) published an emergency temporary standard (the “Emergency Rule”) requiring all employers with at least 100 employees to ensure that their employees are fully vaccinated or require any employees who remain unvaccinated to produce a negative COVID-19 test result on at least a weekly basis before coming to work. The Emergency Rule has been blocked by the Supreme Court. Effective January 2022, the U.S. is prohibiting unvaccinated foreigners from crossing the U.S.-Mexico border and U.S.-Canada border. Furthermore, effective January 2022, Canada is prohibiting unvaccinated foreigners, including U.S. citizens, from crossing their border. These border requirements, as well as any future vaccination, testing, or mask mandates that are allowed to go into effect, could, among other things (i) cause our unvaccinated employees to go to smaller employers, if such employers are not subject to future mandates, or leave us or the trucking industry, especially our unvaccinated drivers, (ii) result in logistical issues, increased expenses, and operational issues from arranging for weekly tests of our unvaccinated employees, especially our unvaccinated drivers, (iii) result in increased costs for recruiting and retention of drivers, as well as the cost of weekly testing, and (iv) result in decreased revenue if we are unable to recruit and retain drivers. Any vaccination, testing, or mask mandates that are interpreted as applying to drivers are expected to significantly reduce the pool of drivers available to us and our industry, which would further impact the extreme shortage of available drivers. Accordingly, any vaccination, testing, or mask mandates, if allowed to go into effect, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.

Seasonality
In the trucking industry, revenue typically follows a seasonal pattern for various commodities and customer businesses. Peak freight demand has historically occurred in the months of September, October and November. After the December holiday season and during the remaining winter months, freight volumes are typically lower as many customers reduce shipment levels. Operating expenses have historically been higher in the winter months due primarily to decreased fuel efficiency, increased cold weather-related maintenance costs of revenue equipment and increased insurance and claims costs attributed to adverse winter driving conditions. Revenue can also be impacted by weather, holidays and the number of business days that occur during a given period, as revenue is directly related to the available working days of shippers. Weather-related events, such as tornadoes, hurricanes, blizzards, ice storms, floods, and fires, could increase in frequency and severity due to climate change.
