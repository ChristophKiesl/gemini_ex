ITEM 1. | BUSINESS.

GENERAL
Carriage Services, Inc. (“Carriage,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) was incorporated in the State of Delaware in December 1993 and is a leading provider of funeral and cemetery services and merchandise in the United States. We operate in two business segments: funeral home operations, which currently account for approximately 76% of our total revenue, and cemetery operations, which currently account for approximately 24% of our total revenue. 
Our funeral homes offer a complete range of services to meet a family’s deathcare needs, including consultation, the removal and preparation of remains, the sale of caskets and related funeral merchandise, the use of funeral home facilities for visitation and services and transportation services. Our cemeteries are primarily sales businesses that sell interment rights (grave sites and mausoleum spaces) and related merchandise, such as markers and outer burial containers.
At December 31, 2016, we operated 170 funeral homes in 28 states and 32 cemeteries in 11 states. We compete with other public funeral and cemetery companies and smaller, independent operators. We believe we are a market leader (first or second) in most of our markets. We provide funeral and cemetery services and products on both an “at-need” (time of death) and “preneed” (planned prior to death) basis.
CURRENT YEAR DEVELOPMENTS
Acquisitions. During 2016, we acquired six funeral home businesses. We acquired two funeral home businesses in Houston, Texas in May 2016, one funeral home business in Madera, California in September 2016, one funeral home business in Brookfield, Wisconsin in November 2016 and two funeral home businesses in Burlington, North Carolina and Graham, North Carolina in November 2016. The pro forma impact of the acquisitions on prior periods is not presented as the impact is not material to our reported results. The results of the acquired businesses are included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition.
Credit Facility. On February 9, 2016, we entered into a seventh amendment (the “Seventh Amendment”) to our Credit Facility. The Seventh Amendment resulted in, among other things, (i) reducing our LIBOR based variable interest rate 37.5 basis points, (ii) extending the maturity so that the Credit Agreement will mature at the earlier of (a) any date that is 91 days prior to the maturity of any subordinated debt (including the $143.75 million in principal amount of 2.75% Convertible Subordinated Notes issued on or about March 19, 2014 and due March 15, 2021 (the “Convertible Notes”) or (b) February 9, 2021, (iii) increasing and funding the term loan so that $150 million was outstanding upon the effectiveness of the Seventh Amendment, (iv) reducing the size of the revolver to $150 million, (v) increasing the accordion to $75 million and (vi) updating the amortization payments for the term loan facility so that the borrowings under the term loan facility are subject to amortization payments of (a) $2.81 million at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2016 through the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2017, (b) $3.75 million at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning with the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2018 through the fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2020 and (c) $4.69 million at the end of each fiscal quarter beginning with the fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2020 through the fiscal quarter ending December 31, 2020. 
Commitments. Effective April 30, 2016, we terminated an agreement to outsource the processing of transactions for our cemetery business and certain accounting activities. At that time, all transaction processing returned in-house and we retained most of the personnel of the service provider that resided in our home office. 
Share Repurchase Program. On February 25, 2016, our Board approved a share repurchase program authorizing us to purchase up to an aggregate of $25.0 million of our common stock in accordance with Rule 10b-18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). The shares may be purchased from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions. Purchases will be at times and in amounts as management deems appropriate based on factors such as market conditions, legal requirements and other business considerations. During the year ended December 31, 2016, we did not repurchase any shares of common stock pursuant to this share repurchase program. 
Executive Leadership Changes.  David J. DeCarlo resigned as President of the Company and Vice Chairman of the Board of Directors (our “Board”) due to his retirement, effective September 30, 2016. As a result, the total size of the Board decreased from six to five members.
Board Of Directors. On August 9, 2016, Richard W. Scott resigned from the Board. At the time of his resignation, Mr. Scott was serving as the chairman of the Corporate Governance Committee and a member of the Audit and Compensation Committees. On the same day, the Board voted James R. Schenck to serve as a Class 1 Director until the 2018 annual meeting of shareholders. 
2

Dividends. On May 19, 2016, the Board approved an increase in our quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.025 to $0.05 per share, effective with respect to dividends payable on September 1, 2016 and later. For our 2016 fiscal year, we paid approximately $2.5 million in dividends. 
FUNERAL AND CEMETERY INDUSTRY
Funeral home and cemetery businesses provide products and services to families in three principal areas: (i) ceremony and tribute, generally in the form of a funeral or memorial service; (ii) disposition of remains, either through burial or cremation; and (iii) memorialization, generally through monuments, markers or inscriptions. The funeral and cemetery industry in the United States is characterized by the following fundamental attributes (the industry statistics and information included in this Form 10-K are from reports compiled by Sundale Research based on information as of September 30, 2016 from the U.S. Department of Commerce). 
Deaths and Death Trends
During 2016, the number of deaths in the United States increased by approximately 1.3% following a 1.9% and a 1.1% increase in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The rapidly growing and aging population (more than half of the U.S. population will be over the age of 50 within the next five years), is expected to result in an increase in the number of deaths annually. The number of Americans age 65 and over is expected to increase from 46.8 million in 2015 to 54.1 million in 2020, reflecting an average annual growth rate of 2.9%. Overall, the number of deaths in the United States is expected to increase by an average of 1.6% per year reaching an estimated 2.9 million in 2020. 
Burial and Cremation Trends 
While the number of deaths is expected to increase over the next few years, the burial rate is expected to continue to decline, however, the cremation rate is expected to continue to increase. In 2016, the number of burials in the United States decreased by an estimated 1.3%, following declines of 1.2% and 1.5% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The number of burials in the United States is estimated to fall by an average of 1.1% per year from 2015 through 2020, as the burial rate is expected to decrease by more than six percentage points during this time. In 2016, the burial rate was estimated to be 50.4% and is estimated to fall to 45.1% in 2020. It is estimated that there will be approximately 1.31 million burials in 2020 declining from 1.36 million in 2016.
In 2016, the number of cremations in the United States increased by an estimated 3.9%, following increases of 5.3% and 4.4% in 2015 and 2014, respectively. Slower growth is expected through 2020, due in part to the sheer size of the market for cremations; however, shifting preferences will continue to lead to a considerable rise in cremations. The number of cremations in the United States is expected to grow by an average of 4.3% per year through 2020. In 2020, it is estimated that there will be approximately 1.59 million cremations in the United States and a cremation rate of 54.9%. 
Highly Fragmented Ownership
Our industry, after over 50 years of consolidation, remains highly fragmented, and succession planning issues for privately-owned funeral and cemetery businesses have become more difficult and complex than ever. We believe Carriage provides a unique consolidation and operating framework that offers a highly attractive succession planning solution for owners who want their legacy family business to remain operationally prosperous in their local communities. We also believe that our decentralized operating model will continue to attract the top entrepreneurial talent in our industry. Our focus is on partnering with the best of the remaining independent funeral home and cemetery owners in major strategic markets around the country where the potential for future revenue growth is the highest.
The largest public operators, in terms of revenue, of both funeral homes and cemeteries in the United States are Service Corporation International (“SCI”), StoneMor Partners L.P. (“StoneMor”) and Carriage. We believe these three companies collectively represent approximately 20% of funeral and cemetery revenues in the United States. Independent businesses, along with a few privately-owned consolidators, represent the remaining amount of industry revenue, accounting for an estimated 80% share of revenues.
Heritage and Tradition
Funeral home and cemetery businesses have traditionally been family-owned businesses that have built a local heritage and tradition through successive generations, providing a foundation for ongoing business opportunities from established client family relationships and related referrals. Given the sensitive nature of our business, we believe that relationships fostered at the local level build trust in the community and are a key driver of market share. While new entrants may enter any given market, the time and resources required to develop local heritage and tradition serve as important barriers to entry.

BUSINESS STRATEGY
Our business strategy is based on strong, local leadership and entrepreneurial principles that we believe drive market share, revenue growth, and profitability in our local markets. We believe Carriage has the most innovative and transparent operating and reporting processes in the funeral and cemetery industry, which we are able to achieve through a decentralized, high-performance cultural operating framework linked with incentive compensation programs that attract top-quality industry talent at all levels.
We are defined by our Mission Statement which states that “we are committed to being the most professional, ethical and highest quality funeral and cemetery service organization in our industry” and our Guiding Principles which state our core values, which are comprised of:    

• | honesty, integrity and quality in all that we do;


• | hard work, pride of accomplishment and shared success through employee ownership;


• | belief in the power of people through individual initiative and teamwork;


• | outstanding service and profitability go hand-in-hand; and


• | growth of the Company is driven by decentralization and partnership.

Our five Guiding Principles collectively embody our Being The Best high-performance cultural, operating framework. Our general operations and business strategy are built upon the execution of the following three models:

• | Standards Operating Model;


• | 4E Leadership Model; and


• | Strategic Acquisition Model.

Standards Operating Model
Our Standards Operating Model eliminates the use of financial budgets which creates enormous amounts of time to focus and work on growing each local business and improving the quality and skills of the staff. Instead of the budget and control model, our Standards Operating Model and the underlying Standards which we refer to as “Being The Best,” focus on market share, people, and operating and financial metrics that drive long-term, sustainable revenue growth and earning power of our portfolio of businesses by employing leadership and entrepreneurial principles that fit the nature of our local, personal service, high-value business. Standards Achievement is the measure by which we judge the success of each business and incentivize our local managers and their teams. Our Standards Operating Model is not designed to produce maximum short-term earnings because we do not believe such performance is sustainable and will ultimately stress the business, which very often leads to declining market share, revenues and earnings. 
Important elements of our Standards Operating Model include:

• | Balanced Operating Model – We believe a decentralized structure works best in the funeral and cemetery industry. Successful execution of our Standards Operating Model is highly dependent on strong local leadership, intelligent risk taking, entrepreneurial drive and corporate support aligned with the key drivers of a successful operation organized around three primary areas - market share, people and operating financial metrics.


• | Incentives Aligned with Standards – Empowering local managers, which we call Managing Partners, to do the right things in their operations and local communities, and providing appropriate support with operating and financial practices, will enable long-term growth and sustainable profitability. Each Managing Partner participates in a variable bonus plan whereby he or she earns a percentage of his or her respective business' earnings based upon the actual standards achieved as long as the performance exceeds our minimum standards. In 2012, we began a five year incentive plan, called “Good to Great,” which rewards Managing Partners with a bonus at the end of five years, equal to a ratio of four to six times their average annual bonus, if they are able to achieve an annual compound growth rate of 2% over a five year period. After each five year incentive plan is achieved and paid out, a new five year plan begins. The initial five-year performance period commenced on January 1, 2012 and ended on December 31, 2016. For this performance period, we will payout approximately $2.4 million to 12 Managing Partners who earned a bonus under this program. Their combined annual growth rate in Revenue and Field Level Operating Earnings was 4.9% and 10%, respectively.


• | The Right Local Leadership – Successful execution of our operating model is highly dependent on strong local leadership as defined by our 4E Leadership Model, intelligent risk taking and entrepreneurial empowerment. A Managing Partner’s performance is judged according to achievement of the standards for that business.


4

4E Leadership Model
Our 4E Leadership Model requires strong local leadership in each business to grow an entrepreneurial, decentralized, high-value, personal service and sales business at sustainable profit margins. Our 4E Leadership Model is based upon principles established by Jack Welch during his tenure at General Electric, and is based upon 4E qualities essential to succeed in a high-performance culture: Energy to get the job done; the ability to Energize others; the Edge necessary to make difficult decisions; and the ability to Execute and produce results. To achieve a high level within our Standards in a business year after year, we require “A Players” in charge that have the 4E Leadership skills to entrepreneurially grow the business by hiring, training and developing highly motivated and productive teams locally that produce results. 
Strategic Acquisition Model
Our Standards Operating Model led to the development of our Strategic Acquisition Model, which guides our acquisition strategy. Both models, when executed effectively, will drive long-term, sustainable increases in market share, revenue, earnings and cash flow. We believe a primary driver of higher revenue and profits in the future will be the execution of our Strategic Acquisition Model using strategic ranking criteria to assess acquisition and divestiture candidates. As we execute this strategy over time, we will acquire larger, higher margin strategic businesses and divest smaller businesses in non-strategic markets. 
We have learned that the long-term growth or decline of a local branded funeral and cemetery business is reflected by several criteria that correlate strongly with five to ten year performance in volumes (market share), revenues and sustainable field-level earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) margins (a non-GAAP measure). We use the following criteria, to name a few, to rank the strategic position of each potential acquisition:

• | volume and price trends;


• | size of business;


• | size of market;


• | competitive standing;


• | demographics;


• | strength of brand; and


• | barriers to entry.

The valuation of the acquisition candidate is then determined through the application of an appropriate after-tax cash return on investment that exceeds our cost of capital.
Our belief in our Mission Statement and Guiding Principles that define us and proper execution of the three models that define our strategy have given us the competitive advantage in any market in which we compete. We believe that we can execute our three models without proportionate incremental investment in our consolidation platform infrastructure or additional fixed regional and corporate overhead. This competitive advantage is evidenced by the sustained earning power of our portfolio as defined by our EBITDA margin. Our deep understanding of each market landscape and our historical, successful competition in individual local markets more than reasonably ensures that we are promoting the interests of the consumer and supporting unfettered markets which, in turn, results in better pricing and more choices for the consumer. 
Other elements of our overall business strategy include the following:
Enhancement of Funeral and Cremation Services. Personalization and pre-planning continue to be two of the most important trends in the funeral and cremation services and merchandise industry, but the move toward more cremations may be the most significant. While this trend is expected to continue through at least 2020, other factors are expected to lead to rising industry revenues, including an increase in spending on additional or unique funeral and cremation services. 
The percentage of funeral services performed by our funeral homes for which cremation was chosen was 47.3% for the year ended December 31, 2014, 48.9% for the year ended December 31, 2015 and 50.7% for the year ended December 31, 2016. For the year ended December 31, 2016, 66.1% of our total cremation services were direct cremations (where no memorial service or visitation is involved, although merchandise may be sold) and 33.9% included services, as compared to 65.8% and 34.2%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2015. Shifting preferences will likely continue to lead to a considerable rise in cremations; as such, we are focused on increasing the percentage of our cremation customers that choose additional services and products. All of our funeral homes offer cremation products and services. While the average revenue for a cremation service is generally lower than that of an average traditional, full-service funeral, we have found that these revenues can be substantially enhanced by our emphasis on offering additional services and merchandise, including counseling referrals, video tributes, flowers, burial garments and memorial items such as urns, keepsake jewelry and other items that hold a portion of the cremated remains. 
5

Preneed Funeral Sales Program. We operate under a local, decentralized preneed sales strategy whereby each business location customizes its preneed program to its local needs. Approximately 19% of our funeral services performed are funded through preneed contracts, which are usually secured by placing the funds collected in trust for the benefit of the customer or by the purchase of a life insurance policy, the proceeds of which will pay for such services at the time of need. Insurance-funded contracts allow us to earn commission income to improve our near-term cash flow and offset a significant amount of the up-front costs associated with preneed sales. Trust funded contracts typically provide cash that is invested in various securities with the expectation that returns will exceed the growth factor in the insurance contracts. The cash flow and earnings from insurance contracts are more stable, but are generally lower than traditional trust fund investments. In markets that depend on preneed sales for market share, we supplement the arrangements written by funeral directors with sales sourced by sales counselors and third party sellers.
Preneed Cemetery Sales Program. Our preneed cemetery strategy is to build family heritage in our cemeteries by selling property and internment rights prior to death through full time, highly motivated and entrepreneurial local sales teams. Approximately 45% of our cemetery revenues are derived from preneed property sales. Cemetery merchandise and services are often purchased in addition to cemetery property at the time of sale. The performance of these preneed cemetery contracts is secured by placing the funds collected in trust for the benefit of the customer, the proceeds of which will pay for such services at the time of need. General consumer confidence and discretionary income have a significant impact on our preneed sales success rate. In 2016, our preneed cemetery sales increased 7.3% compared to 2015.
OUR STRENGTHS
Market Leader. We compete with other public funeral and cemetery companies and smaller, independent operators and believe we are a market leader (first or second) in most of our markets. We focus on markets that perform better than the industry average and are generally insulated from material economic and demographic changes. 
High Performance, Decentralized, Partnership Culture. Our funeral homes and cemeteries are managed by Managing Partners with extensive funeral and cemetery industry experience, often within their local markets. Our Managing Partners have responsibility for day-to-day operations, but are required to follow operating and financial standards based on our Standards Operating Model that are custom designed for each of our four business groupings which is based on the size (number of funerals) and average revenue per funeral. This strategy allows each local business to maintain its unique identity within its local market and to capitalize on its reputation and heritage while our senior leadership provides support services from our corporate headquarters in Houston, Texas. We believe our culture is very attractive to owners of premier independent businesses that fit our profile of suitable acquisition candidates.
Flexible Capital Structure. We have no near-term debt maturity issues. We believe that our capital structure provides us with financial flexibility by allowing us to invest our cash flow in growth opportunities, such as business acquisitions and cemetery inventory projects. For additional information regarding our capital structure, please see Part II, Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Liquidity and Capital Resources.
Stable Cash Flow. We have demonstrated the ability to generate strong and stable cash flow. Cash flow from operations for 2016 totaled $49.5 million, which was used primarily for the acquisition of six funeral home businesses, capital expenditures and our working capital needs. We intend to use our cash flow to acquire funeral home and cemetery businesses and to fund internal growth projects, such as cemetery inventory development. Our growth strategy is the primary way we expect to increase stockholder value. While we reassess our capital allocation strategy annually, we currently believe that our financial goals will best be achieved by continuing to improve the operating and financial performance of our existing portfolio of businesses while selectively investing our net cash flow in growth opportunities that generate a return on invested capital in excess of our weighted average cost of capital.
Strong Field-Level Gross Profit Margins. We believe that we have strong field-level gross profit margins and that this performance is a testament to the success of our business strategies. Our strong margins and the ability to control costs are important advantages in a business such as ours that is characterized by a high fixed-cost structure. We will continue to seek ways to improve our financial performance, and we believe that our Standards Operating Model will continue to yield long-term improvement in our financial results.
Effective Execution of Funeral Preneed Sales. We believe our local, decentralized strategy allows us to adapt our preneed sales selectively to best address the competitive situation in our particular markets. In highly competitive markets, we execute a more aggressive preneed sales program. In less competitive markets where we have a strong market position, we deploy a more passive preneed sales program. In certain of our markets, we do not deploy a formal preneed program. This approach allows us to target the investment in preneed sales to markets where we have the opportunity to reinforce our market share. Since 
6

approximately 78% of our funeral revenues are generated from at-need sales, we retain significant pricing leverage in our funeral business without having to rely on preneed sales.
Integrated Information Systems. We have implemented information systems to support local business decisions and to monitor performance of our businesses compared to financial and performance standards. All of our funeral homes and cemeteries are connected to our corporate headquarters, which allows us to monitor and assess critical operating and financial data and analyze the performance of individual locations on a timely basis. Furthermore, our information system infrastructure provides senior management with a critical tool for monitoring and adhering to our established internal controls, which is critical given our decentralized model and the sensitive nature of our business operations.
Proven Leadership Team. Our leadership team is comprised of eight members, which we refer to as our Operations and Strategic Growth Leadership Team (“OSGLT”), headed by our founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Melvin C. Payne and seven leaders of our support functions and is characterized by a dynamic culture that focuses on addressing changing market conditions and emerging trends in the funeral services industry. We believe our culture of emphasizing the 4Es (Energy, Energize Others, Edge and Execution) leadership characteristics is critical and will provide an important advantage as the funeral and cemetery industry evolves. We are committed to continue operating an efficient organization and strengthening our corporate and local business leadership. Our businesses are led by a Regional Partner who is a member of the OSGLT. This promotes more cooperation and synergy between our funeral and cemetery operations and supports the goal of market-share and volume growth in our most significant markets.
OPERATIONS
We conduct our funeral and cemetery operations only in the United States. Our operations are reported in two segments: funeral operations and cemetery operations. Information for each of our segments is presented below and in our financial statements set forth herein.
Funeral Home Operations
At December 31, 2016, we operated 170 funeral homes in 28 states. Funeral home revenues currently account for approximately 76% of our total revenues. The funeral home operations are managed by a team of experienced funeral and cemetery industry professionals and regional leadership with substantial management experience in our industry. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20 for segment data related to our funeral home operations.
Our funeral homes offer a complete range of services to meet a family’s deathcare needs, including consultation, the removal and preparation of remains, the sale of caskets and related funeral merchandise, the use of funeral home facilities for visitation and services and transportation services. Most of our funeral homes have a non-denominational chapel on the premises, which permits family visitation and services to take place at one location and thereby reduces transportation costs and inconvenience to the family.
Funeral homes are principally service businesses that provide burial and cremation services and sell related merchandise, such as caskets and urns. The sources and availability of caskets and urns are from a small number of national providers that have distribution centers near our businesses. We typically order and receive the merchandise within 24 hours. Given the high fixed-cost structure associated with funeral home operations, we believe the following are key factors affecting our profitability:

• | our ability to establish and maintain market share positions supported by strong local heritage and relationships;


• | our ability to effectively respond to the increasing trends towards cremation packaging complimentary services and merchandise;


• | our ability to control salary, merchandise and other controllable costs;


• | our ability to exercise pricing leverage related to our at-need business to increase average revenues per contract; and


• | demographic trends in terms of population growth and average age, which impact death rates and number of deaths; and


• | our response to fluctuations in capital markets and interest rates, which affect investment earnings on trust funds and our securities portfolio within the trust funds, which would offset lower pricing power as preneed contracts mature.

7

Cemetery Operations
At December 31, 2016, we operated 32 cemeteries in 11 states. Cemetery revenues currently account for approximately 24% of our total revenues. The cemetery operations are managed by a team of experienced funeral and cemetery industry and sales professionals and regional leadership with substantial management experience in our industry. See Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 20 for segment data related to our cemetery operations.
Our cemetery products and services include interment services, the rights to interment in cemetery sites (primarily grave sites, mausoleum crypts and niches) and related cemetery merchandise, such as memorials and vaults. Cemetery operations generate revenues through sales of interment rights and memorials, installation fees, fees for interment and cremation memorialization products, finance charges from installment sales contracts and investment income from preneed cemetery merchandise trusts and perpetual care trusts. Cemetery revenues generated from at-need services and merchandise sales generally are subject to many of the same key profitability factors as our funeral home business. Our cemetery operating results are affected by the following key factors:

• | size and success of our sales organization;


• | local perceptions and heritage of our cemeteries;


• | our ability to adapt to changes in the economy and consumer confidence; and


• | our response to fluctuations in capital markets and interest rates, which affect investment earnings on trust funds, finance charges on installment contracts and our securities portfolio within the trust funds.

Preneed Programs
We market funeral and cemetery services and products on a preneed basis at the local level. Preneed funeral or cemetery contracts enable families to establish, in advance, the type of service to be performed, the products to be used and the cost of such products and services. Preneed contracts permit families to eliminate issues of making deathcare plans at the time of need and allow input from other family members before the death occurs. We guarantee the price and performance of the preneed contracts to the customer.
Preneed funeral contracts are usually paid on an installment basis. The performance of preneed funeral contracts is usually secured by placing the funds collected in trust for the benefit of the customer or by the customer's purchase of a life insurance policy, the proceeds of which will pay for such services at the time of need. These methods are intended to fund preneed funeral contracts, cover the original contract price and generally include an element of growth (earnings) designed to offset future inflationary cost increases. Revenue from preneed funeral contracts, along with accumulated earnings, is not recognized until the time the funeral service is performed. The accumulated earnings from the trust investments and insurance policies are intended to offset the inflation in funeral prices. Additionally, we generally earn a commission from the insurance company from the sale of insurance-funded policies reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements as Preneed funeral insurance commission within Revenues: Funeral. The commission income is recognized as revenue when the period of refund expires (generally one year), which helps us defray the costs we incur to originate the preneed contract (primarily commissions we pay to our sales counselors).
In addition to preneed funeral contracts, we also offer “pre-planned” funeral arrangements whereby a customer determines in advance substantially all of the details of a funeral service without any financial commitment or other obligation on the part of the client until the actual time of need. Pre-planned funeral arrangements permit a family to avoid issues of making deathcare plans at the time of need and enable a funeral home to establish relationships with a client that may eventually lead to an at-need sale.
Preneed sales of cemetery interment rights are usually financed through interest-bearing installment sales contracts, generally with terms of up to five years with such earnings reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements as Preneed cemetery finance charges within Revenues: Cemetery. In substantially all cases, we receive an initial down payment at the time the contract is signed. Preneed sales of cemetery interment rights are recorded as revenue when 10% of the contract amount related to the interment right has been collected. Cemetery merchandise and services may similarly be sold on an installment basis, but revenue is recorded when delivery has occurred. Allowances for bad debts and customer cancellations are recorded at the date that the contract is executed and periodically evaluated thereafter based upon historical experience.
We sold 7,797 and 7,639 preneed funeral contracts, net of cancellations, during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016, respectively. At December 31, 2016, we had a backlog of 91,402 preneed funeral contracts and 63,254 preneed cemetery contracts to be delivered in the future. Approximately 19% of our funeral contract volumes during the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2016 originated through preneed contracts. Cemetery revenues that originated from preneed contracts represented approximately 50% of our net cemetery revenues for 2015 and 2016. 
8

At December 31, 2016, we employed a staff of 210 advance-planning and family service representatives for the sale of preneed products and services. Our advance-planning and family service representatives primarily assist families in making at-need and pre-need funeral, memorialization and cemetery arrangements through the selection and purchase of cemetery property, merchandise and services and ensuring that the expectations of our client families and their guests are exceeded. 
Trust Funds and Insurance Contracts
We have established a variety of trusts in connection with funeral home and cemetery operations as required under applicable state laws. Such trusts include (i) preneed funeral trusts; (ii) preneed cemetery merchandise and service trusts; and (iii) cemetery perpetual care trusts. These trusts are typically administered by independent financial institutions selected by us. Investment management and advisory services are provided either by our wholly-owned registered investment advisory firm, CSV RIA, or by independent financial advisors. At December 31, 2016, CSV RIA provided these services to two institutions, which have custody of 79% of our trust assets, for a fee based on the market value of trust assets. Under state trust laws, we are allowed to charge the trust a fee for advising on the investment of the trust assets and these fees are recognized as income as the advisory services are provided. The investment advisors establish an investment policy that gives guidance on asset allocation, investment requirements, investment manager selection and performance monitoring. The investment objectives are tailored to generate long-term investment returns without assuming undue risk, while ensuring the management of assets is in compliance with applicable laws.
Preneed funeral sales generally require deposits to a trust or purchase of a third-party insurance product. Trust fund income earned, along with the receipt and recognition of any insurance benefits, are deferred until the service is performed or the merchandise is delivered. Trust fund holdings and deferred revenue are reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, while the insurance contracts are not on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In most states, we are not permitted to withdraw principal or investment income from such trusts until the funeral service is performed. Some states, however, allow for the retention of a percentage (generally 10%) of the receipts to offset any administrative and selling expenses. The aggregate balance of our preneed funeral contracts held in trust, insurance contracts and receivables from preneed trusts was approximately $460.9 million as of December 31, 2016.
We are generally required under applicable state laws to deposit a specified amount (which varies from state to state, generally 50% to 100% of the selling price) into a merchandise and service trust fund for preneed cemetery merchandise and services sales. The related trust fund income earned is recognized when the related merchandise and services are delivered. We are generally permitted to withdraw the trust principal and accrued income when the merchandise is actually delivered, when the service is provided or when the contract is canceled. However, certain states allow the withdrawal of income prior to delivery when the regulations identify excess earnings in the trusts. We did not withdraw any trust income in 2015 and 2016. Cemetery merchandise and service trust fund balances totaled approximately $69.7 million as of December 31, 2016.
In most states, regulations require a portion (generally 10%) of the sale amount of cemetery property and memorials to be placed in a perpetual care trust. The income from these perpetual care trusts provides funds necessary to maintain cemetery property and memorials in perpetuity. This trust fund income is recognized, as earned and is reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements as Revenues: Cemetery. While we are entitled to withdraw the income from perpetual care trusts to provide for maintenance of cemetery property and memorials, we are restricted from withdrawing any of the principal balances of the trust fund. Perpetual care trust balances totaled approximately $46.9 million at December 31, 2016.
For additional information with respect to our trusts, see Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Notes 6, 8 and 10.
SEASONALITY
Our business can be affected by seasonal fluctuations in the death rate. Generally, the number of deaths is higher during the winter months because the incidences of death from influenza and pneumonia are higher during this period than other periods of the year.
COMPETITION
The operating environment in the funeral and cemetery industry has been highly competitive. Publicly traded companies operating in the United States include SCI, StoneMor and Carriage. In addition, a number of smaller private consolidators have been active in acquiring and operating funeral homes and cemeteries.
Our funeral home and cemetery operations face competition in the markets that they serve. Our primary competition in most of our markets is from local independent operators. We have observed new start-up competition in certain areas of the country, which may impact our profitability in certain markets, because of the high fixed cost nature of our funeral home operations. Market share for funeral homes and cemeteries is largely a function of reputation and heritage, although competitive pricing, professional service and attractive, well-maintained and conveniently located facilities are also important. Because of the importance of

reputation and heritage, market share increases are usually gained over a long period of time. The sale of preneed funeral services and cemetery property has increasingly been used by many companies as a marketing tool to build market share.
There has been increasing competition from providers specializing in specific services, such as cremations, who offer minimal service and low-end pricing. We also face competition from companies that market products and related merchandise over the internet and non-traditional casket stores in certain markets. These competitors have been successful in capturing a portion of the low-end market and product sales.
REGULATION
General. Our operations are subject to regulations, supervision and licensing under numerous federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations, including extensive regulations concerning trust funds, preneed sales of funeral and cemetery products and services and various other aspects of our business. We believe that we comply in all material respects with the provisions of these laws, ordinances and regulations.
Federal Trade Commission. Our funeral home operations are comprehensively regulated by the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act and a trade regulation rule for the funeral industry promulgated thereunder referred to as the “Funeral Rule.” The Funeral Rule defines certain acts or practices as unfair or deceptive and contains certain requirements to prevent these acts or practices. The preventive measures require a funeral provider to give consumers accurate, itemized pricing information and various other disclosures about funeral goods and services and prohibit a funeral provider from: (i) misrepresenting legal, crematory and cemetery requirements; (ii) embalming for a fee without permission; (iii) requiring the purchase of a casket for direct cremation; (iv) requiring consumers to buy certain funeral goods or services as condition for furnishing other funeral goods or services; (v) misrepresenting state and local requirements for an outer burial container; and (vi) representing that funeral goods and services have preservative and protective value. Additionally, the Funeral Rule requires the disclosure of mark-ups, commissions, additional charges and rebates related to cash advance items.
Environmental. Our operations are also subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including legal requirements governing air emissions, waste management and disposal and wastewater discharges. For instance, the federal Clean Air Act and analogous state laws, which restrict the emission of pollutants from many sources, including crematories, may require us to apply for and obtain air emissions permits, install costly emissions control equipment, and conduct monitoring and reporting tasks. Also, in the course of our operations, we store and use chemicals and other regulated substances as well as generate wastes that may subject us to strict liability under the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and comparable state laws, which govern the treatment, storage, and disposal of nonhazardous and hazardous wastes, and the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, a remedial statute that imposes cleanup obligations on current and past owners or operators of facilities where hazardous substance releases occurred and anyone who transported or disposed or arranged for the transportation or disposal of hazardous substances released into the environment from such sites. In addition, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the federal Clean Water Act, and analogous state laws regulate discharges of pollutants to state and federal waters. Underground and aboveground storage tanks that store chemicals and fuels for vehicle maintenance or general operations are located at certain of our facilities and any spills or releases from those facilities may cause us to incur remedial liabilities under the Clean Water Act or analogous state laws as well as potential liabilities for damages to properties or persons. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil, and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigatory, remedial and corrective action obligations, delays in permitting or performance of projects and the issuance of injunctions restricting or prohibiting some or all of our activities in affected areas. Moreover, accidental releases or spills may occur in the course of our operations, and we cannot assure you that we will not incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of such releases or spills, including any third party claims for damages to property, natural resources or persons. Also, it is possible that implementation of stricter environmental laws and regulations or more stringent enforcement of existing environmental requirements could result in additional, currently unidentifiable costs or liabilities to us, such as requirements to purchase pollution control equipment or implement operational changes or improvements. While we believe we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations, we cannot assure you that we will not incur substantial costs in the future.
Worker Health and Safety. We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, as amended (“OSHA”), and comparable state statutes whose purpose is to protect the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA hazard communication standard, the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act and implementing regulations and similar state statutes and regulations require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local governmental authorities and citizens. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations relating to worker health and safety.
