ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
On October 21, 2019, BellRing Brands, Inc. (“BellRing Inc.”) closed its initial public offering (the “IPO”) of 39.4 million shares of its Class A common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Class A Common Stock”), which number of shares included the underwriters’ exercise in full of their option to purchase up to an additional 5.1 million shares of Class A Common Stock. BellRing Inc. received net proceeds from the IPO of approximately $524.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, all of which were contributed to BellRing Brands, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and BellRing Inc.’s subsidiary (“BellRing LLC”), in exchange for 39.4 million BellRing LLC non-voting membership units (the “BellRing LLC units”). For additional information regarding our history and our organizational structure following the IPO, see “Our History” and “Our Organizational Structure” below in this section.
Unless otherwise indicated or the context otherwise requires, all references in this report to “BellRing,” “we,” “our,” “us,” “the Company” and “our Company” refer to (1) after the completion of our IPO, BellRing Inc. and its subsidiaries, including BellRing LLC, Premier Nutrition Company, LLC (“Premier Nutrition”), Dymatize Enterprises, LLC (“Dymatize”), Supreme Protein, LLC, the PowerBar brand and Active Nutrition International GmbH (“Active Nutrition International”), and (2) prior to the completion of our IPO, the active nutrition business of Post Holdings, Inc. (“Post”), which, effective as of Post’s quarter ended June 30, 2015, had been comprised of the operations and business of Premier Nutrition, Dymatize, Supreme Protein, LLC and the PowerBar brand and also included Active Nutrition International, and all references in this report to BellRing Inc. or BellRing LLC refer only to such particular entity.
Our Company
We are a leader in the global convenient nutrition category, aiming to enhance the lives of our consumers by providing them with highly nutritious, great-tasting products they can enjoy throughout the day. Our primary brands, Premier Protein and Dymatize, target a broad range of consumers and compete in all major product forms, including ready-to-drink (“RTD”) protein shakes, other RTD beverages and powders. Our products are distributed across a diverse network of channels including club, food, drug and mass (“FDM”), eCommerce, specialty and convenience.
We have organically grown our net sales from $854.4 million in our year ended September 30, 2019 to $1,247.1 million in our year ended September 30, 2021. Over the same period, net earnings including redeemable noncontrolling interest declined from $123.1 million in our year ended September 30, 2019 to $114.4 million in our year ended September 30, 2021 primarily due to incremental interest expense and accelerated amortization related to the discontinuance of our Supreme Protein brand. 
Our History
BellRing Inc. was incorporated in the State of Delaware on March 20, 2019 in connection with our IPO. Upon completion of a series of transactions in connection with the IPO (the “formation transactions”), BellRing LLC became the holder of Post’s active nutrition business, which, effective as of Post’s quarter ended June 30, 2015, and until the completion of our IPO, had been comprised of Premier Nutrition, Dymatize, the PowerBar brand and Active Nutrition International.
In its year ended September 30, 2013, Post acquired Premier Nutrition, which, at the time, was a marketer and distributor of high-quality protein shakes and nutrition bars under the Premier Protein brand and nutritional supplements under the Joint Juice brand. Premier Nutrition, Inc. was founded in 1997, and Joint Juice, Inc. was founded in 1999. In 2011, Joint Juice, Inc. acquired the Premier Protein brand and related assets from Premier Nutrition, Inc. via a corporate restructuring, and the resulting entity assumed the name Premier Nutrition Corporation. Effective September 30, 2019, Premier Nutrition Corporation converted to a limited liability company and changed its corporate name to Premier Nutrition Company, LLC.
In its year ended September 30, 2014, Post acquired Dymatize, which, at the time, was a manufacturer and marketer of high-quality protein powders and nutritional supplements under the Dymatize brand and nutrition bars under the Supreme Protein brand. Dymatize was founded in 1994 and purchased the Supreme Protein brand in 2012. 
In its year ended September 30, 2015, Post acquired the PowerBar brand and Active Nutrition International. The PowerBar brand was founded in 1986. 
Our Organizational Structure
As a result of the IPO and completion of the formation transactions:
•Premier Nutrition, Dymatize, Supreme Protein, LLC and Active Nutrition International, the entities that formerly comprised the active nutrition business of Post, became direct or indirect subsidiaries of BellRing LLC.
•BellRing Inc. became a holding company, and has no material assets other than its ownership of BellRing LLC units.
•The members of BellRing LLC consist of Post and BellRing Inc. As of September 30, 2021, Post owns 71.2% of the economic interests in BellRing LLC, and BellRing Inc. (and, indirectly, the holders of our Class A Common Stock) owns 28.8% of the economic interests in BellRing LLC.
•Post holds one share of BellRing Inc. Class B common stock, $0.01 par value per share (the “Class B Common Stock”). For so long as Post or its affiliates (other than us) directly own more than 50% of BellRing LLC units, the share of Class B Common Stock represents 67% and the outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock represent 33%, respectively, of the combined voting power of the common stock of BellRing Inc. By virtue of its ownership of the Class B Common Stock, Post controls BellRing Inc.
•BellRing Inc. holds the voting membership unit of BellRing LLC (which represents the power to appoint and remove the members of the board of managers of BellRing LLC (the “Board of Managers”) and no economic interest in BellRing LLC). BellRing Inc. has the authority to appoint the members of the BellRing LLC Board of Managers and, therefore, controls BellRing LLC.
•The financial results of BellRing LLC and its subsidiaries are consolidated with BellRing Inc., and a portion of the consolidated net earnings are allocated to the redeemable noncontrolling interest (the “NCI”) to reflect the entitlement of Post to a portion of the consolidated net earnings.
See Note 1 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for more information about the IPO and formation transactions.
In August 2021, Post announced its plan to distribute a significant portion of its ownership interest in BellRing Inc. to its shareholders, and in October 2021, BellRing Inc. and Post announced the signing of a Transaction Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Transaction Agreement”) between them, BellRing Distribution, LLC, a newly-formed wholly-owned subsidiary of Post (“New BellRing”), and BellRing Merger Sub Corporation, a wholly-owned subsidiary of New BellRing (“Merger Sub”) related to Post’s distribution plan. Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, Post will contribute its one share of our Class B Common Stock, all of its BellRing LLC units and cash to New BellRing in exchange for all of the then-outstanding equity of New BellRing and New BellRing indebtedness (the “Separation”). New BellRing will convert into a Delaware corporation, and Post will then distribute at least 80.1% of its shares of New BellRing common stock to Post shareholders in a pro-rata distribution, an exchange offer or a combination of both, depending on market conditions. Upon completion of the distribution of New BellRing common stock to Post shareholders (the “Distribution”), Merger Sub will merge with and into BellRing Inc. (the “Merger” and together with the Separation and Distribution, the “Post Distribution Transaction”), with BellRing Inc. as the surviving corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of New BellRing. Pursuant to the Merger, each outstanding share of our Class A Common Stock will be converted into one share of New BellRing common stock plus a to-be-determined amount of cash per share. The exact cash consideration will be determined in accordance with the Transaction Agreement based upon several factors, including the amount of New BellRing indebtedness to be issued. Immediately following the Distribution and Merger, it is expected that Post will own no more than 14.2% of the New BellRing common stock and the Post shareholders will own at least 57.0% of the New BellRing common stock. Legacy Class A common stockholders will own approximately 28.8% of the New BellRing common stock, maintaining their current effective ownership interest in our business. The Transaction Agreement also contemplates that Post and New BellRing will enter into certain customary ancillary agreements in connection with the consummation of the Merger. Completion of the transactions is anticipated to occur in the first calendar quarter of 2022, subject to certain customary closing conditions, although there can be no assurance that the transactions will occur within the expected timeframe or at all.
See “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this report and Note 18 within “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements” included in Part II, Item 8 of this report for more information about the above-mentioned transactions.
COVID-19 Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and continues to cause global economic disruption and uncertainty, including in our business. We continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and developments related thereto on our business and to remain focused on ensuring the health and safety of our employees, maintaining the continuity of our supply chain to serve customers and consumers and preserving financial liquidity to navigate the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and financial results, see “Sales, Marketing and Distribution” below, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report.
Our Industry 
We operate in the global convenient nutrition category, a rapidly-growing and on-trend category within the food and beverage industry. The United States (the “U.S.”) is our primary market and is the largest and most developed market in the 
world for our category. We believe the U.S. convenient nutrition category can be broken down into four key consumer need states as defined by our management: everyday nutrition, adult nutrition, sports nutrition and weight management. 
While we believe most brands in the convenient nutrition category are positioned to appeal to consumers primarily in one need state, Premier Protein has developed brand equities and product value propositions to appeal to a broad range of consumer need states. We primarily compete in the everyday nutrition and sports nutrition consumer need states, but also appeal to the adult nutrition and weight management consumer need states. We define everyday nutrition as nutritious products that can be consumed throughout the day as part of a healthy lifestyle. Our Dymatize brand is focused primarily on sports nutrition, which we define as consumers looking to supplement sports endurance and body building needs. 
Brand Overview 
Our primary brands, based on fiscal 2021 sales, are Premier Protein and Dymatize. Together our brands cover the major product forms in the convenient nutrition category and appeal to a broad range of consumer need states. Our percentage of net sales by brand for our year ended September 30, 2021 were as follows: Premier Protein, 83.0%; Dymatize, 12.6%; and other, 4.4%.
Three product forms accounted for the substantial majority of our fiscal 2021 net sales. In our year ended September 30, 2021, RTD protein shakes and other RTD beverages were 81.3% of our net sales, powders were 14.3% of our net sales and nutrition bars were 3.6% of our net sales. 
Premier Protein 
Our largest brand, Premier Protein, is a leading mainstream, lifestyle brand. Premier Protein’s product portfolio consists of RTD protein shakes, refreshing protein beverages and protein powders. Premier Protein’s flagship RTD protein shakes are available in 11 flavors and contain 30 grams of protein with only one gram of sugar and 160 calories. They are gluten- and soy-free, low fat and fortified with 24 vitamins and minerals. The brand’s Premier Protein with Oats shake line adds more balanced nutrition with 20 grams of protein plus 7 grams of fiber and can be enjoyed both hot and cold. Our RTD protein shakes are formulated to deliver great-tasting, leading protein levels while maintaining one of the leanest nutritional profiles in the category (as measured by sugar and calorie content). Premier Protein’s powder portfolio consists of 100% whey protein products. We believe the product profile appeals to consumers across age ranges in all four need states.
Dymatize 
Our Dymatize brand is a market leader targeting fitness enthusiasts who value the brand for its science-based product development, athletic performance focus and great taste. The brand’s portfolio includes an assortment of sports nutrition products, including protein powders. The majority of Dymatize’s sales are generated through protein powders. Our protein powder portfolio consists of three primary products: ISO.100 made with hydrolyzed 100% Whey Protein Isolate, Elite 100% Whey and Super Mass Gainer. ISO.100, the brand’s flagship product, has a global reach with sales in more than seventy countries. In addition to powders, Dymatize offers a suite of products to meet the needs of athletes, including pre-workout and post-workout recovery products. Dymatize products are sold in a variety of retail channels including specialty, FDM, club and online.
Our Customers
Our customers are predominantly club stores, FDM customers, online retailers, specialty retailers, convenience stores and distributors. We sell our products domestically and in more than seventy countries globally. Our U.S. business represented 88.3% of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2021 and our international business represented 11.7% of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2021. 
Our largest customers, Costco and Walmart (which includes its affiliates, including Sam’s Club), accounted for approximately 65.3% of our net sales in our year ended September 30, 2021. No other customer accounted for more than 10% of our fiscal 2021 net sales.
Sales, Marketing and Distribution
In the U.S., we utilize a direct sales force in multiple channels, including club, FDM, convenience, specialty and eCommerce. We also sell through a broker network for customers in the convenience, grocery and mass channels, and through distributors for the specialty channel. In international markets, we sell our products through a combination of direct sales to retailers and to third party distributors. We utilize a direct sales force in key markets in the European Union (the “E.U.”) for multiple channels, including FDM, convenience, specialty and eCommerce. We also sell through distributors in the specialty channel.
We maintain a dedicated multi-faceted and consumer-driven marketing strategy for each of our primary brands, tailoring initiatives to each brand’s target audience. Each of our brands maintains a presence across all major social media platforms. 
Premier Protein. Premier Protein’s marketing strategy is aimed at accelerating the brand’s positioning as a lifestyle brand for mainstream consumers. Premier Protein’s marketing initiatives are focused on increasing awareness to drive product trial and adoption as well as expanding household penetration among this group of consumers. Premier Protein employs a broad media strategy, which includes digital media, search marketing, television, in-store marketing and demos and online dedicated programming. As part of its marketing strategy, Premier Protein leverages its fans’ enthusiasm for the brand to spread the word of our products. The brand utilizes an influencer marketing program called “Premier Shakers” that leverages micro-influencers, content creators and top-tier influencers to generate further awareness of Premier Protein.
Dymatize. Dymatize’s marketing strategy is focused on retailer-specific programs, online and specialty print media and social media. Social media is a high-touch medium that resonates with Dymatize’s core fitness-focused consumers. The brand also utilizes a social media influencer model, “Team Dymatize,” engaging with athletes. This team promotes product usage via personal social media channels to drive awareness for the brand among its target demographic.
Our products are distributed through a network of third party common carriers.
Demand for our products is impacted by changes in consumer behaviors and preferences, and we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, changes in consumer consumption patterns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures that have been and are being taken by governments, businesses, including us, and the public at large to limit the spread, variants and resurgences of COVID-19. Our products generally experienced a decline in sales starting in March 2020, returned to growth rates in line with their pre-pandemic levels during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 and remained strong in fiscal 2021. We continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on our business; however, we are unable to accurately predict the future impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have due to various uncertainties, including the duration, severity and spread of COVID-19, actions that may be taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic, the availability and adoption of effective treatments and vaccines, changes in consumer behaviors and preferences and the impact on our supply chain, operations, workforce and the financial markets. For further discussion regarding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business refer to the “COVID-19 Pandemic” section above, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 and “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this report. For additional discussion, refer to “Cautionary Statement on Forward-Looking Statements” above.
Research and Development
We continue to improve and expand our product offerings with new flavors, ingredients, packaging and process development technologies. We leverage our dedicated market research, consumer insights and innovation teams, supplemented by leading design firms, product development companies, third party flavor houses and consultants. 
Supply Chain
Raw Materials. Raw materials used in our business consist of ingredients and packaging materials purchased from local, regional and international suppliers. Our principal ingredients include milk-based, whey-based and soy-based proteins, protein blends, sweeteners and vitamin and mineral blends. Our primary packaging materials include aseptic foil and plastic lined cardboard cartons, flexible and rigid plastic film and containers, beverage packaging and corrugate. We purchase our raw materials in accordance with rigorous standards to assure food quality and safety. Supply availability and prices paid for raw materials can fluctuate widely due to external factors, such as pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) and other outbreaks of contagious diseases, weather conditions, labor disputes, governmental programs, regulations and trade and tariff policies, industry consolidation, economic climate, energy shortages, transportation delays, commodity market prices, currency fluctuations and other unforeseen circumstances. We continuously monitor supply and cost trends of these raw materials to enable us to obtain ingredients and packaging needed for our products.
Under the terms of an agreement with a significant protein powder supplier, Premier Nutrition is required to purchase a minimum periodic volume of protein powder and has the right (but not the obligation) to order quantities in excess of such minimum amount provided the supplier has the capacity and the ability to produce such additional quantities. The agreement also contains detailed provisions regarding the product specifications and quality standards for the raw materials to be provided by the supplier, the rights of a party in the event the other party does not comply with its obligations under the agreement and other customary contractual terms and conditions. The agreement expires on October 30, 2024.
Energy
Electricity and steam are used in the facilities that manufacture our products. In addition, considerable amounts of diesel fuel are used in connection with the distribution of our products.
Manufacturing. We primarily engage third party contract manufacturers in North America and the E.U. to produce our products. We receive products from our third party contract manufacturers for an agreed-upon tolling charge for each item produced as well as other minor costs. Most of our relationships with our contract manufacturing partners include minimum volume commitments, whereby the third party contract manufacturer has committed to produce, and we have committed to 
purchase, a minimum quantity of product. We own a manufacturing plant in Voerde, Germany that supplies nutrition bars and gels primarily for the E.U., Switzerland and the U.K. 
We regularly monitor the capacity and performance of our third party contract manufacturing partners and suppliers and qualify new contract manufacturing partners and suppliers as needed. Given the growth profile of our primary products, we continuously plan for incremental capacity and review additional strategic alternatives to support our business. 
From three separate and geographically diverse manufacturing locations, our largest third party contract manufacturer provided approximately 67.5% of our Premier Protein RTD shake supply for our year ended September 30, 2021. Under the terms of a manufacturing agreement with the third party contract manufacturer, Premier Nutrition is required to purchase a minimum annual order volume of RTD protein shakes and has the right (but not the obligation) to order quantities in excess of a monthly minimum amount provided the third party contract manufacturer has the capacity and the ability to produce such additional quantities. In addition, under the terms of the manufacturing agreement, the third party contract manufacturer has committed to produce an annual minimum volume of RTD protein shakes. The manufacturing agreement also contains detailed provisions regarding the product specifications and quality standards for the products to be manufactured and packaged by the third party contract manufacturer, the tolling charges for each item produced (and certain other costs) to be paid by Premier Nutrition (and related payment terms), shipping and storage obligations, the rights of a party in the event the other party does not comply with its obligations under the manufacturing agreement and other customary contractual terms and conditions. The manufacturing agreement expires on December 31, 2022.
We regularly evaluate our contract manufacturing arrangements to ensure the cost-effective manufacturing of our products. We select our manufacturing partners based on expertise, quality, cost and location. Our quality assurance team frequently monitors manufacturing partners to ensure our partners meet our rigorous processing and quality standards, detailed in our Quality Expectations Manual, including requirements for third party certification of Good Manufacturing Practices. Our owned production plant in Voerde, Germany is additionally certified to one of the international Food Safety Standards (ISO/FSSC 22.000, IFS or BRC), SMETA 4-pillars (Labour, Environment, Health and Safety, Business Ethics) and OHSAS 18001 (Health and Safety). 
Distribution. In North America, our products typically are shipped directly from our contract manufacturing partners to a network of third party warehouses. Products are distributed from third party warehouses to customer distribution centers or retail stores or are exported to international customers. Occasionally, we ship products directly from our third party contract manufacturers to our customers’ distribution centers. 
We maintain one third party warehouse location in Germany, which receives products from our production facility located in Voerde, Germany or directly from our third party contract manufacturers. Our branded products are distributed from third party warehouses to customer distribution centers or retail stores or are exported to international customers. 
Competition
The convenient nutrition category in which we operate is highly competitive and highly sensitive to both pricing and promotion. We compete with other brands, including private label and store brand products, and with many nutritional food and beverage players. We have numerous competitors of varying sizes, including manufacturers of other branded food and beverage products, as well as manufacturers of private label products. Some of our competitors have substantially more financial, marketing and other resources than us. Competition in our industry is based on, among other things, product quality, taste, functional benefits, nutritional value and ingredients, convenience, brand loyalty and positioning, product variety, product packaging, shelf space, price, promotional activities and the ability to identify and satisfy dynamic, emerging consumer preferences. Our principal strategies for competing in our industry include strong and impactful marketing to build awareness of our products, effective customer relationship management, category insights, superior product quality and food safety, product innovation, an efficient supply chain and competitive pricing. We expect the industry we operate in to remain highly competitive for the foreseeable future. 
Seasonality 
We experience seasonal fluctuations in our sales and earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”) margins because of consumer spending patterns and timing of our key retailers’ promotional activity. Historically, our first quarter of the fiscal year is seasonally low for net sales for all brands driven by a slowdown of consumption of our products during the holiday season. Sales are typically higher throughout the remainder of the fiscal year as a result of stronger consumer demand in our second quarter of the fiscal year, promotional activity at key retailers and organic growth of the business. Seasonal fluctuations in our sales and EBIT margins may not be the same in the future as they have been historically. For a discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which impacted sales trends for fiscal 2020 and 2021, refer to “Sales, Marketing and Distribution” above.
Trademarks and Intellectual Property 
We own or have licenses to use a number of trademarks that are critical to the success of our business. Our key trademarks include BellRing®, BellRing Brands®, Premier Protein®, Premier Nutrition®, Dymatize®, ISO.100®, PowerBar® and Joint Juice®, each of which we own, as well as trademarks that we license from third parties, such as Pebbles® and Dunkin®. Our owned trademarks are, in most cases, protected through registration in the U.S. or Germany, as well as in many other countries where the related brands or products are sold. We also own, or have applications pending, for several patents in the U.S. and other countries. While our patent portfolio as a whole is material to our business, no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. In addition, we have copyrights, proprietary trade secrets, technology, know-how processes and other intellectual property rights that are not registered. 
We rely on a combination of trademark law, copyright law, trade secrets, non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements and provisions in agreements and other measures to establish and protect our proprietary rights to our products, packaging, processes and intellectual property. 
Governmental Regulation and Environmental Matters 
We are subject to regulation by federal, state and local governmental entities and agencies in the U.S., as well as similar regulations in Canada, Mexico, Europe and other international locations, including food safety laws, labor and employment laws, laws governing advertising, privacy laws, consumer protection regulations, worker health and safety regulations, environmental laws and regulations and other laws and regulations. 
Our products are regulated in the U.S. either as food or dietary supplements, which internationally may be regulated as pharmaceuticals or other health food categories. As a producer and distributor of goods for human consumption, we must comply with stringent production, storage, recordkeeping, distribution, labeling and marketing standards established by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”), the U.S. Department of Agriculture (the “USDA”), the Federal Trade Commission and state and local agencies in the U.S. We also must comply with standards established by similar regulatory agencies in Canada, Mexico, the E.U. and elsewhere. In addition, some of our products are produced and marketed under contract as part of special certification programs such as organic, kosher or non-GMO, and must comply with the strict standards of federal, state and third party certifying organizations. Products that do not meet regulatory or third party standards may be considered adulterated or misbranded and subject to withdrawal or recall. Additionally, following the adoption of the Food Safety Modernization Act in the U.S. and the Safe Foods for Canadians Act in Canada, the FDA and the Canadian Food Inspection Agency are implementing additional regulations focused on prevention of food contamination, more frequent inspection of high-risk facilities, increased record-keeping and improved tracing of food. 
Our manufacturing facility in Germany is subject to certain safety regulations, including the German Occupational Safety and Health Regulation. These regulations require us to comply with certain manufacturing safety standards to protect our employees from accidents. Additionally, some of the food commodities on which our business relies are subject to governmental agricultural programs (e.g., subsidies and import/export regulations), which have substantial effects on the prices and supplies of these commodities. 
In addition, our operations are subject to various federal, state and foreign laws and regulations regarding data privacy, including the General Data Protection Regulation, the E.U.’s retained law version of the General Data Protection Regulation and the California Privacy Rights Act, each of which applies to certain aspects of our business and deal with the collection and use of personal information obtained from data subjects. As a company with international operations, we also are subject to laws, rules and regulations in the U.S. and other countries related to anti-corruption, antitrust and competition and economic sanctions. 
Our business also is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations with respect to environmental matters, including air quality, wastewater and storm water management, waste handling and disposal and other regulations intended to protect public health and the environment. In the U.S., the laws and regulations include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act (“Proposition 65”), among others. Internationally, our operations, including our manufacturing facility in Germany, are subject to local and national regulations similar to those applicable to us in the U.S. We have made, and will continue to make, expenditures to ensure compliance with environmental regulations. 
Human Capital 
We have approximately 355 employees as of November 1, 2021. Of these employees, approximately 205 are in the U.S., approximately 140 are in Germany and approximately 10 are in other countries. Our people are critical to our success and we prioritize providing a safe, rewarding and respectful workplace where our people are provided with opportunities to pursue career paths based on skills, performance and mindset. We adhere to our Code of Conduct, which sets forth a commitment to our stakeholders, including our employees, to operate with integrity and mutual respect. 
Health and Safety
We are committed to maintaining a healthy and safe workplace for our employees. In our Voerde, Germany manufacturing facility, we have a comprehensive safety and risk management system in place that incorporates rigorous safety standards and practices, employee and leadership training to ensure consistent implementation of our safety protocols and periodic internal and external audits to evaluate our compliance with these policies.
Talent Acquisition, Development, Engagement and Retention
Acquiring, developing, engaging and retaining a diverse and talented workforce is key to accomplishing our goals and achieving business results. 
We have taken steps to enhance our talent acquisition processes, including implementing diversity training for recruiters, employee training on interview skills and processes to improve our candidate selection process to promote more diversity among our employees. We also have updated our careers websites and job descriptions and increased community outreach to enable us to reach a wider audience of candidates.
Providing development opportunities and resources for our employees is another key factor in our human capital strategy. We offer a variety of training and development programs for employees at all levels of our organization, including monthly development trainings for people leaders of all levels, along with in depth workshops for new managers.
We check in with our employees through regular engagement surveys and then act on those survey results, as appropriate. Employee-led groups, opportunities to participate in informal wellness activities and philanthropic work are informed by what our employees identify as important to them. We measure our progress and take additional actions, as needed. We communicate transparently with our employees about the organization to keep our employees informed and engaged. 
We strive to develop and implement compensation and benefits policies and programs that support our business goals, maintain competitiveness, promote shared fiscal responsibility among the Company and our employees, strategically align talent within our organization and reward performance, while also managing the costs of such policies and programs. We provide our employees with competitive fixed and/or variable pay and, for eligible employees, we currently provide access to medical, dental and life insurance benefits, disability coverage, a 401(k) plan and employee assistance programs, among other benefits.
Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Belonging 
We recognize the importance of a diverse, equitable and inclusive culture for our employees and we are dedicated to creating an inclusive environment that reflects the communities in which we live and work. We have implemented initiatives to track and improve our performance in these areas. During fiscal 2021, we conducted company-wide workshops on diversity topics, as well as online respectful workplace training for all employees.
COVID-19 Response
During fiscal 2021, as the COVID-19 pandemic has persisted, we have continued to prioritize the health, safety and well-being of our employees. Many of the safety measures implemented in fiscal 2020 also were utilized in fiscal 2021. At various points during fiscal 2021, these measures have included, where practicable: practicing social distancing, providing personal protective equipment, encouraging hygiene practices advised by health authorities, restricting business travel and site visitors, increasing ventilation to promote air exchanges, placing air purifying units throughout our offices and implementing remote working for certain office employees. We continue to monitor our practices to remain aligned with federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and guidelines.
