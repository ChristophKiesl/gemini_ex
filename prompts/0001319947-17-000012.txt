ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

General
DSW Inc. was incorporated in the state of Ohio in 1969, and we opened our first DSW store in Dublin, Ohio in 1991. DSW is the destination for fabulous footwear and accessory brands at a great value every single day. With a breathtaking assortment of shoes, handbags and accessories for women, men and kids in 501 stores nationwide and on dsw.com, DSW strives to delight customers with finding the perfect shoe at an incredible price. Our DSW stores average approximately 21,000 square feet and carry approximately 22,000 pairs of shoes. In addition, our DSW Rewards loyalty program means shopping comes with perks; members earn points towards certificates every time they purchase. We believe this combination of assortment, convenience and value differentiates us from our competitors and appeals to consumers from a broad range of socioeconomic and demographic backgrounds.
As a segment of DSW Inc., the Affiliated Business Group ("ABG") partners with multi-category retailers to develop strategies and business models for targeted shoe assortments. ABG provides service to 395 store locations and e-commerce channels through leased partnerships with Stein Mart, Gordmans and Frugal Fannie's.
We also have an equity investment in Town Shoes Limited ("Town Shoes"). Town Shoes is the market leader in branded footwear in Canada, with sales of over $345 million Canadian dollars ("CAD") in fiscal 2016. As of January 28, 2017, Town Shoes operated 182 locations across Canada under The Shoe Company, Shoe Warehouse, Town Shoes and DSW banners, as well as an e-commerce site. In 2014, we entered into a licensing agreement with Town Shoes, which allows Town Shoes to use the DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse tradename for their new larger concept Canadian stores. As of January 28, 2017, there are 23 DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse stores in Canada. 
We completed several transactions that supported our efforts to grow market share within footwear and accessories domestically and internationally. On March 4, 2016, we acquired Ebuys, Inc. ("Ebuys"), a leading off price footwear and accessories retailer operating in digital marketplaces. Ebuys sells products to customers located in North America, Europe, Australia and Asia. On August 2, 2016, we signed an agreement with the Apparel Group as an exclusive franchise partner in the Gulf Coast region of the Middle East. The agreement is expected to expand the DSW banner by up to 40 stores across the territory, both in malls and on high street locations within Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Qatar, Kuwait, United Arab Emirates and Oman, with the first stores opening in fiscal 2017.
See our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for financial information about our two reportable segments: the DSW segment, which includes DSW stores and dsw.com, and the ABG segment. Additionally, a five year summary of certain financial and operational information is included in Item 6 of this Annual Report.
We follow a 52/53-week fiscal year that ends on the Saturday nearest to January 31 in each year. The periods presented in these financial statements and selected financial data are the fiscal years ended January 28, 2017 ("fiscal 2016"), January 30, 2016 ("fiscal 2015"), January 31, 2015 ("fiscal 2014"), February 1, 2014 ("fiscal 2013") and February 2, 2013 ("fiscal 2012"). Fiscal 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013 each consisted of 52 weeks, while fiscal 2012 consisted of 53 weeks. Our next fiscal year ending February 3, 2018 ("fiscal 2017") will consist of 53 weeks.
Competitive Strengths
We are a leading footwear retailer with a history of growth and financial strength that is leveraging our operating model to gain market share. We believe that having a leading market position is driven by our competitive strengths: assortment, convenience and value. 
Assortment
Our goal is to excite our customers with a competitive, compelling assortment of shoes and complementary accessories that fulfill a broad range of style and fashion preferences. DSW sells a large assortment of brand name, designer and private brand merchandise. We purchase directly from over 450 domestic and foreign vendors, primarily in-season footwear found in specialty and department stores and branded make-ups (shoes made exclusively for a retailer). We offer a broad assortment of handbags, hosiery, jewelry and other accessories which appeal to our brand and fashion conscious customers. We also make opportunistic and close-out purchases to offer value to our customers.

Our vendors include suppliers who manufacture their own merchandise, or supply merchandise manufactured by others, or both. Most of our domestic vendors import a large portion of their merchandise from abroad. We have quality control programs under which our buyers are involved in establishing standards for quality and fit, and our personnel examine incoming merchandise in regards to color, material and overall quality. As our sales volume grows, we believe there will continue to be adequate sources available to acquire a sufficient supply of quality merchandise in a timely manner and on satisfactory economic terms. Our top three vendors in the aggregate supply approximately 18% of our merchandise.
Our merchandising group continuously monitors current fashion trends, as well as historical sales trends, to identify popular styles and styles that may become popular in the upcoming season. We track performance and sales trends on a weekly basis and have a flexible buying process that allows us to reorder successful styles and cancel underperforming styles throughout each season. To keep our product mix fresh and on target, we test new fashions and actively monitor sell-through rates. We also identify new vendor and category opportunities. After a successful launch during fiscal 2016, we will continue to add new locations in fiscal 2017 that will bring DSW kids to close to 60% of the total chain. 
We separate our DSW merchandise into three primary categories: women's footwear; men's footwear; and accessories and other (which includes kids' footwear). The following table sets forth the approximate percentages of DSW segment sales attributable to each merchandise category for the fiscal years below: 

 | Fiscal
Category | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Women's footwear | 69 | % | | 69 | % | 69 | %
Men's footwear | 22 | % | | 22 | % | 22 | %
Accessories and other | 9 | % | | 9 | % | 9 | %

Convenience
We provide our customers with the highest level of convenience based on our belief that customers should be empowered to control and personalize their shopping experiences. 
In stores, our merchandise is displayed on the selling floor with self-service fixtures to enable customers to view and touch the merchandise. We believe this shopping experience provides our customers with maximum convenience as they are able to browse and try on merchandise without feeling rushed or pressured to make a purchasing decision. Merchandise is organized in a logical manner that groups together similar styles, such as dress, casual, seasonal and athletic merchandise, for easy browsing. 
Our omni-channel capabilities create an endless aisle for the customer. Customers can order additional styles, sizes, widths and categories that can be fulfilled from other DSW stores, our fulfillment center or directly from our suppliers (referred to as "drop ship"). To further meet customer demand of how they receive products, we allow our customers the option to buy online, pickup in store and buy online, ship to store. 
Value For Our Customers
Our buying organization aims to provide customers with high quality, in-season fashion styles at attractive prices compared to the sale prices found at specialty retailers and department stores. We have historically employed a consistent pricing strategy that provides customers with the same price on our merchandise from the day it arrives in store until it enters our planned clearance rotation. Our pricing strategy differentiates us from our competitors who usually price and promote merchandise at discounts available only for limited time periods. We find that customers appreciate shopping for everyday value when it is most convenient for them, rather than waiting for a sale event. 
We provide additional value through our DSW Rewards loyalty program where members earn points towards discounts on future purchases. Members also receive promotional offers and gifts with purchase offers. We employ a variety of methods, including email, direct mail and social media, to communicate exclusive offers to our rewards customers. Through our co-branded credit card, DSW Rewards members earn points for any purchases made with the credit card, including transactions outside of DSW.
Approximately 24 million members are enrolled in our DSW Rewards program and have made at least one purchase over the course of the last two years. In fiscal 2016, shoppers in the loyalty program generated approximately 90% of DSW segment sales.

Growth Strategy

Our growth strategy is to strengthen our position as a leading footwear and accessories retailer by expanding into new markets with the right banners and store format, extending our customer reach through new categories, and creating a differentiated customer experience and strong value proposition. We will also continue utilizing our financial strength to invest in key initiatives. 
Expanding Our Presence
We opened 34 DSW stores and closed one DSW store in fiscal 2016, and we plan to open approximately 15 to 17 DSW stores and close two to four DSW stores in fiscal 2017. With our stores increasingly playing a key role in supporting our strong online demand growth and increasing fulfillment of that demand, we are regularly evaluating our real estate strategy to optimize how we can best serve the customers' shopping preferences. When we decide to open a new store in either new or existing markets, our primary focus is on power strip centers. We also look to reposition existing stores as opportunities arise. Depending on the market, we also consider regional malls, lifestyle centers and urban street locations. In general, our evaluation of potential new stores integrates information on demographics, co-tenancy, retail traffic patterns, site visibility and accessibility, store size and configuration, and lease terms. Our real estate decision-making entails an analysis of underlying demand for our products through both physical and digital channels. Our analysis also looks at current penetration levels in markets we serve and our ability to deepen our market share and acquire new customers.
As of January 28, 2017, we operated 501 DSW stores in 43 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The following table sets forth the number of our DSW stores by state and territory:

Location | Number of Stores | Location | | Number of Stores | | Location | | Number of Stores 
Alabama | 6 | | Louisiana | | 4 | | North Dakota | | 1 
Arizona | 10 | | Maine | | 1 | | Ohio | | 21
Arkansas | 1 | | Maryland | | 20 | | Oklahoma | | 3 
California | 47 | | Massachusetts | | 17 | | Oregon | | 6 
Colorado | 11 | | Michigan | | 20 | | Pennsylvania | | 25

Through our investment in Town Shoes, we serve Canadian customers with great values on branded footwear and accessories within a variety of concepts, including DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse stores. As of January 28, 2017, there are 23 DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse stores in Canada. Through our franchise arrangement with the Apparel Group, we expect to expand DSW by up to 40 stores in the Gulf Coast region of the Middle East, both in malls and on high street locations, with the first stores opening in fiscal 2017. With our acquisition of Ebuys, we are expanding our presence into several fast-growing digital marketplaces that appeal to value-oriented customers. 
Investment in Our Infrastructure
We continue to invest in systems in order to enhance our customers' experience, both in-store and online, which includes supporting our omni-channel capabilities. We are also enhancing systems for back-office support. Over the past few years, we have completed investments in our supply chain to support assortment planning, size replenishment and size optimization.

Our primary distribution center is located in an approximately 625,000 square foot facility in Columbus, Ohio. The distribution center operates to facilitate the prompt delivery of purchases and fast-selling footwear so we can take full advantage of each selling season. To further ensure prompt delivery, we engage a logistics service provider to receive orders originating from suppliers on the West Coast and some imports entering at a West Coast port of entry through a West Coast facility we utilize. Merchandise is transported either from the West Coast facility or our primary distribution center to our pool points and then on to stores. 
Our order routing optimization system determines the best location to fulfill digitally demanded products, which allows us to optimize our operating profit. Orders originating online can be fulfilled from a store or our fulfillment center, which is also located in Columbus, Ohio. The fulfillment center processes orders, which are shipped to a customer's home or to a store when an order is placed through buy online, ship to store. Orders originating from a store that cannot be fulfilled immediately in that store can either be fulfilled from our ship from store capability, from the fulfillment center, or drop shipped from a vendors' warehouse.
In order to support the planned growth of Ebuys' operations, we are transitioning Ebuys' existing fulfillment centers into a single larger facility in Nashville, Tennessee that will double its supply chain capabilities.
Utilizing Our Financial Strength 
Over the past five years, our net sales have grown at a compounded annual growth rate of 6%. In addition, we have consistently generated positive operating cash flows and profitable operating results. Our liquidity, strong vendor relationships and talented associates enable us to differentiate our assortment and run a profitable business compared to our peers. 
We are committed to a disciplined process in capital allocation. We believe cash generated from operations, together with our cash and investments of $287.1 million as of January 28, 2017, is sufficient to maintain our ongoing operations, support seasonal working capital requirements, fund capital expenditures, and make quarterly dividend payments and opportunistic share repurchases. In addition, our strong balance sheet allows us to pursue inorganic growth through investments like Town Shoes and Ebuys. 
Affiliated Business Group
The Affiliated Business Group partners with multi-category retailers to develop strategies and business models for targeted shoe assortments. We leverage our sourcing network to produce a merchandise assortment that meets the needs of our affiliated business customers. We have renewable supply agreements to provide merchandise for the shoe departments in Stein Mart, Gordmans, and Frugal Fannie's stores through December 2017, January 2019 and April 2018, respectively. As of January 28, 2017, we supplied merchandise to 288 Stein Mart stores and Steinmart.com, 106 Gordmans stores and Gordmans.com, and one Frugal Fannie's store. We continue to pursue opportunities for new affiliated business partners. 
Additional Information
Competition
The retail footwear market is highly competitive with few barriers to entry. We compete against a diverse group of retailers, both small and large, including department stores, mall-based shoe stores, national chains, independent shoe retailers, single-brand specialty retailers, online shoe retailers, brand-oriented discounters, multi-channel specialty retailers and brand suppliers who sell directly to consumers. Many of our competitors generally offer a more limited assortment at higher initial prices in a less convenient format than DSW and without the benefits of the DSW Rewards program. In addition, we believe we successfully compete against retailers who have attempted to duplicate our format because they typically offer assortments with fewer recognizable brands and more styles from prior seasons, unlike DSW's current on-trend merchandise. We believe that our brick and mortar stores provide a competitive advantage by stimulating digital sales, driving growth in DSW segment sales and providing a convenient location for customers to pick up and return products ordered online, as well as serving as geographically appropriate shipment centers for our digitally demanded products.

Intellectual Property
We have registered a number of trademarks, service marks and domain names in the United States and internationally, including DSW®, DSW Shoe Warehouse® and DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse®. We licensed our DSW Designer Shoe Warehouse trademark to Town Shoes and the Apparel Group. We also have registered trademarks through our acquisition of Ebuys including Apparel Save®, ShoeMetro®, ShoeMetro.com® and SM ShoeMetro®. We believe our trademarks and service marks, especially those related to the DSW concept, have significant value and are important to building our name recognition. To protect our brand identity, we have also protected the DSW trademark in several foreign countries. We also hold patents related to our unique store fixtures, which gives us greater efficiency in stocking and operating those stores that currently have the fixtures. We aggressively protect our patented fixture designs, as well as our packaging, private brand names, store design elements, marketing slogans and graphics. 
Associates
As of January 28, 2017, we employed approximately 12,600 associates. None of our associates are covered by any collective bargaining agreements. We offer competitive wages, paid time off, comprehensive medical and dental insurance, vision care, company-paid and supplemental life insurance programs, associate-paid long-term disability and company-paid short-term disability insurance and a 401(k) plan to our full-time associates and some of our part-time associates. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our associates to be good.
Seasonality

Our business is subject to seasonal merchandise trends driven by the change in weather conditions and our customers' interest in new seasonal styles. New spring styles are primarily introduced in the first quarter and new fall styles are primarily introduced in the third quarter.
