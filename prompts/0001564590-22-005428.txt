Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We are the only fully integrated biopharmaceutical solutions organization purpose-built to accelerate customer success. We lead with a product development mindset, strategically blending clinical development, medical affairs and commercial capabilities to address modern market realities for customers in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and healthcare industries. We offer both stand-alone and integrated biopharmaceutical product development solutions ranging from early phase (Phase I) clinical trials to the full commercialization of biopharmaceutical products, with the goal of increasing the likelihood of regulatory approval and commercial success while accelerating our customers’ delivery to patients in need worldwide.
 We bring a deep understanding of patient and physician behaviors and market dynamics. Together we share insights, use the latest technologies, and apply advanced business practices to speed our customers’ delivery of important therapies to patients.
 Our operations are divided into two reportable segments, Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions. Our Clinical Solutions segment offers comprehensive global services for the development of diagnostics, drugs, biologics, devices, and digital therapeutics that span Phase I to IV of clinical development. The segment is organized around clinical pharmacology and bioanalytical services, workforce deployment, full-service clinical studies, real world evidence, and consulting. This segment offers individual services including product development and regulatory consulting, project management, protocol development, investigational site recruitment, clinical monitoring, technology-enabled patient recruitment and engagement, clinical home health services, clinical trial diversity, biometrics, and regulatory affairs; all across a comprehensive range of therapeutic areas. Our Commercial Solutions segment provides commercialization services, including deployment solutions, communication solutions (public relations, advertising, and medical communications), and consulting services. We integrate our clinical and commercial capabilities into customized solutions by sharing knowledge, data, and insights. This collaboration across the development and commercialization continuum facilitates unique insights into patient populations, therapeutic environments, product timelines, and the competitive landscape.
 Founded more than three decades ago as an academic organization dedicated to central nervous system (“CNS”) research, we have translated that knowledge into a global organization with deep expertise across a wide range of therapeutic specialties, as well as full data services and regulatory advisory and implementation support capabilities. Over the past decade, we have built our scale and capabilities to become a leading global provider of Phase I to Phase IV clinical development services, as well as a full range of commercialization and other complementary services. We were established as INC Research in 1998, and our corporate headquarters are located in Morrisville, North Carolina. INC Research Holdings, Inc. was incorporated in Delaware in August 2010. We changed our name to Syneos Health, Inc. after our 2017 merger (the “Merger”) with Double Eagle Parent, Inc. (“inVentiv”), the parent company of inVentiv Health, Inc.
 COVID-19 Pandemic
 The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and associated economic repercussions have significantly impacted, and are expected to continue to impact, our business and our operations. With the spread of COVID-19 variants, the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business and results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of the potential continued impact of the pandemic on our business.

Our Market
 The market for our solutions is primarily the biopharmaceutical industry that utilizes outsourced clinical drug and medical device development and commercialization services. We believe we are well-positioned to benefit from the following market trends:
 Trends in clinical drug and medical device development. Biopharmaceutical companies continue to prioritize the outsourcing of Phase I to Phase IV clinical trials to contract research organizations (“CROs”). Several biopharmaceutical industry trends are increasing demand for outsourced research and development services from CROs: 
  
• | Large biopharmaceutical companies (top 50 by prior year research and development (“R&D”) expenditure) rely on CRO relationships in order to remain flexible and efficient as they seek to reduce costs and accelerate development timelines, particularly in complex therapeutic areas such as oncology.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies typically have limited infrastructure and resources, making them more likely to outsource their clinical development. While biotechnology funding in 2021 was lighter than the peak experienced in 2020, the funding environment remains robust relative to historical levels. As a result of this increased funding, emerging biotechnology companies represent a high growth customer segment opportunity within the market.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase IV/post-approval/real world evidence represents an increasing area of spending across all customer segments.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We believe that, based on industry sources and management estimates, the Phase I – IV clinical development market for CRO services will grow at a compound average annual rate of 6% to 8% through 2023, driven by a combination of research and development budget increases and further outsourcing spend. We estimate the total addressable clinical development market to be approximately $105 billion, of which $50 billion was outsourced to CROs in 2021.
 Trends in commercialization outsourcing. We believe that, based on industry sources and management estimates, the market for biopharmaceutical commercial outsourcing will grow at a compound average growth rate of approximately 3% to 5% through 2023. We believe this potential growth is supported by: (i) significant biopharmaceutical sales and marketing budgets; (ii) a continuing shift toward specialty and more complex therapies requiring more complex and integrated sales and marketing execution; (iii) a robust funding environment, which provides capital to fuel development and commercialization spending, particularly for small to mid-sized companies; (iv) the strength of new drug approvals by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in recent years; (v) continued political scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing, which is intensifying pressure for our customers to further reduce fixed costs by outsourcing; and (vi) an evolving industry landscape illustrated by a shift to more strategic relationships, particularly where economies of scale can reduce costs.
 Increasingly challenging clinical development and commercialization environment. The biopharmaceutical industry is currently facing a number of challenges, including: (i) margin deterioration; (ii) reimbursement and provider access hurdles; (iii) fewer blockbuster and high profitability drugs; (iv) continued pressure from generic brand exposure; and (v) the consolidation of payers, healthcare systems, providers, and pharmacies. These challenges also make it more complicated to engage physicians and patients, making new product launches more difficult. At the same time, the industry is experiencing growing demand for specialty drugs, pressure to improve R&D productivity, the transition of the healthcare industry worldwide from a volume-based to a value-based reimbursement structure, and growing political and pricing pressures. Existing approaches to address these challenges include reducing overhead costs,

optimizing the deployment of marketing and field assets, and refocusing product portfolios around therapeutic areas with depth of presence and expanded market access capabilities.
 Optimization of biopharmaceutical R&D efficiency. Market forces and healthcare reform, including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, the 21st Century Cures Act, and other governmental initiatives, place significant pressure on biopharmaceutical companies to improve cost efficiencies. At the same time, the complexity, size, duration, and globalization of clinical trials has increased drug development costs. In an effort to reduce these rising costs, biopharmaceutical companies need to demonstrate a new therapy’s relative improvement in quality, safety, and effectiveness compared to the current standard of care as early as possible in the development process. Outsourcing to CROs allows biopharmaceutical companies to deploy capital more efficiently, quickly benefiting from the CROs’ existing infrastructure and therapeutic expertise without having to continuously scale in-house development resources.
 Globalization of clinical trials. Clinical trials have become increasingly global as biopharmaceutical companies seek to accelerate patient recruitment, particularly within protocol-eligible, treatment-naïve patient populations without co-morbidities that could skew clinical outcomes. Biopharmaceutical companies are also increasingly seeking to expand the commercial potential of their products by applying for regulatory approvals in multiple countries, including fast-growing economies that are spending more on healthcare. As part of the biopharmaceutical approval process in newer markets, especially in certain Asian and emerging markets, regulators now often require clinical trials to include specific percentages or numbers of people from local populations, resulting in a combination of multinational and domestic clinical trials.
 Management of increasingly complex clinical trials. The biopharmaceutical industry operates in an increasingly sophisticated and highly regulated environment and has responded to the demands of novel therapeutics by adapting efficient drug development processes. Complex clinical trial design expertise has emerged as a significant competitive advantage for select CROs that have a track record of successfully navigating country-specific regulatory, clinical trial protocol, and patient enrollment barriers, including sometimes subjective, evolving clinical endpoints. In addition, the therapeutic areas where we have significant experience and expertise, including neuroscience, hematology/oncology, and other complex disease areas, often require more complicated protocols than other disease indications. Many of these studies have longer durations due to these factors, resulting in demand for greater clinical trial proficiency and expertise in these therapeutic areas, particularly in light of new methods such as the use of biomarkers, gene therapy, and digital therapeutics.
 Evolving commercialization outsourcing needs for large versus small to mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies. The needs of large versus small to mid-sized customers are evolving differently based upon their distinct infrastructure and corporate commercialization goals. Large biopharmaceutical companies tend to have robust internal resources and generally are seeking to augment these resources with individual outsourced services on a brand-by-brand basis. Frequently, they are also looking to establish enterprise vendor relationships with volume considerations to support broader cost savings initiatives. Conversely, small to mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies typically have limited product portfolios with fewer internal resources and less commercialization experience. As a result, these companies generally require the full spectrum of commercialization capabilities, what we call full-service commercial solutions. Historically, their only viable commercialization option was to enter into licensing agreements or a divestiture, which often meant surrendering a significant portion of an asset’s long-term economic value. However, with today’s funding environment driving sufficient capital for product launch, we believe these companies are becoming more receptive to commercialization alternatives that allow them to maintain their independence.

Rapid adoption of remote technology-enabled platforms. Accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, we have observed a significant increase in the adoption of remote and digital solutions to facilitate continued healthcare delivery to patients and support to healthcare providers (“HCPs”) for our customers’ products. Technology-enabled, insights-powered site- and patient-centric solutions that have been on the rise include risk-based and remote monitoring, home health, and virtual personal and non-personal outreach to medical facilities and clinics. In light of these trends, we have continued to invest in our Decentralized Solutions and Kinetic capabilities. Decentralized Solutions are designed to speed clinical trial data collection, ease site and patient burden, expand available patient populations, and improve patient diversity. Kinetic is designed to digitally enhance our Commercial Solutions by synchronizing customer engagement across multiple personal and digital channels to provide real-time performance data and intelligence. In addition to investing in our current technologies, we invested in new technology and data capabilities in 2021 through our acquisitions of StudyKIK Corporation (“StudyKIK”) and RxDataScience, Inc. (“RxDataScience”). StudyKIK expands our portfolio of patient-direct, technology-enabled solutions while RxDataScience helps biopharmaceutical customers solve challenging problems through advanced analytics, data management, and artificial intelligence. As adoption of remote technology-enabled platforms increases over the longer term, we believe these capabilities provide an opportunity for improved efficiencies that could help to offset the potential revenue impact from reduced travel and other reimbursable expenses, while improving access to clinical trials and the health of patients worldwide.

Diversified customer base with a growing number of preferred provider relationships. We have a customer base of over 800 customers that includes nearly all of the 50 largest global biopharmaceutical companies (based on annual investment in research and development). Additionally, our customer base is geographically diverse with well-established relationships in the United States (“U.S.”), Europe, and Asia. We have several customers with whom we have achieved “preferred provider” or strategic alliance relationships. We define these customers as relationships from which we generate significant revenue and where we have executed master service agreements in addition to regularly scheduled strategy meetings to discuss the status of our relationship, and for which we serve as a preferred supplier of services. We have also entered into strategic agreements with small to mid-sized (“SMID”) biopharmaceutical companies to develop their full portfolio of products from early clinical development through commercialization. We believe these relationships provide us enhanced opportunities for more business, although they are not a guarantee of future business. Our 2020 acquisition of Synteract further enhanced our leading position for serving customers across the SMID category, diversifying our customer base and expanding support to the high-growth emerging biopharmaceutical segment. We continue to experience strong SMID demand, as evidenced by double-digit growth in our request-for-proposal volumes in 2021 as compared to 2020.

This team has successfully grown our company into a leading biopharmaceutical solutions organization through a combination of organic growth and strategic acquisitions.
 Our Business Strategy
 Our goal is to increase our market share and improve our market position. We believe our end-to-end product development model, where clinical insights inform commercialization and commercial insights improve clinical trial design and execution, is unique to the industry. The key elements of our business strategy include:
 Further penetrate the large pharmaceutical market. We believe one of the largest opportunities to increase our market share and improve our market position is to further penetrate large pharmaceutical companies. Large pharmaceutical companies have increasingly focused on partnering with larger outsourcing vendors that offer a full suite of service capabilities. We have invested in expanding our global scale, breadth of services, and infrastructure to build up our service capabilities for this customer sector.
 Continued penetration of the small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical market. We are a leader in the small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical market, which is the fastest growing segment of the market, and we believe there is further opportunity to grow this segment. Our 2020 acquisition of Synteract further enhanced our leading position for serving SMID customers, diversifying our customer base and expanding support to high-growth emerging biopharmaceutical companies. Small and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies typically have fewer internal resources, less existing infrastructure, and less clinical development and commercialization experience. This customer segment is attracted to our full suite of clinical and commercialization services, our Syneos One® offering, our therapeutic expertise and organizational alignment down to the CRA level, and our Trusted Process® operating model.

Bring differentiated solutions to the market and increase cross-selling opportunities. We believe we are uniquely positioned to address our customers’ evolving needs as the only fully integrated provider of a full suite of services across the product development continuum. Our breadth of services enables us to provide customized solutions designed to successfully accelerate the time to market for our customers’ clinical or commercial projects. We believe sharing commercial insights during the early phases of clinical trials can lead to better informed decisions around clinical trial design and strategies. Similarly, we believe our therapeutic and clinical trial expertise can lead to improved decisions about regulatory and payer approvals, market access, reimbursement and formulary inclusion, field team development, and other steps that are critical to the commercial success of our customers.
 We believe that we have substantial opportunities to expand the reach of services that we provide to our existing customers. Given our past success in expanding the scope of services provided to current customers, we intend to further expand our business with our existing customers by cross-selling additional clinical and commercial services.
 Strengthen our geographic footprint. We have developed a global platform with a presence in all of the major biopharmaceutical markets and intend to further expand our business outside of the U.S., targeting regions where we are underpenetrated and that offer significant growth opportunities. We have expanded our capabilities, existing relationships, and local regulatory knowledge, which we believe will continue to position us well for new customer wins in a wide array of markets. We have added geographic reach through both acquisitions and organic growth in areas such as Asia-Pacific, Latin America, the Middle East and Africa, and Europe, which we believe is critical to obtaining business awards from large and mid-sized biopharmaceutical companies. We may also selectively identify and acquire complementary businesses to enhance our services, capabilities, and geographic presence.
 Capitalize on industry trends favoring outsourcing. Our Clinical Solutions and Commercial Solutions segments are benefiting from specific industry trends that are expected to drive attractive growth rates. Global demand for biopharmaceutical products continues to increase, driven by expanding access to healthcare, increasing life expectancy, and the growing prevalence of chronic conditions in both developed and emerging markets. However, higher costs and increased complexity are driving our customers to seek efficiency and expertise through outsourcing services. We believe outsourcing both clinical development and commercialization services optimizes returns on invested R&D for biopharmaceutical companies. Further, as business models continue to evolve in the healthcare sector, we believe that the rate of commercial outsourcing may follow a similar long-term path as that of the clinical development market.
 Drive acceleration of commercial outsourcing with our Syneos One® offering. We believe regulatory approval is only the first step towards a successful outcome, as our customers cannot earn a positive economic return for their asset until they achieve significant adoption in the commercial marketplace. We believe our Syneos One® offering is uniquely positioned to determine the appropriate mix of clinical and commercial solutions to help customers optimize the development process of their products and maximize the return on their investment. In addition, Syneos One® enables multiple selling points along the operational timeline of product development. The need for a full suite of product development services is particularly strong with our small to mid-sized customers in the near-term, given their increased access to funding to bring a product to the market coupled with their limited internal resources. Large biopharmaceutical companies may represent a long-term opportunity if market pressures to reduce fixed-cost infrastructures further intensify. Given our strong relationships in both customer segments and our breadth of services, including our focus on Medical Affairs, we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on the needs of both customer types.

Government Regulation
 The biopharmaceutical industry is subject to a high degree of governmental regulation in both domestic and international markets. Regardless of the country or region in which approval is being sought, before a marketing application for a drug is ready for submission to regulatory authorities, the candidate drug must undergo rigorous testing in pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. The clinical trial process must be conducted in accordance with the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in the U.S. and similar laws and regulations in the relevant foreign jurisdictions (e.g., the European Union Clinical Trial Regulation). These laws and regulations require the candidate drug to be tested and studied in certain ways prior to submission for approval.
 24
 

Regulation of Our Clinical Solutions Segment
 In the U.S., the FDA regulates the conduct of clinical trials of drug products in human subjects, and the form and content of regulatory applications. The FDA also regulates the development, approval, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, import, export, distribution, advertising, sale, and marketing of drug products. The FDA has similar authority and similar requirements with respect to the clinical testing of biological products and medical devices. In the EU and other jurisdictions where our customers intend to apply for marketing authorization (of drug products) or seek certification (of medical devices), similar laws and regulations apply. Within the EU, these requirements are enforced by the EMA and competent authorities of the EU member states. Additional national requirements vary slightly from one member state to another. In Canada, clinical trials are regulated by the Health Products Food Branch of Health Canada as well as provincial regulations. Similar requirements also apply in other jurisdictions, including Australia, Japan, and other Asian countries, where we operate or where our customers intend to apply for marketing authorization. Sponsors of clinical trials also follow the International Council for Harmonisation (“ICH”) Good Clinical Practice (“GCP”) guidelines, which are enforced by the FDA and other comparable regulatory authorities, and may be amended from time to time. 
 Our services are subject to various regulatory requirements designed to ensure the quality and integrity of the clinical trial process. In the U.S., we must perform our clinical development services in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, including GCP and Good Pharmacovigilance Practice, which govern, among other things, the design, conduct, performance, monitoring, auditing, recording, analysis, and reporting of clinical trials. Before a human clinical trial may begin, the manufacturer or sponsor of the investigational drug or biologic must file an investigational new drug application (“IND”) with the FDA, which contains, among other things, the results of pre-clinical tests, manufacturing information, and other analytical data. A separate submission to an existing IND must also be made for each successive clinical trial conducted during product development. Each clinical trial conducted in the U.S. must be conducted pursuant to, and in accordance with, an effective IND. In addition, under GCP regulations, each human clinical trial we conduct is subject to the oversight of an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) which is an independent committee that has the regulatory authority to review, approve and monitor a clinical trial. The FDA, the IRB, or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the study subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
 Clinical trials conducted outside the U.S. are subject to the laws and regulations of the country where the trials are conducted. These laws and regulations might not be similar to the laws and regulations administered by the FDA and other laws and regulations regarding the protection of patient safety and privacy and the control of study pharmaceuticals, medical devices or other study materials. Studies conducted outside the U.S. can also be subject to regulation by the FDA if the studies are conducted pursuant to an IND, or in the case of a medical device, an investigational device exemption. It is the responsibility of the study sponsor or the parties conducting the studies to ensure that all applicable legal and regulatory requirements are fulfilled.
 In order to comply with GCP and other regulations, we must, among other things:
  
• | comply with specific requirements governing the selection of qualified principal investigators and clinical research sites;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain specific written commitments from principal investigators;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain review, approval, and supervision of the clinical trials by an IRB or ethics committee;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain favorable opinion from regulatory agencies to commence a clinical trial;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | verify that appropriate patient informed consents are obtained before the patient participates in a clinical trial;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 25
 

 
• | ensure that adverse drug reactions resulting from the administration of a drug or biologic during a clinical trial are medically evaluated and reported in a timely manner;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | monitor the validity and accuracy of data;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | monitor drug, biologic or device accountability at clinical research sites; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | verify that principal investigators and study staff maintain records and reports and permit appropriate governmental authorities access to data for review.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Similar regulations and guidelines exist in various states and in other countries. In the EU, similarly to the U.S., the various phases of non-clinical and clinical research are subject to significant regulatory controls. Clinical trials of medicinal products must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the ICH guidelines on GCP, as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of a clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. 
 
The regulatory landscape related to clinical trials in the EU has been subject to recent changes. The EU Clinical Trials Regulation (“CTR”), which was adopted in April 2014 and repeals the EU Clinical Trials Directive, became applicable on January 31, 2022. Unlike directives, the CTR is directly applicable in all EU member states, as well as Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, without the need for member states to further implement it into national law. The CTR notably harmonizes the assessment and supervision processes for clinical trials throughout the EU via a Clinical Trials Information System, which contains a centralized EU portal and database. 
 The United Kingdom (“UK”) left the EU on January 31, 2020, following which existing EU medicinal product legislation continued to apply in the UK during the transition period under the terms of the EU-UK Withdrawal Agreement. As of January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) is the UK’s standalone medicines and medical devices regulator. MHRA seeks to amend the UK Medical Devices Regulations 2002 (which are based on EU legislation), in particular to create new access pathways to support innovation, create an innovative framework for regulating software and artificial intelligence as medical devices, reform in vitro diagnostics regulation, and foster sustainability through the reuse and remanufacture of medical devices. The new regime is expected to come into force in July 2023, coinciding with the end of the acceptance period for EU CE marks in Great Britain, subject to appropriate transitional arrangements.
 We may be subject to regulatory action if we fail to comply with applicable rules and regulations. Failure to comply with certain regulations can also result in the termination of ongoing research and disqualification of data collected during the clinical trials. For example, violations of GCP could result, depending on the nature of the violation and the type of product involved, in the issuance of a warning letter, suspension or termination of a clinical study, refusal of the FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities to approve clinical trial or marketing applications or withdrawal of such applications, injunction, seizure of investigational products, civil penalties, criminal prosecutions, or debarment from assisting in the submission of new drug applications. See Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – If we fail to perform our services in accordance with contractual requirements, regulatory requirements, and ethical considerations, we could be subject to significant costs or liability and our reputation could be harmed.”
 We monitor our clinical trials to test for compliance with applicable laws and regulations in the U.S and the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. We have adopted standard operating procedures that are designed to satisfy regulatory requirements and serve as a mechanism for controlling and enhancing the quality of our clinical trials. In the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate, our procedures were developed to ensure compliance with GCP and associated guidelines.
 26
 

In addition to its comprehensive regulation of safety in the workplace, the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers whose workers might be exposed to blood-borne pathogens such as HIV and the hepatitis virus. Furthermore, certain employees might have to receive initial and periodic training to ensure compliance with applicable hazardous materials regulations and health and safety guidelines. We are subject to similar regulations in Canada and Spain.
 Regulation of Our Commercial Solutions Segment
 The safety of medicines continues to be monitored after drug product approvals and throughout their use in healthcare practice. Post-marketing safety surveillance is therefore also subject to FDA regulations as well as the EU Pharmacovigilance Legislation and other countries’ regulations.
 In addition, our field personnel are subject to all laws, rules and regulations governing the promotion of pharmaceutical products in the U.S. and in every other country where such personnel perform work. In particular, these rules and regulations include limitations on the indications for which a product may be promoted and on promotional spending. Additionally, these laws, rules and regulations govern the manner in which the product may be promoted, and the scientific exchange of information related to the product. Violations of these rules may leave us at risk of direct regulatory enforcement action and/or cause us to be in breach of contract with our customers.
 Some of our field personnel handle and distribute samples of pharmaceutical products. In the U.S., the handling and distribution of prescription drug product samples are subject to regulation under the Prescription Drug Marketing Act and other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations and other countries may have similar laws or regulations. These laws and regulations regulate the distribution of drug samples by mandating procedures for storage and record-keeping requirements for drug samples and ban the purchase or sale of drug samples. Further, we must comply with the requirements of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which regulates the distribution, record-keeping, handling, security, and disposal of controlled substances.
 Our communications solutions offerings are subject to all regulatory risks applicable to similar communications businesses as well as risks that relate specifically to the provision of these services to the biopharmaceutical industry. Such regulatory risks include enforcement by the FDA and the Federal Trade Commission in the U.S., Health Canada, the Department of Health in the UK, competent authorities of the EU member states, as well as state agencies and other foreign regulators enforcing laws relating to product advertising, false advertising, and unfair and deceptive trade practices. In addition to enforcement actions initiated by government agencies, there has been an increasing tendency in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions among biopharmaceutical companies to resort to the courts and industry and self-regulatory bodies to challenge comparative prescription drug advertising on the grounds that the advertising is false and deceptive. There continues to be an expansion of specific rules, prohibitions, media restrictions, labeling disclosures, and warning requirements with respect to the advertising for certain products.

Data Protection Regulation
 We are subject to data protection laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate that address the privacy, security and other processing of personal information. These laws and regulations govern the collection, use, handling and disclosure of health-related and other personal information and require that we adopt and maintain reasonable and appropriate security measures that are designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of the information. These laws and regulations also typically require the adoption and maintenance of procedures that facilitate the exercise of an individual’s rights with respect to the information about them. Certain of these laws may also contain requirements relating to the location of the personal information, or the transfer of personal information from one country or region to other countries. Examples of data protection laws and regulations to which we may be subject include Canada’s Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), and the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”). For additional information regarding these laws and regulations and their potential impacts on our business, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors – Risks Related to Our Business – Current and proposed laws and regulations regarding the protection of personal data could result in increased risks of liability or increased cost to us or could limit our service offerings.”
Intellectual Property
 We develop and use a number of proprietary methodologies, analytics, systems, technologies, and other intellectual property in the conduct of our business. We rely upon a combination of confidentiality policies, nondisclosure agreements, and other contractual arrangements to protect our trade secrets, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect other intellectual property rights. We have obtained or applied for patents, trademarks and copyright protection in the U.S. and in a number of foreign countries. Our material trademarks include Trusted Process®, PlanActivation®, QuickStart®, ProgramAccelerate®, QualityFinish®, Shortening the distance from lab to life®, Syneos One®, Biopharmaceutical Acceleration Model®, Dynamic Assembly®, KineticTM, Syneos Health, and other corporate emblems. Although the duration of our intellectual property rights varies from country to country, trademarks generally may be renewed indefinitely so long as they are in use and/or their registrations are properly maintained, and so long as they have not been found to have become generic. Although we believe that the ownership of trademarks is an important factor in our business and that our success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, we rely primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of our employees. We do not have any material patents, licenses, franchises, or concessions.
Human Capital Resources 
 As of December 31, 2021, we had 27,525 employees. Of these, 26,751 employees were regular and 774 were temporary. An additional 610 contingent workers provided services for us.
 Our Culture and Values. Our culture is the cornerstone of all our human capital programs. Our shared purpose, Shortening the Distance from Lab to Life®, aligns our employees and the customers we serve. This purpose is surrounded by three agile-oriented values, designed to foster innovation, including Challenge the Status Quo, Collaborate to Deliver Solutions, and Passionate to Change Lives. We work hard and smart to speed much-needed therapies to those who need them most. This environment is fueled by a belief in caring for our collective well-being, which we refer to as Total Self. This belief enables employees to be their authentic selves at work, fostering a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture where employees are empowered.
 28
 

Safety and Health. The safety, health, and welfare of our employees are paramount to us. We work closely with our customers and regulatory agencies to continuously monitor our employees’ working conditions and implement measures to ensure their wellness. During 2021, in response to the ongoing COVID‑19 pandemic, we continued extensive safety measures to protect our employees, enabling the organization to continue to work with customers pursuing innovative ways to get effective therapies to patients as quickly as possible. These efforts included a U.S. employee vaccination mandate, adherence to stringent safety protocols for employees working at clinical study sites, and compliance with local government regulations. These efforts were further supported by extensive internal and external CEO-led communications supported by our medical community, making all stakeholders aware of the precautions taken to protect the health and safety of our employees and their families, our customers, patients, and communities.
 Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (“DE&I”). We strive to lead our industry in our DE&I efforts both internally and externally. We believe that addressing complex healthcare challenges requires contributions from diverse viewpoints and an inclusive, equitable space where our employees are able to succeed to their highest potential. We strive to foster a work environment that includes and embraces racial, ethnic, and gender diversity and other individual differences. Our policies prohibit unlawful discrimination based on race, color, creed, gender, religion, marital status, age, national origin or ancestry, genetic information, physical or mental disability, medical condition, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, or any other characteristic protected by applicable law. The emphasis placed on DE&I by the Company and by our Board of Directors (the “Board”) is demonstrated by the inclusion of DE&I updates and metrics in the materials for each meeting of the Compensation and Management Development Committee of the Board. In addition, we have also created an external DE&I Advisory Council where we provide our clients with top-tier expertise to navigate corporate and healthcare initiatives.
 As of December 31, 2021, 68% of our total workforce were women. Additionally, 56% of our management roles at Director level and above and 69% of our new hires in 2021 were women. Throughout 2021, 33% of our new hires in the U.S. were minorities. Our DE&I strategy is enabled by our DE&I Council, which was established in 2020, led by an executive leadership team member and comprised of leadership who represent and/or have oversight of our global, regionally diverse workforce. The Council oversees and strategically plans for diversity and inclusion within our Company under three pillars of focus: People, Customer, and Community. 
 Throughout 2021, we grew our existing Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) across the globe: Women, Veterans, LGBTQIA+ and Black. We also formed three new ERGs: Asian, People with Disabilities, and Developing Professionals. These ERGs further honor and support our inclusive environment of Total Self through building and supporting internal communities. We also have several development programs dedicated to women and minority representation in leadership, including actively partnering with the Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association, partnering with McKinsey Leadership programs targeting our underrepresented leadership populations, and establishing mentoring programs within our ERGs. We have a zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and harassment and have several programs under which employees can report incidents confidentially or anonymously and without fear of reprisal. 
 Recruitment, Retention and Development. The primary ways we recruit and retain employees are by (1) ensuring that our compensation and benefits are competitive in our industry and in local labor markets, (2) ensuring our leadership and development programs support our culture and values while preparing people for the future, and (3) maintaining an effective service delivery model conducive to work-life balance and employee needs. 
 Our Global Talent Acquisition Team leverages numerous resources including industry networks, online and social media platforms, university relations, and industry-focused career events to source talent for open positions. Candidates are thoroughly screened and evaluated against job-specific skills, experience, and education criteria. We continuously work at improving our candidate experience, which has been recognized seven years in a row with a North American Candidate Experience (“CandE”) Award, awarded by the Talent Board for excellence in Talent Acquisition.
 29
 

In early 2021 we dedicated a small group of professionals, reporting to the Chief Human Resources Officer and the Chief Development Officer & Global Head Clinical Development Solutions, to focus on increased demand for clinical resources with an ultimate focus on our talent acquisition and retention strategies. This small and impactful team, called Enabling our Talent Advantage, or “ETA” is imbedded in the business and Human Resources (“HR”) organizations and focuses on talent optimization. Going beyond simply hiring replacements and additions, this team works with business leaders and our HR Centers of Excellence to refine policies, practices, and procedures to make it easier to join, work, and stay at Syneos Health. Examples of ETA initiatives include improving our internal mobility policy, developing feeder pools for key roles in support of our early talent strategy, and developing a line manager curriculum to better and more simply equip managers to support our workforce.  
 We regularly evaluate our compensation and benefit programs using external market data and feedback from our Global Talent Acquisition Team and have established processes to make necessary revisions. Our Total Rewards Team introduced a new global salary structure to drive consistent enterprise-wide compensation and job level practices, ensuring our compensation remains competitive in the many countries in which our employees reside.
 Developing Our People for Current and Future Success. We are a continuous learning organization, listening to employees at all levels – particularly at key moments that matter – and harvesting actionable insights to shape the employee experience. Key elements of our listening strategy include purposeful pulse surveys designed to check on key audiences at key moments. Overall, our listening includes our employee engagement survey and regular employee life cycle surveys, including onboarding (following the first week and at 90 days of employment) and exit surveys. Ultimately, we leverage these insights to better enable our employee programs and services. 
 We offer extensive, award-winning training programs that provide regulatory, business, foreign language, and management training and other opportunities for professional and personal development. As part of our empowered employee experience, we offer a suite of tools to assist employees to proactively own their careers and aim to reach their highest professional potential. These opportunities include a mix of company-wide, role-based or business-specific individualized courses and programs to drive career development. As an organization with solutions spanning Clinical and Commercial as well as numerous corporate functions, we encourage internal mobility to support retention.
 Ensuring Competence and Qualification. Syneos Health is the only organization to have achieved the prestigious and internationally recognized Silver Workforce Accreditation from the International Accrediting Organization for Clinical Research in 2020. We offer credentialed, competency-based training programs for clinical monitoring employees to provide customers and investors with confidence that our CRAs are trained to a high standard. Credentials are available at all levels, including entry level (CRA I), intermediate (CRA II), and advanced (Senior CRAs).
 Specific training highlights for 2021 include the design of our Business Leader Program, built by some of our leaders for fellow senior leaders across the Company. The program lasts six months and features executive coaching, customized simulation trainings, cohort leader labs, and assessments against a newly developed Syneos Health Great Leader profile. Our Great Leader profile attracts, retains, and develops diverse talent, creates and maintains strong customer relationships, instills a sense of ownership and accountability, leads using a growth and enterprise mindset, and balances strategic thinking with execution. 
 30
 

Our pipeline leadership programs for aspiring, first-line, experienced, and senior managers now center around our Great Leader profile and these programs cover every step in a manager’s journey. These programs are accessible to all employees to develop and enhance their leadership skills and are purposely designed to support each person to meet their unique development and career needs. One of our values is “Collaborate to Deliver Solutions,” which encourages employees to learn from the expertise of their peers and to share knowledge and experience with colleagues using self-service coaching and mentoring, utilizing software to support mentoring and innovative reverse mentoring programs.
 Indemnification and Insurance
 In conjunction with our Clinical Solutions services, we employ or contract with research institutions and, in some jurisdictions, principal investigators and pharmacies on behalf of biopharmaceutical companies to serve as research centers and principal investigators in conducting clinical trials to test new candidate drugs on human volunteers. Such testing creates the risk of liability for personal injury or death of volunteers, particularly to volunteers with life-threatening illnesses, resulting from adverse reactions to the candidate drugs administered. It is possible that we could be held liable for claims and expenses arising from any professional malpractice of the principal investigators with whom we contract or engage, or in the event of personal injury to or death of persons participating in clinical trials. In addition, as a result of our operation of Phase I clinical trial facilities, we could be liable for the general risks associated with clinical trials including, but not limited to, adverse events resulting from the administration of candidate drugs to clinical trial participants or the professional malpractice of medical care providers. We also could be held liable for errors or omissions in connection with the services we perform through each of our service groups. For example, we could be held liable for errors, omissions, or breach of contract, if monitoring obligations have been transferred to us and one of our CRA’s inaccurately reports from source documents or fails to adequately monitor a human clinical trial resulting in inaccurately recorded results.
 We have sought to reduce our risks by implementing the following where practicable:
  
• | securing contractual assurances such as indemnification provisions and provisions seeking to limit or exclude liability contained in our contracts with customers, institutions, pharmacies, vendors and principal investigators;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | securing contractual and other assurances that adequate insurance will be maintained to the extent applicable by customers, institutions, pharmacies, vendors, principal investigators and us; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | complying with various regulatory requirements, including monitoring that the oversight of independent review boards and ethics committees are intact where obligations are transferred to us and monitoring the oversight of the procurement by the principal investigator of each participant’s informed consent to participate in the study.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Our contractual indemnifications generally do not fully protect us against certain of our own actions, such as negligence. Contractual arrangements are subject to negotiation with customers, and the terms and scope of any indemnification, limitation of liability or exclusion of liability varies from customer to customer and from clinical trial to clinical trial. Additionally, financial performance of these indemnities is not secured. Therefore, we bear the risk that any indemnifying party against which we have claims may not have the financial ability to fulfill its indemnification obligations to us.
 31
 

While we maintain a global insurance program including professional liability and other types of insurance standard to our industry to cover our liability while conducting our business activities and contracted services, including drug safety issues as well as data processing and other errors and omissions, it is possible that we could become subject to claims not covered by insurance or that exceed our coverage limits. We could be materially and adversely affected if we were required to pay damages or bear the costs of defending any claim that is outside the scope of, or in excess of, a contractual indemnification provision, beyond the level of insurance coverage or not covered by insurance, or in the event that an indemnifying party does not fulfill its indemnification obligations.
