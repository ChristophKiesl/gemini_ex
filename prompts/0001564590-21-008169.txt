Corporate 
 Our Corporate segment consists of unallocated general and administrative activities and associated expenses including, in part, executive, legal, finance, communications, certain facility costs and last-in-first-out inventory provisions. In addition, certain costs and earnings of employee benefit plans, such as pension and other postretirement benefits (“OPEB”) plan expense (income) and share-based compensation, are included in Corporate and not allocated to the operating segments. Corporate also manages our cash pooling structures, which enables participating international locations to draw on our international cash resources to meet local liquidity needs. 
 Business Dispositions 
 During 2020, we completed our plan to exit our Logistics Business. The business included Print Logistics, which was disposed of on July 2, 2018; Courier Logistics, which was disposed of on March 2, 2020; DLS Worldwide, which was disposed of on November 2, 2020; and International Logistics which was disposed of on November 3, 2020. These businesses were included in the Business Services segment and primarily provided logistics services to a broad range of clients in the United States and globally.
 On October 25, 2019, we completed the sale of substantially all of the Global Document Solutions (“GDS”) business within the Business Services segment. GDS primarily provided statements and print management services in Europe. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we sold the R&D business and our subsidiary, RR Donnelley Editora e Grafica Ltda. (“RRD Brazil”), filed for bankruptcy liquidation in bankruptcy court in Brazil. The operations of these three businesses were included in the Business Services segment. 
Markets
 The print and related services industry, in general, continues to have excess capacity and remains highly competitive and fragmented. Our clients operate in an evolving and ever-changing market. While the market is large and fragmented, there are tremendous changes occurring in how organizations need to create, manage, deliver and measure their communications. Some of the key factors facing our clients include regulatory changes, sensitivity to economic conditions, raw material pricing volatility and United States Postal Service (“USPS”) actions. In addition, technological changes, including the electronic distribution of documents and data, online distribution and hosting of media content, and advances in digital printing, print-on-demand and internet technologies, continue to impact the market for many of our products and services. 
 We believe that, across our range of products and services, competition is based primarily on quality and the ability to service the special needs of clients at a competitive price. Therefore, we believe we need to continue to differentiate our product and service offerings and aggressively manage our cost structure to remain competitive. Our business is differentiated by the wide array of quality communications products and services, including print and content management, we provide for our clients. We work with our clients to create, manage, deliver and optimize their multichannel communications strategies by providing innovative solutions to meet increasing customer demands in light of the large and evolving marketplace. We also continue to develop our creative and design, content management, digital and print production, supply chain management and distribution services to address our clients’ evolving needs while supporting the strategic objective of becoming a leading global provider of integrated communication products and services.
 Refer to Part 1 Item 1A “Risk Factors” and Part 11 Item 7 ‑Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for additional information regarding the impact of COVID-19 on our business.
 Seasonality 
 Advertising and consumer spending trends affect demand in several of the end-markets we serve. As such, we have some seasonality in our business, mostly in the second half of the year, despite the breadth of our product and service offerings.
Resources 
 The primary raw materials we use in our print businesses are paper and ink. We negotiate with leading suppliers to maximize our purchasing efficiencies. Some of the paper we use is supplied directly by clients. Variations in the cost and supply of certain paper grades and ink formulations used in the manufacturing process may affect our consolidated financial results. Paper prices have fluctuated over the past few years and we expect continued volatility in the foreseeable future. Generally, clients directly absorb the impact of changing prices on client-supplied paper. With respect to paper we purchase, we have historically passed most changes in price through to our clients although in many cases there is a delay based on terms within individual client contracts. We believe contractual arrangements and industry practice will support our continued ability to pass on any future paper price increases, but there is no assurance that market conditions will continue to enable us to successfully do so. We believe that the paper supply is consolidating, and there may be shortfalls in the future in supplies necessary to meet the demands of the entire marketplace. Higher paper prices and tight paper supplies may have an impact on clients’ demand for printed products. We have undertaken various strategic initiatives to mitigate any foreseeable supply disruptions with respect to our paper and ink requirements.
 5


We continue to monitor the impact of changes in the price of crude oil and other energy costs, which impact our ink suppliers and manufacturing costs. Crude oil, energy prices and market cost of transportation continue to be volatile. We generally cannot pass on to clients the impact of higher energy prices on our manufacturing costs. We cannot predict sudden changes in energy prices and the impact that possible future changes in energy prices might have upon either future operating costs or client demand or the related impact either will have on our consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
 We do not believe that our business is dependent upon any single patent or group of patents. We actively monitor the registrations of our trademark and patent portfolio to ensure that our intellectual property is appropriately protected and maintained.
 Distribution 
 Our products are distributed to end-users through U.S. and foreign postal services, through retail channels, electronically or by direct shipment to client facilities. In cooperation with trusted logistics vendors, we manage the distribution of most client products we print in the U.S. and Canada to maximize efficiency and reduce costs for clients.
 As a leading mail service provider of both First-Class and Marketing mail, we are ranked by the USPS as one of the largest preparers of mailings in the U.S. We work closely with our clients and the USPS to offer innovative products and mail preparation services to minimize postage costs. 
 In accordance with the 2006 Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act (“PAEA”), the Postal Regulatory Commission (“PRC”) adjusted and approved USPS filings for a CPI based average price increase of 1.5% to 1.9% depending on the major class of mail. The new prices took effect on January 26, 2020. 
 On November 18, 2020, the PRC approved a USPS filing for a CPI based average price increase of 1.5% on average for the high volume mail classes, which become effective January 24, 2021. 
 Additionally, as required on the 10-year anniversary of PAEA, the PRC initiated a comprehensive review of PAEA on December 20, 2016, to determine if the current system for regulating rates and classes for market-dominant products is still achieving the original objectives of the law. Accordingly, the PRC concluded that the current system was not meeting all of PAEA’s original objectives and after careful consideration of mailing industry stakeholder input, issued its final order on November 30, 2020. The final PRC order provides the USPS with additional discretionary rate-making authority, above CPI, estimated at 5.5 %, that could be partially divided and used during 2021 and/or 2022. 
 While we do not directly absorb the impact of higher postal rates on our clients’ mailings, demand for products distributed through the U.S. or foreign postal services has been negatively impacted by increases in postal rates, as postal costs are a significant component of many clients’ cost structures.
 Clients
 We have approximately 30,000 clients worldwide, including 94% of the Fortune 100, 82% of the Fortune 500 and 71% of the Fortune 1000. Our products and services enable some of the world’s largest companies to create, manage and deliver comprehensive and cost-effective multi-channel communications around the world. For each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, no single client accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales.
 Cybersecurity 
 Our cybersecurity program is designed for needs and expectations of our clients who entrust us with highly sensitive information. Furthermore, our healthcare and insurance printing businesses are subject to industry-specific data regulations, including the Health Care Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which could subject us and our clients to liability should sensitive customer or patient information be publicly disclosed. Our infrastructure and technology, highly-trained global workforce and comprehensive security and compliance program enable us to safely process, store and protect customer information in compliance with relevant regulations. 
 Our infrastructure and technology security capabilities are bolstered by our relationship with a leading data center services provider. Furthermore, our networks are monitored by intrusion detection services around the clock, and our systems and applications are routinely tested for vulnerabilities and are operated under a strict patch management program. 
 We employ a highly skilled IT workforce to implement our cybersecurity programs and to handle specific security responsibilities. As a result of annual mandatory security awareness training, our IT workforce is trained to address security and compliance-related issues as they arise. Additionally, our IT employees are carefully screened, undergo a thorough background check and are bound by a nondisclosure agreement that details such employee’s security and legal responsibilities with regard to information handling.

Government Regulations
It is our policy to conduct our global operations in accordance with all applicable laws, regulations and other requirements. It is not possible to quantify with certainty the impact of potential failures regarding our compliance with these laws and regulations, including environmental matters and resulting remediation and other compliance efforts that we may undertake in the future. However, in our opinion, compliance with present environmental protection laws, before taking into account estimated recoveries from third parties, will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated annual results of operations, financial position or cash flows. 
 Human Capital
RRD’s approximately 33,000 employees worldwide represent our most important asset.  We are committed to prioritizing a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace which allows us to attract and, importantly, retain high quality talent.  Our laser focus on the health and safety of our employees helps us to maintain our qualified workforce and develop leaders for the future.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
 
We are committed to diversity, equity and inclusion from the membership of the Board of Directors through all layers of our employee ranks.  Women represent 50% of our independent directors on the Board of Directors and 25% of our executive leadership team. Our priorities, and the signing of the Parity Pledge in 2017 reflect our commitment to increasing the percentage of women in leadership roles across our company.
 
We are also focused on representation by historically underrepresented groups including, racial minorities and LGBTQ employees in our U.S. businesses.  We are committed to diversifying our workforce and increasing representation of all underrepresented groups in our Board and leadership teams.  
 
In 2020, we launched a new committee, the purpose of which is to focus on and formalize diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives for the Company, communicate broadly, and ensure that every employee feels respected and appreciated and can contribute to their fullest potential.  
 
To ensure its continued focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, executive team members are expected to consider at least one woman and one racial/ethnic minority in hiring for open positions on their teams.  The Board receives ongoing updates on these priorities as well as on the hiring by the executive leadership team.
 
Pay Equity
 
We are committed to paying employees equally for like work, at like levels, in like geographical areas, with similar years of experience, regardless of an employee’s gender, race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, or other personal characteristics.  We have reviewed a variety of positions to ensure pay equity and made adjustments where needed. We regularly review our compensation process and, at this time, we have not identified any specific, significant systemic issues in our compensation process.
Employee Engagement
 
In 2020, we were diligent in surveying our employees throughout the impact of COVID-19 to ensure that employees understood what resources were available to them, how to request assistance (including through our Employee Assistance Program), and how to navigate novel work environments in an unprecedented year. On the whole, the organization pivoted efficiently and without significant issues.  Within our manufacturing facilities, our employees were deemed essential nearly across the globe, which kept our employees working throughout the pandemic.  As such, when COVID-19 hit our facilities in the U.S. and abroad, we immediately implemented rigorous cleaning procedures, mandated the wearing of masks, and required physical distancing where possible. If an employee disclosed a positive COVID-19 test, we deep cleaned areas the employee had visited and engaged in contact tracing.
 
Because of our successful performance and the extraordinary engagement of our essential employees, in December 2020, we were able to pay a year-end bonus to employees not otherwise eligible for a bonus. This employee group included full-time hourly workers, managers, supervisors, facility workers and other non-sales employees who are not eligible for the annual incentive plan or commissions that are available to certain managers, directors, vice presidents and other executives.
 
We also maintain a robust open door process to capture, investigate and timely respond to employee concerns.  Throughout 2020, we listened carefully as employees raised new issues during these unprecedented times and responded with due speed.
 
Finally, we provided our workforce with engagement opportunities through our Global Women’s Business Resource Group, inclusion councils, and dialogues hosted by our diversity, equity and inclusion leadership team.

Training and Development
 
A critical component of our investment in our employees is the provision of virtual and self-directed learning and development.  This training covers topics from sexual harassment prevention, ADA awareness, IT security and a wide variety of anti-corruption and compliance programs.  In 2020, 99.9% of employees completed their required training.
 
In addition to compliance related training, we also offer leadership and job skills training in order to continue to grow and develop our diverse workforce.
 
Health and Safety
 
As a manufacturing company, operations in our facilities continue to represent our greatest safety and health risks for our employees.  Managing and mitigating risks at our facilities is the top priority for the executive team and every employee around the world.  Safety has routinely been a part of our performance metrics for leadership in our facilities and one indicator of success in this area is our recordable case rate, for which we have maintained at the lowest level since becoming a stand-alone company in 2016.  
 
The COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the business community and our Company in 2020. We established a COVID-19 Task Force of leaders from facility operations, EHS, human resources, legal, finance and other business leaders.  The Task Force has monitored guidance of the CDC and WHO on management of viral spread, implemented policies and procedures consistent with CDC and WHO guidance to ensure the health and safety of our employees, investigated and monitored cases of the virus within the Company, and implemented extraordinary cleaning efforts if exposure concerns arose.  The proactive measures taken helped minimize viral spread within our employee population throughout 2020.
