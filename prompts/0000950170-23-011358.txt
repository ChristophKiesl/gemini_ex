 Item 1. Business
 Unless we state otherwise or the context otherwise requires, the terms "we," "us," "our," "Thorne," "the Company," "our business," "our company" refer to Thorne HealthTech, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries as a combined entity. Adjusted EBITDA, as used herein, is a non-GAAP measure. For a detailed description of Adjusted EBITDA, please see the discussion under "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Financial and Operating Data - Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margin."
 Our Purpose
We believe that a personalized and scientific approach to wellness can lead to happier and healthier lives. Our goal is to transform the consumer’s approach to health and wellness and empower our customers to live healthier longer through testing, teaching and proactive measures that help to achieve peak performance and avoid chronic health conditions before they occur.
Who We Are
Thorne is a science-driven wellness company developing innovative solutions for a personalized approach to health and wellness. We seek to bring the scientific rigor of biopharma to the prevention space to help people live longer, healthier lives.Our unique, vertically integrated brands, Thorne and Onegevity, provide actionable insights and personalized data, products and services that empower individuals to take a proactive approach to improve and maintain their health over their lifetime. By combining our proprietary multi-omics database, artificial intelligence (AI) and digital health content with our science-backed nutritional supplements, we deliver a total system for wellness. We believe our integrated solution will redefine the expectations for good health.
Founded in 1984, Thorne Research was a small company dedicated to being a “thorn” in the side of the traditional supplement industry by making the purest and highest quality nutritional supplements to sell to health professionals. With a vision for an unparalleled health ecosystem fueled by innovation and technology, our current Chief Executive Officer, Paul Jacobson, and his management team acquired Thorne Research in 2010 and co-founded Onegevity in 2018. In early 2021, we completed our acquisition of Onegevity and combined these two complementary companies. During the past 12 years, we have evolved to become a transformative consumer brand, trusted by more than 5 million customers, 47,000 healthcare professionals, thousands of professional athletes, more than 100 professional sports teams and multiple U.S. Olympic teams.
We utilize testing and data to create improved product quality and deliver personalized solutions to consumers, health professionals and professional sports teams. We also help pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies repurpose existing drugs and compounds, improve existing medications, and develop new products. Today, consumers are faced with a healthcare system that is focused on the treatment of disease rather than a proactive approach to health and wellness. The supplement market is crowded with confusing products that lack clinical validation or brand equity. We have positioned our brands as a paradigm shift from a focus on the treatment of disease to a proactive approach to health and wellness. The benefits of focusing on health can include enhanced performance in daily life, longer health spans, younger biological ages and reduced reliance on the healthcare system and its associated costs. We have developed a subscription platform that seamlessly combines convenient and comprehensive testing methods, proprietary data, personalized wellness education and premium nutritional solutions to focus on the human body and its unique needs. Through our platform of innovative health solutions and proprietary technology, we are building a new category within the health and wellness market.
Our total addressable market consists of the $358.8 billion global nutritional supplement market (as of 2021 and projected to have a CAGR of 6.3% through 2030 , according to Grand View Research), the $195.1 billion global digital health market (as of 2021 and projected to have a CAGR of 16.1% through 2030, according to FNF Research), the $75.0 billion global drug discovery market (as of 2021 and projected to have a CAGR of 8.9% through 2030, according to Precedence Research) and the $67.3 billion global clinical testing market (as of 2021 and projected to have a CAGR of 6.3% through 2030, according to Straits Research).
Our novel approach seeks to resolve key pain points in the consumer health journey. Our model of test, teach, transform and iterate ensures that consumers are not only active participants in their healthcare, but are also educated and empowered to navigate an overwhelming nutritional supplement marketplace. We help individuals answer the question “what do I take and why?” and are able to personalize nutritional supplement recommendations and protocols because we understand there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Our relentless focus on building a new model of health has resulted in a robust portfolio of science-driven products and high customer satisfaction, as demonstrated by our favorable Net Promoter Score (NPS) of 69 during the year ended December 31, 2022. Our success is not limited to the U.S. market; our Thorne brand was sold in 29 countries in 2022, and we expect to continue to expand internationally.

Our unique go-to-market strategy combines our direct-to-consumer (DTC) and subscription model with an ecosystem of health professionals. We provide customers with direct access to our brand through our mobile, web and Amazon channels. In addition to the DTC channel, our broad range of connected health professionals provides another channel for our products to be marketed and distributed to consumers. We have built our active and growing network to more than 47,000 health professionals, which includes medical doctors, naturopathic doctors, registered dieticians, pharmacists, chiropractors, nutritionists, trainers, acupuncturists and other accredited health professionals.
Thorne: Thorne provides health tests, education, and products that support the optimization of health. We offer health tests to generate comprehensive, personalized molecular portraits for our customers. Our proprietary multi-omics platform, Onegevity, uses the results of these tests to create personalized recommendations, which we believe provide individuals with greater conviction about what actions they need to take, such as consulting with their physician or nutritionist, making a lifestyle change, or using nutritional supplements. All of our tests are performed by reputable third-party clinical laboratories, and the test results and Onegevity-powered AI actionable insights are reviewed by board-certified physicians prior to being delivered to the customer through our website and app.
We have developed premium, high-quality nutritional supplements through our trusted brand, Thorne. We believe that we have established industry leading sourcing, production and testing standards, which are designed to meet or exceed U.S. and international current Good Manufacturing Practice requirements (cGMPs), all of which are subject to third-party certification and audit. We manage nearly all product formulations, ingredients, production processes, documentation, testing and product activities at our facility in Summerville, South Carolina. Our distinguished science and medical teams are advancing an innovative pipeline of products, including a series of next-generation products with nicotinamide riboside (NR), a compound involved in cellular metabolism, which we believe contains properties that support healthy aging at the cellular level.
Health Intelligence: Health Intelligence combines Onegevity's AI and data with professional assistance to map, integrate and understand the billions of dynamic biological features that precisely describe the state of an individual’s health. The platform can be used by customers to manage their own health, and by practitioners and professionals to support patient health and advance their scope of practice. The platform can also be used in the research and development of nutritional supplements and pharmaceuticals by business-to-business (B2B) customers.
Our fast-growing and scaling wellness platform has experienced significant recent growth. Our compelling financial profile is characterized by accelerated year-over-year sales growth, including a focus on steady profitable growth, efficient customer acquisition and strong customer retention.

Recent Developments
Nutrativa Acquisition. In February 2022, we completed the acquisition of Nutrativa LLC (Nutrativa), a company leveraging two-dimensional high-speed printing technology that provides healthier, environmentally superior alternatives to traditional beverages and gummies via dissolvable supplement discs. Following the acquisition, we launched our dissolvable supplement disc product line, beginning with a comprehensive daily multi-vitamin for children. We have also entered into a partnership agreement to produce the supplement discs for private label. We intend to further deploy the innovative technology to address consumer needs in a more sustainable manner and to expand our portfolio of products and services to new health areas and markets.
OneDraw Blood Collection Device (OneDraw). OneDraw is currently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a Class II medical device and has a European Conformity mark for supervised use by health-care professionals to collect blood samples to measure HbA1c for monitoring the long-term control of blood sugar in diabetic individuals. In May 2022, we reported the results of a large-scale surveillance study of more than four thousand participants who repeatedly self-administered COVID-19 serologic testing at 3-month time intervals. Over the 12-month study period, 99.9% of the samples taken with the OneDraw device received by the independent laboratory were successfully processed, demonstrating the reliability of OneDraw's approach in remote blood sample collection. In addition, the majority of the study participants reported preferring the ease-of-use and near pain-free experience of OneDraw over other collection methods. From more recent development efforts, the device now leverages advanced technology that enables cold-chain-free sample preservation at room temperature. OneDraw can also extract higher volumes than other common collection methods, resulting in more sample material available for testing and storage relative to other methods.
In August 2022, OneDraw was certified in Japan as a medical device, having been cleared by the Pharmaceutical and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA). Most recently, OneDraw was selected for use in the Department of Defense's Cancer Moonshot 2.0 Project as part of a President Biden initiative to drive a renewed focus on preventative health and early disease detection. We are currently working with the FDA to clear OneDraw for medical use in unsupervised settings, which would provide us with first mover status in at-home blood sample collection and the ability to extend the offering into our established DTC customer base. We believe these recent developments significantly enhance OneDraw's value proposition and will accelerate strategic partnership opportunities in our numerous end markets, positioning us well to capitalize on projected industry growth rates.
Gut Health Test with Microbiome Wipe. In May 2022, we reported the results of an initial study that validated the performance of our novel wipe-based stool microbiome collection method, when compared to commercially available DNA collection and preservation kits. Following that study, we relaunched our proprietary Gut Health Test with the first-to-market wipe technology that we believe revolutionizes the user experience. We also believe that awareness of the importance of microbiome health and the “gut-brain axis” is growing exponentially on a global stage, and that our first-mover advantage with proprietary technology creates lasting competitive advantages in the DTC space and other end markets such as telehealth, clinical research, and corporate wellness.
 New Products. In addition to our new children's multi-vitamin/mineral supplement and health test advancements, we continued to launch innovative, high-value supplement products with clinically backed ingredients, including:
 •Metabolic Health, a combination of bergamot and curcumin, that targets healthy metabolism and supports healthy cholesterol and blood sugar levels;
 •Collagen Fit, a formula combining collagen and NR, intended to support joint and muscle health, cellular energy production, training, recovery, and healthy aging;
 •Ovarian Care, a blend of nutrients and botanical extracts for women seeking support for menstrual regularity and various aspects of reproductive health by balancing hormones, supporting a healthy insulin response, and providing antioxidant support; and
 •Daily Greens Plus, a unique powder formula targeting healthy aging, energy, and focus that combines the highest-quality sources of green nutrition with NR, adaptogens that support a healthy stress response and adrenal function, an antioxidant blend that boosts the body’s defenses against oxidative damage, a mushroom blend that promotes optimal immune function, as well as prebiotic and enzyme support for healthy digestion and gut function.


PreCon Acquisition. In January 2023, we completed the acquisition of PreCon Health, Inc. (PreCon), a company focused on scientific discovery, innovation, and advancing safe and effective products that support healthy brain function. We initially partnered with PreCon in 2021 to bring to market the first multi-ingredient nutritional supplement formulated to support pre- and post-impact brain health, SynaQuell  and SynaQuell+ . In addition to strengthening our brain health portfolio, this acquisition provides us with the requisite intellectual property for continued development, as well as access to PreCon's top-tier medical and scientific advisory board. We recently completed clinical trials related to the effect of SynaQuell on brain function and subconcussive brain impact, each conducted at the Mayo Clinic. Current details of the clinical trials can be found at clinical trials.gov, and preliminary study results for the completed study are expected to be made available in the first half of 2023.

Backed by this strong network, we offer convenient testing and data-driven, personalized nutrition, clinically studied supplements and pre- and pro-biotics designed to lower healthcare costs and improve wellness for health professionals and consumers.
Vertically Integrated Product Development Platform
We have built our brand on the core pillars of safety, credibility, quality, and user experience. The foundation for these pillars comes from our vertically integrated capabilities. We believe we are one of the only vertically integrated science-based wellness companies in the world, which enables us to provide our customers with premium products made with the highest quality ingredients. Our platform also provides fixed-cost leverage on increased volumes and optimizes our ability to efficiently monitor and manage our inventory.
Bringing high-quality products to market starts at the source. Our research and development team searches worldwide to find only the highest-quality ingredients to use in our nutritional supplements. We source high-quality ingredients that have been clinically tested, allowing us to better understand each ingredients’ safety and quality profile. To us, “clean” describes supplements that do not contain any harmful, banned, or unnecessary ingredients. Our “No List” guides us every day in choosing which ingredients to source and how to formulate new products. We partner with suppliers whose practices emphasize quality, science, and environmental responsibility. Our single largest provider of botanical materials is Indena, a company based in Milan, Italy, which is well-known for its identification, development, and production of high-quality actives derived from plants. We have access to Indena’s comprehensive botanical compound libraries, which enables throughput functional molecule screening.
Our vertical integration spans from sourcing the highest quality ingredients, research and development activities, product delivery and continued customer engagement. Our product formulation is driven completely in-house by a team of scientists and engineers utilizing proprietary technologies, health intelligence systems, and our Onegevity Discovery AI Platform. This capability drives our data-centric approach to evidence-based nutritional product formulations. The Onegevity Discovery AI Platform delivers molecular insights and personalized health mapping. This system has a one-of-a-kind gene expression library and is one of the world’s most comprehensive multi-omics databases for precision wellness. It has been used to track one of the largest microbiome datasets from skin and gut health covering multiple key diseases. These databases are integrated with product targets and statistical and analytical methods that have been published in top peer-reviewed journals, including Nature, Science, and Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.
We develop the optimal product formula to meet the needs of our customers and have the proper facility to maintain control of the manufacturing process. In 2019, we opened our state-of-the-art 272,000-square-foot facility in Summerville, South Carolina. This facility provides significant enhancements to our manufacturing capacity and production efficiencies, research and development platform and in-house laboratory and testing capabilities. This facility demonstrates our commitment to manufacturing all our products in the United States and ensures a quality product is delivered to our growing and loyal customer base. To meet anticipated demand, we are expanding our manufacturing and fulfillment operations in Summerville, South Carolina, with significant incremental capacity coming online in 2023. Please refer to additional discussion within Item 7 Liquidity and Capital Resources of Management's Discussion and Analysis.
Our vertically integrated platform has also enabled the development of a suite of nutritional supplement products centered around a novel ingredient, NR, which we believe contains properties that support healthy aging at the cellular level. Whether it be older consumers looking to stay healthy longer, or younger consumers focusing on their wellness earlier in life, many individuals are seeking new ways to promote healthy aging. We believe NR addresses these demands and presents a significant market opportunity. Through our integrated platform, we have leveraged the trust and manufacturing expertise of Thorne and the power of Onegevity’s engine and multi-omics database to develop and launch our NR-based suite of products.
We believe it is crucial to form relationships with leading industry participants in order to continue to provide innovative products to our customers. Our development ecosystem is comprised of research partners like Mayo Clinic, Legacy Health, Tetra Biopharma, Kyowa Hakko Bio, and a global pharmaceutical company; sponsorship of UFC, Human Powered Health cycling, USA Rugby, Penske Racing, Roush Fenway Racing, and the U.S. Army World Class Athlete Program; and high-profile customers such as individual Navy SEALs, professional teams in the NFL, MLB and NBA and other major athletic organizations.
Our products are subject to four rounds of testing in our state-of-the-art, in-house laboratories. This process includes testing of raw materials and components, which screens for contaminants; in-process testing, which ensures the correct amount of ingredients are used in our formulations; finished product testing, which confirms the identity, potency, and purity of the ingredients, and that no microbiological contamination occurred during manufacturing; and in-house stability testing, which confirms each product will meet its label claims at its expiration date.
During the year ended December 31, 2022, approximately 90% of our nutritional supplement sales were generated by products that we manufactured in-house. We make strategic decisions to use outside contract manufacturers for products like probiotics that cannot be made in the same facility as all our other supplements due to the risk of cross-contamination.
Sales Channel Strategy
Our go-to-market strategy leverages numerous sales channels. Across these channels, a common philosophy guides what we do; put the customer first, meet them on their terms, and cultivate meaningful relationships that grow over time.
Consumers (DTC). We provide consumers with direct access to our brand through our mobile and web channels as well as through Amazon.com via our authorized reseller. Our consumers are 60% female and 40% male, ages 25 to 65 with high household income. We will continue to reach these consumers through our marketing efforts, while also looking for new ways to reach consumers in a brand-aligned way, such as through independent pharmacies and other specialty retail venues.
Athletes. We reach athletes, gyms, professional sports teams, and performance organizations through our world-class partnerships, our Sports Sales Team, and through our web and mobile channels using digital marketing tactics. We will continue to invest in these efforts to reach athletes, while also expanding our reach through strategic initiatives, such as our partnership with CrossFit, where we plan to deploy physical kiosks into a portion of its affiliate gyms.
Health professionals. We have approximately 47,000 healthcare professionals in our network, including medical doctors, naturopaths, registered dieticians, nutritionists, chiropractors, and other accredited healthcare professionals.

B2B. We reach pharmaceutical companies, CPG brands, research clinics, distributors, and other wholesalers with our Business Development Team.
 Our Industry and Opportunity
Industry
We participate in the large and growing multi-billion dollar global health and wellness industry. The market is highly fragmented, and no company holds a significant market share. We are redefining consumers' expectations and approach to health and wellness through our portfolio of science-backed personalized solutions that meet the highest standards of quality, safety and efficacy.
Opportunity
We have a significant opportunity to continue to penetrate the product categories and channels we compete in today. In addition, we believe we benefit from several consumer trends.
Consumerization of Healthcare and an Increase of Healthcare in the Home: We believe that in the last 10 years there has been a shift from individuals viewing themselves as patients to viewing themselves as consumers in the healthcare market. This has been demonstrated by the growth of the home healthcare market and increased competition in the healthcare provider marketplace. In an always-connected world of data, individuals expect and demand from healthcare what they are accustomed to in their everyday lives. They demand a personalized and holistic approach to daily wellness and long-term health combined with the convenience of products and services being available at their fingertips, all from the comfort and safety of their home. We believe successfully achieving this approach is only possible through the convergence of medicine and technology. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the trend of healthcare moving to the home, placing a greater impetus on individuals to find new ways to protect their health and fueling resiliency with limited person-to-person interaction.
Shift to Personalized Health: Personalized health tailors interventions for preventing and treating disease to the individual characteristics of each patient. The complete sequencing of the human genome, which was completed in 2003, ushered in the era of personalized medicine by providing a greater understanding of how an individual’s unique molecular and genetic profile makes him or her predisposed to certain diseases. As demonstrated by the rise in targeted gene therapies and cancer treatments, health care is evolving from a reactive, “one-size-fits-all” approach to a distinctively proactive, personalized and integrative approach. We believe the dietary supplement market can be personalized in the same way. Such an approach will focus on the optimal selection of treatments and preventative measures that best address a patient’s unique medical attributes, vulnerabilities and predispositions.


Increased Demand for Safe Nutritional Supplements Driven by Increased Consumer Education and Expanding Datasets: Physicians and other health professionals are motivated to help patients, and increasingly, are measured by patient outcomes. Traditional practitioners are now more and more likely to study and prescribe nutritional supplements due to the growing evidence of the positive impact of supplement use and their safety profile. For example, traditional medical doctors have become an increased focus and now account for more than one-third of our customer base in 2022, thanks to our continued growth initiatives and increased demand from their patients.
In a recent study conducted by the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN), it was observed that 80% of Americans are using dietary supplements, up 7% from 2020, and of the respondents surveyed, 79% viewed the dietary supplements industry as trustworthy, versus 74% in 2020. Further, the same study noted that 16.7% of supplement purchases were made online in 2020, up 64% from 2019.
Demand for Convenience: Consumers are increasingly placing more value on an exceptional user experience and a demonstrated willingness to invest in bringing premium products and services into their daily lives. Preferences for digital platforms and subscription-based products and services have increased in demand in recent years. Customers want simplicity and an easily available online option from a trusted and clinically validated brand. Our offerings are built to provide an unmatched user experience and provide information to consumers in a way they can easily understand and manage. Consumers can complete personalized testing, create and update their subscription and learn more about their recommended product suite, all from the comfort of their own home. Our omni-channel distribution model can deliver products to most U.S. consumers within two days or allow them to leverage our network of healthcare professionals to receive their products at their local healthcare practitioner's office. We make our test results and recommendations easy to understand. For example, our Biological Age test and resulting recommendations provide consumers with one easily understood number and an actionable plan with the goal of helping consumers reduce their biological age and extend their health span.
What Sets Us Apart
Our Differentiated Consumer Journey
We believe we provide consumers with one of the world’s most innovative solutions for a personalized approach to health and wellness, delivered through our integrated platform of testing, supplements, and digital health content. Our proprietary platform is redefining consumer health through a model of test, teach, transform, and iterate to address the consumer pain points that exist in the market today. Consumers struggle to navigate confusing supplement categories and the market is crowded with ineffective, low-grade products. Personalization has been shown to deliver better health outcomes, yet current health solutions continue a “one-size-fits-all” approach. The current healthcare system focuses on the treatment of disease, but consumers need and want a proactive, empowered approach to health and wellness focused on maintaining and supporting health and promoting wellness.
We teach individuals about their health and wellness and what is occurring in their bodies and why we recommend specific supplement choices. We aim to address an individual’s health needs and deficiencies with our nutritional supplements, as needed. This is an iterative process and provides a differentiated and simplified journey for our customers to navigate the complicated supplement market and improve their health over time.

We believe we are a leader in developing high-quality nutritional supplements in a variety of unique forms. We presently sell more than 300 supplements and health tests. Our network of tens of thousands of health professionals, trainers, and world-class athletes deepens the credibility of our product portfolio. Our offerings are further differentiated by conducting all manufacturing and quality management in the United States. We have strong relationships with our suppliers, predominantly located in Europe and United States, who assist in our product innovation cycle and share our commitment to bringing the highest quality products to our customers.
NSF International evaluates product and ingredient safety through its accredited certification and testing services. The NSF Dietary Supplement Certification Program certifies dietary supplements that meet the requirements of the official American National Standard for Dietary Supplements (NSF/ANSI Standard 173). The certification process includes a toxicology and label review to verify product formulation, testing to identify and quantify dietary ingredients declared on the product label, testing to ensure the product does not contain unacceptable levels of contaminants and annual current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) facility inspections. Our facility has been cGMP certified through NSF since 2015. As part of this certification, our Quality Management system, which includes onsite and third-party laboratory operations, is audited to ensure compliance to cGMPs.

This commitment to quality has contributed to our position as one of the most comprehensive NSF Certified For Sport tested supplement manufacturers in the United States and Canada, with approximately 25 NSF Certified For Sport tested supplement products. The NSF For Sport program in the United States and Canada each certify our nutritional supplements to be free from substances banned by major sporting organizations and enables athletes, dietitians, coaches and consumers make more informed decisions when choosing sports supplements. We believe our supplements line is one of the most extensive NSF Certified For Sport product lines based on publicly available data for the number of certified products by manufacturer, regardless of whether the products are currently on the market; however, there is no publicly available volume or revenue data regarding our competitors’ NSF Certified For Sport supplement products. Although we plan to continue to seek and maintain NSF Certified For Sport certification for certain of our trusted brand of products, we face competition from other manufacturers that have similarly broad lines of NSF Certified For Sport supplement products and target the professional athlete market.
Powerful Data and AI engine
Our AI model and multi-omics database improve our product formulations and make our recommendations to consumers more precise. We collect and process hundreds of personalized tests, evaluations and surveys per day and are able to develop actionable insights from that data with our Onegevity platform. The data collected from customers, combined with a powerful AI engine, enhances our ability to provide personalized recommendations and education to our customers, thereby driving higher conversion and retention. Our platform captures this information which is utilized by our algorithms to create better nutritional supplements with optimal safety and quality and also helps our B2B customers develop more personalized solutions. The availability of this data may open further opportunities for us in the future to drive revenue by providing data services as a health intelligence provider.
Scalable Platform
The large number of highly engaged consumers who trust our Thorne brand and Onegevity platform provide a strong foundation for developing new products that extend across the health and wellness markets. This ecosystem uniquely positions us to create and capture value along the continuum of a consumer’s life with safe and innovative formulas that provide support for prenatal development, healthy adult lifestyles and healthy aging. We have achieved a demonstrated ability to develop innovative new products and successfully integrate acquired companies and assets.
Founder-Led, Science-Oriented Team
Our team of pioneers brings expertise in science-backed wellness, precision health, systems biology and AI-for-health, and has a proven track record of driving profitable growth. Co-Founder Paul Jacobson built this team with a commitment to redefine what it means to be healthy and to push the limits of human potential. Our experienced and highly regarded team of scientists spans fields such as molecular medicine, neuroscience, immunology and genetics.
Growth Strategies
Grow Brand Awareness
We have a significant opportunity to continue to grow our brand awareness and generate new customers. We intend to invest in brand campaigns, full-funnel marketing tactics, and thought leadership initiatives to drive awareness and new customer growth. Once acquired, our customers have demonstrated brand loyalty, so we are well positioned in the market to expand our customer base and effectively retain customers.
Launch New Products and Expand Content Offerings
We intend to launch new products focused on unmet clinical needs. We will continue to invest in evidence-based nutritional supplement development powered by Onegevity’s proprietary AI engine and multi-omics database. For example, through Onegevity's compound delivery platform, we were able to identify the highly efficacious compound from bergamot extract to formulate our recently launched Metabolic Health product.
Leverage Our Multi-Omics Database and AI with B2B Partners
Our longitudinal multi-omics database is proprietary, difficult to replicate, and generates unprecedented data insights. We will seek to monetize our database and unique analysis model with a diverse set of enterprise clients.

Continue to Improve Personalization for a Better Consumer Experience
Our personalized approach to health, delivered through a customized platform of testing, supplements and digital health content continues to contribute to our favorable NPS score and subscription retention rates. We will seek to improve our outstanding track record by further enhancing our AI solutions and consumer engagement to provide tailored, personalized solutions to our customers.
Invest in Our Platform
We will continue to invest in technology and the infrastructure to support the growth of our integrated Thorne and Onegevity platform.
Further Expand into International Markets
We will continue to build on our network of distributors across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, and South America. We believe we have the regulatory expertise to execute this initiative and to accelerate international growth.
Selectively Pursue Acquisitions
Our comprehensive platform will enable us to selectively pursue strategic and complementary assets that support our customers’ needs. We have a track record of successfully identifying and integrating acquisitions. Our March 2021 acquisition of Onegevity Health strategically expanded our testing and education offerings. We intend to augment and scale the breadth of our platform and offerings through continued strong organic growth opportunities and the acquisition of complementary products and services.
Sales and Marketing
We have been able to turn the luxury aspect of Thorne into a competitive advantage by tapping into consumers’ aspiration to be more, where health is the new measure of wealth. To deliver an exceptional brand experience, we focus on:
•Content: Developing and sharing engaging, research-driven educational information, 
 •Community: Engaging our brand ambassadors, influencers, and loyal consumers around their self-optimization and self-investment; and 
 •Commerce: Delivering a first-class, frictionless experience for customers.
 We will continue to invest in these pillars of our brand experience, while also scaling our brand partnerships and influencers to further grow brand equity. We have a holistic, full-funnel strategy that balances long-term brand objectives with performance marketing goals using a mix of paid, owned, and earned media. Our paid media budget is generally split, with approximately 60% focused on brand tactics and 40% focused on performance marketing tactics. We use large-reach vehicles to provide ample scale and exposure for our audience, such as TV streaming advertising, display, and out-of-home. We also use highly targeted tactics, such as paid social and paid search to build frequency of our product solutions against the right audiences and prompt them to convert.
 We maintain a balance between unpaid and paid acquisition, and we prioritize our successful unpaid acquisition strategies and channels. We believe the economics of paid acquisition degrades over time, which is why we have focused on unpaid acquisition. We actively invest in search engine optimization (SEO), improving the user interface and user experience (UI/UX) on our website and mobile application (app), growing our organic social presence, and building new digital products to drive customer engagement. We also are focused on bolstering our earned media efforts to augment our paid and owned strategies by increasing word of mouth and garnering more media placements.
We believe we are well positioned in the market and there is significant room to expand our customer base and convert them into active, recurring customers. Our efficient customer acquisition combined with strong repeat purchase behavior to generate an attractive ratio of customer lifetime value (LTV) to customer acquisition costs (CAC), which was 4.6x in 2022.
 Omni-Channel Sales Model
Customers can purchase our products through our omni-channel model consisting of both our DTC platform and our large network of health professionals.

There are two typical consumer pathways to purchasing our supplement products for the first time through our DTC channel. The first common pathway is through our educational platform, where a consumer searches for a specific ingredient, health concern or product, and due to targeted advertising or positive media content, they land on our website to learn more. Once on our site, the consumer may read our Take 5 Daily blog articles or take a product quiz to help determine the best product to meet his or her needs. An interested consumer typically purchases one to two nutritional supplement products on average, with an average unit price of $34.37, either through our website, app or third-party site such as Amazon. We have an average rating of 4.6 stars across our products on Amazon, which we believe to be among the highest in the industry. Our platform also enables customers to easily choose personalized plans through our subscription service.
The second pathway occurs when a consumer searches for a data-driven approach to determine the best product to meet his or her needs. These consumers typically find our website due to targeted advertising or positive media content and purchase one health test for an average price of $159.00 through our website or app. This consumer then collects a bio sample, mails the sample to a third-party laboratory, and receives his or her test results on Thorne.com within seven to ten business days. Within the results, the consumer can review his or her health insights and personalized recommendations on diet, lifestyle and supplementation. From there, the consumer converts and purchases on average one to two of our supplement products. For customers in this second pathway, we receive revenue from the testing fee and from our supplement product sales. As a result of our merger with Onegevity, we expect the traffic to our websites through this second pathway to continue to increase and to realize increasing revenue as a result of the synergy with our supplement products.
Our platform enables customers to easily choose personalized plans through our subscription service. Customers may also choose to subscribe through Total subscriptions grew from 257,070 in 2021 to 375,185 in 2022, a 45.9% year-over-year growth rate. We plan to further expand this channel in order to continue building a strong recurring revenue stream. We have made significant investments in our supply chain logistics in order to offer shipping anywhere in the United States within two days.
In addition to our robust DTC channel, we have also grown our network of more than 47,000 health professionals across the world who recommend our products to their patients when appropriate. We are a trusted brand by top health professionals all over the world. According to the Holistic Primary Care’s 2016 Practitioner Survey Report, we are the most dispensed brand by health professionals with 30- to 40-year-old patients. This ecosystem provides a separate channel to reach our customers. Our team of more than 25 sales professionals continue to expand this network, educating health professionals of the benefits to using our products. As we continue to see more and more patients seeking safe, effective nutritional supplements for their health, our products have become increasingly popular through this channel. Thousands of our trusted health professionals recommend our products to their patients through “online dispensing,” whereby consumers can avoid going to a retailer and instead purchase any recommended products directly through our website using their health professional’s trusted recommendations and unique code. Health professionals also have the option to buy our products directly to resell in their offices. This continues to increase our brand awareness while also benefiting patients who are being treated by our network of health professionals. We continue to see the adoption through this channel, demonstrated by continued year-over-year sales growth of 18.4% in 2021 and 18.5% in 2022.
 Our selling efforts are accelerated and supported by an in-house U.S.-based customer service team. Our customer service representatives are available for live online chat, as well as live phone support from 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Eastern Standard Time, Monday through Friday. We also make our licensed medical professionals available to answer non-disease related questions to both health professionals and consumers.
 Clinical Laboratory Partners
We partner with independent certified clinical laboratories, such as ZRT Laboratory, CosmosID, and Quest Diagnostics, to process, and in some cases, produce, the tests that we offer. These laboratories are responsible for receiving and logging samples, preparing samples for processing, processing samples, and performing quality assurance and quality control to assure the validity of all test results before returning results to our network of physicians for assessment. The samples these laboratories process on our behalf include saliva-, blood-, stool- and urine-derived samples.
Competition

We are building a new health category to develop personalized nutritional solutions to improve health with the same degree of scientific rigor that pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are using for disease treatment. We are at the intersection of and compete against companies that offer DTC subscriptions, digital health services, personalized consumer products, and data-enabled wellness solutions. Due to our comprehensive approach to health and wellness, we currently compete with different health and wellness companies in different markets, such as Nestle Health Science and Metagenics in the nutritional supplement market, Hims, 23and Me, and Livongo in the health services and online testing market, and companies in the AI-driven healthcare market. The market for our products and services is highly fragmented, with many global players participating across category segments in which no single company has obtained more than a 5% market share. We believe no single competitor offers a similarly comprehensive, vertically integrated platform combining product efficacy with personalized health and wellness solutions to consumers, health professionals and corporations.
We believe the principal competitive factors in our market are product quality, customer experience, brand awareness and loyalty, reliability and trust. We believe we differentiate ourselves from our competitors by our relentless pursuit of science-based, personalized health and wellness solutions.
Research and Development
We plan to continue to devote significant resources to research and development. Our research and development organization is responsible for the design, architecture, and operation of our personalized testing platform and nutritional supplement products. Our personalized testing platform includes more than 10, such as the Biological Age test and Gut Health test. We develop new nutritional products through evidence-based product development in areas such as healthy aging and cognition. We pioneered a drug-supplement mapping system that, through AI, helps develop a new B2B pipeline to support product development of our B2B partners, such as pharmaceutical and CPG companies.
We continue to innovate in many areas, such as the development of Thorne Lab. Our Thorne Lab assessments provide an in-person clinical experience powered by AI, which we believe will help expand the personalized scientific wellness paradigm. By enabling individuals to obtain a 360-degree snapshot of their well-being, we believe Thorne Lab empowers individuals to identify opportunities that preserve their health and optimize performance. Thorne Lab also equips scientists with longitudinal multi-scale health data and a testbed environment to develop, validate and deploy new products and services. As a result, Thorne Lab creates a virtuous cycle of innovation that radically accelerates the pace at which wellness can be optimized and promising ideas can potentially become clinical practice.
 We are also developing two new advanced tests. The first is our brain health test that will combine blood testing, health histories and cognitive assessments. The second is a metabolomics-based test that will provide our most comprehensive information to date, providing deep health insights and informing personalization around the majority of our product portfolio.
Intellectual Property
We believe that our intellectual property rights are valuable and important to our business. We rely on trademarks, trade secrets, intellectual property assignment agreements, confidentiality procedures, non-disclosure agreements and employee non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements to establish and protect our proprietary rights. In addition, we rely at least in part on trade secrets to protect some aspects of our business, including the sourcing and methods of manufacturing for our nutritional supplement products, the multi-omics database and the algorithm of our AI models. Though we rely in part upon these legal and contractual protections, we believe that factors such as the skills and ingenuity of our employees and the functionality and frequent enhancements to our solutions are larger contributors to our success in the marketplace.
As of December 31, 2022, we held 72 active registered trademarks in the United States, primarily for product names, tag lines, and several THORNE marks; we have been issued one pending Notice of Allowance by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), and we have several active trademark applications pending at the USPTO. Internationally, we received trademarks for THORNE in one or more classes in the following jurisdictions: Canada, China, European Union (27 member states), Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Philippines, Russia, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and United Kingdom. We have trademark applications for THORNE in one or more international classes currently pending in the following jurisdictions: Australia, Brazil, Brunei, China, India, Malaysia, Qatar, Russia, Serbia, Singapore, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Ukraine, and Vietnam.

We intend to pursue additional intellectual property protection, including patent protection in the future, to the extent we believe it will be beneficial and cost-effective. Despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, they may not be respected in the future or may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our products and practicing our proprietary technology, and any patent applications we pursue that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our products. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents that we own or in-license. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our products and services.
Our industry is characterized by the existence of many patents and frequent claims and related litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. We believe that competitors will try to develop products that are similar to ours and that may infringe our intellectual property rights. Our competitors or other third parties may also claim that our solutions infringe their intellectual property rights. Some companies in our industry have extensive patent portfolios. From time to time, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation and other violations of intellectual property rights against us or our customers or partners, with whom our agreements may obligate us to indemnify against these claims. Successful claims of infringement by a third-party could prevent us from offering certain products or features, require us to develop alternate, non-infringing technology, which could require significant time and during which we could be unable to continue to offer our affected products or solutions, require us to obtain a license, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all, or force us to pay substantial damages, royalties or other fees. Moreover, our solutions incorporate software components licensed to the general public under open source software licenses. We obtain many components from software developed and released by contributors to independent open source components of our solutions. Open source licenses grant licensees broad permissions to use, copy, modify and redistribute our platform. As a result, open source development and license practices can limit the value of our software copyright assets. For additional information, see the section titled “Risk Factors—Risks Related to our Business – Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.”
Data Protection
We are committed to the security and privacy of our customers’ data. The data we collect and process is an integral part of our products and services, allowing us to ensure our products are safe and effective, to provide an engaging consumer experience, to recommend the most relevant products and services and to reach opted-in consumers with timely information. We collect and may use personal information to help operate our business, including for analytical purposes, and to communicate and otherwise reach our consumers. In some instances, we use third-party service providers to assist us in these activities.
We attempt to control access to and distribution of our proprietary information, including our algorithms, source code and customer data through enterprise-grade security measures. We utilize various technology and process-based methods, such as multi-layer firewalls, intrusion detection systems, content filtering, endpoint security, centralized logging and alerting, email security mechanisms and access control mechanisms. Our platform offers powerful data security from our cloud infrastructure to the application layer, end-to-end data encryption, as well as fine grain authorization controls and sensitive field data masking. In addition, we continue to pursue independent third-party assessments and validations of our security and compliance capabilities, including an examination conducted under Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements (SSAE) No. 16 (Reporting on Controls at a Service Organization), commonly referred to as Service Organization Controls (SOC) reports.
Culture and Values
Our culture is driven by empowering our employees. By ensuring employees enjoy their jobs and believe they are challenged and treated fairly, we believe they will work hard to deliver our premium products for our customers and strong results for our investors.
We pride ourselves on the fact that our manufacturing and customer service takes place in our facilities in the United States. During 2020, we developed protocols to deal with the COVID-19 pandemic and were forced to adjust to a workforce that was split between those who could work from home and those who could not.
We used the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to learn from our employees. We established the Thorne United Committee, an action committee derived from all of our departments, which examined how we paid people, our role in the community, the diversity of our staff, the childcare issues facing employees, the potential for adult education programs, mentoring by senior staff and opportunities for college and trade school scholarships.

We believe that talented and engaged employees create trust and a bond with our customers that no senior management team can achieve alone. We engineer and produce complex products to solve the complex problems of health and wellness and believe that if our customers are to trust our brand, our employees must lead the messaging and be trusted to make decisions that do not compromise the quality of our products. To that end, we have long had policies that senior management cannot overrule decisions made by our quality control and quality assurance teams, nor can senior management overrule decisions taken by our adverse event review team about reporting Serious Adverse Events to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) or the safety of our products. We are a product-driven company, built around a culture that empowers employees to make the right decisions and rewards them for doing the right things for the company and our customers.
The key to our success lies in the four tenets of our culture that have driven our innovation and ingenuity from the very start. These tenets define our legacy and propel us toward a future where we are the leader in solving the complex problems of health and wellness. These four tenets are:
A belief in our purpose. We are a team united behind a common purpose: educating, inspiring and improving the health and wellness of people around the world. Being part of a larger purpose is what drives and unites us. It is this shared passion and belief in our mission that has helped us earn the trust of thousands of health professionals, United States Olympic Teams, Mayo Clinic and customers around the world.
A belief in the power of our people. Our culture empowers our employees. From our distinguished researchers to our elite customer-care team, every individual has the opportunity to make a difference firsthand. Every individual has the opportunity to lead, to bring ideas to the table and to be an instrument of change in our workplace culture. We encourage candor, collaboration and communication within our company.
Our culture is built on equality, where people of all backgrounds and experiences are both celebrated and encouraged. As of December 31, 2022, women constitute 40% of the leadership roles across our company and minorities represent 38% of our total employees. This group of leaders operates across multiple departments, including research and development, finance, marketing, bioinformatics, product development and customer service.
We give our employees the tools required to succeed. We offer competitive compensation, fully paid employee benefits, employee training and development, childcare benefits and monthly product credits for personal and immediate family use. We also provide unique growth opportunities dedicated to the ongoing training and professional development of our employees. To better achieve this objective, we draw together internal and external resources to develop and deliver the very best training, development and enrichment programs for our employees.
A belief in our communities. We create opportunities for employees to give back to their communities and support causes of their choosing. We are an active supporter of communities in South Carolina through charitable donations and programs. We encourage employees to support these activities with employer-sponsored paid time off for volunteer work. Our company does not make contributions to any political causes. Instead, we encourage our employees to take an active role in good government without management intervention.
Our Thorne United Committee champions a work environment that promotes the values of diversity, equality, inclusiveness and community. Its work supports programs that address cultural diversity, education and development, community outreach, dependent care support and employee wellness. Specific examples of these programs include tuition support for employees and a tuition grant award program for employees’ dependents, a company-sponsored 529 college savings plan with a company contribution, internship and mentoring options for employees’ children, community support programs and comprehensive childcare support.
A belief to lead from the front. Our mission is to be the world’s leader in scientific wellness. This is the bedrock of our organization’s culture and it drives us to become the market leader in research and development, bringing innovative new products to market that address unmet clinical needs. Our goal is to innovate and provide new ways to think about health, performance and wellness.
Human Capital

We are extremely proud of our team, which embodies a diverse mix of backgrounds, industries and levels of experience, united in the shared belief that we can help people lead healthier, happier lives with longer health spans. As of December 31, 2022, we had 544 full-time employees across our company. Of these employees, 281 were in manufacturing, 48 were in sales and marketing, 68 were in customer service and shipping, 59 were in medical, research and development and 88 were in general and administrative functions. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we believe the relationship between management and employees is one that has developed over mutual trust and is in good standing.
Sustainability
We care deeply about the origins of our ingredients. We only partner with suppliers whose practices emphasize quality, science and responsibility. Higher quality ingredients that meet our stringent specifications of potency, purity and absorption ultimately translate into better health and wellness. We believe that the environment should not be compromised for the sake of profits. To us, doing our part to protect the environment and its resources goes hand-in-hand with our quality standards. We take pride in being a steward of the botanical ingredients we use in our products. If we happen to learn a botanical ingredient is becoming endangered or over sourcing is diminishing its supply, we will discontinue its use in our product line.
As our sustainability efforts evolve, we are working on long-term solutions to eliminate unnecessary paper waste, including an innovative paperless “pick, pack, and ship” system. Nearly all of our shipping supplies are made from recycled materials, including our shipping boxes, fill-air pillows and padded packs. We are also heavily invested in introducing innovative products, such as Effusio by Thorne, that align with our sustainability mission and help solve the complex problems we face today with plastic pollution. Effusio by Thorne leverages proprietary printing technology to develop dissolvable supplement beverage discs that provide healthier alternatives to traditional beverages, while also providing sustainable packaging alternatives and reducing packaging waste and emissions during shipping. Effusio by Thorne packaging is plastic free and the carton is fully recyclable.
Facilities
We currently lease three industrial facilities located in Summerville, South Carolina, which house our warehouse, production and primary distribution operations and a fourth industrial facility located in Benicia, California for regional distribution operations. We also lease and operate two administrative and support locations in New York, New York, and Madison, Wisconsin.
 Our primary manufacturing and administrative facility is located in Summerville, South Carolina. The 272,000 square-foot facility is located on 25.8 acres and houses our manufacturing and production, research and development, medical affairs, engineering, quality management, laboratory testing, brand marketing, inside sales, customer service, finance, legal, human resources, warehousing and materials management, procurement and safety functions. The lease expires in October 2037. We have the right to renew for two additional terms of five years each.
We also operate a 115,500 square-foot warehouse facility in Summerville, South Carolina, within close proximity to our primary manufacturing and administrative facility. This facility expands our finished goods warehousing and shipping capabilities to the eastern United States and international markets. This facility is under a lease which terminates in July 2026. We have the right to renew for two additional terms of three years each.
 On July 28, 2021, we entered into a lease for a to-be-constructed 360,320 square-foot industrial facility in Summerville, South Carolina, directly adjacent to our primary facility. This lease will commence upon the completion of construction of the facility, which is currently estimated to be during the second quarter of 2023 and will terminate upon the thirteenth anniversary of the commencement date. We have the right to renew for one additional term of five years. Upon commencement of this lease, we plan to relocate certain warehousing and certain materials-processing production activities from our primary manufacturing facility to provide additional space for expansion of our current manufacturing and production capabilities in support of our continued growth.
 We also maintain a 16,896 square-foot warehouse in Benicia, California that services Midwest and West Coast product fulfillment operations. This lease terminates in January 2025. We have the right to renew for one additional term of five years.
 Our corporate headquarters in New York, New York consists of 3,500 square-feet of space and primarily houses executive management, business development, corporate marketing and Onegevity personnel. The leases for this office space expire in 2027.
In addition, our information management and digital marketing staff, including our Chief Technology Officer, occupy a 2,500 square-foot facility in Madison, Wisconsin. The lease for this office expires in October 2024.

We intend to procure additional space as we add employees, grow production and expand geographically. We believe, however, that our facilities are adequate to meet our needs for the immediate future and suitable additional space will be available to accommodate any expansion of our operations as needed.
Government Regulation
Products that promote health and wellness, as well as payment for such products, are regulated by various federal, state and local agencies, including but not limited to the following: (i) the FDA, which administers the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), as well as other relevant laws; (ii) the Federal Trade Commission (FTC); (iii) the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC); (iv) the Office for Civil Rights, which administers the privacy aspects of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996; and (v) various state regulatory bodies. The FDA in the course of enforcing the FDCA may subject a company to various sanctions for violating FDA regulations or provisions of the FDCA, including requiring or requesting recalls, issuing Warning Letters, seeking to impose civil money penalties, seizing products that the agency believes are non-compliant, seeking to enjoin distribution of a specific product, seeking disgorgement of profits and seeking to criminally prosecute a company and its officers and other responsible parties.
Dietary Supplements
The Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act of 1994 (DSHEA), amended the FDCA to establish a new framework governing the composition, safety, labeling, manufacturing and marketing of dietary supplements. Generally, under DSHEA, dietary ingredients (i.e., vitamins; minerals; herb or other botanical; amino acids; or dietary substances for use by humans to supplement diet by increasing total dietary intake; or any concentrate, metabolite, constituent, extract or combination of any of the above) that were marketed in the United States prior to October 15, 1994 as a dietary supplement may be used in dietary supplements without notifying the FDA. “New” dietary ingredients (i.e., dietary ingredients that were “not marketed in the United States before October 15, 1994”) must be the subject of a new dietary ingredient notification submitted to the FDA unless the ingredient has been “present in the food supply as an article used for food” without being “chemically altered.” A new dietary ingredient notification must provide the FDA evidence of a “history of use or other evidence of safety” establishing that use of the dietary ingredient “will reasonably be expected to be safe.” A new dietary ingredient notification must be submitted to the FDA at least 75 days before the initial marketing. The FDA may determine that a new dietary ingredient notification does not provide an adequate basis to conclude that a dietary ingredient is reasonably expected to be safe. In addition, manufacturers of dietary supplements must ensure that ingredients in their products that are not defined as dietary ingredients comply with all the requirements applicable to conventional foods. For example, fillers and other constituents of the product must be approved as food additives or must be deemed generally recognized as safe for the conditions of use in order to be sold.
The FDA generally prohibits the marketing of a dietary supplement with any “disease claim,” including claims that the product is intended to treat, cure, mitigate or prevent disease or other health-related conditions or correlating use of the product with a decreased risk of disease, unless the claim constitutes a “health claim” that is authorized by the FDA. The FTC has imposed stringent, claim-specific substantiation standards on certain dietary supplement manufacturers, to settle charges that they deceptively advertised their supplements’ efficacy. However, “statements of nutritional support,” including so-called “structure/function claims,” are permitted to be included in labeling for dietary supplements. Such statements may describe how a particular dietary ingredient affects the structure, function or general well-being of the body, or the mechanism of action by which a dietary ingredient may affect the structure, function or well-being of the body, but such statements may not state that a dietary supplement will reduce the risk or incidence of a disease unless such claim has been reviewed and approved by the FDA. A company that uses a statement of nutritional support in labeling must possess evidence substantiating that the statement is truthful and not misleading. Such statements must be submitted to the FDA no later than thirty days after first marketing the product with the certification that they possess the necessary evidence and must be accompanied by an FDA mandated label disclaimer that “This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure or prevent any disease.”
The FDA has published detailed current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP), regulations that govern the manufacturing, packaging, labeling and holding operations of dietary supplement manufacturers. The cGMP regulations, among other things, impose significant recordkeeping requirements on manufacturers and require dietary supplements to be of appropriate potency, purity and identity. The cGMP requirements are in effect for all dietary supplement manufacturers, and the FDA conducts inspections of dietary supplement manufacturers pursuant to these requirements.
The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions of federal law applicable to dietary supplements, including powers to issue a public warning or notice of violation letter to a company, publicize information about illegal products, detain products intended for import, require the reporting of serious adverse events, require a recall of illegal or unsafe products from the market, and request the Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action or a criminal prosecution in the United States courts.

The Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA), expands the reach and regulatory powers of the FDA with respect to the production and importation of food, including dietary supplements. The expanded reach and regulatory powers include the FDA’s ability to order mandatory recalls, administratively detain domestic products, and require certification of compliance with domestic requirements for imported foods associated with safety issues. FMSA also gave FDA the authority to administratively revoke manufacturing facility registrations, effectively enjoining manufacturing of dietary ingredients and dietary supplements without judicial process.

On December 20, 2018, the Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018 also known as the “Farm Bill” was signed into law. The Farm Bill removed hemp from the definition of marijuana under the Controlled Substances Act, and granted the U.S. Department of Agriculture the ability to regulate hemp defined as the cannabis plant (Cannabis sativa L.), and derivatives of cannabis, with extremely low (less than 0.3 percent on a dry weight basis) concentrations of the compound delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), The Farm Bill did not alter, and explicitly preserved, the authority of the FDA to regulate dietary supplements, foods, and other products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds including hemp or hemp-derived compounds under the FDCA.
Our hemp oil product is derived from the seeds and mature stalks of the Cannabis Sativa plant and, in accordance with the definition of hemp, contains a THC concentration that is less than 0.3 percent on a dry-weight basis. Hemp-containing products may also be subject to state registration requirements depending on where such products are marketed. We are also subject to state laws and regulations for our hemp oil product, which may limit where we can sell and market hemp-derived products.
Laboratory Developed Tests
The health and wellness tests we offer are considered laboratory developed tests (LDTs), and are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory that is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA), a federal law that regulates clinical laboratories that perform testing on specimens derived from humans and under which our partner laboratories are certified. Laboratory testing is currently under the purview of the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and state agencies that provide oversight of the safe and effective use of clinical laboratory tests, including LDTs.
Our partner clinical laboratories’ operations are subject to CLIA regulations, which are designed to ensure the quality and reliability of clinical laboratories by mandating specific standards in the areas of personnel qualifications, administration and participation in proficiency testing, patient test management, quality control, quality assurance and inspections. Laboratories must undergo on-site surveys at least every two years, which may be conducted by CMS under the CLIA program or by a private CMS approved accrediting agency. The sanction for failure to comply with CLIA requirements may be suspension, revocation or limitation of a laboratory’s CLIA certificate, which is necessary to conduct business, as well as significant fines and/or criminal penalties. Our partner laboratories are also subject to regulation of laboratory operations under state clinical laboratory laws. State clinical laboratory laws may require that laboratories and/or laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality controls or require maintenance of certain records. Certain states, such as New York, California, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Rhode Island, each require that laboratories obtain licenses to test specimens from patients residing in those states and additional states may require similar licenses in the future. Only Washington and New York State are exempt under CLIA, as these states have established laboratory quality standards at least as stringent as CLIA’s quality standards. Potential sanctions for violation of these statutes and regulations.
Our partner clinical laboratories’ operations are subject to complex laws, regulations and licensure requirements relating to billing and payment for laboratory services, sales and marketing interactions with ordering physicians and other health care providers, security and confidentiality of health information, and environmental and occupational safety, among others. Changes in regulations often increase the cost of testing or processing claims. Also, these laws may be interpreted or applied by a prosecutorial, regulatory or judicial authority in a manner that could require our partner laboratories and, consequently us, to make changes in operations, including in pricing, billing and/or marketing practices in a manner that could adversely affect operations.
In addition, the FDCA defines a medical device to include any instrument, apparatus, implement, machine, contrivance, implant, in vitro reagent, or other similar or related article, including a component part, or accessory, intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions, or in the cure, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease, in man or other animals. The health tests we offered may be considered by the FDA to be subject to regulation as medical devices. Among other things, pursuant to the FDCA and its implementing regulations, the FDA regulates the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, pre-market clearance or approval, marketing and promotion, and sales and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the export of medical devices manufactured in the United States to international markets.

Although the FDA has statutory authority to assure that medical devices are safe and effective for their intended uses, the FDA has generally exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable regulations with respect to LDTs, which the FDA considers to be in vitro diagnostics that are designed, manufactured, and used within a single laboratory for use only in that laboratory. As a result, we believe the health tests that we offer are currently subject to the FDA’s enforcement discretion and are not subject to the FDA’s oversight.
Legislative and administrative proposals proposing to amend the FDA’s oversight of LDTs have been introduced in recent years and we expect that new legislative and administrative proposals will continue to be introduced from time to time. It is possible that legislation could be enacted into law or regulations or guidance could be issued by the FDA which may result in new or increased regulatory requirements for us to continue to offer our health tests or to develop and introduce new tests.
For example, in recent years, FDA has stated its intention to modify its enforcement discretion policy with respect to LDTs. On July 31, 2014, the FDA notified Congress of its intent to modify, in a risk-based manner, its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs. On October 3, 2014, the FDA issued two draft guidance documents entitled “Framework for Regulatory Oversight of Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs),” or the Framework Guidance, and “FDA Notification and Medical Device Reporting for Laboratory Developed Tests (LDTs),” or the Reporting Guidance. The Framework Guidance stated that FDA intends to modify its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs in a risk-based manner consistent with the classification of medical devices generally in Classes I through III. The Reporting Guidance would have further enabled FDA to collect information regarding the LDTs currently being offered for clinical use through a notification process, as well as to enforce its regulations for reporting safety issues and collecting information on any known or suspected adverse events related to the use of an LDT. On November 18, 2016, the FDA announced that it would not finalize either guidance document to allow for further public discussion on an appropriate oversight approach to LDTs and to give Congressional authorizing committees the opportunity to develop a legislative solution, and the FDA issued a discussion paper on possible approaches to LDT regulation in January 2017. Moreover, in August 2020, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced that FDA will not require premarket review of LDTs absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, as opposed to through guidance documents and other informal issuances.
Medical Devices
LDTs, which are currently subject to FDA’s enforcement discretion and for which the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has announced the FDA may not impose its authority without notice and comment rulemaking, the FDA may decide in the future to regulate LDTs and do not qualify for enforcement discretion at present. If this occurs, or if the FDA determines that certain of our other offerings, such as low-risk health and wellness products, including software, are subject to regulation as medical devices, our health tests and/or these other product offerings could become subject to the FDA’s authority applicable to medical devices, including the requirement for premarket review. Unless an exemption applies, each new or significantly modified medical device we seek to commercially distribute in the U.S. will require either a premarket notification to the FDA requesting permission for commercial distribution under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, or approval from the FDA of a Premarket Approval (PMA) application.
Classification
Under the FDCA, medical devices are classified into one of three classes-Class I, Class II or Class III depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to provide reasonable assurances with respect to safety and effectiveness. Class I includes devices with the lowest risk to the patient and are those for which safety and effectiveness can be reasonably assured by adherence to a set of FDA regulations, referred to as the General Controls for Medical Devices, which require compliance with the applicable portions of the FDA’s quality system regulation (QSR), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse events and malfunctions, and appropriate, truthful and non-misleading labeling and promotional materials. Some Class I devices also require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below. Most Class I products are exempt from the premarket notification requirements.
Class II devices are those that are subject to the General Controls, and special controls as deemed necessary by the FDA to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device. These special controls can include performance standards, patient registries, FDA guidance documents and post-market surveillance. Most Class II devices are subject to premarket review and clearance by the FDA. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices is accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification process. Our subsidiary, Drawbridge Health, Inc., has developed a blood draw device that is regulated as a Class II medical device and received 510(k) clearance in 2019.

Class III devices include devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk such as life-supporting or life-sustaining devices, or implantable devices, in addition to those deemed novel and not substantially equivalent following the 510(k) process. The safety and effectiveness of Class III devices cannot be reasonably assured solely by the General Controls and Special Controls described above. Therefore, these devices are subject to the PMA application process, which is generally more costly and time-consuming than the 510(k) process. Through the PMA application process, the applicant must submit data and information demonstrating reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use to the FDA’s satisfaction. Accordingly, a PMA typically includes, but is not limited to, extensive technical information regarding device design and development, preclinical and clinical trial data, manufacturing information, labeling and financial disclosure information for the clinical investigators in device studies. The PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence that demonstrates to the FDA’s satisfaction a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device for its intended use.
510(k) Clearance
Under the 510(k) clearance process, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification, demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to a legally marketed predicate device. A predicate device is a legally marketed device that is not subject to a PMA, i.e., a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976 (pre-amendments device) and for which a PMA is not required, a device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or I, or a device that was previously found substantially equivalent through the 510(k) process. To be “substantially equivalent,” the proposed device must have the same intended use as the predicate device, and either have the same technological characteristics as the predicate device or have different technological characteristics and not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness than the predicate device. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence.
After a 510(k) premarket notification is submitted, the FDA determines whether to accept it for substantive review. If it lacks necessary information for substantive review, the FDA will refuse to accept the 510(k) notification. If it is accepted for filing, the FDA begins a substantive review. By statute, the FDA is required to complete its review of a 510(k) notification within 90 days of receiving the 510(k) notification. As a practical matter, clearance often takes longer, and clearance is never assured. Although many 510(k) premarket notifications are cleared without clinical data, the FDA may require further information, including clinical data, to make a determination regarding substantial equivalence, which may significantly prolong the review process. If the FDA agrees that the device is substantially equivalent, it will grant clearance to commercially market the device.
If the FDA determines that the device is not “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, or if the device is automatically classified into Class III, the device sponsor must then fulfill the much more rigorous premarketing requirements of the PMA approval process, or seek reclassification of the device through the de novo process. The de novo classification process is an alternate pathway to classify medical devices that are automatically classified into Class III but which are low to moderate risk. A manufacturer can submit a petition for direct de novo review if the manufacturer is unable to identify an appropriate predicate device and the new device or new use of the device presents a moderate or low risk. De novo classification may also be available after receipt of a “not substantially equivalent” letter following submission of a 510(k) to FDA.
After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any modification that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a new or major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or, depending on the modification, could require a PMA application. The FDA requires each manufacturer to determine whether the proposed change requires a new submission in the first instance, but the FDA can review any such decision and disagree with a manufacturer’s determination. Many minor modifications are accomplished by a letter-to-file in which the manufacturer documents the change in an internal letter-to-file. The letter-to-file is in lieu of submitting a new 510(k) to obtain clearance for such change. The FDA can always review these letters to file in an inspection. If the FDA disagrees with a manufacturer’s determination regarding whether a new premarket submission is required for the modification of an existing 510(k)-cleared device, the FDA can require the manufacturer to cease marketing and/or recall the modified device until 510(k) clearance or approval of a PMA application is obtained. In addition, in these circumstances, the FDA can impose significant regulatory fines or penalties for failure to submit the requisite application(s).
Over the last several years, the FDA has proposed reforms to its 510(k) clearance process, and such proposals could include increased requirements for clinical data and a longer review period, or could make it more difficult for manufacturers to utilize the 510(k) clearance process for their products. For example, in November 2018, FDA officials announced steps that the FDA intended to take to modernize the premarket notification pathway under Section 510(k) of the FDCA. Among other things, the FDA announced that it planned to develop proposals to drive manufacturers utilizing the 510(k) pathway toward the use of newer predicates. These proposals included plans to potentially sunset certain older devices that were used as predicates under the 510(k) clearance pathway, and to potentially publish a list of devices that have been cleared on the basis of demonstrated substantial equivalence to predicate devices that are more than 10 years old. These proposals have not yet been finalized or adopted, although the FDA may work with Congress to implement such proposals through legislation.

More recently, in September 2019, the FDA published revised final guidance describing an optional “safety and performance based” premarket review pathway for manufacturers of “certain, well-understood device types” to demonstrate substantial equivalence under the 510(k) clearance pathway by showing that such device meets objective safety and performance criteria established by the FDA, thereby obviating the need for manufacturers to compare the safety and performance of their medical devices to specific predicate devices in the clearance process. The FDA maintains a list device types appropriate for the “safety and performance based” pathway and continues to develop product-specific guidance documents that identify the performance criteria for each such device type, as well as the recommended testing methods for such device types.
PMA Approval
Following receipt of a PMA application, the FDA conducts an administrative review to determine whether the application is sufficiently complete to permit a substantive review. If it is not, the agency will refuse to file the PMA. If it is, the FDA will accept the application for filing and begin the review. The FDA has 180 days to review a filed PMA application, although the review of an application more often occurs over a significantly longer period of time. During this review period, the FDA may request additional information or clarification of information already provided, and the FDA may issue a major deficiency letter to the applicant, requesting the applicant’s response to deficiencies communicated by the FDA.
Before approving or denying a PMA, an FDA advisory committee may review the PMA at a public meeting and provide the FDA with the committee’s recommendation on whether the FDA should approve the submission, approve it with specific conditions, or not approve it. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Prior to approval of a PMA, the FDA may conduct inspections of the clinical trial data and clinical trial sites, as well as inspections of the manufacturing facility and processes to ensure compliance with the QSR. PMA devices are also subject to the payment of user fees, and an annual establishment registration fee.
If the FDA evaluation of a PMA is favorable, the FDA will issue either an approval letter, or an approvable letter, the latter of which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of the device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA, or the PMA is withdrawn and resubmitted when the data are available. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which the FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.
New PMA applications or PMA supplements are required for modification to the manufacturing process, equipment or facility, quality control procedures, sterilization, packaging, expiration date, labeling, device specifications, ingredients, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel, depending on the nature of the proposed change.
In approving a PMA application, as a condition of approval, the FDA may also require some form of post-approval study or post-market surveillance, whereby the applicant conducts a follow-up study or follows certain patient groups for a number of years and makes periodic reports to the FDA on the clinical status of those patients when necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional or longer term safety and effectiveness data for the device. The FDA may also approve a PMA application with other post-approval conditions intended to ensure the safety and effectiveness of the device, such as, among other things, restrictions on labeling, promotion, sale, distribution and use. New PMA applications or PMA supplements may also be required for modifications to any approved diagnostic tests, including modifications to our manufacturing processes, device labeling and device design, based on the findings of post-approval studies.

Clinical Trials
Clinical trials are almost always required to support a PMA and are sometimes required to support a 510(k) submission. All clinical investigations of devices to determine safety and effectiveness must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s investigational device exemption (IDE), regulations which govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion of the investigational device, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. If the device presents a “significant risk,” to human health, as defined by the FDA, the FDA requires the device sponsor to submit an IDE application to the FDA, which must become effective prior to commencing human clinical trials. A significant risk device is one that presents a potential for serious risk to the health, safety or welfare of a patient and either is implanted, used in supporting or sustaining human life, substantially important in diagnosing, curing, mitigating or treating disease or otherwise preventing impairment of human health, or otherwise presents a potential for serious risk to a subject. An IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory test results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA unless the FDA notifies the company that the investigation may not begin. If the FDA determines that there are deficiencies or other concerns with an IDE for which it requires modification, the FDA may permit a clinical trial to proceed under a conditional approval.
In addition, the study must be approved by, and conducted under the oversight of, an Institutional Review Board (IRB), for each clinical site. The IRB is responsible for the initial and continuing review of the IDE, and may pose additional requirements for the conduct of the study. If an IDE application is approved by the FDA and one or more IRBs, human clinical trials may begin at a specific number of investigational sites with a specific number of patients, as approved by the FDA. If the device presents a non-significant risk to the patient, a sponsor may begin the clinical trial after obtaining approval for the trial by one or more IRBs without separate approval from the FDA, but must still follow abbreviated IDE requirements, such as monitoring the investigation, ensuring that the investigators obtain informed consent, and labeling and record-keeping requirements. Acceptance of an IDE application for review does not guarantee that the FDA will allow the IDE to become effective and, if it does become effective, the FDA may or may not determine that the data derived from the trials support the safety and effectiveness of the device or warrant the continuation of clinical trials. An IDE supplement must be submitted to, and approved by, the FDA before a sponsor or investigator may make a change to the investigational plan that may affect its scientific soundness, study plan or the rights, safety or welfare of human subjects.
 During a study, the sponsor is required to comply with the applicable FDA requirements, including, for example, trial monitoring, selecting clinical investigators and providing them with the investigational plan, ensuring IRB review, adverse event reporting, record keeping and prohibitions on the promotion of investigational devices or on making safety or effectiveness claims for them. The clinical investigators in the clinical study are also subject to FDA’s regulations and must obtain patient informed consent, rigorously follow the investigational plan and study protocol, control the disposition of the investigational device, and comply with all reporting and recordkeeping requirements. Additionally, after a trial begins, the sponsor, the FDA or the IRB could suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to study subjects outweigh the anticipated benefits.
Post-Market Regulation
After a device is cleared or approved for marketing, numerous and pervasive regulatory requirements continue to apply. These include:
•establishment registration and device listing with the FDA; 
 •QSR requirements, which require manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process; 
 •labeling regulations and FDA prohibitions against the promotion of investigational products, or the promotion of ‘‘off-label’’ uses of cleared or approved products; 
 •requirements related to promotional activities; 
 •clearance or approval of product modifications to 510(k)-cleared devices that could significantly affect safety or effectiveness or that would constitute a major change in intended use of one of our cleared devices, or approval of certain modifications to PMA-approved devices; 
 •medical device reporting regulations, which require that a manufacturer report to the FDA if a device it markets may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or has malfunctioned and the device or a similar device that it markets would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, if the malfunction were to recur; 


•correction, removal and recall reporting regulations, which require that manufacturers report to the FDA field corrections and product recalls or removals if undertaken to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the FDCA that may present a risk to health; 
 •the FDA’s recall authority, whereby the agency can order device manufacturers to recall from the market a product that is in violation of governing laws and regulations; and 
 •post-market surveillance activities and regulations, which apply when deemed by the FDA to be necessary to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device. 
 Device manufacturing processes are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which cover the methods and the facilities and controls for the design, manufacture, testing, production, processes, controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, distribution, installation and servicing of finished devices intended for human use. The QSR also requires, among other things, maintenance of a device master file, device history file, and complaint files. As a manufacturer, will be subject to periodic scheduled or unscheduled inspections by the FDA. Failure to maintain compliance with the QSR requirements could result in the shut-down of, or restrictions on, manufacturing operations and the recall or seizure of products. The discovery of previously unknown problems with any marketed medical device products, including unanticipated adverse events or adverse events of increasing severity or frequency, whether resulting from the use of the device within the scope of its clearance or off-label by a physician in the practice of medicine, could result in restrictions on a medical device, including the removal of the product from the market or voluntary or mandatory device recalls.
The FDA has broad regulatory compliance and enforcement powers. If the FDA determines that a manufacturer has failed to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, it can take a variety of compliance or enforcement actions, which may result in any of the following sanctions:
•warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties; 
 •recalls, withdrawals, or administrative detention or seizure of our products; 
 •operating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production; 
 •refusing or delaying requests for 510(k) marketing clearance or PMA approvals of new products or modified products; 
 •withdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted; 
 •refusal to grant export approvals; or 
 •criminal prosecutions. 
 Telehealth Regulation
The practice of health care professions is subject to various federal, state and local certification and licensing laws, regulations and approvals, relating to, among other things, the adequacy of health care, the practice of medicine and other health professions (including the provision of remote care and cross-coverage practice), equipment, personnel, operating policies and procedures and the prerequisites for prescribing medication. In addition, the provision of health care services through any kind of clinic, facility, storefront or other location open to the public is often subject to state clinic licensure laws akin to those that health facilities like hospitals, surgery centers and urgent care clinics must obtain and maintain. We do not operate or promote any physical place to obtain healthcare and therefore do not believe we are subject to any clinic licensure requirements, but the application of some of these laws to the telehealth we facilitate is unclear and subject to differing interpretation.
Some states have enacted regulations specific to providing services to patients via telehealth. Such regulations include informed consent requirements that some states require providers to obtain from their patients before providing telehealth services. Health professionals who provide professional services using telehealth modalities must, in most instances, hold a valid license to practice the applicable health profession in the state in which the patient is located. In addition, certain states require a physician providing telehealth to be physically located in the same state as the patient. Any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in civil or criminal penalties against us.
State Corporate Practice of Medicine and Fee Splitting Laws
Our relationships with physicians and other health professionals are subject to various state laws, which are intended to prevent unlicensed persons from interfering with or influencing the physician’s professional judgment and prohibiting the sharing of professional services income with non-professional or business interests. These laws vary from state to state and are subject to broad interpretation and enforcement by state regulators. A determination of non-compliance could lead to adverse judicial or administrative action against us and/or our providers, civil or criminal penalties, receipt of cease-and-desist orders from state regulators, loss of provider licenses, or a restructuring of our arrangements with our affiliated professional entities.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws
Although none of our offerings are currently covered by any third-party payor, including any commercial payor or government healthcare program, we may nonetheless be subject to a number of federal and state healthcare regulatory laws that restrict business practices in the healthcare industry. These laws include, but are not limited to, federal and state anti-kickback, false claims, and other healthcare fraud and abuse laws.
The U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any good, facility, item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have antikickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions, and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers and self-pay patients.
The federal false claims, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government, knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the U.S. federal government. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. Moreover, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.
In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits, among other things, the offer or transfer of remuneration, including waivers of copayments and deductible amounts (or any part thereof), to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner or supplier of services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the U.S. federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
The federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to CMS information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain other healthcare professionals beginning in 2022, and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.
Violations of fraud and abuse laws, including federal and state anti-kickback and false claims laws, may be punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid), disgorgement and corporate integrity agreements, which impose, among other things, rigorous operational and monitoring requirements on companies. Similar sanctions and penalties, as well as imprisonment, also can be imposed upon executive officers and employees of such companies.
Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the FTC Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example, the privacy and security regulations under HIPAA establish comprehensive federal standards with respect to the uses and disclosures of PHI by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain health care providers referred to as covered entities, and the business associates with whom such covered entities contract for services, as well as their covered subcontractors, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI. HIPAA requires covered entities and business associates to develop and maintain policies with respect to the protection of, use and disclosure of electronic PHI, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information, and imposes certain notification requirements in the event of a data breach.
As we launch commercial diagnostic tests, we must ensure that our use and disclosure and protection of PHI comply with requirements under the HIPAA privacy and security regulations. Violations of HIPAA may result in significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of PHI, including potential civil and criminal fines and penalties.
In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the GDPR, govern the privacy and security of personal data, including health-related data in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation. For example, California enacted the CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020. Pursuant to the CCPA, certain businesses are required, among other things, to make certain enhanced disclosures related to California residents regarding the use or disclosure of their personal information, allow California residents to opt-out of certain uses and disclosures of their personal information without penalty, provide Californians with other choices related to personal data in our possession, and obtain opt-in consent before engaging in certain uses of personal information relating to California residents under the age of 16. The California Attorney General may seek substantial monetary penalties and injunctive relief in the event of our non-compliance with the CCPA. The CCPA also allows for private lawsuits from California residents in the event of certain data breaches. Moreover, the CPRA recently passed in California. The CPRA significantly modifies the CCPA, creating obligations relating to consumer data including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, with enforcement beginning July 1, 2023. Aspects of the CCPA and CPRA remain uncertain, and we may be required to make modifications to our policies or practices in efforts to comply.
In Europe, the GDPR went into effect in May 2018 and imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of individuals within the EEA. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. Additionally, from January 1, 2021, companies have to comply with the GDPR and the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in UK national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, e.g. fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how United Kingdom data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the United Kingdom will be regulated in the long term.
Privacy and security laws, self-regulatory schemes, regulations, standards, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
Federal Trade Commission
The advertising and promotion of our products in the United States is subject to regulation by the FTC, under the Federal Trade Commission Act (FTC Act). The FTC Act requires that an advertiser possess, at a minimum, a “reasonable basis” to substantiate all product claims before the claims are made, and competent and reliable scientific evidence to substantiate health and therapeutic claims. A lack of adequate substantiation may render such claims deceptive and/or misleading. The FTC Act also governs the appropriate use and necessary disclosures relating to promotional statements made by social media influencers as well as product testimonials.
In recent years, the FTC has initiated numerous investigations of and actions against companies that sell dietary supplements. The FTC has issued guidance to assist companies in understanding and complying with its substantiation requirement. We believe that we have adequate substantiation for all material advertising claims that we make for our products in the United States, and we believe that we have organized the documentation to support our advertising and promotional practices in compliance with these guidelines. However, no assurance can be given that the FTC would reach the same conclusion if it were to review or question our substantiation for our advertising claims in the United States.
The FTC may enforce compliance with the law in a variety of ways, both administratively and judicially, using compulsory process, cease and desist orders, and injunctions. FTC enforcement can result in orders requiring, among other things, limits on advertising, corrective advertising, customer redress, restitution, divestiture of assets, rescission of contracts, and such other relief as the agency deems necessary to protect the public. Violation of these orders could result in substantial financial or other penalties. Although we have not been the subject of any action by the FTC, no assurance can be given that the FTC will not question our advertising or other operations in the United States in the future. Any action in the future by the FTC could materially and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products in the United States.
In addition, state attorneys general and local district attorneys also have jurisdiction to enforce similar state and local consumer protection laws. Our policy is to use advertising that complies with applicable regulations. Nevertheless, there can be no assurance that inadvertent failures to comply with the applicable regulations will not occur. Failure by us to comply with applicable regulations could result in substantial penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and adversely affect our ability to successfully market our products in the United States.
Environmental Matters
Our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers involve the use of hazardous materials and chemicals and produce waste products. We and our suppliers are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and waste products. For example, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), regulates the generation and disposal of certain hazardous wastes. Additionally, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, as amended, and other state, local or foreign laws may impose liabilities for the costs of remediating contaminated real property. We may also be subject to environmental, health and safety claims and proceedings. While we believe we are in compliance with applicable environmental regulations, the failure to fully comply with any such regulations could result in the imposition of significant penalties, fines and/or sanctions which could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Proposition 65
We are also subject to regulation under various state, local, and international laws that include provisions governing, among other things, the formulation, manufacturing, packaging, labeling, advertising, and distribution of dietary supplements. For example, California Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 (Proposition 65), in the state of California is a list of substances deemed to pose a risk of carcinogenicity or birth defects at or above certain levels. If any such listed ingredient exceeds the permissible levels in a marketed product distributed in the state of California, the product must be accompanied by a prominent warning label alerting consumers that the product contains an ingredient linked to cancer or birth defect risk. Private attorney general actions as well as California attorney general actions may be brought against non-compliant products and can result in substantial costs and penalties.
Other Government Regulation
We also cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative or executive action, either in the United States or abroad. For example, certain policies of the Biden Administration may impact our business and industry. The Biden Administration could significantly increase the federal government’s willingness to engage in regulatory and oversight activities such as implementing statutes through rulemaking, issuance of guidance, and review and approval of marketing applications. Any of these could substantially affect any of our regulated products or services.
