ITEM 1. | BUSINESS

Overview
Revance Therapeutics, Inc. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of novel botulinum toxin products for multiple aesthetic and therapeutic indications. We are leveraging our proprietary portfolio of botulinum toxin type A compounds, formulated with our patented and proprietary peptide technology, to address unmet needs in large and growing neurotoxin markets. Our proprietary peptide technology enables delivery of botulinum toxin type A through two investigational drug product candidates, DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (RT002), or RT002 injectable, and DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical Gel (RT001), or RT001 topical. We are pursuing clinical development for RT002 injectable in a broad spectrum of aesthetic and therapeutic indications. Neither formulation of our product candidates contains albumin or any other animal or human-derived materials. We believe this reduces the risk of the transmission of certain viral diseases. We hold worldwide rights for all indications of RT002 injectable and RT001 topical, and the pharmaceutical uses of our proprietary peptide technology.
RT002 injectable is a novel, injectable formulation of botulinum toxin type A designed to be a targeted and long-lasting injectable botulinum toxin treatment. We are studying RT002 injectable for aesthetic indications, such as glabellar (frown) lines and therapeutic indications, such as cervical dystonia and plantar fasciitis. We believe RT002 injectable has the potential to expand into additional aesthetic and therapeutic indications in the future. We are planning to conduct additional preclinical development with RT001 topical for potential future therapeutic and aesthetic indications.

Our Product Candidates 
DaxibotulinumtoxinA for Injection (RT002, or RT002 Injectable)
We are developing an injectable formulation of botulinum toxin type A, which we refer to as RT002 injectable, for indications where a long-lasting effect is desired. We believe, and our preclinical and clinical studies using RT002 indicate, that daxibotulinumtoxinA combined with our novel peptide may permit safe administration of higher doses of botulinum toxin and may result in long-lasting effect. We are initially focusing on developing RT002 for the treatment of glabellar lines, cervical dystonia, and plantar fasciitis.
Glabellar Lines
Glabellar lines are the result of the gathering of the tissue between the eyebrows into a fold. They are caused by the repeated action of underlying muscles associated with facial expression. Years of squinting and frowning tend to leave deep wrinkles in the skin between the eyebrows and on the bridge of the nose, across the forehead and at the corners of the eyes. On many people, frown lines produce an angry or sad look that detracts from a pleasant facial appearance. Physical, emotional and social reasons for treating frown lines and forehead furrows include improved appearance and enhanced self-esteem. The most common cosmetic use of the market leader, BOTOX® Cosmetic, is for the treatment of glabellar lines, which we believe represented a global market of nearly $1 billion in 2015. In general, consumers enjoy the benefits of botulinum toxin injections 
1

and express a high rate of satisfaction. Longevity, or duration of effect, is the one area where consumers are less satisfied and desire longer duration.
Botulinum toxin treatment of glabellar lines is the largest proportion of cosmetic neurotoxin sales in the United States and, according to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, botulinum toxin treatment is the number one nonsurgical cosmetic procedure in the United States. We believe RT002 injectable has the potential to satisfy significant unmet needs in this market. According to market research we conducted in April 2015, which involved a quantitative study with one hundred dermatologists and plastic surgeons, 72% of the physicians surveyed stated that longer duration is a significant unmet need in the market for the botulinum toxin treatment of glabellar lines and 75% stated that they are extremely likely to use RT002 injectable based on both injectable data available during the study and the RT002 injectable product concept.
Also, primary qualitative market research among aesthetic physicians, patients and office practice managers indicated that they were very impressed by the clinical data generated in the RT002 Phase 2 BELMONT study. In fact, a majority of those physicians interviewed reported that if RT002 injectable demonstrated similar results in Phase 3 trials the increased duration of effect would cause them to change their treatment or purchase habits from currently available botulinum toxins to include RT002 injectable. Duration of effect is reported to be the greatest unmet need and the primary driver of adoption amongst physicians, patients and office managers.
We believe that a product that shows increased persistence of effect over time, with a slower return to baseline and a meaningful consumer benefit up to six months would fit very nicely into the current treatment regimen and consumer habits. Quantitative market research shows that the majority of consumers only visit their physicians twice per year for treatments and the longer duration would mean that they would remain satisfied between treatments.
We believe that RT002 injectable may provide the following benefits to patients and physicians for treatment of glabellar lines, as compared to the market leader, BOTOX® Cosmetic:

• | RT002 injectable may permit longer lasting effect up to 6 months and increase response rates.


• | RT002 injectable may provide the ability to administer higher doses without associated adverse events. This could potentially decrease unwanted side effects like eyelid ptosis (droopy eyelids), which leads to patient dissatisfaction.

We believe that RT002 injectable may provide the following benefits to physicians:

• | RT002 injectable may be simple to use and consistent with the method of administration of the market leader. Minimal training is required because administration would be similar to currently available marketed products.


• | RT002 injectable may lead to more sustained patient satisfaction between treatments, which is critical for self-pay procedures.


• | RT002 injectable could potentially expand their practices by appealing to consumers who are not willing to come in multiple times per year to sustain the benefits of treatment.


• | Physicians may be willing to pay more for RT002 injectable compared to currently available neurotoxins as they believe that they could easily pass that cost along to their patients, who would be willing to pay for increased duration of effect.


• | In phase 2 studies, RT002 injectable appeared to be well-tolerated with no significant safety concerns.

Development of RT002 Injectable for Treatment of Glabellar Lines
Phase 3 Clinical Trials - We are in Phase 3 clinical development for RT002 injectable in North America for the treatment of glabellar lines. During the fourth quarter of 2016, we initiated subject dosing in our SAKURA Phase 3 program. 
The Phase 3 clinical program includes two randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trials (named SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2) to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single administration of RT002 for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adults. SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 are expected to enroll a total of approximately 600 subjects at multiple sites in the United States and Canada. In both trials, subjects will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to either the RT002 or placebo treatment groups, respectively. Post-treatment, subjects will be followed for at least 24 weeks and up to 36 weeks. The primary efficacy endpoint of the pivotal trials will be a composite of the proportion of subjects who achieve a score of 0 or 1 
2

(none or mild) and a two-point improvement from baseline in glabellar line severity on the Investigator Global Assessment-Facial Wrinkle Severity (IGA-FWS) and Patient Facial Wrinkle Severity (PFWS) scales, at maximum contraction (frown), at Week 4. Duration of the reduction of severity of the glabellar lines will be assessed as a secondary efficacy endpoint in the Phase 3 pivotal trials. We plan to share topline results from the SAKURA 1 and SAKURA 2 pivotal trials in the fourth quarter of 2017.
In addition to the two planned pivotal trials, the SAKURA Phase 3 program includes a long-term, open-label safety trial (SAKURA 3), which is designed to evaluate the long-term safety of RT002 injectable for the treatment of moderate to severe glabellar lines in adults following both single and repeat treatment administration. The long-term safety trial is expected to enroll approximately 1,500 subjects at multiple sites in the US and Canada. Depending on the number of treatments and duration of follow-up, a subject may be on trial for a maximum of 86 weeks. 
We have designed SAKURA 3 to support a safety database adequate for both domestic and international marketing applications, and will continue to conduct clinical trials with periodic, thorough analysis of benefits and risks.
Assuming successful completion of our SAKURA Phase 3 Program, we plan to file marketing applications in the United States, European Union and Canada followed by submissions in Latin American countries, such as Brazil, and certain other territories in Asia.
European Union Agency Interactions - We requested scientific guidance from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, on the development of RT002 injectable for the treatment of glabellar lines and the proposed Phase 3 program in 2016. The EMA provided comments on Quality, Nonclinical and Clinical programs. Overall, the EMA agreed with the proposed programs and provided details and suggestions to be considered for our marketing application. We have taken the EMA comments into consideration in the Phase 3 program and will provide data to support the various requests in the marketing application.
Pre-Phase 3 FDA Interactions - In 2016, we completed a pre-Phase 3 meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, regarding RT002 injectable for the treatment of glabellar lines. Based upon the discussion with the FDA and the minutes received following the meeting, we submitted an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) for the SAKURA Phase 3 clinical program for RT002 in glabellar lines and other supportive studies required for a Biologics License Application (BLA) submission. 
Phase 1 and 2 Clinical Trials - RT002 has demonstrated long-lasting effect and appeared to provide safe administration of botulinum toxin in Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, even at high targeted doses. Long-lasting effect was first demonstrated in 2014 in the final cohort of a four-cohort Phase 1/2 clinical dose escalation trial conducted outside the United States for improvement of glabellar lines. In the trial, RT002 injectable met its primary efficacy and safety endpoints. The open-label, dose escalating, Phase 1/2 trial enrolled 48 adults. All subjects had moderate to severe wrinkles at baseline, measured using the 4-point Global Line Severity Scale (GLSS). In summary, the data showed:

• | 96% of subjects were rated with None or Mild wrinkle severity at maximum frown 4 weeks post-treatment using the GLSS as assessed by the clinical investigator.


• | 83% of subjects assessed themselves as achieving None or Mild wrinkles at maximum frown at the same time point.


• | In the final cohort, the only one where duration of effect was measured, RT002 injectable achieved a median duration of 29.4 weeks or seven months based on both investigator and subject assessments.


• | In this final cohort, 60% of subjects maintained None or Mild wrinkle severity at 6 months.


• | RT002 injectable was well-tolerated, and there was no evidence of spread beyond the treatment site at any dose; additionally, adverse event rates did not change in frequency, severity, or type with increasing doses.

RT002 appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated with minimal adverse events in our Phase 1/2 trial. Adverse events were generally mild, localized and transient. The most common adverse events observed were headache and injection site reactions. There was no evidence of spread beyond the treatment site at any dose. There were no serious adverse events or evidence of any systemic exposure based on clinical laboratory results and related evaluations. Adverse event rates did not change in frequency, severity, or type with increasing doses.
Based on the results of this study, in 2015 we conducted BELMONT, a Phase 2, Randomized, Double-Blind, DosE Ranging, Active and PLacebo Controlled, Multi-Center Study to Evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, and Duration of Effect Of RT002, a BotuliNum Toxin Type A for Injection, injectable to treat glabellar lines. The primary endpoints for the study were the investigator's assessment of glabellar line severity at maximum frown at Week 24 and median duration of effect from the 
3

date of treatment back to baseline severity. The BELMONT trial evaluated treatment for glabellar lines in 268 subjects with moderate to severe glabellar lines at nine investigational sites in Canada. The trial compared the safety, efficacy and duration of three doses of RT002 injectable, the labeled dose of the current market leader BOTOX® Cosmetic/VISTABEL® and a placebo control in a randomized 1:1:1:1:1 trial design. In 2015, we reported positive 24-week results from the trial that showed RT002 injectable achieved its primary efficacy measurement at four weeks for all doses of RT002 injectable and that such efficacy was highly statistically significant as compared to placebo. In addition, the 40 unit dose of RT002 injectable demonstrated a 23.6-week median duration versus BOTOX® Cosmetic with an 18.8-week median duration. Across all cohorts, RT002 injectable appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated. 
Cervical Dystonia and Other Muscle Movement Disorders
We have also been developing RT002 for the treatment of cervical dystonia, a muscle movement disorder. We will continue to evaluate development for other therapeutic indications, such as neurological movement and other disorders, based on the results of our current preclinical studies and clinical trials. Muscle movement disorders, such as cervical dystonia, are neurological conditions that affect a person's ability to control muscle activity in one or more areas of the body. Muscle spasticity happens after the body's nervous system has been damaged, most commonly by a stroke, disease, or trauma. While not life-threatening, spasticity can be painful and may have a significant effect on a person's quality of life. Some tasks, like getting dressed or bathing, become difficult, and a person's self-esteem may be affected by their abnormal posture. Common muscle movement disorders include cervical dystonia (excessive pulling of the muscles in the neck and shoulder), upper or lower limb spasticity (stiffness in muscles), and blepharospasm (involuntary closing of the eyelids). Botulinum toxin type A has proven safe and effective for such uses, as the most common treatment for muscle movement disorders is to relax the muscle by injecting it with botulinum toxin. We believe muscle movement disorders accounted for nearly $1 billion of therapeutic neurotoxin sales globally in 2015. 
RT002 Injectable for Treatment of Cervical Dystonia
We initiated a Phase 2 dose-escalating, open-label clinical study of RT002 injectable to evaluate safety, preliminary efficacy, and duration of effect of RT002 injectable in subjects with moderate to severe isolated cervical dystonia symptoms of the neck. In December 2016, we announced positive interim results from the Phase 2 clinical trial. The interim data showed that RT002 injectable appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated, demonstrated a median duration of greater than 24 weeks for the first cohort of the study, and displayed a clinically significant impact on cervical dystonia signs and symptoms. The trial enrolled 37 subjects and follows three sequential treatment cohorts for up to a total of 24 weeks after treatment for each cohort. The trial’s first cohort of 12 subjects received a single dose of up to 200 units of RT002 injectable, the second cohort of 12 subjects received between 200 and 300 units, and the third cohort of 13 subjects received from 300 to 450 units. Later-enrolled subjects in the second and third cohorts had yet to complete the trial’s 24-week protocol. We plan to share 24-week results in the second quarter of 2017.
Key interim results of the cervical dystonia trial are as follows:
Safety. In all three cohorts, RT002 injectable appeared to be generally safe and well-tolerated. There were no serious adverse events and no dose-dependent increase in adverse events. The treatment-related adverse events were transient and mild to moderate in severity, except for one case of neck pain reported as severe, with a duration of 2 days. The most common adverse events were dysphagia, or difficulty in swallowing (10.8%), injection site redness (8.1%), injection site pain (5.4%), muscle tightness (5.4%) and muscle weakness (5.4%). For reference, trials for botulinum type A products approved to treat cervical dystonia have reported adverse events for dysphagia ranging from 13% to 39%.
Efficacy. The trial’s 4-week primary efficacy measurement was the improvement in dystonia symptoms as determined by reduction from baseline on the Toronto Western Spasmodic Torticollis Rating Scale (TWSTRS)-Total score. RT002 injectable showed a clinically significant mean reduction of 16.8 from baseline, or 38%, across all three cohorts at Week 4. In cohort one, with a mean dose of 174 units, the majority of the 46% reduction observed in the TWSTRS-Total score at Week 4 was preserved at Week 24, with a 33% mean reduction from baseline observed. Clinically meaningful mean reductions in the TWSTRS Severity, Disability and Pain subscales were consistent and observed at all follow-up visits in the first cohort. Later-enrolled subjects in the second and third cohorts had not yet reached the 24-week point. For reference, placebo-controlled trials with botulinum type A products approved to treat cervical dystonia have reported a reduction from baseline in the TWSTRS-Total score that ranged from 22% to 26% at Week 4.
4

Duration of Effect. Duration of effect for this trial was defined as the number of weeks from treatment until the return of symptoms that warrant retreatment, based on the subject’s target TWSTRS score. The median duration of effect was at least 24 weeks (6 months) for subjects in cohort one (n=12), and at least 16 weeks for subjects in cohort two (n=11), using the complete 16 week follow up data. In cohort one, no subjects had returned to baseline at Week 24 and only one subject in cohort two, to date, has returned to baseline, which occurred at the Week 24 visit. In cohort one, RT002 achieved a median duration of at least 24 weeks based on three different assessments, including 1) the number of weeks from treatment until a subject reaches or exceeds their target TWSTRS-Total score, 2) improvement (score >0) on the Clinician Global Impression of Change (CGIC), and 3) TWSTRS-Total score return to baseline. For reference, current treatment of cervical dystonia calls for injection of botulinum toxin approximately every 3 months, or 4 times per year.
Plantar Fasciitis
We are also developing RT002 for the treatment of plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis is a painful affliction caused by inflammation of the ligament running along the bottom of the foot and is the most common cause of heel pain. Heel pain is the most common complaint of patients who visit podiatrists and orthopedic foot and ankle surgeons. Eighty percent of reported heel pain complaints are due to plantar fasciitis. Plantar fasciitis is estimated to affect 10 to 18 million individuals in the United States. Risk factors include age, long distance running, excessive weight, abnormal foot posture, use of poor foot wear, and repetitive trauma.
Symptoms can last six months or more, sometimes requiring surgery. In the United States alone, more than two million patients undergo treatment for plantar fasciitis each year. Treatment options for less severe cases include leg and foot stretching exercises, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, shoe inserts, heel pads, and night splints. More severe or refractory cases are currently treated with steroid injections, extracorporeal shock wave therapy, platelet rich plasma injections, and/or surgery. Preclinical and clinical research suggests a neurotoxin candidate such as RT002 injectable may provide patients with sustained relief from chronic heel pain and support healing of the plantar fascia without the risks of plantar fascia rupture or atrophy of the fat pad that can occur with corticosteroid injections, a common treatment.
No botulinum toxin is approved for treating plantar fasciitis; the clinical endpoints, however, are well established. Published estimates place the annual U.S. evaluation and treatment market for plantar fasciitis at more than $250 million, and we believe the market could grow significantly larger if patients had a compelling neurotoxin treatment option.
RT002 Injectable for Treatment of Plantar Fasciitis
In 2016, we initiated a Phase 2 prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial of RT002 injectable in the therapeutic indication of plantar fasciitis. This study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a single administration of RT002 injectable in reducing the signs and symptoms of plantar fasciitis. The study is expected to enroll approximately 60 subjects in the United States. The study's primary efficacy endpoint is the improvement in the American Orthopedic Foot and Ankle Score (AOFAS). Subjects will be followed for 16 weeks post treatment. Topline clinical results from this study are expected in the second half of 2017.
DaxibotulinumtoxinA Topical Gel (RT001 or RT001 Topical)
RT001 topical is a topical gel formulation of botulinum toxin type A in a proprietary single-use applicator. The botulinum toxin in RT001 topical blocks neuromuscular transmission by binding to receptor sites on motor or sympathetic nerve terminals, entering the nerve terminals and inhibiting the release of specific neurotransmitters. RT001 is designed to provide treatment with no needles, no downtime, no bruising and no pain.
We completed RT001 topical Phase 3 clinical trials for the treatment of lateral canthal lines (crow’s feet) and an initial Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of primary axillary hyperhidrosis. We discontinued clinical development of RT001 topical for the treatment of crow’s feet in 2016 following the results from our REALISE 1 Phase 3 clinical trial, which was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of RT001 topical compared to placebo in subjects with moderate to severe crow's feet. Based on the REALISE 1 results, we also decided not to pursue further clinical development of RT001 topical for the treatment primary axillary hyperhidrosis. We are studying RT001 topical in a preclinical setting for therapeutic and aesthetic applications where topical administration of botulinum toxin provides a meaningful advantage over injection.

Preclinical Program
In accordance with international guidelines and in consultation with the FDA, we have also conducted a nonclinical development program for RT001 topical. The program included preclinical efficacy, safety bioavailability and single and repeat dose toxicity studies of RT001 topical, including chronic studies of up to nine months' duration. Genotoxicity, local tolerance and formulation bridging studies were also conducted, along with reproductive toxicity testing. Together, these studies supported prior and possible future clinical development of RT001 topical.
Based on the results of future preclinical studies, we will determine further development of indications for RT001 topical, such as hyperhidrosis, neuropsychiatric disorders, and chronic inflammatory diseases.
Hyperhidrosis
According to published medical articles, hyperhidrosis affects approximately nine million people in the United States (or 2.8% of the current population), with approximately half experiencing axillary hyperhidrosis, or underarm excessive sweating. Prevalence in the United States is slightly higher among men than women, but women are more likely to take action to have the condition treated. In 2014, the International Hyperhidrosis Society or IHHS fielded a survey among its email subscribers. While it is recognized that consumers who regularly read newsletters from the IHHS are likely to be more severe sufferers and those who are more likely to treat their disease, this survey does provide up to date information on this population. Additionally, we believe that these consumers may be early adopters of new treatments. In this population, hyperhidrosis is a multi-focal disease where the majority of people (81%) suffer in more than one focal area in addition to their underarms, most commonly the hands and feet. Among this group of consumers, 90% have sought assistance from a medical professional (compared to 38% cited in medical literature that describes the general population of hyperhidrosis sufferers). Of the 90% who seek medical assistance, 79% receive a diagnosis of hyperhidrosis, and of those, 87% seek some type of treatment. The most commonly used treatments and percentage of respondents that use each are:

• | Over-the-counter antiperspirants (78%)


• | Prescription antiperspirants (77%)


• | Oral medication (53%)


• | Botulinum Toxin Injections (41%)


• | Iontophoresis, or the use of electrical current on skin (38%)


• | Surgery (13%)


• | Other (10%)

Neuropsychiatric Disorders
Migraine Headache. Migraine headache is a central nervous system disorder characterized as moderate to severe headache and often includes additional symptoms such as nausea and vomiting. The global market for treatment of migraine headache was estimated to be $3.2 billion in 2015 according to a report published by Decision Resource Group. Migraine headache affects 38 million people in the United States, 4 million of whom suffer from chronic migraine headache. In the United States, this debilitating condition results in $36 billion each year in healthcare and lost productivity costs, according to the Migraine Research Foundation. Injected delivery of botulinum toxin has been validated as a therapeutically effective pharmaceutical agent for the preventive treatment of migraine headache. Botox® was approved for the treatment of chronic migraine headache in 2010. In 2015, BOTOX® sales for migraine were estimated to be more than $500 million. However, the treatment requires up to 31 injections in a patient’s head and neck and may have significant side effects, including the potential for injected botulinum toxin to diffuse to neighboring sites causing muscle weakness and pain, sometimes even triggering migraine headache attacks.
Chronic Daily Headache. Chronic daily headache, which is defined as an idiopathic headache occurring on more than 15 days per month for at least 3 months and for a daily duration of at least 4 hours, is considered a headache disorder that may benefit from treatment with botulinum toxin A. It is likely that those patients with chronic daily headache (with or without medication overuse) who are severely impaired (i.e., highest loss of productivity) and who are not receiving any other prophylactic treatment are the appropriate group of patients that may benefit from treatment with botulinum toxin. Since this total patient group shows a prevalence of up to 4% in population based epidemiological studies, it is warranted to further elucidate the clinical efficacy of botulinum toxin in this subgroup.
6

Major Depressive Disorder. Major depressive disorder is a common and serious disease that may be resistant to routine pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic treatment approaches. Preliminary studies have shown a single treatment of botulinum toxin in the forehead region can improve symptoms of depression in patients with major depressive disorder, or MDD, as defined by DSM-IV criteria. Positive effects on mood have been observed in subjects who underwent treatment of glabellar lines with botulinum toxin and, in an open case series, depression remitted or improved after such treatment.
Neuropathic Pain. Neuropathic pain is a condition that may arise as a result of a lesion or disease affecting the nervous system and, as a collection of syndromes, is often chronic in nature causing significant negative impact to quality of life. Existing treatments include antidepressants, serotonin inhibitors and calcium channel agonists, each of which require daily dosing and are often accompanied by side effects and modest efficacy. More recently, injected botulinum toxin has been shown to address many forms of neuropathic pain and provide extended relief, of approximately three months, in line with the known duration profile for botulinum toxin treatment of other targets. RT001 topical represents an appealing alternative with its topical delivery, allowing relatively large areas to be treated without injection pain while maintaining the potential benefit of extended duration from a single treatment of botulinum toxin.
Chronic Inflammatory Diseases
Rosacea. Rosacea is a common skin condition that causes redness, dilated blood vessels and may produce small red pus-filled bumps of the face. It affects an estimated 16 million Americans, yet only a small fraction are being treated. While there is no cure for rosacea and the cause is unknown, medical therapy is available to control or reverse its signs and symptoms.
Psoriasis. Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that affects an estimated 125 million people worldwide, 2 to 3 percent of the total population, and is the most prevalent autoimmune disease according to the World Psoriasis Day consortium. Animal-model studies have shown the potential role of botulinum toxin in addressing inflammatory skin conditions, specifically demonstrating that botulinum toxin injections improved the clinical appearance of psoriasis. 
Eczema. Eczema is another chronic inflammatory skin condition marked by dry, itchy skin. Atopic dermatitis - the most common form of eczema - affects millions of people, including an estimated six to 10 percent of children. Early research suggests that there could be a role for botulinum toxin in combating itch by better understanding the interaction of the vascular system in inflammatory skin conditions. While there are available therapies to treat eczema and psoriasis, not all therapies are equally effective. 
In inflammatory conditions such as these, a topical botulinum toxin could potentially provide a viable treatment alternative to the current standard treatment, topical steroids, which have side effects, such as rosacea, perioral dermatitis, and acne. 
Rheumatic conditions. In rheumatology, botulinum toxin may be able to help treat painful blood vessel conditions, such as Raynaud’s disease and Scleroderma. In initial studies, botulinum toxin injections have shown overall improvement in patient pain as well as a reduction in soft tissue ulceration.
Our Technology 
Our Proprietary Peptide Technology
Combining our proprietary peptide technology with active drug macromolecules such as daxibotulinumtoxinA may help address currently unfulfilled needs in aesthetic medicine and various therapeutic categories. Employing our proprietary peptide technology may ensure overall formulation performance of the RT002 injectable where the focus is on delivering the first potentially long-acting neurotoxin. With novel as well as multiple indication areas in clinical development, our DaxibotulinumtoxinA compound is often referred to as "a pipeline within a product."
RT002 Injectable Delivery of Botulinum Toxin
RT002 injectable utilizes our proprietary botulinum toxin-peptide complex in a saline-based formulation. In RT002 injectable, the peptide interacts with both extracellular structures and cell surface receptors in the targeted muscle. This interaction restricts the toxin molecule to the target site and potentially reduces unwanted spread to other neighboring muscles. 
7

We believe that by limiting the spread of RT002 injectable to neighboring muscles, RT002 injectable is likely to be tolerated at higher doses than Botox® Cosmetic. Additionally, at doses where the spread of BOTOX® Cosmetic and RT002 injectable were compared, RT002 injectable appeared to be more targeted with longer duration in our preclinical studies. Nonclinical and clinical data taken together suggest that RT002 injectable may provide long duration of effect at the target muscle and reduce spread to untargeted muscles.
The Botulinum Toxin Market
Botulinum toxin is a protein and neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. Since 1989 botulinum toxin in an injectable dose form has been used to treat a variety of aesthetic and therapeutic indications in the United States. Botulinum toxin has been approved for a variety of therapeutic indications including cervical dystonia, upper limb spasticity, blepharospasm, strabismus associated with neurological movement disorders, hyperhidrosis, migraine headache, overactive bladder conditions and, most recently, lower limb spasticity. In the United States, botulinum toxin has been approved to treat two aesthetic indications, glabellar lines and lateral canthal lines, although we believe that botulinum toxin is widely used for other aesthetic indications. Only three products, Allergan’s Botox® Cosmetic, Ipsen and Galderma’s Dysport®, and Merz’s Xeomin®, each of which is delivered in an injectable form, have been approved for the treatment of glabellar lines in the United States.
According to Global Industry Analysts, Inc. or GIA, the global market for botulinum toxin was estimated to be $3.7 billion in 2016 and is anticipated to reach $6.6 billion by 2022, registering a Compounded Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10.7% over the analysis period of 2015 to 2022. The market is split into aesthetic ($1.6 billion in 2016) and therapeutic indications ($2.0 billion in 2016). We expect continued growth of the botulinum toxin market to be driven by new indications and product launches in new geographies. According to clinicaltrials.gov, there are nearly 240 active clinical trials for a wide range of uses of botulinum toxin, with approximately one-fifth of these identified as being in Phase 3 clinical development. While we are unaware of any clinical trials for potentially competitive long-lasting products that may reach the market before RT002 injectable, it is possible that clinical trials for such potentially competitive products have occurred or are occurring.
The Opportunity for Botulinum Toxins for Aesthetic Indications
Today’s culture places significant value on physical appearance, leading to widespread adoption of anti-aging and aesthetic treatments. The aesthetic market has grown dramatically in the United States, driven by a large population of consumers who are looking to delay signs of aging and improve general appearance. 
Injectable botulinum toxin treatments are the single largest cosmetic procedure in the United States and the rest of the world. According to the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, or ASAPS, a strong consumer preference for non-surgical options and the increasing availability of effective alternatives have prompted adoption of non-surgical aesthetic procedures by a broader patient population. These trends have made non-surgical procedures the primary driver of growth in the aesthetic medicine market, accounting for 85% of the total number of procedures performed in 2015, according to the ASAPS annual statistics. Injectable botulinum toxin was the most frequently performed non-surgical procedure in 2015, with 4.3 million procedures in the US, an 18.9% increase over 2014. Injectable treatments overall, botulinum toxins and dermal fillers, increased 21% in 2015, according to ASAPS. Injectable botulinum toxin treatments have been the number one nonsurgical procedure since 2000, according to ASAPS. The number of procedures surpassed 4 million annually for the first time in 2015.
The Opportunity for Botulinum Toxins for Therapeutic Indications
While currently approved botulinum toxin products may be better known for their aesthetic applications, according to GIA, the fastest-growing segment of the botulinum toxin market in the United States and Europe is actually for therapeutic indications. This growth has been driven largely by the approval of botulinum toxin products in new indications such as preventive treatment of chronic migraine headache and upper limb spasticity in 2010, urinary incontinence in 2011, overactive bladder in 2013, and lower limb spasticity in 2016. Botulinum toxin’s ability to affect neuromuscular junctions, muscle activity or the release of neuropeptides, neurotransmitters and neuromediators in a controlled manner has enabled it to be developed and used in a wide range of therapeutic indications. 
In addition to the approved therapeutic indications mentioned above, botulinum toxin products are being evaluated in clinical trials in multiple other therapeutic indications including acne, rosacea, skin and wound healing, scar reduction, hair loss treatments, plantar fasciitis and several musculoskeletal conditions.

We believe there is opportunity to improve injectable botulinum toxin use in neurological movement and other disorders. Muscle movement disorders are neurological conditions that affect a person’s ability to control muscle activity in one or more areas of the body. Muscle spasticity happens after the body’s nervous system has been damaged, most commonly by a stroke, disease, or trauma. Muscle spasticity can be painful and may have a significant effect on a person’s quality of life. Some tasks, like getting dressed or bathing, become difficult, and a person’s self-esteem may be affected by their abnormal posture. Common muscle movement disorders include cervical dystonia (excessive pulling of the muscles in the neck and shoulder), and upper or lower limb spasticity (stiffness in arm or leg muscles). Botulinum toxin type A has proven safe and effective for such uses, as the most common treatment for muscle movement disorders is to relax the muscle by injecting it with botulinum toxin. However, such injections must be repeated every 3-4 months and require large doses, typically more than 200 BOTOX® units each treatment. As a result of the discomfort associated with muscle movement disorders and the associated demand for treatment that currently requires up to four visits per year, we believe that there is a significant need for a long-lasting and targeted injectable botulinum toxin.
Our Strategy
Our objective is to be a leading provider of botulinum toxin products across multiple aesthetic and therapeutic indications in both injectable and topical dose forms and to expand the market for botulinum toxin products. To achieve this objective, we plan to develop and commercialize two proprietary, patent-protected product candidates: first, our RT002 injectable botulinum toxin, followed by our RT001 topical botulinum toxin.
Key elements of our strategy are:


• | Advance RT002 Injectable Clinical Development. We initiated subject dosing of our SAKURA Phase 3 program of RT002 injectable for the treatment of glabellar lines in 2016. We also plan to continue our Phase 2 trials for the treatment of cervical dystonia and plantar fasciitis and initiate future development of RT002 injectable in other indications where differentiation or first-mover advantage can be achieved. 


• | Build Our Own Sales And Marketing Capabilities To Commercialize RT002 Injectable in North America. If RT002 injectable is approved for the treatment of glabellar lines by the FDA, we intend to build our own commercial organization to launch in North America. Specifically, we plan to build a specialty sales force to target key physicians who perform the majority of aesthetic procedures, including dermatologists, plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons, and oculo-plastic surgeons. 


• | Expand the Global Market for Botulinum Toxin Products. We believe RT002 injectable has the ability to expand the botulinum toxin market by appealing to patients who seek a long-lasting effect. We believe RT001 topical and other possible dose forms can expand the overall botulinum toxin market beyond the current patient base by bringing in new patients who would prefer a needle-free approach to treatment and a more tolerable procedure. 


• | Establish Selective Strategic Partnerships to Maximize the Commercial Potential of our Product Candidates and our Proprietary Peptide Technology. Outside of North America, we plan to evaluate whether to commercialize our product candidates on our own or in collaboration with potential partners and distributors. Specifically, assuming regulatory approval of RT002 injectable outside of the United States, we will evaluate whether to build in-house commercial capabilities in one or more foreign countries or to seek commercialization partners to maximize the profitability of RT002 injectable. Additionally, our proprietary peptide technology can be used for molecules other than botulinum toxin. We plan to partner or license opportunistically the technology to monetize our technology platform. 


• | Maximize the Value of our Botulinum Toxin Cell Line and Manufacturing Assets. We have developed an integrated manufacturing, analytics, research and development facility that is capable of producing proprietary forms of botulinum toxin for Revance and any future partners. 

Manufacturing and Operations 
We have established capabilities for the production of botulinum toxin type A, including bulk drug substance and both topical and injectable finished drug product. Botulinum toxin is regulated as a Select Agent under authority of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, and as such requires that we perform our operations in compliance with CDC regulations. We are in good standing under our Select Agent license with the CDC. We have assembled a team of experienced individuals in the technical disciplines of chemistry, biology and engineering and have appropriately equipped laboratory space to support ongoing research and development efforts in our botulinum toxin product development platform. We have the ability to manufacture our own botulinum toxin to support our clinical trial programs and eventually, our commercial production. We believe that having direct control over our manufacturing processes will enable us to develop additional pharmaceutical product configurations effectively and with a competitive cost structure.

We manufacture and perform testing for both bulk drug substance and finished dosage forms of drug product to support our RT002 injectable and our RT001 topical product candidates. The additional components required for our product lines, the peptide for both RT002 injectable and RT001 topical and the diluent and delivery applicator for RT001 topical, are all manufactured by third parties under contract with us. See the section entitled “Outsourced Components” below for additional information.
Drug Substance
Manufacture of the drug substance for RT002 injectable and RT001 topical is based on microbial fermentation followed by product recovery and purification steps. The process is entirely free of animal and human-derived materials and depends on standard raw materials available commercially. The process is already scaled to support all future commercial demands. Bulk drug substance is stable when stored for extended periods, which allows us to establish reserves of drug substance and allows periodic drug substance production to replenish inventories as needed.
Drug Product
Manufacture of topical and injectable dose forms to support the RT002 injectable and RT001 topical clinical programs is currently performed at our fill-finish facility. The manufacturing process consists of bulk compounding, liquid fill and freeze-drying to support acceptable shelf-life duration. We plan to perform further scale-up of RT002 injectable drug product manufacturing to meet anticipated commercial demand and may utilize internal capacity, a third-party manufacturer or a combination of both. 
Outsourced Components
We contract with third parties for the manufacture of our botulinum toxin and the additional components required for our products, which includes the manufacture of bulk peptide through American Peptide Company, Inc., or American Peptide, diluent through Hospira Worldwide, Inc., or Hospira. American Peptide and Hospira have been or were recently acquired by Bachem and Pfizer, Inc., respectively.
Our agreement with List Biological Laboratories, Inc., or List Laboratories, a developer of botulinum toxin, includes certain milestone payments related to the clinical development of our botulinum toxin products and the toxin manufacturing process. There is a royalty with an effective rate ranging from low-to-mid single-digit percentages of future sales of botulinum toxin. Our agreement with List Laboratories will remain in effect until expiration of our royalty obligations and may be terminated earlier on mutual agreement or because of a material breach by either party.
Our agreement with American Peptide includes development, manufacture and supply of peptide in accordance with certain specifications. This agreement also includes certain quality control and inspection provisions through which we can ensure the satisfactory quality of our peptide. Our agreement with American Peptide will remain in effect until 2020 and may be terminated earlier by either party following advance notice or a material breach by either party.
Our agreement with Hospira includes product development services and manufacture and supply services and requires that we provide Hospira with advance forecasts of our product needs. This agreement also includes minimum purchase requirements once we have commercialized our products. Our agreement with Hospira will remain in effect for seven years, subject to extensions, after we commercialize our products and may be terminated earlier by either party following advance notice and good faith consultation.
Competition 
We expect to enter highly competitive pharmaceutical and medical device markets. Successful competitors in the pharmaceutical and medical device markets have the ability to effectively discover, develop, test and obtain regulatory approvals for products, as well as the ability to effectively commercialize, market and promote approved products, including communicating the effectiveness, safety and value of products to actual and prospective customers and medical staff. Numerous companies are engaged in the development, manufacture and marketing of healthcare products competitive with those that we are developing.
Many of our competitors have substantially greater manufacturing, financial, research and development, personnel and marketing resources than we do. Our competitors may also have more experience and expertise in obtaining marketing approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. In addition to product development, testing, approval and promotion, other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical and medical device industries include industry consolidation, product quality 
10

and price, product technology, reputation, customer service and access to technical information. As a result, our competitors may be able to develop competing or superior technologies and processes, and compete more aggressively and sustain that competition over a longer period of time than we could. Our technologies and products may be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances or entirely different approaches developed by one or more of our competitors. As more companies develop new intellectual property in our markets, the possibility of a competitor acquiring patent or other rights that may limit our products or potential products increases, which could lead to litigation.
Upon marketing approval, the first expected use of our products will be to treat glabellar lines, cervical dystonia and plantar fasciitis, followed by potential use to treat other aesthetic and therapeutic conditions. The technologies with which we expect to compete directly are injectable and topical neuromodulators.
Injectable and Topical Neuromodulators 
Our primary competitors in the pharmaceutical market are companies offering injectable dose forms of botulinum toxin, including:


• | BOTOX® and BOTOX Cosmetic®, marketed by Allergan, Inc., since its original approval by the FDA in 1989, has been approved for multiple indications, including glabellar lines, crow’s feet, hyperhidrosis, upper and lower limb spasticity, cervical dystonia, strabismus, blepharospasm, chronic migraine, incontinence, and overactive bladder. Allergan is a leading global pharmaceutical company with significant research, discovery, and delivery capabilities.


• | Myobloc®, a neuromodulator currently marketed by US WorldMeds and approved by the FDA in 2000.


• | Dysport®, an injectable botulinum toxin for the treatment of cervical dystonia, glabellar lines and upper and lower limb spasticity, which is marketed by Ipsen Ltd., or Ipsen, and Galderma, a Nestle company. Galderma acquired rights to market the product in the United States and Canada from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International, Inc. in 2014. Dysport® was approved by the FDA in 2009. Ipsen had previously received marketing authorization for a cosmetic indication for Dysport® in Germany in 2006. In 2007, Ipsen granted Galderma an exclusive development and marketing license for Dysport® for cosmetic indications in the European Union, Russia, Eastern Europe and the Middle East, and first rights of negotiation for other countries around the world, except the United States, Canada and Japan. In 2008, Galderma became Ipsen’s sole distributor for Dysport® in Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay. In 2009, the health authorities of 15 European Union countries approved Dysport® for glabellar lines under the trade name Azzalure®. In 2011, Ipsen and Syntaxin engaged in a research collaboration agreement to develop native and engineered formats of botulinum toxin. 


• | Xeomin®, marketed by Merz Pharma, or Merz, and approved by the FDA in 2010 for cervical dystonia and blepharospasm in adults previously treated with Botox®. In the third quarter of 2011, Xeomin® was approved by the FDA and in Korea for glabellar lines. In the fourth quarter of 2015, Xeomin® was approved by the FDA for the treatment of upper limb spasticity. Xeomin® is also currently approved for therapeutic indications in most countries in the European Union as well as Canada and certain countries in Latin America and Asia. Bocouture® (rebranded from Xeomin®), marketed by Merz, received approval for glabellar lines in Germany in 2009. In 2010, Bocouture® was approved in significant markets within the European Union. Xeomin® is also approved for glabellar lines in Argentina and Mexico. 

We are aware of competing neuromodulators currently being developed and commercialized in Asia, South America and other markets. These markets may or may not require adherence to the FDA’s cGMPs or the regulatory requirements of the European Medicines Agency or other regulatory agencies in countries that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While these products are unlikely to meet stringent U.S. regulatory standards, the companies operating in these markets may be able to produce products at a lower cost than United States and European manufacturers. In addition to the injectable botulinum toxin dose forms, we are aware that other companies are developing topical neuromodulators for cosmetic and therapeutics indications and are conducting clinical trials for acne and facial aesthetic and hyperhidrosis.
Aesthetic Medicine
We anticipate that the first use of our products will be in the professional facial aesthetic medicine market, which includes neurotoxins and dermal fillers, as well as polymer-based injectables. These and other products experience indirect competition from procedures, such as laser treatments, face lifts, chemical peels, fat injections and cold therapy. In the United States, dermal filler products, including Allergan’s Juvéderm family of fillers including Juvéderm VoLUMA® XC, compete with Galderma’s products Restylane® and Perlane™. In 2010, the FDA approved Allergan’s Juvéderm® Ultra XC and Ultra Plus XC products 
11

containing lidocaine as well as new formulations of Galderma's Restylane® and Perlane™, also containing lidocaine, and Restylane® without lidocaine for lips. In June 2016, Allergan gained FDA approval for Juvéderm Volbella® XC, created specifically for lips for greater lift and longer-lasting results. In December 2016, Galderma gained FDA approval for Restylane Refyne, which was approved for the treatment of moderate to severe facial wrinkles and folds, and Restylane Defyne, which was approved for the treatment of moderate to severe, deep facial wrinkles and folds. Additional competitors in the filler category include Radiesse®, a calcium hydroxylapatite from BioForm, which was acquired by Merz in 2010, Sculptra® from Galderma, and Belotero Balance® from Merz. Internationally, competitive products include Q-Med’s range of Restylane® and Perlane™ products, as well as products from Anteis, Filoraga, Teoxane, Galderma and a large number of other hyaluronic acid, bioceramic, protein and other polymer-based dermal fillers.
Sales and Marketing
We currently have limited marketing capabilities and no sales organization. Assuming successful completion of clinical trials and receipt of marketing approval for RT002 injectable for treatment of glabellar lines by the FDA, we plan to launch in North America with our own commercial organization. Specifically, we would access the North American market by hiring a focused, specialized sales force that targets the core physicians (dermatologists, plastic surgeons, facial plastic surgeons and oculo-plastic surgeons) who perform the majority of the cosmetic procedures. Assuming approval to market in the United States, we will focus our initial marketing of RT002 injectable on these core specialties.
Strategic Partnering
We plan to focus our efforts on developing and commercializing RT002 injectable in North America. We intend to market on our own and seek collaborative relationships outside of North America to maximize the commercial potential of our product candidates and delivery technology.
We also plan to leverage our proprietary peptide technology outside of our core focus in botulinum toxin by partnering with other companies. For example, in June 2013, we entered into an exclusive technology evaluation agreement with the Procter & Gamble Company to co-develop a peptide and explore applications of our proprietary peptide technology in two classes of over-the-counter cosmetic compounds. If successful, this partnership would enable us to receive royalty revenue.
Intellectual Property 
Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for our drug candidates, novel biological discoveries, and drug development technology and other know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary or intellectual property rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary and intellectual property rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing U.S. and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on know-how, copyright, trademarks and trade secret laws, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. Such protection is also maintained using confidential disclosure agreements. Protection of our technologies is important for us to offer our customers proprietary services and products unavailable from our competitors, and to exclude our competitors from using technology that we have developed. If competitors in our industry have access to the same technology, our competitive position may be adversely affected.
It is possible that our current patents, or patents which we may later acquire, may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part. It is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents from our pending patent applications or other inventions we seek to protect. Due to uncertainties inherent in prosecuting patent applications, sometimes patent applications are rejected and we subsequently abandon them. It is also possible that we may develop proprietary products or technologies in the future that are not patentable or that the patents of others will limit or altogether preclude our ability to do business. In addition, any patent issued to us, or any of our pending patent applications, may provide us with little or no competitive advantage, in which case we may abandon such patent, or patent applications, or license them to another entity. For more information, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Intellectual Property.”
On June 2, 2016, we entered into the Asset Purchase Agreement, or the Purchase Agreement, with Botulinum Toxin Research Associates, Inc., or BTRX. Under the Purchase Agreement, we acquired all rights, title and interest in a portfolio of botulinum toxin-related patents and patent applications from BTRX and was granted the right of first negotiation and right of first refusal with respect to other botulinum toxin-related patents owned or controlled by BTRX. 
12

As of February 7, 2017, we held approximately 183 issued patents and approximately 134 pending patent applications, including foreign counterparts of U.S. patents and applications. Thirty-one of our patents are issued in the United States, with the rest issued in Australia, Canada, China, various countries in Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and South Africa. In addition, we have pending patent applications in the United States as well as in Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Singapore. The earliest that any of our patents will expire is December 10, 2019 for U. S. Patent No. 6,429,189. 
We will continue to pursue additional patent protection as well as take appropriate measures to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our innovative technologies.
Our registered and pending U.S. trademarks include REVANCE®, TransMTS®, MOTISTE®, "Remarkable Science Changes Everything®", MEYESMILE, and R Logo.
Government Regulation 
Product Approval Process in the United States
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, its implementing regulations, and other laws, including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our product candidates, RT002 injectable and RT001 topical, are subject to regulation by the FDA as a biologic. Biologics require the submission of a BLA to the FDA and approval of the BLA by the FDA before marketing in the United States.
The process of obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial sale and distribution and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U. S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold on clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current good laboratory practices, or GLP regulations;


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;


• | approval by an institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s current good clinical practices, or GCP regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;


• | submission to the FDA of a BLA;


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection, if the FDA deems it as a requirement, of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s current good manufacturing practice standards, or cGMP regulations to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity, as well as compliance with applicable Quality System Regulations, or QSR, for devices;


• | potential audits by the FDA of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;


• | potential review of the BLA by an external advisory committee to the FDA, whose recommendations are not binding on the FDA; and


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale.

Preclinical Studies
Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential toxicity and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together 
13

with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical trial, including concerns that human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. The FDA may also impose clinical holds on a product candidate at any time before or during clinical trials due to safety concerns or non-compliance, or for other reasons.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and effectiveness. Each protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of clinical trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:

• | Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into a limited population of healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and excretion. In the case of some products for some diseases, or when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the disease or condition for which the product candidate is intended to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.


• | Phase 2. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population, but larger than in Phase 1, to identify possible adverse events and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications and to assess dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, and provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population, such as several hundred to several thousand, at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 clinical trials are typically conducted when Phase 2 clinical trials demonstrate that a dose range of the product candidate is effective and has an acceptable safety profile. These trials typically have at least 2 groups of patients who, in a blinded fashion, receive either the product or a placebo. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.

Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication to further assess the biologic’s safety and effectiveness after BLA approval. Phase 4 trials can be initiated by the drug sponsor or as a condition of BLA approval by the FDA.
Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA and written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events or any finding from tests in laboratory animals that suggests a significant risk for human subjects.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final biologic product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
14

The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The submission of a BLA is subject to the payment of substantial user fees.
Once the FDA receives a BLA, it has 60 days to review the BLA to determine if it is substantially complete and the data are readable, before it accepts the BLA for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the BLA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, the FDA has twelve months from submission in which to complete its initial review of a standard BLA and make a decision on the application, and eight months from submission for a priority BLA, and such deadline is referred to as the PDUFA date. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA dates for either standard or priority BLAs. The review process and the PDUFA date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA date.
After the BLA submission is accepted for filing, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug or biological products or drug or biological products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval and limit commercial opportunity.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA can inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the BLA unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with GCP requirements. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional clinical testing or information before a BLA can be approved.
The FDA will issue a complete response letter if the agency decides not to approve the BLA. The complete response letter describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. After approval, certain changes to the approved biologic, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes or additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Depending on the nature of the change proposed, a BLA supplement must be submitted and approved before the change may be implemented. For many proposed post-approval changes to a BLA, the FDA has up to 180 days to review the application. As with new BLAs, the review process is often significantly extended by the FDA requests for additional information or clarification.

Post-Approval Requirements
Any biologic products for which we receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling, known as “off-label use,” industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. The FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of biologics, and although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such off-label uses. Failure to comply with these or other FDA requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, possible civil or criminal penalties or other negative consequences, including adverse publicity.
We currently manufacture clinical drug supplies using a combination of third-party manufacturers and our own manufacturing facility in order to support both of our product candidates and plan to do so on a commercial scale if our product candidates are approved. Our future collaborators may also utilize third parties for some or all of a product we are developing with such collaborator. We and our third-party manufacturers are required to comply with applicable FDA manufacturing requirements contained in the FDA’s cGMP regulations. cGMP regulations require among other things, quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of our biologic product candidate, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s BLA. Specifically, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product cannot be approved by the FDA until twelve years after the original branded product was approved under a BLA. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement to one of the patents listed with the FDA by the innovator BLA holder. 
Product Approval Process Outside the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of foreign regulations governing manufacturing, clinical trials, commercial sales and distribution of our future products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product candidate, we must obtain approval of the product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before commencing clinical trials or marketing in those countries. The approval process varies from country to country, and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country.
Under European Union regulatory systems, marketing authorizations may be submitted either under a centralized, decentralized or mutual recognition procedure. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing 
16

authorization that is valid for all European Union member states. The decentralized procedure includes selecting one “reference member state,” or RMS, and submitting to more than one member state at the same time. The RMS National Competent Authority conducts a detailed review and prepares an assessment report, to which concerned member states provide comment. The mutual recognition procedure provides for mutual recognition of national approval decisions. Under this procedure, the holder of a national marketing authorization may submit an application to the remaining member states post-initial approval. Within 90 days of receiving the applications and assessment report, each member state must decide whether to recognize approval.
Federal and State Fraud and Abuse and Data Privacy and Security Laws and Regulations
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, federal and state fraud and abuse laws restrict certain business practices in the biotechnology industry. These laws include anti-kickback and false claims statutes. We will be subject to these laws and regulations once we begin to directly commercialize our products.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including for example, gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, payments of cash, waivers of payment, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on one hand prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. Although there are a number of statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for statutory exemptions or safe harbor protection. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal healthcare covered business, the statute has been violated. The reach of the Anti-Kickback Statute was also broadened by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the ACA, which, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute, which imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. The federal transparency requirements under ACA require certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies to annually report to the Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and physician ownership and investment interests.
The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. Pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus non-reimbursable, uses. Also, many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor.
In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s privacy and security standards directly applicable to “business associates,” those independent contractors or agents of covered entities that receive or obtain protected health information in connection with providing a service on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also increased the civil and criminal penalties that may be imposed against covered entities, business associates and possibly other persons, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorney’s fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, 
17

many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exemptions, it is possible that some of our business activities now and in the future could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including criminal and significant civil monetary penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion of products from reimbursement under government programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. To the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or transfers of value to healthcare professionals.
Environment, Health and Safety
We are voluntarily assessing and publicly reporting our greenhouse gas emissions and water usage, and have begun to take action to reduce such emissions and usage. For example, we have established employee commuter programs, evaluated the energy efficiency of our buildings and installed low-flow water fixtures. Various laws and regulations have been implemented or are under consideration to mitigate the effects of climate change caused by greenhouse gas emissions. For example, the California Air Resources Board is in the process of drafting regulations to meet state emissions targets. Based on current information and subject to the finalization of the proposed regulations, we believe that our primary risk related to climate change is the risk of increased energy costs. However, because we are not an energy-intensive business, we do not anticipate being subject to a cap and trade system or any other mitigation measures that would likely be material to our capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position.
We are also subject to other federal, state and local regulations regarding workplace safety and protection of the environment. We use hazardous materials, chemicals, viruses and various radioactive compounds in our research and development activities and cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. Certain misuse or accidents involving these materials could lead to significant litigation, fines and penalties. We have implemented proactive programs to reduce and minimize the risk of hazardous materials incidents.
Research and Development
Conducting research and development is central to our business model. We have invested and expect to continue to invest significant time and capital in our research and development operations. Our research and development expenses were $50.4 million, $47.5 million, and $33.4 million during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. We plan to increase our research and development expenses for the foreseeable future to initiate and complete additional clinical trials and associated programs related to RT002 injectable for the treatment of glabellar lines and therapeutic indications in areas such as cervical dystonia and plantar fasciitis.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had 106 full-time employees. Of these employees, 83 employees were engaged in research and development and 23 employees were engaged in finance, marketing, human resources, facilities, information technology, general management, and administrative activities. We plan to continue to expand our research and development activities. To support this growth, we will need to expand managerial, research and development, operations, commercial, finance and other functions. None of our employees are represented by a labor union, and we consider our employee relations to be good.
