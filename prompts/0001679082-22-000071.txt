Item 1. Business
Overview of our Business
We are a biopharmaceutical company that aspires to redefine care for women and for men through purpose-driven science, empowering medicines, and transformative advocacy. Founded in 2016, we have two FDA-approved products: (1) ORGOVYX® (relugolix 120 mg), which was approved in the U.S. by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in December 2020 as the first and only oral gonadotropin-releasing hormone (“GnRH”) receptor antagonist for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer; and (2) MYFEMBREE® (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg), which was approved in the U.S. by the FDA in May 2021 as the first and only once-daily oral GnRH treatment for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids. In July 2021, the European Commission (“EC”), and in August 2021, the United Kingdom (“U.K.”) Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”), approved RYEQO® (relugolix 40 mg, estradiol 1.0 mg, and norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) as the first and only long-term, once-daily oral treatment in the European Union (“EU”) and U.K., respectively, for moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age. In April 2022, the EC approved ORGOVYX (relugolix 120 mg) as the first and only oral androgen deprivation therapy for advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer in Europe. In September 2021, the FDA accepted to review our supplemental New Drug Application (“sNDA”) for MYFEMBREE for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis. On May 6, 2022, we and Pfizer announced that the FDA extended the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (“PDUFA”) goal date for this sNDA to August 6, 2022. MYFEMBREE is being evaluated for contraceptive efficacy in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids or endometriosis-associated pain who are 18 to 50 years of age and at risk for pregnancy. We are also developing MVT-602, an investigational oligopeptide kisspeptin-1 receptor agonist, which has completed a Phase 2a study for the treatment of female infertility as a part of assisted reproduction.
Since our inception, we have funded our operations primarily from the issuance and sale of our common shares, from debt financing arrangements, and more recently from the upfront and milestone payments we have received from our collaboration and commercialization partners, as well as net revenues generated from sales of ORGOVYX and MYFEMBREE in the U.S., and to a lesser extent from revenues generated from sales of product supply to Gedeon Richter Plc. (“Richter”) as well as royalties on net sales of RYEQO in Richter’s Territory.
Our majority shareholder is Sumitovant Biopharma Ltd. (“Sumitovant”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Pharma Co., Ltd. (“Sumitomo Pharma”), the name of which prior to April 1, 2022 was Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma Co., Ltd. As of March 31, 2022, Sumitovant directly, and Sumitomo Pharma indirectly, own 50,041,181, or approximately 52.8%, of our outstanding common shares.

•deliver operational excellence while upholding the highest ethical and compliance standards in our business practices; and
•foster our values-based culture that embraces diversity and attract and retain highly skilled employees that value and contribute to the advancement of our patient-focused mission.
Relugolix in General
Relugolix is an oral, once-daily, small molecule that acts as a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (“GnRH”) receptor antagonist that binds to and inhibits GnRH receptors in the anterior pituitary gland. Inhibition of GnRH receptors decreases the release of gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone (“LH”) and follicle-stimulating hormone (“FSH”)), thereby decreasing the downstream production of estrogen and progesterone by the ovaries in women and testosterone by the testes in men.
As a GnRH receptor antagonist, relugolix has a clinically-validated mechanism of action in each of our programs: advanced prostate cancer; heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids; pain associated with endometriosis; and contraceptive efficacy. The direct and rapid action of relugolix on the pituitary-gonadal axis is distinct from approved luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (“LHRH”) agonists which are administered as depot injections and result in an initial surge in levels of gonadotropins, and estrogen and progesterone or testosterone, before resulting in pituitary desensitization and a fall in hormone levels over weeks. Approved LHRH agonist injections such as leuprolide acetate are used in women to treat the symptoms of uterine fibroids and endometriosis, but the adoption and duration of use is limited due to bone mineral density loss and vasomotor symptoms (such as hot flushes).
Our Approved Products and Product Candidates and the Market Opportunities
Advanced Prostate Cancer
Prostate cancer is a potentially lethal disease that starts in the prostate gland in men. Prostate cancer usually grows slowly and is confined, or localized, to the prostate gland. Cancer cells can grow beyond the prostate gland and spread to other tissues, also called metastasis.
On December 18, 2020, the FDA approved ORGOVYX for the treatment of adult patients with advanced prostate cancer. ORGOVYX, which was granted Priority Review by the FDA, is the first and only oral GnRH receptor antagonist for the treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer. The approval of ORGOVYX is based on efficacy and safety data from our Phase 3 HERO study of ORGOVYX in men with advanced prostate cancer. For the years ended March 31, 2022, and 2021, we generated net revenues from sales of ORGOVYX in the U.S. of $83.0 million and $3.6 million, respectively. Pursuant to the terms of our collaboration and license agreement by and between one of our subsidiaries and Pfizer (the “ Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement”), we collaborate with Pfizer to jointly develop and commercialize relugolix in oncology. We and Pfizer may conduct additional clinical studies to support the commercial potential of ORGOVYX.
On April 29, 2022, the EC approved ORGOVYX as the first and only oral androgen deprivation therapy for advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer in Europe. This approval is applicable to all 27 EU member states plus Iceland, Norway, and Lichtenstein. We expect our commercialization partner, Accord, to launch ORGOVYX for this indication in Europe in the second half of calendar year 2022.
We expect to submit a New Drug Submission to Health Canada seeking marketing approval for ORGOVYX for advanced prostate cancer in Canada in calendar year 2022.
Phase 3 HERO Study
In the Phase 3 HERO study, ORGOVYX met the primary endpoint and achieved sustained testosterone suppression to castrate levels (< 50 ng/dL) through 48 weeks in 96.7% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 94.9-97.9) of men, compared with 88.8% (95% CI: 84.6-91.8) of men receiving leuprolide acetate injections, the current standard of care. ORGOVYX also achieved several key secondary endpoints compared to leuprolide acetate, including suppression of testosterone to castrate levels at Day 4 and Day 15 (56% versus 0% and 99% versus 12%, respectively) and profound suppression of testosterone (< 20 ng/dL) at Day 15 (78% versus 1%). ORGOVYX lowered prostate-specific antigen (“PSA”), on average, by 65% at Day 15 and by 83% at Day 29. In a substudy, 55% of men treated with ORGOVYX achieved normal testosterone levels (> 280 ng/dL) or returned to baseline within 90 days of treatment discontinuation. The most frequent adverse events reported in at least 10% of men in the ORGOVYX group, were hot flush, musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, constipation, and mild to moderate diarrhea. In May 2020, efficacy and safety data from the Phase 3 HERO study were published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.
Advanced Prostate Cancer Market Opportunity
Prostate cancer is the second most prevalent form of cancer in men and the second leading cause of death due to cancer in men in the U.S. Approximately three million men diagnosed with prostate cancer are alive in the U.S., and approximately 250,000 men are newly diagnosed each year, according to the National Cancer Institute. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in the world and responsible for the fifth leading cause of cancer-related deaths. It is estimated that 1 in 9 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer during their lifetime.
If prostate cancer is diagnosed at a stage where it is confined to the prostate gland and immediate surroundings, it is generally treated by surgical removal of the prostate gland (prostatectomy) or with radiation. Often, these procedures are successful in curing men of their disease. Men whose disease progresses after prostatectomy or radiation are said to have advanced prostate cancer. Advanced prostate cancer is defined as any of the following: PSA biochemical relapse following primary surgical or radiation therapy of curative intent; newly diagnosed metastatic prostate cancer; or advanced localized disease for which immediate radiation or surgical therapy is not indicated.
First-line treatment for advanced prostate cancer typically involves treatment with androgen deprivation therapies (“ADT”), which are therapies that substantially reduce testosterone. This is because androgens, such as testosterone, promote the growth of cancerous prostate cells by binding to and activating the androgen receptor which, once activated, stimulates prostate cancer cell growth. ADT consisting of either medical castration or surgical castration (removal of the testes which produce testosterone) can be successful in delaying prostate cancer progression. As prostate cancer progresses, men remain on ADT while other therapies are added, typically until death.
The most commonly prescribed ADTs are LHRH agonists, such as long-acting leuprolide depot injections. LHRH agonists initially stimulate a testosterone surge, but with chronic stimulation of the LHRH receptors, the pituitary gland desensitizes and luteinizing hormone decreases with a resultant reduction in testosterone three to four weeks after the initiation of therapy. The initial stimulation of testosterone can cause an initial worsening of symptoms, or testosterone flare, and require additional 
medicines to manage its effects. LHRH agonists are often given as depot formulations, requiring injections every month, three months or six months, and testosterone may remain suppressed for weeks and months after cessation of therapy.
ORGOVYX provides rapid reduction of testosterone with no testosterone flare as seen with many other ADTs. Additionally, the testosterone reduction is profound and sustained as long as the patient remains on therapy and testosterone returns to normal levels quickly after stopping therapy. ORGOVYX is the only treatment option that offers these clinical benefits in an oral formulation. Over time, we believe that ORGOVYX has the potential to change the treatment paradigm and become a standard of care in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer.
Uterine Fibroids
Uterine fibroids, also known as uterine myomas or leiomyomas, are non-cancerous tumors that develop in the muscular wall of the uterus and are among the most common reproductive tract tumors in women. In addition to an individual’s genetic predisposition, estrogens are well known to play an important role in the regulation of fibroid growth. Although uterine fibroids are benign tumors, they may cause debilitating symptoms such as heavy and prolonged menstrual bleeding, heavy or painful periods, anemia, abdominal pain, backache, increased abdominal girth and bloating, urinary frequency or retention, constipation or painful defecation, pregnancy loss, painful intercourse and, in some cases, infertility. These symptoms can also lead to loss of productivity at work, limitations in normal activities of daily living, and social embarrassment. For most women, uterine fibroids and associated symptoms resolve at menopause when estrogen and progesterone levels fall. 
On May 26, 2021, the FDA approved MYFEMBREE as the first and only once-daily oral GnRH treatment for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women, with a treatment duration of up to 24 months. The approval is supported by efficacy and safety data from our Phase 3 LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 studies, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine, and the LIBERTY long-term extension study. For the year ended March 31, 2022, we generated net revenues from sales of MYFEMBREE in the U.S. of $6.4 million. Pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement, we collaborate with Pfizer to jointly develop and commercialize relugolix in women’s health. 
On July 16, 2021, the EC, and on August 9, 2021, the MHRA, approved RYEQO as the first and only long-term, once-daily oral treatment in the EU and U.K., respectively, for moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age with no limitation on its duration of use. The EC decision is valid in all 27 member states of the EU, as well as Iceland, Norway, and Liechtenstein. The approvals are based on the safety and efficacy data from the Phase 3 LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 studies, the LIBERTY long-term extension study, and supportive bone mineral density data from the LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study. Richter, our commercialization partner for RYEQO in Europe and certain other international markets, has launched RYEQO in 17 countries since these regulatory approvals.
We expect to submit a New Drug Submission to Health Canada seeking marketing approval for MYFEMBREE for heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in Canada in calendar year 2022.
Phase 3 LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 Studies
The Phase 3 LIBERTY clinical program, which evaluated relugolix combination therapy in women with heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids, consisted of two multinational, replicate pivotal clinical studies. We enrolled 388 women in LIBERTY 1 and 382 women in LIBERTY 2. To be enrolled, women must have had a monthly menstrual blood loss volume of at least 80 mL in two consecutive cycles or 160 mL in one cycle, measured by the alkaline hematin method, a quantitative measure of menstrual blood loss from an assessment of collected menstrual products. Women in the LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 studies underwent a screening period requiring up to two menstrual cycles to document heavy menstrual bleeding and were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of three groups. Women received treatment either with relugolix combination therapy for 24 weeks, relugolix 40 mg once-daily monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by relugolix combination therapy once-daily for an additional 12 weeks, or placebo once-daily for 24 weeks.
The primary efficacy endpoint for LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2 was the proportion of all women enrolled who achieved a menstrual blood loss volume of less than 80 mL and at least a 50% reduction in menstrual blood loss volume from baseline during the last 35 days of the 24-week treatment period (responders) as measured by the alkaline hematin method. The secondary endpoints included the proportion of women who achieved amenorrhea (defined as no or negligible blood loss) during the last 35 days of treatment, reduction in pelvic pain, reduction in fibroid volume, reduction in uterine volume, percent change from baseline to week 24 in menstrual blood loss, increase in hemoglobin, and an assessment of the impact of therapy 
on quality-of-life. Safety, including bone mineral density changes as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (“DXA”), was also assessed.
The Phase 3 LIBERTY studies each met the primary endpoint, with 72.1% and 71.2% of women in the MYFEMBREE groups achieving the responder criteria compared with 16.8% and 14.7% of women in the placebo groups at week 24, respectively (both p < 0.0001). Women receiving MYFEMBREE experienced reductions of 82.0% and 84.3% in menstrual blood loss from baselines, respectively (both p < 0.0001 compared to placebo). Adverse reactions occurring in at least 3% of women treated with MYFEMBREE and at a greater incidence than placebo were hot flush, abnormal uterine bleeding, alopecia (baldness), and decreased libido. There were no pregnancies reported in the MYFEMBREE groups in either study. The Phase 3 LIBERTY studies each met the same six key secondary endpoints with statistical significance compared to placebo, including mean change in menstrual blood loss from baseline to week 24, reduction in pain in women with pain at baseline, improvement in quality of life, amenorrhea (defined as no or negligible blood loss), improvement in anemia in those women with anemia at baseline, and reduction in uterine volume. The seventh key secondary endpoint, reduction in uterine fibroid volume, did not achieve statistical significance. 
Eligible women who completed the LIBERTY 1 or LIBERTY 2 studies were offered the opportunity to enroll in an active treatment extension study in which all women received relugolix combination therapy for an additional 28-week period for a total treatment period of 52 weeks, designed to evaluate the safety and sustained efficacy of longer-term treatment. Upon completion of this 52-week total treatment period, eligible women could elect to participate in a second 52-week randomized withdrawal study designed to provide two-year safety and efficacy data on relugolix combination therapy, and to evaluate the need for maintenance therapy.
LIBERTY Long-Term Extension Study
On February 10, 2020, we announced positive one-year safety and efficacy data from the LIBERTY long-term extension study. In the primary endpoint analysis, 87.7% of women achieved the responder criteria, as defined above for LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2. The one-year primary endpoint result in the LIBERTY open-label extension study demonstrated durability of the response observed in LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2. In addition, women experienced, on average, an 89.9% reduction in menstrual blood loss from baseline at one year. 
Changes in bone mineral density through one year, as assessed by DXA every three months, were consistent with those in LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2. The incidence of adverse events over one year was consistent with that observed in LIBERTY 1 and LIBERTY 2, with no new safety signals observed. Adverse events reported in more than 10% of women treated with relugolix combination therapy for one year and more frequent than those reported in the placebo group after 6 months included only hot flash. There were no pregnancies reported in the relugolix combination therapy group.
In October 2020, we presented a poster at the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (“ASRM”) 2020 Virtual Congress describing a validated exposure-response model simulating long-term effects of relugolix combination therapy on bone mineral density at the lumbar spine. Simulations from this model were well correlated with the effect of relugolix combination therapy observed in the Phase 3 LIBERTY program and projected maintenance of bone mineral density for at least three years.
Data from the LIBERTY long-term extension study were included in the original NDA submission for MYFEMBREE for the uterine fibroids indication.
LIBERTY Randomized Withdrawal Study
On March 24, 2021, we and Pfizer announced positive safety and efficacy data from the LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study. The LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study (n=229) was a Phase 3 double-blind, placebo-controlled study that enrolled eligible women who completed the LIBERTY long-term extension study. Eligibility criteria included meeting the responder criteria at one year. In this study, response was defined as sustained menstrual blood loss of less than 80 mL through week 76 or to week 104. Women were randomized at week 52 to once-daily relugolix combination therapy or placebo for a one-year double-blind treatment period. Women on placebo with relapse of heavy menstrual bleeding during the study were offered re-treatment with open-label relugolix combination therapy. This study, together with the LIBERTY 1, LIBERTY 2, and LIBERTY long-term extension study, was designed to provide data on the safety and efficacy of treatment with relugolix combination therapy for up to two years.
The LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study met its primary endpoint with 78.4% of women who continued on relugolix combination therapy achieving the sustained responder rate (menstrual blood loss < 80 mL) through week 76 compared with 15.1% of women who discontinued treatment and initiated placebo at week 52 (p < 0.0001). All three key secondary endpoints in the LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study were also achieved, including sustained responder rate at two years (week 104), time to relapse of heavy menstrual bleeding, and amenorrhea rate (all p < 0.0001). Through two years, 69.8% of women who 
continued on relugolix combination therapy remained responders. 88.3% of women who discontinued treatment at week 52 relapsed with heavy menstrual bleeding, with a median time of return to heavy menstrual bleeding of 5.9 weeks.
Bone mineral density was maintained through two years in the subset of women continuously treated with relugolix combination therapy (n=31). The incidence of adverse events over one additional year of treatment was consistent with those observed in prior studies, with no new safety signals observed. The most commonly reported adverse event in at least 10% of women treated with relugolix combination therapy was nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nose and pharynx).
On March 29, 2022, one of our subsidiaries, Myovant Sciences GmbH (“MSG”), submitted an sNDA to the FDA that included the two-year data from the LIBERTY randomized withdrawal study.
Observational Bone Mineral Density Study
This prospective observational study was designed to characterize the longitudinal natural history of bone mineral density in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis over 52 weeks. A cohort of women (n=262) with documented uterine fibroids by imaging who were not receiving treatment with GnRH agonists or antagonists were enrolled contemporaneously from U.S. centers that participated in the LIBERTY studies. Bone mineral density was assessed by DXA at baseline, week 24 and week 52. Mean bone mineral density at the lumbar spine showed minimal changes over the 52-week observational period (0% at week 24 and -0.41% at week 52) and did not appear to be influenced by race or body mass index. This study began in August 2018 and was completed in July 2020.
Uterine Fibroids Market Opportunity
We estimate that over 25% of women of reproductive age in the U.S., or approximately 19 million women, have uterine fibroids. Of those, approximately five million women are estimated to experience symptoms of uterine fibroids, approximately three million of whom are inadequately treated by current medical therapy and require further treatment. Heavy menstrual bleeding is defined as more than 80 mL in a cycle. It is the most common symptom of uterine fibroids and many of these women with heavy menstrual bleeding go undiagnosed. 
The current approach to treating uterine fibroids includes both medical therapies and surgical options. The recommended treatment for a given patient is dependent on factors such as the patient’s desire to become pregnant in the future, the importance of uterine preservation, symptom severity, and tumor characteristics. Medical options include oral contraceptives, GnRH antagonists, tranexamic acid, and LHRH agonists. 
The current standard of care for the treatment of patients with mild symptoms includes the use of oral or other hormonal contraceptives or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (“NSAIDs”), which are generally prescribed at the time of initial diagnosis. These therapeutic options, however, often do not provide sufficient relief to the many patients with more moderate-to-severe symptoms. These women require additional treatment to relieve excessive bleeding and pain. Tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, is approved for use to treat heavy menstrual bleeding. LHRH agonists are used for short-term therapy and may involve low-dose estradiol and progestin hormonal combination therapy to mitigate the side effect of bone mineral density loss and reduce vasomotor symptoms generally associated with LHRH agonists. Recently the GnRH antagonist elagolix in combination with estradiol and a progestin, was approved for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids providing one new medical treatment option. However, treatment requires twice daily dosing and is associated with hot flashes and progressive bone loss. Other invasive procedures such as endometrial ablation and uterine artery embolization may also be tried. Surgical intervention, such as myomectomy or hysterectomy, are often used to treat the heavy bleeding and symptoms associated with uterine fibroids; however, these procedures may result in post-operative complications, complications with future pregnancy, or as is the case in hysterectomies, preclude the potential for future pregnancies. Even if a future pregnancy is not desired, many women prefer to avoid surgical intervention. However, heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids is a leading cause of hysterectomy, resulting in approximately 250,000 hysterectomies per year in the U.S. alone. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (“ACOG”) updated their clinical management guidelines for the Management of Symptomatic Uterine Leiomyomas in June of 2021. These guidelines look to make recommendations based on good and consistent scientific evidence (Level A), limited or inconsistent scientific evidence (Level B) and those based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C). They emphasize a patient-centered, shared decision-making approach when determining treatment. Oral contraceptives are given a Level C rating, versus newer oral GnRH therapies that are given a Level B rating for use for up to 2 years in abnormal uterine bleeding.
We believe that MYFEMBREE can potentially better meet the needs of women with uterine fibroids. Women receiving MYFEMBREE had a clinically meaningful reduction of menstrual blood loss of 84.3% over 24 weeks with approximately 50% reporting amenorrhea or absence of periods. The significant reduction of menstrual bleeding was associated with improvement of anemia in patients with anemia at baseline. Treatment was generally well tolerated with minimal changes in BMD with treatment. As the only one pill once a day available GnRH treatment, we believe MYFEMBREE has the potential to become a 
standard of care for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids potentially reducing the need for surgery or other invasive procedures.
Endometriosis
Endometriosis is an estrogen-dependent, inflammatory disease in which tissue similar to the lining of the uterus is found outside the uterine cavity. Endometriosis lesions commonly appear in the lower abdomen or pelvis or on ovaries, the bladder, or the colon. During the menstrual cycle, the lesions grow, differentiate, and shed into the abdomen, thereby inducing a cascade of inflammatory events. Endometriosis may cause debilitating symptoms such as dysmenorrhea (menstrual pain), non-menstrual pelvic pain, dyspareunia (painful intercourse), heavy bleeding, fatigue, and infertility. Endometriosis can also impact general physical, mental, and social well-being. Pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement, we collaborate with Pfizer to jointly develop and commercialize relugolix in women’s health.
On September 9, 2021, we and our collaboration partner, Pfizer, announced that the FDA accepted for review an sNDA for MYFEMBREE for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis. On May 6, 2022, we and Pfizer announced that the FDA extended the PDUFA goal date to August 6, 2022 for the sNDA to allow time to review additional analyses related to bone mineral density submitted in response to the FDA’s information request. No new clinical data was requested by the FDA. The submission of the additional analyses has been determined by the FDA to constitute a Major Amendment to the sNDA, resulting in an extension of the PDUFA goal date. 
We currently expect the European Medicines Agency regulatory submission for RYEQO for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain in calendar year 2022. Richter, our commercialization partner for RYEQO in Europe and certain other international markets, will be the sponsor.
We expect to submit a New Drug Submission to Health Canada seeking marketing approval for MYFEMBREE for the treatment of endometriosis-associated pain in Canada in calendar year 2022.
Phase 3 SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 Studies
The Phase 3 SPIRIT clinical program, which evaluated relugolix combination therapy in women with pain associated with endometriosis, consisted of two multinational, replicate pivotal clinical studies. We enrolled 638 women in SPIRIT 1 and 623 women in SPIRIT 2. To be enrolled, women must have had a surgical diagnosis of endometriosis in the last 10 years and moderate-to-severe dysmenorrhea (menstrual pelvic pain) and non-menstrual pelvic pain. Each study randomized women 1:1:1 to one of three treatment arms. Women received treatment either with relugolix combination therapy for 24 weeks, relugolix 40 mg once-daily monotherapy for 12 weeks followed by relugolix combination therapy once-daily for an additional 12 weeks, or placebo once-daily for 24 weeks.
The co-primary efficacy endpoints for the SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 studies were the proportion of all women enrolled with reductions in both dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain, as assessed by an endometriosis-specific patient questionnaire based on the Numerical Rating Scale (“NRS”) completed daily on an electronic patient diary, with no increase in background pain medication. The NRS is an 11-point scale with 0 representing “no pain” and 10 representing “the worst pain you can imagine.” Secondary endpoints included additional questionnaires assessing functional changes associated with endometriosis-specific pain and quality of life, and the use of pain medications to treat endometriosis, including opioid medications. Safety, including bone mineral density changes as measured by DXA, was also assessed. 
SPIRIT 1
On June 23, 2020, we announced that SPIRIT 1 met its co-primary efficacy endpoints and all seven key secondary endpoints. In addition, relugolix combination therapy was generally well-tolerated and resulted in minimal bone mineral density loss over 24 weeks.
Relugolix combination therapy achieved both co-primary endpoints by demonstrating clinically meaningful pain reductions for 74.5% of women with dysmenorrhea (menstrual pain) and 58.5% of women with non-menstrual pelvic pain, compared to 26.9% and 39.6% of women in the placebo group, respectively (p < 0.0001). On average, women receiving relugolix combination therapy had a 73.3% reduction on the 11-point (0 to 10) NRS for dysmenorrhea from 7.3 (severe pain) to 1.8 (mild pain).
All seven key secondary endpoints measured at week 24 and compared to placebo achieved statistical significance, including changes in mean dysmenorrhea and overall pelvic pain, impact of pain on daily activities as measured by the EHP-30 pain domain, greater proportions of women not using analgesics (p-values < 0.0001), changes in mean non-menstrual pelvic pain (p = 0.0002), greater proportions of women not using opioids (p = 0.0005), and changes in mean dyspareunia (painful intercourse) (p = 0.0149).
The overall incidence of adverse events in the relugolix combination and placebo groups was similar (71.2% vs. 66.0%). In the relugolix combination therapy group, 3.8% of women had adverse events leading to discontinuation of treatment versus 1.9% in the placebo group. The only reported adverse events in at least 10% of women in the relugolix combination group were headache and hot flashes. There was one pregnancy in the relugolix combination group and three in the placebo group.
SPIRIT 2
On April 22, 2020, we announced that SPIRIT 2 met its co-primary efficacy endpoints and six key secondary endpoints. In addition, relugolix combination therapy was generally well-tolerated and resulted in minimal bone mineral density loss over 24 weeks.
In the co-primary endpoint analysis, 75.2% of women achieved a clinically meaningful reduction in dysmenorrhea versus 30.4% of women in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). For non-menstrual pelvic pain, relugolix combination therapy achieved a clinically meaningful reduction in 66.0% of women versus 42.6% of women in the placebo group (p < 0.0001). On average, women receiving relugolix combination therapy had a 75.1% reduction on the 11-point (0 to 10) NRS for dysmenorrhea from 7.2 (severe pain) to 1.7 (mild pain).
Six key secondary endpoints measured at week 24 and compared to placebo achieved statistical significance, including changes in mean dysmenorrhea and overall pelvic pain, impact of pain on daily activities as measured by the EHP-30 pain domain, a greater proportion of women not using opioids (all p-values < 0.0001), changes in non-menstrual pelvic pain (p = 0.0012), and dyspareunia (painful intercourse) (p = 0.0489). An endpoint evaluating change in analgesic use did not achieve statistical significance.
The overall incidence of adverse events in the relugolix combination therapy and placebo groups was similar (80.6% vs. 75.0%). In the relugolix combination therapy group, 5.3% of women discontinued treatment early due to adverse events versus 3.9% in the placebo group. The most frequently reported adverse events, reported in at least 10% of women in the relugolix combination therapy group, were headache, nasopharyngitis, and hot flashes. There were three pregnancies in the relugolix combination therapy group and five in the placebo group.
SPIRIT Long-Term Extension Study
Eligible women who completed the SPIRIT 1 or SPIRIT 2 studies were offered the opportunity to enroll in an active treatment long-term extension study in which all women received relugolix combination therapy for an additional 80-week period, resulting in a total treatment period of up to 104 weeks, designed to evaluate the safety and sustained efficacy of longer-term treatment. A total of 802 women enrolled in the SPIRIT long-term extension study, all of whom received relugolix combination therapy regardless of their treatment assignment in SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2.
On January 26, 2021, we and Pfizer announced positive one-year safety and efficacy data from the SPIRIT long-term extension study. In the primary endpoint analysis, 84.8% and 73.3% of women receiving relugolix combination therapy over one year achieved clinically meaningful pain reductions in dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain, respectively. On average, women reported an 82.8% reduction on the 11-point Numerical Rating Scale (0-10) for dysmenorrhea from 7.4 (severe pain) to 1.3 (mild pain) over one year. Bone mineral density remained stable through week 52 in women treated with relugolix combination therapy after minimal, non-clinically meaningful bone loss through week 24. The incidence of adverse events over one year was consistent with that observed in the SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 studies, with no new safety signals observed. The most commonly reported adverse events in at least 10% of women treated with relugolix combination therapy were headache, nasopharyngitis, and hot flashes. There was one pregnancy reported in the relugolix combination therapy group (n=278).
In the primary endpoint analysis for the two-year extension study, 84.8% and 75.8% of women receiving relugolix combination therapy for up to two years achieved clinically meaningful pain reductions in dysmenorrhea and non-menstrual pelvic pain, respectively. The incidence of adverse events over two years was consistent with that observed in the SPIRIT 1 and SPIRIT 2 studies and the first 28 weeks of the long- term extension study, with no new safety signals observed. The most commonly reported adverse events with relugolix combination therapy were headache, nasopharyngitis, and hot flashes. There were two additional pregnancies reported in the relugolix combination therapy group (n=278) during the second year of the long- term extension study. Bone mineral density remained stable through week 104 in women treated with relugolix combination therapy after minimal, non-clinically meaningful bone loss through week 24. We expect to present two-year data from the SPIRIT long-term extension study at a scientific conference in mid-calendar year 2022.
Observational Bone Mineral Density Study
This prospective observational study was designed to characterize the longitudinal natural history of bone mineral density in premenopausal women with uterine fibroids or endometriosis over 52 weeks. A cohort of women (n=452) with documented endometriosis by surgery who were not receiving treatment with GnRH agonists or antagonists were enrolled 
contemporaneously from U.S. centers that participated in the SPIRIT studies. Bone mineral density was assessed by DXA at baseline, week 24 and week 52. Mean bone mineral density at the lumbar spine showed minimal changes over the 52-week observational period (0.35% at week 24 and 0.53% at week 52) and did not appear to be influenced by race or body mass index. This study began in August 2018 and was completed in July 2020.
Endometriosis Market Opportunity
We estimate that endometriosis affects approximately 10% of women of reproductive age and, in the U.S., can take approximately 4-11 years from the onset of symptoms to accurately diagnose, often leading to unnecessary or inappropriate treatment. We estimate that approximately six million women in the U.S. suffer from symptomatic endometriosis, approximately one million of whom are inadequately treated by oral contraceptives and require additional treatment. We estimate that three in four women with endometriosis experience debilitating symptoms. In addition, approximately 100,000 endometriosis-related hysterectomies are performed each year in the U.S., although hysterectomy is not a cure for endometriosis and pain associated with endometriosis will not necessarily subside following hysterectomy.
Standard treatment options for endometriosis include medical therapies and surgery. Initial treatment usually involves over-the-counter pain medications, including NSAIDs, because pain is the primary symptom. Hormonal contraceptives are also commonly used. In more severe cases, LHRH agonists such as leuprolide are used for short-term treatment and may involve hormonal add-back therapy with an estrogen and/or a progestin. The FDA has approved Lupaneta Pack (leuprolide administered with norethindrone acetate (5 mg)) to treat pain associated with endometriosis while lowering the side effect of bone mineral density loss and reducing vasomotor symptoms use longer than one year is not recommended. The GnRH antagonist, elagolix, is approved for the management of moderate to severe pain associated with endometriosis. The low dose of elagolix is associated with limited efficacy but is generally well tolerated and can be used for up to two years. The high dose is more efficacious but is associated with a high incidence of hot flashes and progressive loss of bone density and, therefore, is only recommended for six months. For many patients, surgical intervention, typically laparoscopy with ablation or resection of endometriotic lesions, is ultimately undertaken to relieve pain, and opioid medications are frequently needed to control pain both before and after surgery. After treatment with hormonal therapy or laparoscopic procedures, recurrence of endometriosis and related symptoms is common, resulting in repeated procedures for many women. 
We believe MYFEMBREE, if approved for endometriosis, could potentially provide a medical treatment option for women with pain associated with endometriosis that reduces both menstrual pain (dysmenorrhea) and non-menstrual pelvic pain, pain with intercourse (dyspareunia) leading to improvements of function and other measures of quality of life. This may reduce the need for repeated surgeries that many women with endometriosis undergo and to avoid the risks associated with multiple surgical interventions. If approved, MYFEMBREE would offer women with endometriosis effective management of their endometriosis-associated pain in a convenient one pill once a day therapy and allowing them to potentially delay or avoid surgery.
Prevention of Pregnancy
Uterine fibroids and endometriosis occur in premenopausal women who may desire to prevent pregnancy while receiving treatment for their heavy menstrual bleeding or pelvic pain. However, when using medical options like LHRH agonists or GnRH antagonists, the use of effective contraceptives such as combined hormonal contraceptives is not recommended. Their use may reduce the efficacy of treatment with LHRH agonists or GnRH antagonists and, in some cases, the efficacy of the contraceptives may be reduced, and the concomitant use of these therapies may increase the risk of severe and serious adverse events including thromboembolic events.
In April 2020, we announced results from a Phase 1 single-arm, open-label ovulation inhibition study to assess the effects of relugolix combination therapy on ovulation inhibition, per the Hoogland-Skouby assessment scale (score < 5). In 67 healthy women over an 84-day treatment period (three cycles), relugolix combination therapy achieved 100% ovulation inhibition and was generally well tolerated. Furthermore, 100% of women resumed ovulation or menses upon discontinuation of treatment, with an average time to ovulation of 23.5 days. Data from this study were presented at the ASRM 2020 Virtual Congress. The findings of the Phase 1 study demonstrated that relugolix combination therapy inhibited ovulation study participants and provides the basis for our Phase 3 SERENE study.
Phase 3 SERENE Study
We are enrolling patients in our Phase 3 SERENE study evaluating MYFEMBREE for the prevention of pregnancy. The enrollment target in the SERENE study is 1,020 patients who are 18 to 50 years of age and at risk for pregnancy, who have a confirmed diagnosis of uterine fibroids or endometriosis. The primary efficacy endpoint is the at-risk Pearl Index, defined as the number of on-treatment pregnancies per 100 women-years of treatment. On-treatment pregnancies are pregnancies with an estimated conception date between the first day of study intervention intake up to and including seven days after the last intake 
of study medication. In May 2021, the FDA informed us that they placed a partial clinical hold on the Phase 3 SERENE study, pending certain protocol modifications. In August 2021, the FDA informed us that the partial clinical hold for the Phase 3 SERENE study was lifted following study protocol amendments. The primary analysis of the study, prevention of pregnancy, remains unchanged, but now the SERENE study will only evaluate women with a confirmed diagnosis of uterine fibroids or endometriosis. Bone mineral density monitoring will occur throughout the treatment period as well as after treatment is discontinued to gain additional insights into bone health, which will augment the safety profile observed in the LIBERTY and SPIRIT programs. The enrollment target was increased to 1,020 patients who are 18 to 50 years of age and at risk for pregnancy, enhancing the power of the study. Patient screening with this updated protocol began in September 2021, with initial patients dosed in October 2021. Women will receive once-daily MYFEMBREE for 13 28-day at-risk cycles. Safety data will also be collected during the study.
MVT-602
As part of our license agreement with Takeda, we acquired the worldwide rights to MVT-602, our second product candidate, which previously had been evaluated in over 150 men. MVT-602 is an oligopeptide kisspeptin-1 receptor agonist. Kisspeptin, the ligand, is a naturally occurring peptide that stimulates GnRH release and is required for puberty and maintenance of normal reproductive function, including production of sperm, follicular maturation and ovulation, and production of estrogen and progesterone in women and testosterone in men. MVT-602 is being developed as a potential treatment for female infertility in women as part of assisted reproduction, such as in vitro fertilization (“IVF”). Approximately 1.5 million assisted reproduction cycles are performed each year worldwide. Further, approximately 25% of women suffering from infertility have problems achieving ovulation, including the inability to produce fully matured eggs or the failure to ovulate, most commonly resulting from hormonal dysfunction in the GnRH-luteinizing hormone/follicle-stimulating hormone axis. We believe MVT-602 has the potential to be a safer alternative to human chorionic gonadotropin as a part of assisted reproduction for the treatment of female infertility.
We believe that MVT-602, an analog of the naturally-occurring kisspeptin peptide in humans, may mimic natural physiology by inducing a luteinizing hormone surge during IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies, enhancing the likelihood of successful egg maturation and ovulation at the right time without the serious side effect of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (“OHSS”). While assisted reproductive technologies are effective, typically resulting in pregnancy in 20% to 35% of patients, the standard procedure has remained largely unchanged since inception and has potentially serious side effects. The most serious side effect of assisted reproduction is OHSS. Severe OHSS has been reported to occur in up to 2% of the general assisted reproduction population, and in up to 20% of patients at high-risk for developing OHSS, including women with polycystic ovarian syndrome. OHSS is thought to occur as a result of the nonphysiologic elevations in luteinizing hormone that occur as a result of egg maturation triggered with human chorionic gonadotropin and to a lesser extent the GnRH receptor agonists. Symptoms can range from abdominal pain and bloating in milder cases to rapid weight gain, severe abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, blood clots, decreased urination, kidney failure, and shortness of breath.
By acting upstream in the GnRH-axis to promote the release of physiologically normal levels of key hormones in the assisted reproduction cycle such as luteinizing hormone, kisspeptin agonists, such as MVT-602, may have the potential to trigger egg maturation without causing OHSS. A recently published investigator-sponsored study, where a native kisspeptin peptide (specifically, kisspeptin 54) was used in place of human chorionic gonadotropin as the egg-maturation trigger in the assisted reproduction cycle, showed that none of the 60 high-risk patients developed moderate-to-severe OHSS and resulted in a live birth rate of up to 65.1% at the maximally efficacious dose tested. These results validate the potential use of kisspeptin analogs as an alternative to the standard egg maturation trigger in assisted reproduction protocols. To our knowledge, MVT-602 is the only kisspeptin-1 receptor agonist in clinical development and thus has the potential to become a safe alternative egg-maturation trigger in this space.
In October 2018, we presented data from a Phase 1 study of MVT-602 at the ASRM Annual Congress. Results of the study showed that administration of MVT-602 in healthy premenopausal women in the follicular phase produced a dose-related increase in LH concentrations and expected effects on FSH and estradiol. A total of 24 women were randomized to one of three MVT-602 dose groups (0.3 µg, 1 µg or 3 µg) and then subsequently randomized within the assigned group to receive a single subcutaneous dose of MVT-602 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. Results showed that administration of single subcutaneous doses of MVT-602 demonstrated dose-related increases in LH concentrations and expected post-dose increases in FSH and estradiol concentrations, with little effect observed on progesterone as expected. No serious adverse events were reported, and no subject discontinued from the study due to an adverse event. Adverse events were similar between the placebo and MVT-602 groups with no apparent dose-related effects.
Further assessment of the exposure-response profile of MVT-602 was conducted in a Phase 2a study during the pre-ovulatory phase in 75 fertile women following a minimal controlled ovarian stimulation protocol. After ovarian stimulation, women were randomized to one of four MVT-602 dose groups (0.1 µg, 0.3 µg, 1 µg or 3 µg), to triptorelin, 0.2 mg, or to placebo. Top-line 
results from this Phase 2a study were presented at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Vienna, Austria in June 2019. The study demonstrated that MVT-602 was generally well-tolerated and produced the desired LH surge associated with high and dose-dependent rates of ovulation in healthy women following a minimal controlled ovarian stimulation protocol. This study provides information for dose selection for a future study of MVT-602 in infertile women seeking pregnancy.

Related Party Agreements
Our majority shareholder is Sumitovant, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Sumitomo Pharma. We have agreements with Sumitovant, Sumitomo Pharma, and their affiliates, including Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“Sunovion”), a subsidiary of Sumitomo Pharma. The agreements that are material to us are described below.
Sumitomo Pharma Loan Agreement
On December 27, 2019, we and one of our subsidiaries, MSG, entered into a loan agreement with Sumitomo Pharma (the “Sumitomo Pharma Loan Agreement”). Pursuant to the Sumitomo Pharma Loan Agreement, Sumitomo Pharma agreed to make revolving loans to us in the aggregate principal amount of up to $400.0 million, of which $358.7 million was outstanding as of March 31, 2022. Funds may be drawn down by us once per calendar quarter, subject to certain terms and conditions, including consent of our board of directors. The maturity date of the loans under the Sumitomo Pharma Loan Agreement is December 27, 2024, or the date the outstanding principal of the loans is declared due and payable due to an event of default pursuant to the terms of the Sumitomo Pharma Loan Agreement. In addition, if Sumitomo Pharma fails to own at least a majority of our outstanding common shares, it may become unlawful under Japanese law for Sumitomo Pharma to fund loans to us, and in which case we would not be able to continue to borrow under the Sumitomo Pharma Loan Agreement. Interest is due and payable quarterly. Loans under the Sumitomo Pharma Loan Agreement are prepayable at any time without premium or penalty upon 10 business days’ prior written notice.
Loans under the Sumitomo Pharma Loan Agreement bear interest at a variable rate per annum equal to 3-month London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) plus a margin of 3% payable on the last day of each calendar quarter. Publication of 3-month LIBOR is currently expected to be discontinued on June 30, 2023. In the event that 3-month LIBOR becomes unavailable, we and Sumitomo Pharma will negotiate in good faith to select an alternative interest rate and, if applicable as a result of such alternative interest rate, margin adjustment that is consistent with industry accepted successor rates for determining a LIBOR replacement. Our obligations under the Sumitomo Pharma Loan Agreement are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by us and our subsidiaries. The loans and other obligations are senior unsecured obligations of us, MSG, and subsidiary guarantees. The Sumitomo Pharma Loan Agreement includes customary representations and warranties and affirmative and negative covenants.
The Sumitomo Pharma Loan Agreement also includes customary events of default, including payment defaults, breaches of representations and warranties, breaches of covenants following any applicable cure period, cross acceleration to certain other debt, failure to pay certain final judgments, certain events relating to bankruptcy or insolvency, failure of material provisions of the loan documents to remain in full force and effect or any contest thereto by us or any of our subsidiaries and certain breaches by us under the Investor Rights Agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, a default interest rate of an additional 5% will apply to the outstanding principal amount of the loans, Sumitomo Pharma may terminate its obligations to make loans to us and declare the principal amount of loans to become immediately due and payable, and Sumitomo Pharma may take such other actions as set forth in the Sumitomo Pharma Loan Agreement. Upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy and insolvency events, the obligations of Sumitomo Pharma to make loans to us would automatically terminate and the principal amount of the loans would automatically become due and payable. In addition, if it becomes unlawful for Sumitomo Pharma to maintain the loans under the Sumitomo Pharma Loan Agreement or within 30 days of a change of control with respect to us, we would be required to repay the outstanding principal amount of the loans.
Investor Rights Agreement
On December 27, 2019, we entered into an Investor Rights Agreement with Sumitomo Pharma and Sumitovant (the “Investor Rights Agreement”). Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, among other things, we agreed, at the request of Sumitovant, to register for sale, under the Securities Act of 1933, common shares beneficially owned by Sumitovant, subject to specified conditions and limitations. In addition, we agreed to periodically provide Sumitovant (i) certain financial statements, projections, capitalization summaries and other information and (ii) access to our books, records, facilities and employees during our normal business hours as Sumitovant may reasonably request, subject to specified limitations. 
The Investor Rights Agreement also contains certain protections for our minority shareholders for so long as Sumitomo Pharma or certain of its affiliates beneficially owns more than 50% of our common shares. These protections include: (i) a requirement that Sumitovant vote its shares for the election of independent directors in accordance with the recommendation of our board of directors or in the same proportion as the shareholders not affiliated with Sumitovant vote their shares; (ii) a requirement that the audit committee of our board of directors be composed solely of three independent directors; (iii) a requirement that any transaction proposed by Sumitomo Pharma or certain of its affiliates that would increase Sumitomo Pharma’s beneficial ownership to over 60% of the outstanding voting power of us must be approved by our audit committee (if occurring prior to December 27, 2022) and be conditioned on the approval of shareholders not affiliated with Sumitovant approving the transaction by a majority of the common shares held by such shareholders; and (iv) a requirement that any related person transactions between Sumitomo Pharma or certain of its affiliates and us must be approved by our audit committee.
Pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, we also agreed that at all times that Sumitomo Pharma beneficially owns more than 50% of our common shares, Sumitomo Pharma, by purchasing common shares in the open market or from us in certain specified circumstances, will have the right to maintain its percentage ownership in our common shares in the event of a financing event or acquisition event conducted by us, or specified other events, subject to specific conditions.
Market Access Services Agreement
On August 1, 2020, one of our subsidiaries, MSG, entered into the Market Access Services Agreement, as amended, (“Market Access Services Agreement”) with Sunovion. Pursuant to the Market Access Services Agreement, among other things, Sunovion agreed to provide to MSG certain market access services with respect to the distribution and sale of ORGOVYX (“Prostate Cancer Product”) and MYFEMBREE (“Women’s Health Product,” and collectively with Prostate Cancer Product, the “Products”, and each a “Product”), including, among other things: (i) adding the Products to Sunovion’s agreements with its third party logistics providers; (ii) adding the Women’s Health Product to certain of Sunovion’s contracts with wholesalers, group purchasing organizations and integrated delivery networks and negotiating rates for the Products with certain market access customers; (iii) providing order-to-cash services; (iv) providing certain employees to provide market access account director services; (v) performing activities required in connection with supporting and maintaining contracts between us and market access customers for the coverage, purchase, or dispensing of the Products; (vi) managing the validation, processing and payment of rebates, chargebacks, and certain administrative, distribution and service fees related to the Products; (vii) providing MSG with price reporting metrics and other information required to allow us to comply with applicable government price reporting requirements; (viii) coordinating with MSG and any applicable wholesalers and distributors to address any recalls, investigations, or product holds; (ix) configuring, or causing to be configured, the appropriate software systems to enable Sunovion to perform its obligations under the Market Access Services Agreement; and (x) providing training and certain other ancillary support services to facilitate the foregoing. Pursuant to this agreement, Sunovion will also provide certain services to us to enable us to comply with our obligations under the State Transparency Laws.
MSG, in turn, appointed Sunovion as the exclusive distributor of the Women’s Health Product and a non-exclusive distributor of the Prostate Cancer Product, each in the United States, including all of its territories and possessions. 
In order to facilitate Sunovion’s provision of these services, MSG agreed, among other things, to: (i) grant Sunovion a non-exclusive license under all intellectual property owned or controlled by MSG, solely for Sunovion’s use in connection with its performance of the contemplated services; (ii) provide Sunovion periodic reports of sales projections and estimated volume requirements, as well as such other information as Sunovion reasonably requests or may need to perform the services; (iii) comply with the provisions of any agreements between Sunovion and third parties pursuant to which the Products will be distributed or sold; (iv) cooperate with certain investigations related to orders and audits of MSG’s quality systems solely related, as reasonably determined by us, to Sunovion’s performance of certain regulatory services, at Sunovion’s costs; and (v) promptly notify Sunovion in the event relugolix is recalled.
As consideration for the services, MSG has paid and will continue to pay Sunovion an agreed-upon monthly service charge for each of the first two years of the Market Access Services Agreement term and any agreed regulatory and training service charges. After the second year of the Market Access Services Agreement term, the monthly service charges will be determined by the parties. In addition, MSG also agreed to (x) reimburse Sunovion for any pass-through expenses it incurs while providing the services, and (y) establish an escrow fund for use by Sunovion to manage payments for rebates, chargebacks and similar fees. 
The Market Access Services Agreement also contains customary representations and warranties by the parties and customary provisions related to confidentiality, indemnification and insurance. The initial term of the Market Access Services Agreement is three years. Thereafter, the term will be automatically extended for one-year periods, unless either party provides notice of its intent not to renew the Market Access Services Agreement at least nine (9) months prior to the expiration of the applicable term. Either party may also terminate the Market Access Services Agreement prior to the end of its term in the event of an uncured material breach by the other party, if there are certain changes of law, or if such other party becomes insolvent or undergoes a change of control. MSG may also terminate the Market Access Services Agreement with respect to one or both Products if Sunovion fails to satisfy certain market access milestones or for convenience upon payment of a break-up fee.
Other Agreements
Takeda License Agreement
On April 29, 2016, we entered into a License Agreement with Takeda (as subsequently amended, the “Takeda License Agreement”) pursuant to which Takeda Pharmaceuticals International AG (“Takeda”), a subsidiary of Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited (“Takeda Limited”), the originator of relugolix, granted to us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by Takeda to develop and commercialize relugolix and MVT-602, and products containing these compounds for all human diseases and conditions. The territory for our exclusive license for relugolix covers all countries worldwide, except that Takeda retains exclusive rights to Japan, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam (including, in each case, the territories and possession of each of the foregoing), which we collectively refer to as the Takeda Territory. Takeda has granted us a nonexclusive license in the Takeda Territory to manufacture relugolix and to conduct development of relugolix for prostate cancer solely for the purpose of developing, manufacturing and commercializing relugolix in our territory.

Under the Takeda License Agreement, we granted to Takeda an exclusive, royalty-bearing license in the Takeda Territory under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by us to develop and commercialize relugolix and products containing relugolix for all human diseases and conditions, subject to our nonexclusive rights to conduct development and manufacturing as described above. We also granted to Takeda a nonexclusive license in our territory to manufacture relugolix and MVT-602; and to conduct development of relugolix for uterine fibroids and endometriosis solely for the purpose of developing, manufacturing and commercializing relugolix in the Takeda Territory. Takeda’s license includes a right of reference to regulatory materials controlled by us. If Takeda determines not to seek regulatory approval for or to commercialize relugolix in any country in the Takeda Territory, then we have a right of first negotiation to acquire the rights to seek regulatory approval and commercialize relugolix in such country.
We are solely responsible, at our expense, for all activities related to the development of relugolix and MVT-602 in our territory and all activities related to the development of relugolix through the receipt of regulatory approval for prostate cancer in certain countries in the Takeda Territory. Pursuant to the terms of the Takeda License Agreement, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and obtain regulatory approval of relugolix for the treatment, prevention, cure or control of symptoms associated with uterine fibroids or endometriosis and MVT-602 in our territory, as well as to develop and obtain regulatory approval of relugolix for prostate cancer in Japan and the U.S. We are solely responsible, at our expense, for all 
activities related to the commercialization of relugolix and MVT-602 in our territory and must use commercially reasonable efforts to do so in each country in our territory in which we obtain regulatory approval. Takeda is solely responsible, at its expense, for all activities related to the commercialization of relugolix in the Takeda Territory, and must use diligent efforts to commercialize relugolix for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory following receipt of regulatory approval.
Under the Takeda License Agreement, we will pay Takeda a fixed, high single-digit royalty on net sales of certain relugolix products, a low single-digit royalty on net sales of certain other relugolix products, and a high single-digit royalty on net sales of MVT-602 products in our territory, all subject to certain agreed reductions. Takeda will pay us a high single-digit royalty on net sales of relugolix products for prostate cancer in the Takeda Territory, subject to certain agreed reductions. Royalties are required to be paid, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, until the latest to occur of the expiration of the last to expire valid claim of a licensed patent covering such product in such country, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity for such product in such country, or 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country. Under the Takeda License Agreement, there was no upfront payment and there are no payments upon the achievement of clinical development or marketing approval milestones. We have also licensed additional patents and patent applications from Takeda directed to other oligopeptides that target the same pathway as MVT-602.
The Takeda License Agreement will expire, on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis, on the expiration of the royalty payment term described above for such product in such country. Either party may terminate the Takeda License Agreement for the other party’s uncured material breach, challenge to the patents licensed under the Takeda License Agreement, or insolvency. Takeda may terminate the Takeda License Agreement with respect to a compound if we cease development or commercialization of such compound. We may terminate the agreement at will, in our sole discretion, in its entirety, or with respect to relugolix for prostate cancer or both endometriosis and uterine fibroids, or on a compound by compound basis for all fields, upon prior notice, with the notice period depending on the compound and field to be terminated and the regulatory status at the time that notice of termination is given. We may also terminate the agreement with respect to a compound for safety reasons or lack of commercial viability. If the agreement is terminated in its entirety or with respect to relugolix for prostate cancer, other than for safety reasons or by us for Takeda’s uncured material breach, prior to receipt of the first regulatory approval of relugolix for prostate cancer in Japan, then we must either reimburse Takeda for its out of pocket costs and expenses directly incurred in connection with Takeda’s completion of the relugolix development for prostate cancer, up to an agreed cap, or complete ourselves the conduct of any clinical studies of relugolix for prostate cancer that are ongoing as of the effective date of such termination, at our cost and expense. If we reimburse Takeda for such costs, then under certain circumstances we may be later reimbursed by Takeda through a royalty on sales of the terminated relugolix product.
Takeda Supply Agreements
In June 2016, we and one of Takeda’s affiliates, Takeda Limited, entered into an agreement for the manufacture and supply of relugolix. Under this agreement, Takeda Limited supplied us with, and we obtained from Takeda Limited, all of our requirements for relugolix drug substance and drug product that were used under our development plans.
On May 30, 2018, we entered into a Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Takeda (the “Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement”) pursuant to which Takeda agreed to supply us with and we agreed to obtain from Takeda certain quantities of relugolix drug substance according to agreed-upon quality specifications. For relugolix drug substance manufactured or delivered on or after December 31, 2019, we will pay Takeda a price per kilogram of relugolix drug substance to be agreed upon between the parties at the beginning of each fiscal year. Takeda has also assisted with the transfer of technology and manufacturing know-how to a second contract manufacturing organization of one of our subsidiaries, MSG. 
The initial term of the Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement began on May 30, 2018, and will continue for five years. At the end of the initial term, the Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement will automatically renew for successive one-year terms, unless either party gives notice of termination to the other at least 12 months prior to the end of the then-current term. The Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement may be terminated by either party upon 90 days’ notice of an uncured material breach of its terms by the other party, or immediately upon notice to the other party of a party’s bankruptcy. Each party will also have the right to terminate the Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement, in whole or in part, for any reason upon 180 days’ prior written notice to the other party, provided that any then-open purchase orders will remain in effect and be binding on both parties. The Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement, including any then-open purchase orders thereunder, will terminate immediately upon the termination of the Takeda License Agreement in accordance with its terms.
The Takeda Commercial Supply Agreement also includes customary provisions relating to, among others, delivery, inspection procedures, warranties, quality management, storage, handling and transport, intellectual property, confidentiality and indemnification.
Excella Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement
On April 4, 2019, one of our subsidiaries, MSG, entered into a Commercial Manufacturing and Supply Agreement with Excella GmbH & Co. KG (“Excella”) pursuant to which Excella agreed to manufacture and supply us with certain commercial relugolix active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”). Subject to and under the terms and conditions of this agreement, Excella shall not develop, manufacture or supply any relugolix API or regulatory starting material, or any product containing relugolix, for or to any third party without our written consent.
Commercialization of our Approved Products
Our fully integrated commercial organization consists of sales, marketing, market access, and commercial operations functions. In the U.S., our sales teams market ORGOVYX primarily to urologists and oncologists and MYFEMBREE primarily to gynecology practices, as well as to other healthcare professionals. In the U.S., our sales and marketing efforts are supported by Pfizer pursuant to the terms of the Pfizer Collaboration and License Agreement, in which we collaborate to jointly develop and commercialize relugolix in oncology and women’s health. 
In addition to using customary pharmaceutical company practices, we, and Pfizer, have also adopted digital marketing technologies to engage with customers. The use of digital marketing technologies increased as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which required us, and Pfizer, to shift from customary in-person to primarily telephonic and virtual interactions with healthcare professionals. For a more detailed discussion of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and our risk mitigation efforts, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations— Effects of the COVID-19 Pandemic on our Business” in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report.
Our approved products, ORGOVYX and MYFEMBREE, are sold in the U.S. principally through wholesale and specialty distribution and pharmacy channels. These customers subsequently resell our products to healthcare providers and patients. To facilitate our commercial activities in the U.S., we also engage with various other third parties such as advertising agencies, market research firms and vendors providing other sales-support related services as needed, including digital marketing and other promotional activities.
To help ensure that all eligible patients in the U.S. have appropriate access to ORGOVYX and MYFEMBREE, we have established comprehensive reimbursement and support programs. Under these programs, we provide co-pay assistance to qualified, commercially insured patients to help minimize out-of-pocket costs and provide free drug to uninsured or under-insured patients who meet certain criteria. In addition, our programs provide comprehensive reimbursement support services, such as prior authorization support.
Pursuant to the Richter Development and Commercialization Agreement, we granted Richter an exclusive license to commercialize relugolix combination tablet for uterine fibroids and endometriosis in Europe, the Commonwealth of Independent States including Russia, Latin America, Australia, and New Zealand. Since RYEQO’s approvals in the EU and U.K. for the treatment of moderate to severe symptoms of uterine fibroids in adult women of reproductive age, Richter has launched RYEQO in 17 countries.
Pursuant to the Accord License Agreement, we granted Accord an exclusive license to commercialize relugolix for the treatment of advanced hormone-sensitive prostate cancer under the trade name ORGOVYX in the European Economic Area, U.K., Switzerland, and Turkey. Accord expects to launch ORGOVYX for this indication in Europe in the second half of calendar year 2022.
Manufacturing and Product Supply
We do not own or operate, nor do we expect to own or operate, facilities for drug substance and drug product manufacturing, storage and distribution, or testing of our product or product candidates. We contract with third parties for these activities and expect to continue to do so in the future. We have personnel with extensive technical, manufacturing, analytical and quality experience and strong project management discipline to oversee activities performed by third-party contract manufacturing organizations and testing activities performed by other third parties, and to compile manufacturing and quality information for our regulatory submissions. 
Manufacturing of any product or product candidate is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern recordkeeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. We expect that all of our contract manufacturing organizations will manufacture relugolix and MVT-602 under current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) conditions, which set forth the regulatory standards for the production of pharmaceuticals to be used in humans. However, we do not control the manufacturing process of, and are completely dependent on, our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with cGMP requirements and other regulations 
and laws for the manufacture of our product and product candidates. If our contract manufacturers cannot successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities, they may not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approvals for their manufacturing facilities and any applications that we submit to the FDA or other regulatory authorities that list those manufacturing facilities may be negatively affected. 
If there are delays in initiating new relationships with one or more other third-party manufacturers for MVT-602, or if there are delays in completing technology transfer to any of these manufacturers, or if any of our third-party manufacturers experience adverse developments, including with respect to adverse findings during inspections and/or the COVID-19 pandemic, we could experience delays in our future development and commercialization efforts.
Competition
The pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and require an ongoing, extensive search for technological innovation. These industries are characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our products, product candidates, knowledge, experience, and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
Our ability to compete successfully will significantly depend upon our ability to effectively complete necessary clinical studies and regulatory approval processes, and effectively commercialize approved products. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any product candidate for which we have or may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, acceptance by physicians, ease of patient compliance, dosing convenience, price, insurance and other reimbursement coverage, patent position, distribution, and marketing. Our competitors may obtain FDA or other regulatory approvals for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market.
Many of our existing and potential future competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, and human resources to deploy than we do towards the discovery and development of product candidates, as well as obtaining regulatory approvals of those product candidates in the U.S. and in foreign countries. Many of our existing and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience in manufacturing and commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaboration agreements with larger more established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific, sales force, and management personnel and establishing clinical study sites and patient enrollment and retention for clinical studies. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. 
Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for prostate cancer, uterine fibroids or endometriosis by a competitor could render our product candidates non-competitive or obsolete or reduce the demand for our product candidates before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses.
Although ORGOVYX is the first and only oral GnRH receptor antagonist for adult patients with advanced prostate cancer approved by the FDA in the U.S., we may face competition from various drugs approved for the treatment of prostate cancer, such as Lupron Depot® (AbbVie Inc.), Eligard® (Tolmar Pharmaceuticals), Firmagon® (Ferring Pharmaceuticals), and CamceviTM (Accord BioPharma (U.S.)). LHRH agonists, such as leuprolide acetate, are the current standard of care treatment used to lower testosterone in men with advanced prostate cancer. These have been approved for three decades and are administered by injection on a monthly, quarterly, every four months or every six months basis and are the most direct competitor for ORGOVYX. Degarelix, a depot GnRH antagonist requiring monthly injections, is approved for use to lower testosterone in men with advanced prostate cancer, but clinical use is limited likely due to the requirement for monthly high-volume injections with a rate of injection site reactions of approximately 35%. Other oral medications used for androgen deprivation therapy include androgen receptor inhibitors such as enzalutamide, apalutamide and darolutamide, androgen biosynthesis inhibitors such as abiraterone acetate, and antiandrogens such as bicalutamide and flutamide, each commonly used in combination with a GnRH receptor antagonist or LHRH agonist.
MYFEMBREE is the first and only once-daily oral GnRH treatment for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids in premenopausal women approved by the FDA in the U.S., with a treatment duration of up to 24 months. MYFEMBREE competes with ORIAHNN®, an oral GnRH receptor antagonist combination therapy (one capsule 
(elagolix 300 mg, estradiol 1 mg, norethindrone acetate 0.5 mg) in the morning and one capsule (elagolix 300 mg) in the evening), which was approved by the FDA and launched by AbbVie in June 2020 for the management of heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine leiomyomas (fibroids) in premenopausal women. In addition, ObsEva SA’s NDA for linzagolix, an oral GnRH receptor antagonist for the treatment of uterine fibroids for use with and without add-back therapy, was accepted for review by the FDA in November 2021 and the FDA set a target action date of September 13, 2022. 
We consider MYFEMBREE’s (if approved) most direct competitor for the treatment of pain associated with endometriosis to be ORILISSA™ (elagolix), an oral GnRH receptor antagonist, which was approved as monotherapy (150 mg once a day or 200 mg twice a day) by the FDA and launched by AbbVie in August 2018 for the management of moderate-to-severe pain associated with endometriosis. AbbVie also has one ongoing Phase 3b study of elagolix in combination with hormonal therapy in women with pain associated with endometriosis. In April 2021, AbbVie posted the results of a Phase 3 study evaluating elagolix 200 mg twice a day with and without hormonal add-back therapy in women with moderate to severe endometriosis associated pain, showing that the study met its primary endpoint. In May 2019, ObsEva initiated a Phase 3 program evaluating linzagolix in women with endometriosis-associated pain, evaluating a lower 75 mg monotherapy dose and a higher 200 mg dose with hormones; however, one of the Phase 3 studies being conducted in the U.S. was terminated due to enrollment challenges. ObsEva reported in January 2022 positive Phase 3 study results for the higher dose with hormones, but the lower 75 mg monotherapy dose did not meet one of the co-primary objectives of nonmenstrual pelvic pain.
We believe the development of multiple GnRH receptor antagonists by other biopharmaceutical companies adds further validation to the therapeutic relevance of GnRH as a target for the treatment of women’s health and endocrine diseases and will help fuel growth in this market which has lacked innovative new medical therapies.
In addition to other GnRH receptor antagonists and selective progesterone receptor modulators in active development, we are aware of other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies as well as academic institutions, government agencies, and private and public research institutions that are developing, and may in the future develop and commercialize, products for gender-specific hormone disorders.
Intellectual Property
Our commercial success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and other countries for relugolix, MVT-602 and any future products and product candidates. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing and in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets and know-how to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Generally, issued patents are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest claimed non-provisional filing date. In certain instances, patent terms can be adjusted to recapture a portion of delay by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) in examining the patent application (patent term adjustment (“PTA”)) or extended to account for term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period (patent term extension (“PTE”)), or both. We cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or future applications or that any issued patents will adequately protect our products or product candidates. Without patent protection for our current or future product candidates, we may be open to competition from generic versions of such products.
Under the Takeda License Agreement, we are the exclusive licensee of multiple granted U.S. patents, and pending patent applications, as well as patents and patent applications in numerous foreign jurisdictions relating to relugolix and MVT-602. 
For relugolix, we are the exclusive worldwide licensee, excluding the Takeda Territory. These patents and patent applications cover the relugolix molecule and certain analogs and solid forms; the use of relugolix to treat prostate cancer, hysteromyoma (uterine fibroids), and endometriosis; methods of manufacturing and certain intermediates; and certain formulations. The patent family directed to the relugolix molecule will expire in 2024, subject to any extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. We have applied for PTE based on the approval of ORGOVYX for a patent covering relugolix. If granted, the term of the extended patent may be extended for up to five years, or 2029. Based on the approval of RYEQO in Europe for the treatment of uterine fibroids, we have also filed Supplementary Protection Certificate (“SPC”) applications based on the European patent directed to the relugolix molecule. If issued, the SPCs should expire in 2029 in individual European countries in which filed. The patents and patent applications, if issued, directed to methods of manufacturing relugolix and relevant intermediates will expire in 2033, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. The patents and patent applications, if issued, directed to formulations of relugolix will expire in 2036, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. We have filed patent applications directed to uses of relugolix combination therapy in treating, among other conditions, heavy menstrual bleeding associated with uterine fibroids and for pain associated with endometriosis. The granted U.S. patent and pending patent applications in this patent family are co-owned with Takeda under the Takeda License Agreement. This patent and these applications, if issued, will expire in 2037 not including any adjustments or extensions. We have also filed patent applications directed to the use of 
relugolix as a monotherapy to treat advanced prostate cancer. The granted U.S. patents, and patent applications in this patent family, if issued, will expire in 2037, not including any adjustments or extensions. These patents and patent applications are also co-owned with Takeda. We have also filed patent applications directed to particular crystalline forms of relugolix and certain relugolix solvates. The patent applications in these families, if issued, will expire in 2040, not including any adjustments or extensions. The relugolix crystalline form application is co-owned with Takeda under the Takeda License Agreement, and the relugolix solvates application is owned by Myovant Sciences GmbH. We have also filed a patent application directed to uses of relugolix combination therapy to treat prostate cancer, uterine fibroids, or endometriosis. The patent applications resulting from this family, if issued, will expire in 2041, not including any adjustments or extensions. This application is owned by Myovant Sciences GmbH. We have also filed patent applications directed to fixed dose combination formulations which, if issued, will expire in 2041, not including any adjustments or extensions. These applications are owned by Myovant Sciences GmbH.
For MVT-602, we are the exclusive worldwide licensee of multiple patents and patent applications in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. These patents and patent applications cover the MVT-602 oligopeptide and its use in treating advanced prostate cancer, as well as certain sustained release formulations containing MVT-602. The patent family directed to the MVT-602 molecule and method of use expires in 2028 in the U.S. (because of PTA) and in 2026 ex-U.S., subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. The patents directed to sustained-release formulations of MVT-602, if issued, would expire between 2030 and 2031, subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. We intend to apply for PTE for a patent covering MVT-602. If granted, the patent term covering MVT-602 may be extended. We are also the owner of patents and patent applications directed to uses of MVT-602 in treating infertility. The patents and applications, if issued, in this family will expire in 2037 subject to any adjustment or extension of patent term that may be available in a particular country. We have licensed additional patents and patent applications from Takeda directed to other oligopeptides that target the same pathway as MVT-602.
In addition to patents, we also rely upon trademarks, trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We maintain both registered and common law trademarks. Common law trademark protection typically continues where and for as long as the mark is used. Registered trademarks continue in each country for as long as the trademark is registered. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants, and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners and selected consultants. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Obtaining patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have or obtain rights to patents which could be used to prevent or attempt to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that also claim technology to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference or derivation proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention.
Orange Book Listing
An NDA sponsor must identify to the FDA patents that claim the drug substance or drug product or approved method of using the drug. When the drug is approved, those patents are among the information about the product that is listed in the FDA publication, Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, which is referred to as the Orange Book. Any applicant who files an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA must certify, for each patent listed in the Orange Book for the Referenced Listed Drug (“RLD”) that (1) no patent information on the drug product that is the subject of the application has been submitted to the FDA, (2) such patent has expired, (3) the listed patent will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration, or (4) such patent is invalid or will not be infringed upon by the manufacture, use or sale of the drug product for which the application is submitted. An ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant may also submit a statement that it intends to carve-out from the labeling of its product an RLD’s use that is protected by exclusivity or a method of use patent. The fourth certification described above is known as a Paragraph IV certification. A notice of the Paragraph IV certification must be provided to each owner of the patent that is the subject of the certification and to the reference NDA holder. The reference NDA holder and patent owners may initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the Paragraph IV notice. We intend to defend vigorously any patents for our approved products. Six patents and four patents are currently listed in the Orange Book for ORGOVYX and MYFEMBREE, respectively.
Government Regulation
United States- FDA Drug Approval Process 
In the U.S., pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and other regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”), and other federal and state statutes and regulations, govern, among other things, the research, development, nonclinical and clinical testing, manufacture, storage, recordkeeping, approval, labeling, promotion and marketing, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling, and import and export of pharmaceutical products. Failure to comply with applicable U.S. requirements may subject a company to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil penalties or criminal investigations and penalties brought by the FDA, the Department of Justice or other governmental organizations.
No drug product candidates may be marketed in the U.S. until the drug has received FDA approval. The steps required before a drug may be approved for marketing in the U.S. generally includes the following:
•completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies conducted in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices (“GLP”); 
•submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application (“IND”) for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical studies may begin in the U.S.; 
•approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”), representing each clinical site before each clinical study may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies in accordance with Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”) to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication; 
•the preparation and submission of an NDA or sNDA to the FDA for commercial marketing;
•FDA acceptance, review, and approval of the NDA or sNDA, which might include an advisory committee; and
•satisfactory completion of any FDA pre-approval inspections of a manufacturing facility or facilities at which the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) and finished drug product are produced and tested to assess compliance with cGMP and of selected clinical investigators or contract research organizations for their compliance with GCP. 
Regulatory authorities or an IRB or the study sponsor may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk.
Nonclinical studies include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, formulation, and toxicity, as well as animal studies to assess the characteristics and potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The results of nonclinical testing are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND along with other information, including information about product chemistry, manufacturing and controls, and a proposed clinical study protocol. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA raises concerns or questions about the conduct of the clinical study as outlined in the IND prior to that time. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical study can begin. The FDA may nevertheless initiate a clinical hold after the 30 days if, for example, significant public health issues arise. A separate submission to the existing IND must be made for each successive clinical study conducted during product development. Long-term nonclinical tests, such as animal tests of reproductive toxicity and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. 
Clinical studies are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. These phases generally include the following: 
•Phase 1 - Studies, which involve the initial introduction of the product candidate into humans, are initially conducted in a limited number of subjects to assess pharmacological actions, side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, early evidence on effectiveness. Phase 1 studies may also be conducted to assess potential for drug interactions or drug exposure in patients with renal or hepatic impairment.
•Phase 2 - Studies are conducted with groups of patients afflicted with a specified disease in order to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, metabolism, pharmacokinetics, dosage tolerance, and optimum dosage, and to identify common adverse effects and safety risks.
•Phase 3 - Phase 3 studies, also called pivotal or registration studies, are undertaken to obtain the additional information about clinical efficacy and safety in a larger number of patients, typically at geographically dispersed clinical study sites, to permit the FDA to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the drug. In most cases, the FDA requires two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical studies to demonstrate the efficacy of the drug. A single Phase 3 clinical study with other confirmatory evidence may be sufficient in rare instances where the study is a large multi-center study demonstrating internal consistency and a statistically very persuasive finding of a clinically meaningful effect on mortality, irreversible morbidity, or prevention of a disease with a potentially serious outcome and where confirmation of the result in a second study would be practically or ethically impossible.
The FDA may require, or companies may pursue, additional clinical studies after a product is approved. These Phase 4 studies may be deemed a condition to be satisfied after a drug receives approval. Failure to satisfy such post-marketing commitments can result in FDA enforcement action, up to and including withdrawal of approval.
After completion of the required clinical testing, an NDA is prepared and submitted to the FDA. FDA approval of the NDA is required before marketing of the product may begin in the U.S. The NDA must include the results of all nonclinical, clinical, and other testing, and a compilation of data relating to the product’s pharmacology, chemistry, manufacture and controls. The submission of most NDAs is subject to a substantial application user fee, and the manufacturer and/or sponsor under an approved NDA are also subject to annual program user fees. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or decide that the data is insufficient for approval and require additional nonclinical, preclinical, or other studies.
The FDA has 60 days from its receipt of an NDA to determine whether the application will be accepted for filing based on the agency’s threshold determination that it is sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA sets a user fee goal date that informs the applicant of the specific date by which the FDA intends to complete its review. The FDA’s goal is to review applications within ten months of the filing date or, if the application relates to an unmet medical need in a serious or life-threatening indication and is granted priority review, six months from the filing date. The review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether a drug candidate is safe and effective for its intended use and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP. The FDA may refer applications to an advisory committee—typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts—for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendation of an advisory committee, but it generally follows such recommendations. Before approving an NDA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. Additionally, the FDA will inspect the facility or some of the facilities at which the drug is manufactured or tested. 
After the FDA evaluates the NDA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the drug product and/or its API will be produced, it issues either an approval letter or a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally outlines the deficiencies in the submission and may require substantial additional testing, or information, in order for the FDA to reconsider the application. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. If, or when, those deficiencies have been addressed to the FDA’s satisfaction in a resubmission of the NDA, the FDA will issue an approval letter.
As a condition of NDA approval, the FDA may require a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”) to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the potential risks. A REMS can include a medication guide, a communication plan for healthcare professionals, and elements to assure safe use, such as special training and certification requirements for individuals who prescribe or dispense the drug, requirements that patients enroll in a registry, and other measures that the FDA deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug. Moreover, product approval may require substantial post-approval testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy. Once granted, product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained or problems are identified following initial marketing.
Changes to some of the conditions established in an approved application, including changes in formulation, indications, labeling, or manufacturing processes or facilities, require submission and FDA approval of a new NDA or sNDA before the change can be implemented. An sNDA for a new indication typically requires clinical data similar to that in the original application, and the FDA uses the same procedures and actions in reviewing an sNDA as it does in reviewing NDAs.
Post-Approval Requirements 
Approved drugs that are manufactured or distributed in the U.S. pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA. For instance, the FDA closely regulates the post-approval marketing and promotion of drugs, including standards and regulations for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the Internet and social media. Drugs may be marketed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product’s FDA approved labeling.
Adverse event reporting and submission of periodic reports is required following FDA approval of an NDA. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing, REMS, or surveillance to monitor the effects of an approved product, or restrictions on the distribution or use of the product. In addition, quality-control, drug manufacture, packaging, and labeling procedures must continue to conform to GMP requirements after approval, including for supply chain traceability. Drug manufacturers and certain of their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies. Registration with the FDA subjects entities to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA, during which the agency inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with GMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality-control to maintain compliance with GMP requirements. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, suspension of the approval, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls; 
•fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
Foreign Regulation 
In addition to regulations in the U.S., we are subject to laws and regulations of other countries governing clinical studies and the manufacturing, commercial sales and distribution of our products outside the U.S. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical studies or marketing of the product in foreign countries or economic areas, such as the EU. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the U.S. apply similarly in the context of foreign countries and the EU, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be shorter or longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively impact the regulatory process in others.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
Our current and future business operations are subject to additional healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security, price reporting, and physician sunshine laws.
Because we commercialize products that could be reimbursed under a federal healthcare program and other governmental healthcare programs, we have a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics and other corporate compliance policies, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee or third-party misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations. Although the development and implementation of compliance programs designed to establish internal control and facilitate compliance can mitigate the risk of violating these laws, and the subsequent investigation, prosecution, and penalties assessed for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. 
If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting requirements, and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Anti-Kickback Laws
U.S. federal laws, including the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, prohibit fraud and abuse involving state and federal healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid. These federal Anti-Kickback Statutes, among other things, make it illegal for any person or entity, including a prescription drug manufacturer or a party acting on its behalf, to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration, directly or indirectly, that is intended to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item, or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including cash, gifts or gift certificates, improper discounts, and free or reduced-price items and services. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. 
Additionally, the intent standard under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), to a stricter intent standard such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or the specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act (discussed below).
Federal and State Prohibitions on False Claims
The federal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent or not provided as claimed. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Many states have enacted similar laws modeled after the federal civil False Claims Act that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state healthcare programs, and, in several states, such laws apply to claims submitted to all payers. 
Federal Prohibitions on Healthcare Fraud and False Statements Related to Healthcare Matters
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) created new federal civil and criminal statutes that prohibit among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers. Like the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the ACA broadened the reach of certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes under HIPAA by amending the intent requirement such that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. 
The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. 
Healthcare Privacy and Security Laws
Numerous federal and state laws, including state security breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws and federal and state consumer protection laws, govern the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (“HITECH”) and their implementing regulations, impose specific requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses and their respective business associates and covered subcontractors that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individual identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security, and transmission of individually identifiable health information. In addition, certain state and foreign laws, regulations, standards and regulatory guidance govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.
We have conducted, and may continue to conduct, clinical studies or continue to enroll subjects in our ongoing or future clinical studies in certain jurisdictions in which we may be subject to additional privacy restrictions. For example, the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the EU, including personal health data, is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective on May 25, 2018. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including requirements relating to processing health and other sensitive data, obtaining consent of the individuals to whom the personal data relates, providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data out of the EU, including the U.S., and permits data protection authorities to impose large penalties for violations of the GDPR, including potential fines of up to the greater of 20 million Euros or 4% of annual global revenue. The GDPR also confers a private right of action on data subjects and consumer associations to lodge complaints with supervisory authorities, seek judicial remedies, and obtain compensation for damages resulting from violations of the GDPR. In addition, the GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. Data protection authorities from the different EU member states have issued limited guidance, may interpret the GDPR and national laws differently and may impose additional requirements, which complicates the effort to comply with these laws. Further, Brexit has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the U.K. In particular, it is unclear whether, post-Brexit, the U.K. will enact data protection legislation equivalent to the GDPR and how data transfers to and from the U.K. will be regulated.
Also, many states have similar healthcare statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer. Some states require the posting of information relating to clinical studies. Additionally, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), which creates new individual privacy rights for California consumers (as defined in the law) and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling personal data of California consumers and households. The CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, gives California residents expanded rights to access and requires deletion of their personal information, opting out of certain personal information sharing, and receiving detailed information about how their personal information is collected, used and shared. The CCPA provides for civil penalties for violations, as well as a private right of action for data breaches that may increase data breach litigation. Although the CCPA includes exemptions for certain clinical studies data, as well as HIPAA protected health information, the law may increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to other personal information we collect about California residents. The CCPA has prompted a number of proposals for new federal and state privacy legislation that, if passed, could increase our potential liability, increase our compliance costs, and adversely affect our business.
Physician Payments Sunshine Act
There has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The ACA through the enactment of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, imposes, among other things, annual reporting requirements for covered manufacturers for certain payments and other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners), and teaching hospitals, as well as certain ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
Many states have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payer, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers, marketing expenditures, or drug pricing, as well as state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Additionally, to the extent that any of our products are sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, (“FCPA”), which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity to obtain a business advantage. The FCPA also requires public companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to make and keep books and records that accurately and fairly reflect their transactions and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls. A determination that our operations or activities are not, or were not, in compliance with U.S. or foreign laws or regulations could result in the imposition of substantial fines, interruptions of business, loss of suppliers, vendor or other third-party relationships, termination of necessary licenses or 
permits, and legal or equitable sanctions. Other internal or governmental investigations or legal or regulatory proceedings, including lawsuits brought by private litigants, may also follow as a consequence. 
Healthcare Reform
Public policy, laws, regulations, and guidelines for the pharmaceutical industry can be made across the executive and legislative branches of government and at the federal, state and local level. Efforts to expand access, enhance quality and contain costs are fundamental underpinnings of most healthcare reform measures. While well intended, some policies could have an adverse effect, such as cost containment programs to limit the growth of health care costs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. 
At any time, legislation can be drafted, introduced, and passed in the U.S. Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, marketing, coverage, and reimbursement of products regulated by the FDA or other government agencies. For example, in 2022 Congress is expected to pass the Prescription Drug User Fee Act Reauthorization for years 2023 to 2028, as well as annual funding for the FDA and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”); and may consider other major legislation such as the “Build Back Better Act” aimed in part at lowering drug prices and reforming Medicare. Previously passed legislation that materially impacts prescription drug manufacturers will also become effective in the near-term. For example a provision included in the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 will eliminate the statutory Medicaid drug rebate cap, currently set at 100% of a drug’s average manufacturer price, effective beginning January 1, 2024. Further, Congress is considering additional healthcare reform measures. It is also possible that additional government action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Federal agencies including the HHS and its Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) may also issue rules and guidance that impact coverage, reimbursement, and pricing policy for prescription drugs. For example, CMS previously finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from drug manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly or indirectly through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers. The implementation of this rule has been delayed until January 1, 2026. Further, in response to the Biden administration’s July 2020 executive order aimed at prescription drugs, HHS released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices which provides principles for drug pricing reform and potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue to advance these principles.
Finally, U.S states also have partial jurisdiction over coverage of prescription drugs by commercial health insurance plans and Medicaid. Over the course of the state legislative sessions, we are closely tracking legislation that affects drug pricing and access in these channels. This includes legislation attempting to cap drug prices, expand 340B pricing, and require drug manufacturer rebates to be passed through to patients at the point-of-sale; as well as efforts to reduce or eliminate prior authorization and step therapy, and to protect manufacturer-provided financial assistance for patients.
Coverage, Reimbursement and Pricing 
Sales of any products for which we have obtained or, in the future, may obtain regulatory approval, depend, in part, on the coverage and reimbursement status of those products. In the U.S., sales of any products for which we have received or, in the future, may receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. Third-party payers include government programs including Medicare Part D, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Veterans Administration, as well as private payers including pharmacy benefit managers, health plans, self-insured organizations, and other plan administrators. Other countries and jurisdictions will also have their own unique mechanisms for approval and reimbursement. 
The process for determining whether a payer will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payer will pay for the product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payers may also refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. Further, private payers often follow the coverage and payment policies established by certain government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, which require manufacturers to comply with certain rebate, price reporting, and other obligations. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, which is part of the Medicaid program (a program for financially needy patients, among others), requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services under which the manufacturer agrees to report certain prices to the government and pay rebates to state Medicaid programs on outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients, as a condition for receiving federal reimbursement for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. Further, in order for a pharmaceutical product to receive federal reimbursement under Medicare Part B and Medicaid programs or to be sold directly to U.S. 
government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the Public Health Service’s 340B drug pricing program. 
Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers performing the prescribed services generally rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Patients are unlikely to use our approved products unless coverage is provided, and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any approved products will therefore depend substantially on the extent to which costs of the product will be paid by third-party payers. Additionally, the market for any approved products depends significantly on access to third-party payers’ formularies without prior authorization, step therapy, or other limitations such as approved lists of treatments for which third-party payers provide coverage and reimbursement. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for therapeutic products can differ significantly from payer to payer. One third-party payer’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payers will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. As a result, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately and will likely be a time-consuming process.
Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. Additionally, the containment of healthcare costs (including drug prices) has become a priority of federal and state governments. The U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement, and requirements for substitution by generic products, among other controls. Adoption of price controls or other cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could limit our net revenue and results. If these third-party payers do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products once approved as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of reimbursement may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our approved products or a decision by a third-party payer to not cover our products could reduce or eliminate utilization of our products and have an adverse effect on our sales, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, state and federal healthcare reform measures have been and will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our approved products or additional pricing pressures.
The degree of market acceptance of ORGOVYX will also depend on the acceptance and degree of adoption by institutional treatment pathways and institutional, local, and national clinical guidelines such as the National Comprehensive Cancer Networks® Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology, or the NCCN Guidelines, the American Urological Association (“AUA”) guidelines, American Society of Clinical Oncology (“ASCO”) Clinical Practice Guidelines, or other country-specific guidelines. This could also be the case for MYFEMBREE in terms of inclusion in practice guidelines such as those from the American College of Gynecology (“ACOG”), American Society for Reproductive Medicine (“ASRM”), American Association of Gynecologic Laparoscopists (“AAGL”), or other country-specific guidelines. In the U.S., healthcare providers may refer to these guidelines related to patient treatment decisions. To the extent that our current or any future approved products are not included or positioned favorably in such treatment guidelines and pathways, the full utilization potential of our products may not be reached, which may harm our ability to successfully commercialize our current or any future approved products. 
Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the United Kingdom
In December 2020, the U.K. and the EU agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement, under which the U.K. and the EU will now form two separate markets governed by two distinct regulatory and legal regimes. The trade and cooperation agreement covers the general objectives and framework of the relationship between the U.K. and the EU, including as it relates to trade, transport and visas. Under the trade and cooperation agreement, U.K. service suppliers no longer benefit from automatic access to the entire EU single market, U.K. goods no longer benefit from the free movement of goods and there is no longer the free movement of people between the U.K. and the EU. Depending on the application of the terms of the trade and cooperation agreement, we and others could face new regulatory costs and challenges.
Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the U.K. applicable to our business and certain of our product candidates are derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit has had, and may continue to have, a material impact upon the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our product candidates in the U.K. or the EU. For example, the U.K. is no longer covered by the centralized procedures for obtaining EU-wide marketing authorization from the EMA, and a separate marketing authorization will be required to market 
our product candidates in the U.K. Until January 2023, it is possible for the MHRA to rely on a decision taken by the EC on the approval of a new marketing authorization via the centralized procedure. However, it is unclear whether the MHRA in the U.K. is sufficiently prepared to handle the increased volume of marketing authorization applications that it is likely to receive after such time. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would prevent us and our collaboration partners from commercializing our product candidates in the U.K. or the EU and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability.
The U.K.’s vote to exit the EU could also result in similar referendums or votes in other European countries in which we and our collaboration partners conduct business. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it is unclear what financial, trade and legal implications the withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU will have and how such withdrawal may affect us.
Other Applicable Laws
We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the U.S., including laws relating to the oversight activities of the SEC and the regulations of the New York Stock Exchange, on which our common shares are traded.
We are also subject to various other federal, state, and local laws and regulations, including those related to safe working conditions, and the storage, transportation, or discharge of items that may be considered hazardous substances, hazardous waste, or environmental contaminants.
Our operations extend to countries around the world, and many of these jurisdictions have established privacy legal frameworks with which we, our customers, our collaboration partners, or our vendors must comply.
Environment, Social, Governance, and Human Capital
Governance and Leadership
Our commitment to integrating sustainability across our organization begins with our board of directors, which has oversight of strategy and risk management related to Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”).
Business Ethics
We are committed to creating an environment where we are able to excel in our business while maintaining the highest standards of business conduct and ethics. Our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics (“Code of Conduct”) reflects the business practices and principles of behavior that supports this commitment, including our policies on bribery, corruption, conflicts of interest, insider trading, and our whistleblower program. We expect all of our directors, officers, and employees to read, understand, and comply with the Code of Conduct and its application to the performance of his or her business responsibilities. 
Environmental Commitment
We are committed to protecting the environment and attempt to mitigate any negative impact of our operations, promoting reuse and recycling and conserving resources, where feasible. We have safety protocols in place for handling biohazardous waste in our operations, including in our clinical trials, and we use third-party vendors for biohazardous waste and chemical disposal. 
Social Responsibility
We believe a transformative effort is needed to make significant progress for greater access to medicines, continued scientific discovery and innovation, and removing barriers to access and quality of care for the patients we serve. We work to elevate the conversation around women’s health and bring much-needed attention to conditions such as uterine fibroids and endometriosis. In October 2019, we announced Female Forward Together, a cross-sector coalition committed to advancing research, education, and action for women’s health. This coalition brings together expertise in healthcare, digital health, and advocacy to elevate women’s health.
We believe that significant challenges remain for men with prostate cancer despite recent progress. Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. We believe prostate cancer also has the largest racial disparity of any major cancer, killing Black men twice as often as White men. Despite new medications and increased public awareness, there remains an inadequate focus on the full spectrum of the mental and physical health of men with prostate cancer. We are working across sectors to address the complex set of challenges that these men face, including persistent racial disparities. In June 2020, we announced Forward Momentum, a cross-sector coalition working on innovative projects to increase diversity in research and develop new digital resources for men with prostate cancer. This coalition brings together expertise in healthcare, research, and advocacy to address the stigma, education, and other barriers for men with prostate cancer. 
Our goal is to maximize access to our approved medicines. Our access within federally funded programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, and VA/TRICARE is comprehensive. We have also established various support programs for patients, including co-pay support for commercially-insured patients, free trial programs, and patient assistance for uninsured and under-insured patients.
Human Capital
As of March 31, 2022, we had 579 full-time employees, all of whom are expected to be guided by our vision and values and by an underlying set of ethical principles. We are committed to treating each of our employees fairly, and to maintaining employment practices based on equal opportunity for all employees. We respect each other’s privacy and treat each other with dignity and respect irrespective of age, race, color, sexual preferences, nationality, or physical condition. We are committed to providing safe and healthy working conditions and an atmosphere of open communication for all our employees.
We believe that our future success largely depends upon our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We emphasize a number of measures and objectives in managing our human capital assets, including employee engagement, development and training, talent acquisition and retention, employee wellness, diversity, inclusion, and compensation and pay equity. We provide our employees with competitive salaries, bonuses, opportunities for equity ownership, development opportunities that enable continued learning and growth and a robust employment package that promotes well-being across all aspects of their lives, including health care, retirement planning and paid time off. In addition, we collect employee feedback to ensure two-way communication, measure employee engagement and identify opportunities for improvement. 
We believe that developing a diverse and inclusive culture is critical to continuing to attract and retain the top talent necessary to deliver on our business strategy. As such, we are investing in a work environment where our employees feel inspired and included. We continue to focus on extending our diversity and inclusion initiatives across our entire workforce. In addition, we work to ensure our employees understand and embrace our commitment to our patient community and core values.
Response to COVID-19
Beginning in March 2020, we have supported our employees and government efforts to curb the COVID-19 pandemic through a multifaceted communication, infrastructure, and behavior modification and enforcement effort. These actions have included:
•establishing a COVID-19 task force, which provides clear and regular COVID-19 policies, safety protocols, and updates to all employees;
•decreasing density and increasing physical distancing in workplaces for employees working onsite by scheduling adjustments and adding work from home flexibility;
•adjusting attendance policies to encourage those who are sick to stay at home;
•increasing cleaning protocols in our offices;
•providing additional personal protective equipment and cleaning supplies;
•implementing protocols to address actual and suspected COVID-19 cases and potential exposure;
•prohibiting all domestic and international non-essential travel for all employees through mid-2021; and
•complying with all local and national public health advisories.
In December 2021, we adopted a policy to require proof of vaccination as a condition of employment for our U.S.-based employees, subject to medical and religious exemptions, or as otherwise required by law. In April 2022, we reopened our offices, and our employees began to return to work onsite on a voluntary basis with specific safety protocols.
