Item 1. Business.
Overview
 We are a rapidly growing technology company with an initial focus on offering comprehensive genetic testing to provide physicians with clinically actionable diagnostic information they can use to improve the overall quality of patient care. We have develop
ed a proprietary technology platform that integrates sophisticated data comparison and suppression algorithms, adaptive learning software, advanced genetic diagnostics tools and integrated laboratory processes. This platform allows us to offer a broad and flexible test menu and continually expand and improve our proprietary genetic reference library, while maintaining accessible pricing, high accuracy and competitive turnaround times.  Combining next generation sequencing with our technology platform, we can perform full-gene sequencing with deletion/duplication analysis in single-gene tests, pre-established, multi-gene, disease-specific panels and customized panels that can be tailored to meet specific customer needs. We believe our test menu offers more genes for testing than our competitors in today’s market, which enables us to provide expansive options for test customization and clinically actionable results. After launching our first commercial genetic tests focused on rare pediatric diseases in 2013, our tests covered more than 1,000 genes in 100 panels by the first quarter of 2014 and more than 10,000 genes in over 170 panels by the end of 2015. Today, we have further expanded our test menu to offer approximately 18,000 single-gene tests and more than 300 panels that collectively test for approximately 7,700 genetic conditions, including various cancers, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders and pediatric tests.
 Genetic testing has experienced significant growth in recent years. As this trend continues, we believe genetic testing will become a more accepted part of standard medical care and the knowledge of a person’s unique genetic makeup will begin to play a more important role in the practice of medicine. Genetic testing offers the possibility of early identification of a disease or a genetic predisposition to a disease. As a result, we believe widespread genetic testing could enable significant health improvements and healthcare cost reductions. Furthermore, we believe genetic testing and existing and future diagnostics tools will facilitate production of more comprehensive information that physicians can use to enhance disease prognosis and prediction, as well as for pharmacogenomic purposes. According to GrandView Research, the size of the global next generation sequencing, or NGS, genetic testing market, which includes pre-sequencing, sequencing and data analysis, is estimated to have been approximately $4.0 billion in 2016, including approximately $1.4 billion in the United States, and is expected to reach approximately $10.5 billion by 2022, including approximately $3.6 billion in the United States. 
 While adoption of genetic testing has increased in recent years, we believe widespread utilization has been limited because many tests are prohibitively expensive, are produced through inefficient processes and often do not result in clinically actionable data. Through our technology, we have developed genetic tests designed to address these limitations and provide a robust platform for future growth. The key features of our technology platform include: proprietary gene probes we develop and manufacture that are engineered to interact with our software; data comparison algorithms that allow for the efficient comparison of DNA sequences to publicly available databases and our proprietary reference library of genetic information; data suppression algorithms that reduce irrelevant noise in the genetic data we collect; adaptive learning software supporting our reporting systems; and integrated laboratory information management systems that allow us to efficiently manage workflow, monitor quality and ensure the fidelity of information generation and analytics for reporting. This technology platform allows us to deliver comprehensive, adaptable, clinically actionable and affordable genetic analysis while maintaining a low cost per billable test, enabling us to efficiently meet customer needs with the latest genes, panels and custom offerings. We believe our technology platform provides a sustainable competitive advantage in genetic testing today and as we implement new diagnostic tools in the future. 
 We believe we are well-positioned to succeed in today’s market because our technology platform has enabled us to develop a test menu that we believe produces more actionable results than available alternatives. A retrospective study conducted by the University of Southern California, or USC, Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center of 475 individuals with a personal or family history of cancer who had undergone a clinically indicated multi-gene panel test from one of six commercial laboratories found that multi-gene panel testing increases the yield of mutations detected and adds to the capability of providing individualized cancer risk assessment. Of the 17 Fulgent tests evaluated in the study, approximately 35% identified a genetic mutation compared to an average of approximately 17% of the other commercial laboratories’ tests included in the study. We believe our tests’ comprehensive data output and improved detection rate, both made possible by our expansive genetic coverage, provide physicians with information they can readily incorporate into treatment decisions for their patients, which we refer to as clinical actionability. In addition, our technology platform enables us to perform customized genetic tests using our expansive library of genes, and we believe this flexibility increases efficiency and the utility of the genetic data we produce. We have generated growing demand for our tests with relatively little marketing efforts to date, which we believe demonstrates the advantages of our offering compared to other available testing alternatives.

Our existing customer base consists primarily of hospitals and medical institutions, which are frequent and high-volume users of genetic tests. We believe our relationships with these customers provide an avenue for further growth as we seek to deepen these relationships and drive increased ordering. We believe the key to further penetrating our existing customer base and expanding into new customer markets is to continue to focus on delivering a superior test menu while maintaining affordable prices. In order to offer our customers affordable price points, we continue to enhance our technology platform to develop tests that we can perform at a low internal cost. 
 Our headquarters are located in Temple City, California, where we have our corporate offices and a laboratory where we receive tissue specimens and perform genetic tests. Our laboratory is certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988, or CLIA, accredited by the College of American Pathologists, or CAP, and licensed by the State of California Department of Public Health, or CA DPH. We offer tests at competitive prices, averaging approximately $1,461 per billable test delivered in 2016, and with competitive turnaround times. Our volume has grown rapidly since our commercial launch, with over 20,000 billable tests delivered to over 600 customers as of December 31, 2016. We delivered 12,507 billable tests in 2016, compared to 6,852 billable tests delivered in 2015 and 966 billable tests delivered in 2014, and we have experienced compound quarterly growth of 19% in the number of billable tests delivered from the first quarter of 2015 through the fourth quarter of 2016. Further, approximately 86% of our test billings that were generated and due in 2016 were paid during that period.
 We have assembled a highly-qualified team of 70 employees as of March 1, 2017. Our team includes personnel with expertise in a number of fields important to our business, such as bioinformatics, genetics, software engineering, laboratory management and sales and marketing. We have relied upon this team to improve and support our proprietary technology platform and differentiated business model, which we believe have driven our commercial success to date and provide us with significant opportunity for future growth. 
 Genetic Testing Industry
 Overview 
 Genetic testing identifies mutations in genes or chromosomal abnormalities to confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or to evaluate a person’s likelihood of developing a genetic condition. For example, a person displaying symptoms of one or more conditions could use genetic testing to determine or confirm a diagnosis, which can be especially useful for conditions that are difficult to diagnose. Further, a person with a family history of a particular condition, such as breast cancer, could use genetic testing to predict the likelihood of developing the condition. For instance, a mutation in the BRCA1 gene indicates an estimated 84% cumulative risk of developing breast cancer by age 70. The results of genetic testing can also be used to improve the selection and implementation of drug treatment programs targeting specific diseases. 
 The availability and accessibility of genetic testing has grown significantly in recent years, due in large part to improvements in testing technologies that have driven costs down. The National Institutes of Health gene testing registry includes over 480 genetic testing laboratories and, as of February 16, 2017, genetests.org estimates that over 4,900 disorders can be identified via genetic testing. Due to the continued expansion of testing availability and accessibility, a growing and aging population and the increasing overall incidence of disease, among other factors, the global market for genetic testing is expected to grow significantly. According to GrandView Research, the size of the global NGS genetic testing market, which includes pre-sequencing, sequencing and data analysis, is estimated to have been approximately $4.0 billion in 2016, including approximately $1.4 billion in the United States, and is expected to reach approximately $10.5 billion by 2022, including approximately $3.6 billion in the United States. 
 The process for conducting a genetic test begins with the extraction of genomic DNA from a tissue specimen collected and provided by an ordering physician. The extracted DNA is then sequenced using various equipment and other tools depending on the nature of the test. For instance, tests relying upon next generation sequencing technology use NGS sequencers and associated reagents to sequence DNA. Additionally, gene probes are an important tool used in the sequencing process. A gene probe is a single strand of DNA that has a base sequence complementary to the base sequence of a targeted gene. During the sequencing process, gene probes are introduced and will bind to the complementary base sequence, identifying the presence and location of the gene. After the DNA is sequenced using all appropriate equipment and tools, the fully sequenced genes are analyzed in a process known as curation, in which every DNA sequence is aligned with a known reference sequence and differences between the DNA sequence and the reference sequence are identified. These differences, which represent potential genomic alterations, are then compared to publicly available sources and proprietary genetic libraries to identify pathogenic alterations associated with disease or disease risk. The data produced by this sequencing and analysis is then synthesized into a report that is delivered to the ordering physician. 
 The genetic testing market is characterized by several testing methods based on different techniques, including microarray-based tests and NGS tests. Microarray-based tests are used to measure the expression levels of large numbers of genes simultaneously. Although microarray technologies are older than NGS technologies, the market for these tests continues to be significant, totaling approximately $960 million, or 15.4% of the overall market, in 2014, according to GrandView Research. NGS technology, a relatively new genetic testing technique, has dramatically improved genetic testing by enabling millions of DNA fragments to be sequenced in

parallel. As the cost of NGS testing continues to decline and the performance of NGS testing continues to improve, the availability and demand for genetic tests is expected to continue to accelerate. Furthermore, with the innovations in genomic medicine in recent years and the expected further advances in this area in the near term, pharmacogenomics, the practice of selecting and implementing drug treatment programs based on genetic information, is expected to continue to grow. 
 Industry Challenges 
 While adoption of genetic testing has increased in recent years, we believe widespread utilization has been limited in large part because of certain barriers to adoption that exist in today’s market, including the challenges described below. As a result of these challenges, we believe a significant market exists for a genetic testing option that provides broad genetic coverage and the flexibility to customize tests for individual patient needs, while maintaining accuracy and affordability. 
Prohibitive Cost of Some Genetic Tests
 The price of a genetic test can range from $300 to more than $9,000, depending on the nature and complexity of the test, and the overall price increases if more than one test is necessary or if multiple family members must be tested to obtain a meaningful result. While the price of genetic testing has decreased over time, prices remain significant enough that many payors and physicians limit the scope of genetic tests to only those conditions for which the test has direct clinical application, rather than performing a more thorough genetic evaluation of a patient’s health.
Limited Reimbursement Options
 In today’s market, third-party payors generally restrict the reimbursement of genetic testing to a limited subset of genetic tests and only for those patients that meet specific criteria. This lack of widespread favorable reimbursement policies has contributed to slower adoption of genetic testing by a broad market and has presented a challenge for genetic testing companies in building sustainable business models.
Limited Scope of Genetic Analysis
 It is estimated that there are 10,000 human diseases that are caused by single-gene mutations within the human genome, which consists of approximately 25,000 genes. Genetic testing laboratories that offer tests covering a limited set of genes may not be capable of diagnosing or identifying a predisposition to a disease that is caused by mutations in genes that are not included in the gene set that is analyzed.
Inefficient Process
 The genetic testing process can be inefficient due to sequential retesting that can involve multiple companies and continue for extended periods. UnitedHealth Group estimates that there are 1,000 to 1,300 available genetic tests; however, many of these tests are not sufficiently comprehensive in their gene coverage to identify genetic mutations. Additionally, many laboratories offer only a small subset of the available tests and a physician may be forced to submit specimens to multiple laboratories in order to obtain all of the desired genetic information for a patient. Moreover, many genetic tests are specific to a single disease, which has created a sequential retesting process—often called a diagnostic odyssey—in cases where initial tests return negative results or where patients require testing for more than one condition. These challenges are further exacerbated by long and unpredictable turnaround times associated with each test, which limit clinical applicability of genetic testing for patients in need of time-sensitive treatment.
 Cumbersome and Time-Consuming Interpretation of Results 
 The scientific curation of individual genetic disorders, genes and variants is relatively new and rapidly evolving. Although genetic tests are available to assist in the diagnosis or treatment planning of thousands of disorders, the implications of gene mutations are subject to substantial uncertainty due to a number of factors. Genetic curation has historically been done manually through the review of information from the broader scientific community to understand the implications of variants that have been identified in a genetic test. This process is often performed through a time-consuming search of biomedical literature that does not have standard nomenclature or expression, is subject to individual interpretation of data from genetic analyses and literature and often includes outdated, incomplete or otherwise flawed information. As a result, functional predictions based on simple categorization of gene variations can be limited and interpretation of genetic test results can be cumbersome and time-consuming, especially when the scope of the test is narrowed to a few selected genes.

Our Technology Platform 
 We have approached the competitive and operational challenges of our industry by building a multi-faceted technology platform. Through this technology-driven approach, we have developed a system of proprietary tools and processes that we believe will enable us to overcome many of the challenges facing our industry today. The key features of our technology platform include: 
Proprietary Gene Probes
 All genetic testing providers use gene probes in the sequencing process to extract and target specific genomic regions, and many companies obtain these probes from third-party suppliers. We have developed technologies to design and formulate proprietary gene probes that, when combined with our proprietary genetic reference library and publicly available genetic databases, support our ability to sequence DNA regions that we believe laboratories using commercial probes cannot and improve the detection rate of our test data. In turn, we believe this enables us to produce clinically actionable results physicians can use to improve care for their patients. Our proprietary gene probes are specifically engineered to generate genetic data that is optimized for our software, which enables us to rapidly incorporate new genes into our test menu, develop new panels of disease-specific tests and customize tests for our customers. Moreover, once we develop a probe for a new gene, we can efficiently reproduce, validate and assure the quality of that probe under CLIA and CAP guidelines, which allows us to continuously and rapidly expand our library of genetic content while increasing the breadth of our test menu. Additionally, we believe our probes more effectively enrich the targeted genes to improve the quality of the sequenced data we produce.
Advanced Database Algorithms
 We have developed proprietary data comparison and data suppression algorithms to improve and simplify the curation process by highlighting identified pathogenic mutations. Our advanced data comparison algorithms measure DNA sequences from patient specimens against genetic data available from the broader scientific community and our own proprietary reference library of genetic information, which enables us to rapidly and effectively detect pathogenic mutations. Our advanced data suppression algorithms reduce irrelevant noise in the genetic data we analyze to improve the efficiency and speed of our data analysis while reducing the need for manual curation.
Adaptive Learning Software
 We have developed software that automatically incorporates the data from each completed test into our expansive genetic reference library, enabling it to continuously evolve and support the improvement of our gene probes. This software leverages the capabilities of our gene probes to improve the speed and effectiveness of curation and reporting. Our adaptive learning software also communicates with our integrated laboratory systems, which leads to increasing efficiency and effectiveness.
Proprietary Laboratory Information Management Systems
 We have developed proprietary laboratory information management systems that are highly integrated with our laboratory processes and adaptive learning software. These systems provide the backbone by which we efficiently manage workflow, monitor quality and ensure the fidelity of information generation and analytics for reporting to our customers. The result is a highly connected platform that allows us to process tests and information in an efficient manner. Our talented team of software engineers continuously iterates with our laboratory and customer-facing personnel to improve the efficiencies of these systems.
Our Solution 
 The benefits provided by our technology platform include the following: 
 Low Cost per Billable Test
 We have developed various proprietary technologies that improve our laboratory efficiency and reduce the costs we incur to perform our tests. Our technology platform enables us to perform each test and deliver its results at a lower internal cost than many of our competitors, averaging approximately $537 per billable test delivered in 2016. This low cost per billable test allows us to maintain affordable pricing for our customers, averaging approximately $1,461 per billable test delivered in 2016, which we believe encourages repeat ordering from existing customers and attracts new customers. We believe our low cost per billable test will also facilitate the process for establishing coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors at a level adequate for us to achieve profitability with this payor group.

Broad and Flexible Test Menu
 We offer single-gene tests on approximately 18,000 genes, which, to our knowledge, is thousands more than any of our competitors’ portfolios. We believe the breadth of genes in our portfolio allows us to provide more comprehensive genetic information and improves our variant detection rate, which can increase the clinical actionability of the data we produce. The breadth of genes in our portfolio also allows us to provide a flexible and customizable test menu for our customers that can reduce sequential retesting. We offer single-gene tests on all of the genes in our portfolio, as well as deletion/duplication analysis and site-specific tests. If customers desire a broader test, we offer more than 300 pre-established, multi-gene panels that focus on various genetic conditions. These panels can be adjusted up or down to include more or fewer genes, or customers can design their own panels to their exact specifications. We also offer clinical and full gene exome testing options. We offer our tests at different price points and turnaround times depending on the size and complexity of the test, which increases optionality for our customers. We believe the flexibility of our offering improves the efficiency and utility of the data output by our tests and decreases overall customer costs. We also offer our customers access to our highly qualified genetic counselors and laboratory experts to assist in interpreting the data we provide, which further increases the utility of our test results for ordering physicians.
 The benefit of including multiple genes on a single panel was recently discussed in a study published in 2016 by the USC Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center in Cancer Genetics. The study retrospectively evaluated 475 individuals with a personal or family history of cancer who had undergone a clinically indicated multi-gene panel test of six to 110 genes from one of the following six commercial laboratories: Myriad Genetics (n=354), Ambry Genetics (n=100), Fulgent (n=17), University of Washington Genetics Laboratory (n=2), City of Hope Molecular Diagnostics (n=1) and Baylor Genetics Laboratory (n=1). The study concluded that multi-gene panel testing increases the yield of mutations detected and adds to the capability of providing individualized cancer risk assessment. More specifically, the study reported that deleterious mutations were identified in 15.6% of patients tested on a variety of multi-gene panels, which included 8.6% of patients who would not have a mutation detected if a targeted gene-by-gene-approach had been used. The study also presented evidence that, as the number of genes on a panel increased, a higher proportion of panels identified a mutation. The Fulgent panels evaluated in the study contained over 100 genes compared to less than 30 genes in the next largest panel. Additionally, approximately 35% of our panels identified a genetic mutation, and in comparison, the test with the next highest percentage of detected mutations identified mutations in approximately 17% of its tests.
Expansive and Growing Genetic Library
 Using our proprietary gene probes and testing processes, we are able to capture large amounts of genetic information on each test we perform—oftentimes more than is ordered for the test—without an incremental increase in our costs. Through this data collection process, we have developed a proprietary reference library of expansive genetic information. This reference library is automatically curated by our adaptive learning software and supplemented with manual curation by our team of highly trained professionals, which adds to and improves upon the information available in public genetic databases. This software allows us to leverage publicly available information from the broader scientific community with our internally developed reference library to develop what we believe is a more reliable catalog of genetic information and to accelerate, standardize and improve our reporting process.
Our Strategy 
 We aim to be a leading provider of genetic information and other diagnostic tools to physicians for disease prediction and prognosis, as well as for pharmacogenomic purposes. Our strategy for long-term growth is to focus on the following key drivers of our business: 
Grow Our Customer Base
 Our existing customer base consists primarily of hospitals and medical institutions, which are frequent and high-volume users of genetic tests. We believe we must expand our customer base laterally and vertically to achieve our desired growth.
 We are seeking to grow our customer base laterally by continuing to acquire new hospital and medical institution customers and expand into additional customer groups, such as individual physicians and other practitioners, as well as research institutions. To this end, we have made efforts to diversify our customer base beyond hospitals by establishing a vendor code with a national clinical laboratory that orders our tests to fulfill some of the genetic testing orders it receives from certain U.S. government agencies and contracting with a regional hospital network within the U.S. Army to provide genetic tests for members and their families. We have also pursued relationships with payors, including Medicare, some state Medicaid programs and third-party payors, in order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our tests to make them accessible to more individual physicians. To achieve further lateral customer growth, we plan to continue to increase our direct sales force and to invest in our sales and marketing efforts, including continued efforts to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for our tests.
 5

Our vertical customer growth strategy focuses on more deeply penetrating our relationships with existing customers to increase the volume of tests they order from us. We plan to achieve this vertical customer growth by continuing to broaden our test menu and by educating the medical community about the benefits of our genetic tests and genetic testing in general.
 Further Broaden Our Test Menu
 We intend to continue to expand our test menu to include more options and to cover more genes. For example, we recently launched our first Focus and Comprehensive panels, which are designed to offer customers an efficient ordering process for comprehensive and customizable tests at an attractive price. Our first Focus and Comprehensive panels are focused on oncology, and we intend to launch additional panels targeting other areas, including cardiology, pediatrics and prenatal, all of which represent large genetic testing markets in which we believe our comprehensive and flexible tests will be competitive. Further, we recently launched a new chromosomal test that is designed to use NGS technology to detect copy number variants with similar or improved results as compared to microarray-based genomic tests, which we anticipate will expand our potential customer market to include users of these tests. We believe offering a broad and flexible test menu will appeal to potential customers and increase our revenue potential.
Increase the Global Presence of Our Business
 Approximately $10.0 million, $4.5 million and $638,000 of our revenue came from non-U.S. customers in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and of this, approximately $3.8 million, $2.7 million and $194,000 in the respective periods came from customers located in Canada. We aim to increase this volume in the near term, from customers in Canada and other geographic markets, including Asia and Europe. To this end, we received revenues of $3.2 million from tests ordered by customers in China in 2016 and we are working with Xi Long USA, Inc., or Xi Long, a large stockholder of our company, to develop a strategic commercial relationship to pursue additional customers in China, which we expect to be finalized in the first half of 2017. Although the terms of this relationship have not been finalized, we anticipate that this relationship, if it proceeds, could expand our long-term opportunities to address the genetic testing market in Asia. We believe there is a large potential for growth of genetic testing in many international markets due to the presence of high unmet diagnostic and predictive testing needs, rapidly rising healthcare expenditures and patient awareness of NGS technologies. We plan to engage distributors or establish other types of arrangements, such as joint ventures or other partner relationships, in an effort to expand our presence and test volume in new geographic markets.
 Maintain Our Low-Cost Operations
Our low costs for each test we perform allow us to provide customers with clinically actionable genetic information at an accessible price. In order to maintain the low costs we incur to perform our tests and, in turn, the affordability of our tests for our customers, we plan to continue to improve our internal processes, increase their scalability and implement additional automation procedures to further increase efficiencies. As our business grows, we believe our investment in these processes and procedures will allow us to achieve further cost advantages in our specimen collection, genetic testing, report preparation and customer service functions.
 Develop Relationships with Payors by Focusing on Established Genetic Testing Markets
In order to effectively market our tests to non-hospital customers, we intend to pursue coverage and adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payors. To this end, we have contracted with a regional physician services organization and a national health insurance company to become an in-network provider and enrolled as a supplier with Medicare and 10 state Medicaid programs, which means that we have agreed with these payors to provide certain of our tests at negotiated rates. As part of our strategy for obtaining adequate reimbursement for our tests, we intend to increase our focus on established genetic testing markets, including primarily oncology, cardiology, pediatrics and prenatal. We believe this approach will enable us to develop relationships with third-party payors in connection with tests for which coverage and reimbursement are well-established, which we anticipate will allow us to demonstrate the benefits of our platform and improve the reimbursement profile for many of the other genetic conditions covered by our broad test offering. Further, we believe our low cost per billable test will enhance our ability to compete effectively in, and our flexibility in approaching, the third-party payor market.
Pursue Additional Opportunities in Pharmacogenomics and Drug Discovery
 We plan to pursue relationships with pharmaceutical companies to deepen our opportunities in pharmacogenomics and drug discovery. We expect that we will attract pharmaceutical partners with our comprehensive reference library of genetic information, which allows us to aggregate the role genetic variations play in diseases and drug responses. We believe pharmaceutical companies could use our reference library to enhance clinical trial design, identify novel gene targets, support precision medicine strategies and improve existing or develop new targeted drug therapies.
 6

In addition, we are building relationships with research institutions, which use genetic tests to find unknown genetic disease relationships, learn how genes work, advance current knowledge about genetic conditions and for other research purposes. Like hospitals, research institutions can be frequent and high-volume users of genetic tests, and we believe these users represent a potentially large customer market for our tests.
 Leverage Our Technology Platform into Other Diagnostic Modalities
We believe genetic testing and other existing and future diagnostic tools will facilitate production of more comprehensive information to physicians, enabling enhanced disease prognosis and prediction and pharmacogenomic advances. We have constructed our technology platform to be highly adaptive and scalable, which could allow us to apply it to other types of diagnostic tools in the future. We could use these tools to analyze other components of biology in addition to DNA, which may include RNA, proteins and metabolic systems. By utilizing a complement of diagnostic tools with our highly adaptive technology platform, we believe we will be able to develop new tests in the future that further enhance our offering. We may also seek to expand our business through opportunistic acquisitions, investments, collaborations or other strategic relationships in order to enhance our tests, enter new geographical or other markets or leverage our existing capabilities, among other things.
Our Genetic Tests 
 Our offering consists of the following types of full-gene sequencing and deletion/duplication analysis: 
 

Our customers have a high degree of choice when selecting a test from our menu. A customer may select a single-gene test of any of the approximately 18,000 genes in our portfolio. A customer may also select one of our more than 300 panels, which are designed to test for particular genes and mutations within these genes that relate to a wide range of conditions and diseases. For example, our Focus and Comprehensive oncology panels test 29 genes and 122 genes, respectively, that relate to various cancers. We also offer whole exome and clinical exome panel tests, which test all genes included in our portfolio and up to 4,810 genes located in the exome, respectively, and produce results that we combine with the individual’s unique clinical presentation and family history to enhance the clinical relevance of the results. Our whole exome and clinical exome tests also include the option for Trio testing, which involves sequencing the genes of a patient’s parents and is thought to enhance the utility of the test results. In addition, we offer whole genome testing, which determines and tests the complete DNA sequence of a genome at a single time. We also provide known mutation testing, which can be used to target familial specific or other desired mutations, as well as repeat expansion testing, which tests for a particular type of mutation known as “copy choice” DNA replication. Importantly, all of our pre-established panels are completely customizable, offering customers the ability to add up to 20 additional genes to, or remove any number of genes from, any of these panels when ordering, at no additional cost.
Our Customers 
 Since inception, we have sold our tests to over 600 total customers. We typically consider each single billing and paying unit to be an individual customer, even though the unit may represent multiple physicians and healthcare providers ordering tests. We have primarily sold our tests to hospitals, including children’s hospitals, and medical institutions. We have approached the genetic testing market with a focus on these customers in part because they are frequent and high-volume users of genetic tests. We believe this customer base provides a meaningful opportunity for further growth by vertically deepening these relationships to drive increased ordering. Additionally, collection of billings from these institutional customers is more attainable than other types of customers in today’s reimbursement environment. Approximately 86% of our test billings that were generated and due in 2016 were paid during that period. In addition, we believe hospitals and medical institutions are early adopters of NGS technology and could influence broader clinical acceptance of genetic testing as a predictive, diagnostic and pharmacogenomic tool due to their influential position in the medical community. As a result, we have pursued and attained as customers many hospitals and medical institutions that we 
 7

believe are recognized leaders in the medical field. In 2016, Dongyang People’s Hospital (“Customer A”) and Kaiser Permanente (“Customer B”) each contributed 15% of our total revenue, and Kaiser Permanente also contributed 19% and 11% of our total revenue in 2015 and 2014, respectively. The following is a representative list of some of our other top 50 hospital and medical institution and children’s hospital customers by number of billable tests delivered in 2016:
 
Hospitals and Medical Institutions | Children’s Hospitals 
Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center Harbor-UCLA Medical Center Kaiser Permanente Loma Linda University Medical Center LSU Health Sciences Center Shreveport Mayo Clinic McGill University Health Centre Royal University Hospital UC Davis Medical Center Vanderbilt University Medical Center | Alberta Children’s Hospital Arkansas Children’s Hospital Children’s Hospital (Boston) Children’s Hospital Colorado Children’s Hospital Oakland Children’s Hospital of Orange County Children’s Mercy Hospital Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Johns Hopkins All Children’s Hospital, Inc. Rady Children’s Hospital—San Diego

 We intend to continue to expand our reach laterally to include new customer groups, such as individual physicians and other practitioners, as well as research institutions, as we increase our focus on our sales and marketing activities, including our efforts to obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for our tests. To this end, we have made efforts to diversify our customer base beyond hospitals by establishing a vendor code with a national clinical laboratory that orders our tests to fulfill some of the genetic testing orders it receives from certain U.S. government agencies, contracting with a regional hospital network within the U.S. Army to provide genetic tests for members and their families. We have also pursued relationships with payors, including Medicare, some state Medicaid programs and third-party payors, in order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our tests to make them accessible to more individual physicians.  
 Additionally, much of our business to date has been from non-U.S. customers, with approximately 55%, 47% and 50% of our total revenue generated from sales to non-U.S. customers in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We intend to further grow our non-U.S. customer base and the volume of tests ordered from non-U.S. customers in the near-term, from customers in Canada and other geographic markets, including Asia and Europe. To this end, we started to receive revenues from tests ordered by customers in China in 2016 and we are working with Xi Long to develop a strategic commercial relationship in order to further pursue our opportunities in this market, although this relationship has not been, and may never be, finalized or successful. We intend to pursue international distributor relationships or establish other types of arrangements, such as joint ventures or other partner relationships, to cover new geographic markets and expand our international customer base. 
 Generally, our customers can be divided into three categories based on the party from which we receive payment for our tests: hospitals and medical institutions; patients and third-party payors. Hospitals and medical institutions are responsible for paying for the vast majority of the tests we have delivered since our inception. We bill these organizations for our tests and they are responsible for paying us directly and either billing their patients separately or obtaining reimbursement from third-party payors in connection with a patient’s diagnosis related group. A small percentage of our customers are patients, whose physicians order our tests and the patients elect to pay for the tests themselves with out-of-pocket payments. Third-party payors, which consist of private health insurers and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, have been responsible for paying for a small number of the tests we have delivered to date; however, as we seek to expand our customer base to include more individual practitioners, we expect this category of payors will be responsible for many of the tests we deliver to these customers. 
 Third-party payors require us to identify the test for which we are seeking reimbursement using a Current Procedural Terminology, or CPT, code set maintained by the American Medical Association, or AMA. Where we offer a multi-gene panel and there is no CPT code for the full panel but the panel includes a gene for which the AMA has an established CPT code, we identify the test provided under that CPT code when billing a third-party payor for that test. In cases where there is not a specific CPT code, our 
 8

test may be billed under a miscellaneous code for an unlisted molecular pathology procedure. Because this miscellaneous code does not describe a specific service, the insurance claim must be examined to determine what service was provided, whether the service was appropriate and medically necessary, and whether payment should be rendered, which may require a letter of medical necessity from the ordering physician. Given the changing CPT coding environment and our development of relationships with third-party payors, we expect that our practices regarding billing these payors will evolve in the future. 
 Sales and Marketing 
 We currently operate with a lean sales team consisting of sales and marketing experts who are highly trained and educated about the complexities of our tests. Because our sales and marketing personnel serve as a primary interface between our company and many of our customers, we believe the power of this team is directly correlated to its breadth and depth of understanding of our technologies, our offering and the advantages of each. As a result, we expect to invest time and capital in aggressively growing our sales force and delivering rigorous training to these personnel. Our sales and marketing team consisted of 16 individuals as of March 1, 2017 and we plan to continue to increase this number, with the goal of more than doubling the size of our sales and marketing team in the next 12 months. We have experienced our sales to date largely through organic growth of our customer base and in spite of our small marketing presence, which we believe demonstrates the value of our tests and the power of word-of-mouth communication among current and potential future customers as a marketing tool. 
 Our sales and marketing strategy is designed to expand our brand awareness, laterally grow our customer base and vertically penetrate our relationships with existing customers by educating the medical community, including existing and potential future customers, about the benefits and the full scale of our offering. Our marketing activities include targeted marketing initiatives, such as working with medical professional societies to promote awareness of the benefits of our tests and genetic testing in general, presenting at medical conferences and scientific meetings and pursuing publication in medical and scientific journals. In addition, we conduct email advertising campaigns to existing and potential future customers when we want to send a specific message about our company and our brand, including, for instance, when we launch new tests or new test options, such as our Focus and Comprehensive oncology panel tests launched in the first half of 2016, and when we add new genes to our test menu. 
 Our sales and marketing strategy is also focused on offering differentiated and highly available customer service resources, which we believe is an important factor in maintaining and deepening our customer relationships. Genetic tests are highly complex by nature and we recognize that our customers may want to discuss with us available testing options, specimen collection requirements, expected turnaround times, the cost of the test and the clinical reports we produce. As a result, we offer comprehensive customer service designed to enable efficient ordering and increase the accessibility of our clinical reports. We strive to answer phone calls directed to our customer service team with a person, not an auto-attendant, and to provide physicians with the answers they need on their first contact with us, including, as needed, access to our licensed and qualified laboratory directors who review and approve each report we produce. Additionally, all of the reports we produce are accessible by our customers online via an encrypted web portal, allowing our customers flexibility in viewing their reports and seamless access to our customer service resources. 
 Our Suppliers 
 We rely on a limited number of suppliers, and, in some cases, sole suppliers, for certain laboratory reagents, sequencers and other equipment and materials that we use in our laboratory operations. We rely on Illumina, Inc. as the sole supplier of our next generation sequencers and associated reagents and as the sole provider of maintenance and repair services for these sequencers. Our laboratory operations would be interrupted if we encounter delays or difficulties in securing these reagents, sequencers or other equipment or materials or if we need a substitute or replacement for any of our suppliers and are not able to locate and make arrangements with an acceptable substitute or replacement. 
Competition 
 Our competitors include dozens of companies focused on molecular genetic testing services, including specialty and reference laboratories that offer traditional single-gene and multi-gene tests. Principal competitors include companies such as Ambry Genetics, Inc.; Counsyl; Foundation Medicine, Inc.; GeneDx, a subsidiary of OPKO Health, Inc.; Invitae Corporation; Myriad Genetics, Inc.; and Pathway Genomics Corporation, as well as other commercial and academic laboratories. In addition, other established and emerging healthcare, information technology and service companies may develop and sell competitive tests, which may include informatics, analysis, integrated genetic tools and services for health and wellness. 
 Additionally, participants in closely related markets, such as prenatal testing and clinical trial or companion diagnostic testing, could converge on offerings that are competitive with the type of tests we perform. Instances where potential competitors are aligned with key suppliers or are themselves suppliers could provide such potential competitors with significant advantages. Further, hospitals, 
 9

research institutions and eventually individual physicians and other practitioners may also seek to perform at their own facilities the type of genetic testing we would otherwise perform for them. In this regard, continued development of, and associated decreases in the cost of, equipment, reagents and other materials and databases and genetic data interpretation services may enable broader direct participation in genetic testing and analysis and drive down the use of third-party testing companies such as ours. Moreover, the biotechnology and genetic testing fields continue to undergo significant consolidation, permitting larger clinical laboratory service providers to increase cost efficiencies and service levels, resulting in more intense competition.
 We believe the principal competitive factors in our market are: 
  
• | breadth and depth of genetic content;
--+--------------------------------------


• | flexibility of test customization;
--+-----------------------------------


• | quality of results, including their reliability, accuracy and clinical actionability;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | accessibility of results;
--+--------------------------


• | price of tests;
--+----------------


• | turnaround time;
--+-----------------


• | customer service;
--+------------------


• | coverage and reimbursement arrangements with third-party payors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | convenience of testing; and
--+----------------------------


• | brand recognition.
--+-------------------

 We believe we compare favorably with our competitors on the basis of these factors. However, many of our existing and potential future competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and market penetration, substantially greater financial, technological and research and development resources and selling and marketing capabilities and considerably more experience dealing with third-party payors. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer requirements or preferences, devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their tests, devote more resources to and obtain more favorable results from third-party payors regarding coverage and reimbursement for their offerings, adopt more aggressive pricing policies for their tests, secure supplies from vendors on more favorable terms or devote substantially more resources to infrastructure and systems development. In addition, competitors may be acquired by, receive investments from or enter into other commercial relationships with larger, well-established and well-financed companies as use of NGS for clinical diagnosis and preventative care increases. Further, companies or governments that effectively control access to genetic testing through umbrella contracts or regional preferences could promote our competitors or prevent us from performing certain tests in certain territories. We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations. 
 Research and Development 
 We have assembled a highly-qualified team with expertise in a number of fields important to our business, such as bioinformatics, genetics, software engineering, laboratory management and sales and marketing, and including 33 employees with a PhD or other advanced degree as of March 1, 2017. We rely upon this team to conduct all of our research and development activities, including efforts to develop and curate our expansive library of genetic information and further expand our technology platform. Our research and development expenses were $3.6 million, $4.4 million and $521,000 in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Intellectual Property 
 We rely on a combination of unregistered intellectual property rights, including trade secrets, common law trademarks and customary contractual protections, to protect our core technology and intellectual property. 
Trade Secrets 
 We rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain and develop the competitive position afforded by many of our laboratory, analytic and business practices. For example, significant elements of our genetic tests and our testing procedures, including aspects of specimen preparation, bioinformatics algorithms and related processes and software, are based on unpatented trade secrets and know-how. We try to protect trade secrets and know-how by taking reasonable steps to keep them confidential, including entering into nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties 
 10

who have access to them, such as our employees and certain third parties, and entering into invention assignment agreements with our employees and consultants that obligate them to assign to us any inventions developed in the course of their work for us. 
 Trademarks 
 We own registered trademark rights under applicable U.S. and foreign law to distinguish and/or protect our tests and our brand, including our company name. We also own a registered service mark in the United States for our company logo. 
 Regulation
CLIA 
 As a clinical laboratory, we are required to hold certain federal licenses, certifications and permits to conduct our business. In 1988, Congress passed CLIA, which establishes quality standards for all laboratory testing designed to ensure the accuracy, reliability and timeliness of patient test results. Our Temple City, California laboratory is CLIA-certified and accredited by CAP, a CLIA-approved accrediting organization. 
 Under CLIA, a laboratory is any facility that performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease or the impairment or assessment of health. CLIA requires that we hold a certificate applicable to the type of laboratory examinations we perform and that we comply with various standards with respect to personnel qualifications, facility administration, proficiency testing, quality control and assurance and inspections. Laboratories must register and list their tests with CMS, the agency that oversees CLIA, and CLIA compliance and certification is a prerequisite to be eligible to bill government payors and many private payors for our tests. CLIA is user-fee funded, such that all costs of administering the program must be covered by the regulated facilities, including certification and survey costs. 
 We are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with CLIA’s program standards, and we may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. Our CLIA certification was last renewed October 23, 2015. If our clinical reference laboratory is found to be out of compliance with CLIA requirements at any of these inspections, we may be subject to sanctions such as suspension, limitation or revocation of our CLIA certificate, a directed plan of correction, on-site monitoring, civil monetary penalties, civil injunctive suits, criminal penalties, exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs and significant adverse publicity. 
 In addition to CLIA requirements, we elect to participate in the accreditation program of CAP. CMS has deemed CAP standards to be equally or more stringent than CLIA regulations and has approved CAP as a recognized accrediting organization. Inspection by CAP is performed in lieu of inspection by CMS for CAP-accredited laboratories. Because we are accredited by the CAP Laboratory Accreditation Program, we are deemed to also comply with CLIA. 
State and Foreign Laboratory Licensure 
 Under CLIA, states may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law, and a number of states have implemented their own more stringent laboratory regulatory requirements. State laws may require that laboratory personnel meet certain qualifications, specify certain quality control procedures or facility requirements or prescribe record maintenance requirements. 
 We are required to maintain a license to conduct testing in the State of California. California laws establish standards for day-to-day operations of our laboratory in Temple City, including with respect to the training and skills required of personnel, quality control and proficiency testing requirements. If our clinical reference laboratory is out of compliance with California standards, the CA DPH may suspend, restrict or revoke our license to operate our clinical reference laboratory, assess substantial civil money penalties or impose specific corrective action plans. Any such actions could materially affect our business. We maintain a current license in good standing with CA DPH. 
 Additionally, several states require the licensure of out-of-state laboratories that accept specimens from those states and/or receive specimens from laboratories in those states. Our laboratory holds the required out-of-state laboratory licenses to perform testing on specimens from Florida, Maryland and Pennsylvania. In addition to having a laboratory license in New York, our laboratory is required to obtain approval on a test-specific basis by the New York State Department of Health before specific testing is performed on specimens from New York. Because our licensure application is currently pending in New York, we are currently prohibited from performing tests on specimens from New York until our license is approved.
11

Other states may adopt similar licensure requirements in the future, which could require us to modify, delay or discontinue our operations in such jurisdictions. If we identify any other state with such requirements or if we are contacted by any other state advising us of such requirements, we intend to follow instructions from the state regulators as to how to comply with such requirements. 
 We are also subject to regulation in foreign jurisdictions, which we expect will increase as we seek to expand international utilization of our tests or if jurisdictions in which we pursue operations adopt new or modified licensure requirements. Foreign licensure requirements could require review and modification of our tests in order to offer them in certain jurisdictions or could impose other limitations, such as restrictions on the transport of human blood or other tissue necessary for us to perform our tests that may limit our ability to make our tests available outside of the United States on a broad scale. 
 FDA 
 Pursuant to its authority under the federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDC Act, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, has jurisdiction over medical devices, which are defined to include, among other things, in vitro diagnostic products, or IVDs, used for clinical purposes. The tests that we offer are IVDs. The laws and regulations governing the marketing of IVDs are evolving, extremely complex, and in many instances there are no significant regulatory or judicial interpretations of these laws and regulations. The FDA regulates, among other things, the research, testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, premarket clearance or approval, marketing and promotion and sales and distribution of medical devices in the United States to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses. In addition, the FDA regulates the import and export of medical devices. 
 The FDC Act classifies medical devices into one of three categories based on the risks associated with the device and the level of control necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness. Devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices or devices deemed not substantially equivalent to a previously 510(k) cleared device, are categorized as Class III. These devices typically require submission and approval of a premarket approval application, or PMA. Devices deemed to pose lower risk are categorized as either Class I or II, which requires the manufacturer to submit to the FDA a 510(k) premarket notification submission requesting clearance of the device for commercial distribution in the United States. Some low-risk devices are exempted from this requirement. When a 510(k) premarket notification submission is required, the manufacturer must submit to the FDA a premarket notification submission demonstrating that the device is “substantially equivalent” to: (i) a device that was legally marketed prior to May 28, 1976, for which PMA approval is not required, (ii) a legally marketed device that has been reclassified from Class III to Class II or Class I, or (iii) another legally marketed, similar device that has been cleared through the 510(k) clearance process. 
 After the FDA permits a device to enter commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include: the Quality System Regulation, which requires manufacturers to follow elaborate design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process; labeling regulations; the FDA’s general prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or “off-label” uses; and the Medical Device Reporting regulation, which requires that manufacturers report to the FDA if their device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if it were to recur. The FDA has broad post-market and regulatory and enforcement powers. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. medical device regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees, civil penalties, repairs, replacements, refunds, recalls or seizures of products, total or partial suspension of production, the FDA’s refusal to grant future premarket clearances or approvals, withdrawals or suspensions of current product applications, and criminal prosecution. 
 Although the FDA has statutory authority to assure that medical devices, including IVDs, are safe and effective for their intended uses, the FDA has historically exercised its enforcement discretion and not enforced applicable provisions of the FDC Act and regulations with respect to laboratory developed tests, or LDTs, which are a subset of IVDs that are intended for clinical use and designed, manufactured and used within a single laboratory. We believe our tests fall within the definition of an LDT. As a result, we believe our diagnostic tests are not currently subject to the FDA’s enforcement of its medical device regulations and the applicable FDC Act provisions. 
 Even though we commercialize our tests as LDTs, our tests may in the future become subject to more onerous regulation by the FDA. Pursuant to the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, the FDA notified Congress on July 31, 2014 that the FDA intended to issue in 60 days the Framework Guidance and the Notification Guidance. On October 3, 2014, the FDA issued the anticipated Framework Guidance and Notification Guidance. The Framework Guidance states that the FDA intends to modify its policy of enforcement discretion with respect to LDTs in a risk-based manner consistent with the existing classification of medical devices. Thus, the FDA plans to begin to enforce its medical device requirements, including premarket submission requirements, for LDTs that have historically been marketed without FDA premarket review and oversight. The FDA states its intention in the Framework Guidance to require registration or listing and adverse event reporting six months after the Framework Guidance is finalized and to publish general LDT classification guidance within 24 months of the date on which the Framework 
 12

Guidance is finalized. According to the Framework Guidance, the FDA intends to enforce premarket review requirements in a risk-based, phased-in manner, starting with the highest risk LDTs beginning 12 months after the Framework Guidance is finalized, followed by other high risk LDTs in the next four years, and then moderate risk LDTs in the four years after that. Generally, for each category of LDTs, the FDA intends to continue exercising enforcement discretion pending the FDA’s review and consideration of the premarket submissions for devices that are already in use at the time—so long as premarket submissions are timely made. However, for certain categories of the highest risk LDTs (specifically, (i) LDTs with the same intended use as a cleared or approved companion diagnostic; (ii) LDTs with the same intended use as an FDA-approved Class III medical device; and (iii) certain LDTs for determining the safety or efficacy of blood or blood products), the FDA intends to begin enforcing premarket review requirements immediately upon publication of the finalized Framework Guidance for all new LDTs in those categories.
If and when the Framework Guidance and Notification Guidance are finalized, or if the FDA disagrees with our assessment that our tests fall within the definition of an LDT, we could for the first time be subject to enforcement of regulatory requirements such as registration and listing requirements, medical device reporting requirements and quality control requirements. Any new FDA enforcement policies affecting LDTs may result in increased regulatory burdens on our ability to continue marketing our tests and to develop and introduce new tests in the future. Additionally, if and when the FDA begins to actively enforce its premarket submission regulations with respect to LDTs generally or our tests in particular, we may be required to obtain premarket clearance for our tests under Section 510(k) of the FDC Act or approval of a PMA. The process for submitting a 510(k) premarket notification and receiving FDA clearance usually takes from three to 12 months, but it can take significantly longer and clearance is never guaranteed. The process for submitting and obtaining FDA approval of a PMA generally takes from one to three years or even longer and approval is not guaranteed. PMA approval typically requires extensive clinical data and can be significantly longer, more expensive and more uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process. If premarket review is required for some or all of our tests, the FDA could require that we stop selling our products pending clearance or approval and conduct clinical testing prior to making submissions to FDA to obtain premarket clearance or approval. The FDA could also require that we label our tests as investigational or limit the labeling claims we are permitted to make. 
 While there is also the risk that the FDA does not consider our tests to be LDTs, the Framework Guidance states that, in the interest of ensuring continuity in the testing market and avoiding disruption of access to tests marketed as LDTs that do not meet the FDA’s definition of LDTs, the FDA intends to apply the same risk-based framework described in the Framework Guidance to any IVD that is offered as an LDT by a CLIA-certified laboratory. 
 Additionally, the FDA has recently solicited public input and published two draft guidance documents relating to FDA oversight of NGS-based tests. The two draft guidance documents on NGS-based tests describe the FDA’s current thinking and proposed approach regarding the possible use of FDA-recognized standards to support analytical validity, and public human genetic variant databases to support clinical validity, of these tests. While it appears that the FDA is striving to provide a flexible pathway to device clearance or approval for manufacturers seeking to market NGS-based tests, it is unknown how the FDA may regulate such tests in the future and what testing and data may be required to support such clearance or approval. If premarket review is required for some or all of our tests and the FDA requires more extensive testing such as clinical trials, for example, we could experience significantly increased development costs and delay. 
 The FDA enforces its medical device requirements by various means, including inspection and market surveillance. If the FDA finds a violation, it can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions, ranging from an Untitled Letter or Warning Letter to more severe sanctions, such as: fines, injunctions and civil penalties; recall or seizure of products; operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production; and criminal prosecution.
Legislative proposals addressing the FDA’s oversight of LDTs have been introduced by Congress in the past and we expect that new legislative proposals may be introduced from time to time in the future. The likelihood that Congress will pass such legislation and the extent to which such legislation may affect the FDA’s plans to enforce its medical device requirements with respect to certain LDTs is difficult to predict at this time. If the FDA ultimately lifts its policy of enforcement discretion over LDTs and begins to enforce its medical device requirements with respect to LDTs, our tests may be subject to additional regulatory requirements imposed by the FDA, the nature and extent of which would depend upon applicable final guidance or regulation by the FDA or instruction by Congress. Failure to comply with any applicable FDA requirements could trigger a range of enforcement actions by the FDA, including warning letters, civil monetary penalties, injunctions, criminal prosecution, recall or seizure, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of operations and denial of or challenges to applications for clearance or approval, as well as significant adverse publicity.

Reimbursement 
 CPT Codes 
 Third-party payors, including private insurers and CMS, require genetic testing companies to identify each test for which reimbursement is sought using a CPT code set maintained by the AMA. These CPT codes in their current form are not readily applied to many of the genetic tests we conduct. For example, for many of our multi-gene panels, there may not be an appropriate CPT code for any genes in a panel, in which case our test would be billed under a miscellaneous code for an unlisted molecular pathology procedure. Because these miscellaneous codes do not describe a specific service, the insurance claim would need to be examined to determine the service that was provided, whether the service was appropriate and medically necessary and whether payment should be rendered. This process can require a letter of medical necessity from the ordering physician and it can result in a delay in processing the claim, a lower reimbursement amount or denial of the claim. 
 In September 2014, the AMA published new CPT codes for genomic sequencing procedures that are effective for dates of service on or after January 1, 2015. These include genomic sequencing procedure codes for certain multi-gene panel tests. In a final determination under the Medicare Clinical Laboratory Fee Schedule, or CLFS, published in November 2014, CMS set the 2015 payment rate for these codes using the gap-fill process. Under the gap-fill process, local Medicare Administrative Contractors, or MACs, establish rates for the codes that each MAC believes meet the criteria for Medicare coverage and considering laboratory charges and discounts to charges, resources, amounts paid by other payors for the tests and amounts paid by the MAC for similar tests. In 2015, gap-filled payment rates were established for some, but not all, of the published codes for genomic sequencing procedures. For the codes for which local gap-filled rates were established in 2015, a national limitation amount for Medicare was established for 2016. For the codes for which local gap-filled rates were not established in 2015, associated procedures are priced by the local MACs in 2016 if an individual MAC determines that such codes should be covered. Where available, the national limitation amount serves as a cap on the Medicare and Medicaid payment rates for a test procedure, which may not be adequate for all of the procedures covered by the applicable codes, including our tests to the extent we are required to report them under these codes. 
 PAMA 
 In April 2014, Congress passed the Protecting Access to Medicare Act of 2014, or PAMA, which included substantial changes to the way in which clinical laboratory services will be paid under Medicare. Under PAMA, laboratories that receive the majority of their Medicare revenue from payments made under the CLFS or the Physician Fee Schedule are required to report to CMS, beginning in 2017 and every three years thereafter (or annually for “advanced diagnostic laboratory tests”), private payor payment rates and volumes for their tests. Laboratories that fail to report the required payment information may be subject to substantial civil monetary penalties. We do not believe that our tests meet the current definition of advanced diagnostic laboratory tests, and therefore we believe we will be required to report private payor rates for our tests every three years. As required under PAMA, CMS will use the rates and volumes reported by laboratories to develop Medicare payment rates for laboratory tests equal to the volume-weighted median of the private payor payment rates for the tests. On June 23, 2016, CMS published the final rule implementing the reporting and rate-setting requirements under PAMA. 
 As set forth under PAMA, for tests furnished on or after January 1, 2018, Medicare payments for clinical diagnostic laboratory tests will be paid based upon these reported private payor rates. For clinical diagnostic laboratory tests that are assigned a new or substantially revised CPT code, initial payment rates will be assigned by the gap-fill methodology, as under prior law. Initial payment rates for new advanced diagnostic laboratory tests will be based on the actual list charge for the laboratory test. 
 The payment rates calculated under PAMA are set to be effective starting January 1, 2018. Any reductions to payment rates resulting from the new methodology are limited to 10% per test per year in each of the years 2018 through 2020 and to 15% per test per year in each of the years 2021 through 2023. 
 PAMA codifies Medicare coverage rules for laboratory tests by requiring any local coverage determination to be made following the local coverage determination process. PAMA also authorizes CMS to consolidate coverage policies for clinical laboratory tests among one to four laboratory-specific MACs. These same contractors may also be designated to process claims if CMS determines that such a model is appropriate. It is unclear whether CMS will proceed with contractor consolidation under this authorization. 
 PAMA also authorizes the adoption of new, temporary billing codes and/or unique test identifiers for FDA-cleared or approved tests as well as advanced diagnostic laboratory tests. The AMA’s CPT Editorial Panel has approved a proposal to create a new section of billing codes to facilitate implementation of this section of PAMA. At this time, it is unclear whether or when the new section of billing codes will be implemented, nor is it clear if or how these codes would apply to our tests.

Privacy and Security Laws 
 HIPAA and HITECH 
 Under the administrative simplification provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the federal Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, has issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and requirements for protecting the privacy and security of protected health information, or PHI, used or disclosed by most healthcare providers and other covered entities and their respective business associates, including subcontractors of business associates. The following four principal regulations with which we are required to comply have been issued in final form under HIPAA and HITECH: privacy regulations, security regulations, the breach notification rule and standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions. 
 The privacy regulations of HIPAA and HITECH cover the use and disclosure of PHI by covered entities and business associates, which include subcontractors that create, receive, maintain or transmit PHI on behalf of a business associate. A subcontractor means any person to whom a business associate delegates a function, activity or service, other than in the capacity of the business associate’s workforce. As a general rule, a covered entity or business associate may not use or disclose PHI except as permitted under the privacy regulations of HIPAA and HITECH. The privacy regulations also set forth certain rights of an individual with respect to his or her PHI maintained by a covered entity or business associate, including the right to access or amend certain records containing his or her PHI or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of his or her PHI. 
 Covered entities and business associates must also comply with the security regulations of HIPAA and HITECH, which establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic PHI. In addition, HITECH established, among other things, certain breach notification requirements with which covered entities and business associates must comply. In particular, a covered entity must notify any individual whose unsecured PHI is breached according to the specifications set forth in the breach notification rule. A covered entity must also notify the Secretary of HHS and, under certain circumstances, the media. 
 There are significant civil and criminal fines and other penalties that may be imposed for violating HIPAA. A covered entity or business associate is also liable for civil monetary penalties for a violation that is based on an act or omission of any of its agents, including a downstream business associate, as determined according to the federal common law of agency. Penalties for failure to comply with a requirement of HIPAA and HITECH vary significantly depending on the failure and include civil monetary penalties of up to $1.5 million per violation of the same requirement per calendar year. A single breach incident can result in violations of multiple requirements, resulting in potential penalties in excess of $1.5 million. Additionally, a person who knowingly obtains or discloses individually identifiable health information in violation of HIPAA may face a criminal penalty of up to $50,000 and up to one year of imprisonment. These criminal penalties increase if the wrongful conduct involves false pretenses or the intent to sell, transfer or use identifiable health information for commercial advantage, personal gain or malicious harm. Further, to the extent that we submit electronic healthcare claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under HIPAA and HITECH, payments to us may be delayed or denied. 
 The HIPAA privacy, security, and breach notification regulations establish a uniform federal “floor,” but do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing PHI or insofar as such state laws apply to personal information that is broader in scope than PHI as defined under HIPAA. Massachusetts, for example, has a state law that protects the privacy and security of personal information of Massachusetts residents.
Numerous other federal, state and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of patient health information. In addition, Congress and some states are considering new laws and regulations that further protect the privacy and security of medical records or medical information. With the recent increase in publicity regarding data breaches resulting in improper dissemination of consumer information, many states have passed laws regulating the actions that a business must take if it experiences a data breach, such as prompt disclosure to affected customers. Generally, these laws are limited to electronic data and make some exemptions for smaller breaches. Congress has also been considering similar federal legislation relating to data breaches. The Federal Trade Commission and states’ Attorneys General have also brought enforcement actions and prosecuted some data breach cases as unfair and/or deceptive acts or practices under the Federal Trade Commission Act. In addition to data breach notification laws, some states have enacted statutes and rules requiring businesses to reasonably protect certain types of personal information they hold or to otherwise comply with certain specified data security requirements for personal information. We intend to continue to comprehensively protect all personal information and to comply with all applicable laws regarding the protection of such information. 
 15

Foreign Laws 
 We are also subject to foreign privacy laws in the jurisdictions in which we sell our tests. The interpretation, application and interplay of consumer and health-related data protection laws in the United States, Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain, contradictory and in flux. For example, a new General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and Cybersecurity Directive have been enacted in the European Union and will come into full effect in May 2018. These texts will introduce many changes to privacy and security in the European Union, including stricter rules on consent and security duties for critical industries, including for the health sector. The interpretation of some rules is still unclear, and some requirements may be completed by national legislation. This makes it difficult to assess the impact of these new data protection laws on our business at this time. More generally, foreign laws and interpretations governing data privacy and security are constantly evolving and it is possible that laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our current practices, in which case we could be subject to government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices. These fines can be very high. For instance, the GDPR introduces fines of up to approximately $22 million or 4% of a group’s worldwide annual turnover for certain infringements. In addition, privacy regulations differ widely from country to country. 
Fraud and Abuse Laws 
 In the United States, we must comply with various fraud and abuse laws and we are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including CMS, other divisions of HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice and state and local governments. We also may be subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws. 
 Anti-Kickback and Fraud Statutes 
 In the United States, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, in order to induce or in return for the referral of an individual for the furnishing of or arranging for the furnishing of, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for or recommending purchasing, leasing or ordering of any good, facility, service or item for which payment may be made in whole or in part by a federal healthcare program. Courts have stated that a financial arrangement may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute if any one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, consulting fees, waivers of co-payments, ownership interests and providing anything at less than its fair market value. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, although it does contain several exceptions. HHS has issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors,” which set forth certain provisions that, if met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with the statutory exceptions or regulatory safe harbors ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. Furthermore, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. Penalties for violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute are severe and include imprisonment, criminal fines, civil monetary penalties and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. In addition, a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute can serve as a basis of liability under the federal False Claims Act (described below). Many states also have anti-kickback statutes, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers. 
 There are also U.S. federal laws related to healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government payor programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. A violation of this statute is also a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government payor programs. 
 False Claims Act 
 Another development affecting the healthcare industry is the increased enforcement of the federal False Claims Act and, in particular, actions brought pursuant to the False Claims Act’s “whistleblower” or “qui tam” provisions. The False Claims Act imposes liability on any person or entity that, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, a false or fraudulent claim for payment by a federal government payor program. The qui tam provisions of the False Claims Act allow a private individual to bring 
 16

actions on behalf of the federal government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government by submitting a false claim to the federal government and permit such individuals to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. In addition, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which we collectively refer to as the Affordable Care Act, establishes a requirement for providers and suppliers to report and return any overpayments received from government payors under the Medicare and Medicaid programs within 60 days of identification. Failure to identify and return such overpayments exposes the provider or supplier to False Claims Act liability. When an entity is determined to have violated the False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim. 
 In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payor and not merely a government payor program. 
 Civil Monetary Penalties Law 
 The federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law imposes penalties against any person or entity that, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or for a claim that is false or fraudulent. This law also prohibits the offering or transfer of remuneration to a Medicare or state healthcare program beneficiary if the person knows or should know it is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular provider, practitioner, or supplier of items or services reimbursable by Medicare or a state healthcare program, unless an exception applies. 
Physician Referral Prohibitions 
 The U.S. federal law directed at “self-referrals,” commonly known as the “Stark Law,” prohibits a physician from making referrals for certain designated health services, including laboratory services, that are covered by the Medicare program, to an entity with which the physician or an immediate family member has a direct or indirect financial relationship, unless an exception applies. The prohibition also extends to payment for any services referred in violation of the Stark Law. A physician or entity that engages in a scheme to circumvent the Stark Law’s referral prohibition may be fined up to $100,000 for each such arrangement or scheme. In addition, any person who presents or causes to be presented a claim to the Medicare program in violation of the Stark Law is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to $15,000 per service, an assessment of up to three times the amount claimed and possible exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, meaning that a physician’s financial relationship with a laboratory must meet an exception under the Stark Law or the referrals are prohibited. Thus, unlike the Anti-Kickback Statute’s safe harbors, if a laboratory’s financial relationship with a referring physician does not meet the requirements of a Stark Law exception, then the physician is prohibited from making Medicare and Medicaid referrals to the laboratory and any such referrals will result in overpayments to the laboratory and subject the laboratory to the Stark Law’s penalties. 
 Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare referrals. The Stark Law also prohibits state receipt of federal Medicaid matching funds for services furnished pursuant to a prohibited referral, but this provision of the Stark Law has not been implemented by regulations. In addition, some courts have held that the submission of claims to Medicaid that would be prohibited as self-referrals under the Stark Law for Medicare could implicate the False Claims Act. 
 Physician Sunshine Laws 
 The Affordable Care Act, among other things, imposed new reporting requirements on manufacturers of certain devices, drugs and biologics for certain payments and transfers of value by them and in some cases their distributors to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Because we manufacture our own LDTs solely for use by or within our own laboratory, we believe we are exempt from these reporting requirements. We may become subject to such reporting requirements, however, if the FDA requires us to obtain premarket clearance or approval for our tests. 
 Anti-Bribery Laws 
 FCPA 
 We are subject to U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making payments in violation of law to non-U.S. government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or securing any other improper advantage. The sale of our tests internationally demands a high degree of vigilance in maintaining, implementing and enforcing a policy against participation in corrupt activity. Other U.S. companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical fields have faced substantial monetary fines and criminal penalties under the FCPA for allowing their agents to deviate from appropriate practices in doing business with non-U.S. government officials. 
 17

Foreign Laws 
 We are also subject to similar anti-bribery laws in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offence. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act of 2010, which became effective in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public or private nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act of 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act of 2010 faces imprisonment of up to 10 years and could be subject to an unlimited fine, as could commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery. 
Healthcare Policy Laws 
 In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was enacted in the United States. The Affordable Care Act made a number of substantial changes to the way healthcare is financed both by governmental and private insurers. For example, the Affordable Care Act requires each medical device manufacturer to pay a sales tax equal to 2.3% of the price for which such manufacturer sells its medical devices. The medical device tax has been suspended for 2016 and 2017, but is scheduled to return beginning in 2018. It is unclear at this time when, or if, the provision of our LDTs will trigger the medical device tax if the FDA ends its policy of general enforcement discretion and regulates certain LDTs as medical devices, and it is possible that this tax will apply to some or all of our existing tests or tests we may develop in the future. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act establishes an Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, to propose reductions to payments in order to reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending if expenditures exceed certain targets. The expenditure targets for IPAB proposals have not been exceeded at this time, and it is unclear when such targets may be exceeded in the future, when any IPAB-proposed reductions to payments could take effect and how any such reductions would affect reimbursement payments for our tests. The Affordable Care Act also contains a number of other provisions, including provisions governing enrollment in federal and state healthcare programs, reimbursement matters and fraud and abuse, which we expect will impact our industry and our operations in ways that we cannot currently predict. Following the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election and in light of the policies of the current administration, which has threatened to repeal the Affordable Care Act, there is uncertainty regarding the continued effect or the Affordable Care Act in its current form. 
Corporate Practice of Medicine 
 Numerous states have enacted laws prohibiting business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. These laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. For example, California’s Medical Board has indicated that determining the appropriate diagnostic tests for a particular condition and taking responsibility for the ultimate overall care of a patient, including providing treatment options available to the patient, would constitute the unlicensed practice of medicine if performed by an unlicensed person. Violation of these corporate practice of medicine laws may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against the business corporation and/or the professional through licensure proceedings. Typically such laws are only applicable to entities with a physical presence in the applicable state. 
Environmental and Other Regulatory Requirements 
 Our laboratory is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the use, storage, handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemicals, biological agents and compounds, blood and other tissue specimens. Typically, we use outside vendors to dispose of such waste that are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of the waste. However, many of these laws and regulations provide for strict liability, holding a party potentially liable without regard to fault or negligence. As a result, we could be held liable for damages and fines if our, or others’, business operations result in contamination of the environment or individual exposure to hazardous substances. Our costs for complying with these laws and regulations cannot be predicted at this time and will depend upon, among other things, the amount and nature of waste we produce (which will depend in part on the number of tests we perform) and the terms we negotiate with our waste disposal vendors. 
 Our operations are also subject to extensive requirements established by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration relating to workplace safety for healthcare employees, including requirements to develop and implement programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries. 
 Reporting Segment and Geographical Information 
 We operate in one reportable business segment. See Note 7, Reporting Segment and Geographic Information, to our consolidated financial statements for information about revenue attributable to customers and long-lived assets located in the United 
 18

States and other regions. We are subject to risks attendant to our foreign operations, which are discussed in this report under “Item 1A. Risk Factors.” 
 Employees 
 We believe growing and retaining a strong team is crucial to our success. As of March 1, 2017, we had 70 employees engaged in bioinformatics, genetics, software engineering, laboratory management, sales and marketing and corporate and administrative activities. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by collective bargaining agreements and we believe our relationship with our employees is good. 
Corporate Information
 We were incorporated in Delaware on May 13, 2016. We are the holding company of Fulgent LLC, which was initially formed in June 2011 as a California corporation and converted to a California limited liability company in September 2012. On September 30, 2016, Fulgent LLC became our wholly owned subsidiary in a transaction we refer to as the Reorganization, in which the holders of all equity interests in Fulgent LLC immediately prior to the Reorganization became all of our stockholders immediately following the Reorganization. 
 Our initial operations focused on Fulgent LLC’s former pharmaceutical business, or the Pharma Business, and in 2013 we commenced the genetic testing business we are currently pursuing. In October 2015, we recapitalized Fulgent LLC to establish two series of units, with the Class D units (consisting of Class D-1 preferred, Class D-2 preferred and Class D common units) having economic rights based on the genetic testing business we are currently pursuing and the Class P units (consisting of the Class P preferred and Class P common units) having economic rights based on the Pharma Business. On April 4, 2016, Fulgent LLC separated the Pharma Business from our genetic testing business in a transaction we refer to as the Pharma Split-Off. The operating results of the Pharma Business have been reported as discontinued operations for all periods in our consolidated financial statements included in this report. 
 Our headquarters and laboratory are located at 4978 Santa Anita Avenue, Temple City, California 91780, and our telephone number is (626) 350-0537. Our website address is www.fulgentgenetics.com. The information contained on or that can be accessed through our website is not part of and is not incorporated into this report by this reference. 
 We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, as amended, or JOBS Act. As an emerging growth company, we may take advantage of specified reduced disclosure and other requirements that are applicable generally to other public companies. We will remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2021, unless our gross revenue exceeds $1.0 billion in any fiscal year before that date, we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period before that date or the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of the second fiscal quarter of any fiscal year before that date.
 Available Information
 We file reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and make available, free of charge, on or through our website, our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy and information statements and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the SEC.
