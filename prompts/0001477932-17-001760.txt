Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Cosmos Holdings Inc. ("us", "we", or the "Company") was incorporated in the State of Nevada on July 21, 2009 under the name Prime Estates and Developments, Inc. for the purpose of acquiring and operating commercial real estate and real estate related assets. On November 14, 2013, we changed our name to Cosmos Holdings Inc.
 
On September 27, 2013, the Company closed a reverse take-over transaction pursuant to which it acquired a private company whose principal activities are the trading of products, providing representation, and provision of consulting services to various sectors as described below. Pursuant to a Share Exchange Agreement between the Company and Amplerissimo Ltd. ("Amplerissimo"), a company incorporated in Cyprus, we acquired 100% of Amplerissimo's issued and outstanding common stock.
 
As a result of the reverse take-over transaction, Amplerissimo became our wholly-owned subsidiary. On August 1, 2014, Amplerissimo formed SkyPharm S.A. a Greek Corporation ("SkyPharm"), a subsidiary that focuses on pharmaceutical products. As of July 22, 2015, the Hellenic Ministry of Health and more specifically the National Organization for Medicines has granted the license for the wholesale of pharmaceutical products for human use to the Company. The license is valid for a period of five years and pursuant to the EU directive of (2013/C 343/01) SkyPharm is subject to the Guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices of the European Union (the "Good Distribution Practices") for the sale and distribution of medical products for human use. SkyPharm believes it has properly incorporated all the methodologies, procedures, processes and resources in order to be in accordance with the guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices. Our warehouse has been equipped with the proper equipment, specifically with the proper shelves, working tables, medicines cold fridge and barcode machines to comply with all requirements. In addition, our headquarters have also been equipped with the proper office equipment, specifically with the bureau tables, chairs and the terminals for each one working station as well central hardware systems (Servers) and software programs (ERP & CRM platforms) that are essential for the efficient running of the business are already installed and in place. The Company commenced sales of pharmaceutical products in the beginning of November 2015.
 
We are currently focusing our existing operations on expanding the business of SkyPharm and have concentrated our efforts on becoming an international pharmaceutical company. The Company's focus will be on Branded Pharmaceuticals, Over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, and Generic Pharmaceuticals. The Company also intends to expand into Cosmetic-Beauty Products as well as Food Supplements and we target areas where we can build and maintain a strong position. The Company uses a differentiated operating model based on a lean, nimble and decentralized structure, an emphasis on low risk license acquisition as well as Research & Development and our ability to be better owners of pharmaceutical assets than others. This operating model and the execution of our Corporate Strategy are enabling the company to achieve sustainable growth and create shareholder value.
 
We regularly evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand through the acquisition of pharmaceutical products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we look to continue to enhance our pharmaceutical and over the counter product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluate selective acquisition and license opportunities.
 
We believe that the demand for reasonably-priced medicines, delivered in the highest quality, and constantly matching the requirements of reliable and comprehensive medical care, is set to increase in the years to come, with the populationâ€™s increasing life expectancy. With our product portfolio of non-patent and patent medicines, we contribute to the optimization of efficient medicinal care, and thereby to lowering costs both for health insurance funds and companies and for patients.

We assess the foreseeable development of the Company as being positive. The pharmaceutical sector offers a large growth potential in the European trade market of medicines, if service, price and quality are strictly directed to-wards the customer requirements. We will continue to encounter the competition in the market by service, reliability and a high level of quality. On the procurement side we can access a wide range of supply possibilities. To minimize business risks we diversify our sources of supply Europe wide. We secure our high quality demands through careful supplier qualification and selection as well as active supplier management.

Business Environment
 
The Company conducts its business within the pharmaceutical industry and is active in both of the pharmaceutical markets branded and generic pharmaceutical products. The pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and subject to comprehensive government regulations. Many factors may significantly affect the Company's sales of its products, including, but not limited to, efficacy, safety, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance as well as our research and development of new products. To compete successfully for business in the healthcare industry, the Company must demonstrate that its products offer medical benefits as well as cost advantages. Currently, most of the products that the Company is trading, compete with other products already on the market in the same therapeutic category, and are subject to potential competition from new products that competitors may introduce in the future.
 
Generic medicines are the pharmaceutical and therapeutic equivalents of branded pharmaceutical products and are generally marketed under their generic (chemical) names rather than by brand names. Typically, a generic drug may not be marketed until the expiration of applicable patent(s) on the corresponding branded product, unless a resolution of patent litigation results in an earlier opportunity to enter the market. Generic drugs are the same as branded products in dosage form, safety, efficacy, route of administration, quality, performance characteristics and intended use, but they are sold generally at prices below those of the corresponding branded products. Generic drugs provide a cost-effective alternative for consumers, while maintaining the same high quality, efficacy, safety profile, purity and stability of the branded product. At the moment we are not active yet in this market, we intend to sell generic products primarily in the European Market across multiple therapeutic categories in the near term.
 
The Company intends to start operating within the Health Products & Food Supplement industry markets. These specific industries are highly competitive and many factors may significantly affect the Company's sales of its products, including, but not limited to, price and cost-effectiveness, marketing effectiveness, product labeling, quality control and quality assurance. Currently the company is not selling any cosmetic product neither food supplements. No assurances can be made that the Company will be able to gain entry into these markets.
 
Corporate Strategy
 
The main strategy initiative is focused on continuing our progress in becoming a Global Specialty Pharmaceutical Company. Through the development of a lean and efficient operating model, we are committed to serving our customers while continuing to innovate and provide products that make a difference in the lives of patients. We strive to maximize our shareholders' value by adapting to market realities and customer needs.
 
We are committed to driving organic growth at attractive margins by improving execution, optimizing cash flow and leveraging our strong market position, while maintaining a streamlined cost structure throughout each of our businesses.

Specific areas of management's focus include:
 

- | Branded & Over the Counter Pharmaceuticals: Accelerating performance of Growth drivers, increasing profitability from high demand brands and investing in key pipeline development opportunities. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Generic Pharmaceuticals: Capitalizing on encouraging demand trends for a differentiated product portfolio and focusing on developing or acquiring high barrier to entry products, including first to file or first to market opportunities that are difficult to formulate, difficult to manufacture or face complex legal and regulatory challenges. Acquiring dossiers and registrations for generic products, which require limited manufacturing start-up and development activities.
- | Health Products & Food Supplements: Investing in high growth business segments with durable revenue streams and where possible and capable geographical expansion and penetration. 
- | Research & Development: Committed to strategic R&D across each business unit with a particular focus on pharmaceutical and cosmetic products with inherently lower risk profiles and clearly defined regulatory pathways. 
- | Growth Opportunities: Seeking to identify incremental development growth opportunities through acquisitions and product licensing. In addition to a focus on organic growth drivers, we are also actively pursuing accretive acquisitions that offer long-term revenue growth, margin expansion through synergies and the ability to maintain a flexible capital structure. 

 
To successfully execute our corporate strategy, we believe that the Company must adopt, incorporate and maintain the following core strengths (no assurances can be made that the Company will be able to effectively implement these strategies):
 
Diversification of our business to become a Global specialty Pharmaceutical company
 
In light of the evolving healthcare industry, we have to regularly evaluate and, where appropriate, execute on opportunities to expand through acquisitions of products and companies in areas that will serve patients and customers and that we believe will offer above average growth characteristics and attractive margins. In particular, we look to continue to enhance our product lines by acquiring or licensing rights to additional products and regularly evaluating selective acquisition and license opportunities. 
 
Focus on business differentiated Generic Pharmaceutical Products.
 
Developing high-barrier-to-entry Generic pharmaceutical products, including first-to-file or first-to-market opportunities that are difficult to formulate, difficult to manufacture or face complex legal and regulatory challenges. We believe products with these characteristics will face a lesser degree of competition and therefore provide longer product life cycles and higher profitability than commodity generic products.
 
We plan to optimize our generic products pipeline and portfolio as part of a strategic assessment of our generic business. We will retain only those marketed products that deliver acceptable returns on investment, thereby leveraging our existing platform to drive operational efficiency. 
 
Emphasis on Vertical Integration of Pharmaceutical Business units 
 
We are strategically seeking to expand our technology, manufacturing, handling and development capabilities to a diversified array of pharmaceutical products. We believe our comprehensive suite of technology, manufacturing and development capabilities increases the likelihood of success in commercializing high-barrier-to-entry products and obtaining first-to-file and first-to-market status on future products, yielding more sustainable market share and profitability.

Targeted Sales and Marketing
 
We have to continue market our products directly and indirectly through a dedicated sales force team. Our sales force targets mainly wholesale distributors and other healthcare professionals. We sell our products principally through independent wholesale distributors, but we also sell directly to other pharmaceutical companies, clinics, government agencies, doctors, independent retail and specialty pharmacies and independent specialty distributors. 
 
We believe this corporate strategy will allow us to maximize both the growth rate and profitability of the Company and at the same time to enhance shareholder value.
 
Products & Services
 
The current principal activity of SkyPharm is the trading of branded and generic pharmaceutical products and medicines across the European Union member states. SkyPharm will operate as a buyer from wholesale pharmaceutical companies and as a reseller to other companies. Thus, SkyPharm will be the operator and the mechanism between the supply and demand sides in the wholesale market. The Company could be characterized as the middle ring of this distribution channel. 
 
The operational life cycle of services performed by SkyPharm could be described as follows:
 

a. | Searching and analyzing within market the demand and price of medicines; 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b. | Demand list placement by the clients including specific medicines, volumes and prices;
c. | Research availability of the demanded medicines in the market; 
d. | Choosing the appropriate supplier based upon available medicines and volumes; 
e. | Order placement by the client; 
f. | Checking control of the relevant authorities; 
g. | Purchase of the medicines from the wholesalers; 


h. | Assortment and storage of the medicines in the Company's facilities;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------
i. | Packaging the medicines according to the buyer's order list; 
j. | Delivery of the medicines to clients facilities; and 
k. | Direct payment for the shipment. 

 
We believe that the entire aforementioned product life cycle would take approximately three weeks to one month, from the demand list to the payment for the shipment.
 
We are formulating a broader and more diversified pharmaceutical product portfolio and a greater selection of targets for potential development. We target products with limited competition for reasons such as trading complexity or the market size, which make our pharmaceutical products a key growth driver of our portfolio and complementary to other product offerings.
 
Customers 
 
Through our subsidiary, SkyPharm, we primarily sell pharmaceutical products directly to a limited number of large wholesale drug distributors who, in turn, supply-sell the products to other wholesalers, hospitals, pharmacies, governmental agencies across the European Union member states. Total revenues from the customers that accounted for 10% or more of our total consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2016 & 2015 are as follows:

 | 2016 | | | 2015
------------------------+------+-------+---+-----
MPA Pharma GmbH | | 39.61 | % | | 68.84 | %
Interport ltd | | 4.01 | % | | 18.37 | %
Farmakeftiko Kenro S.A. | | 12.88 | % | | 0.00 | %

No other customer generated over 10% of our total revenues.
 
We make a significant amount of our sales to a relatively small number of pharmaceutical product wholesalers. These customers represent an essential part of the distribution chain of our products. Pharmaceutical wholesalers have undergone, and are continuing to undergo, significant consolidation in a worldwide basis. This consolidation resulted in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage and consequently increasing the product pricing pressures facing our business. 
 
Geographic Markets
 
All of our revenues are generated from operations in the European Union or otherwise earned outside the U.S. All of our foreign operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, including price and currency exchange controls, fluctuations in the relative values of currencies, political and economic instability and restrictive governmental actions including. Our geographical market sales distribution of our total consolidated revenues during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 are as follows:

 | 2016 | | | 2015
--------------------------+------+--------+---+-----
Germany | | 49.42 | % | | 68.84 | %
United Kingdom of England | | 16.19 | % | | 26.50 | %
Greece | | 19.07 | % | | 2.90 | %
Netherlands | | 8.35 | % | | 0.00 | %
Ireland | | 4.49 | % | | 0.00 | %
Poland | | 2.30 | % | | 1.76 | %
Sweden | | 0.11 | % | | 0.00 | %
Italy | | 0.07 | % | | 0.00 | %
Total | | 100.00 | % | | 100.00 | %

 
We currently sell the products to wholesalers through our own sales force. We do not sell directly to large drug store chains or through distributors in countries where we do not have our own sales staff. As part of our sales marketing and promotion program, we use direct advertising, direct mailings, trading techniques, direct & personal contacts, exhibition of products at medical conventions and sponsor medical education symposia. 
 
Competition
 
Our pharmaceutical businesses are conducted in intensely competitive and often highly regulated markets. Many of our trading pharmaceutical products face competition in the form of branded or generic drugs that treat similar diseases or indications. The principal forms of competition include efficacy, safety, ease of use, and cost effectiveness. The means of competition vary across product categories and business groups, demonstrating the value of our trading products is a critical factor for success in all of our principal businesses.
 
Our competitors include other trading companies, smaller companies, with generic drug and consumer healthcare products. We compete with other companies that manufacture and sell products that treat diseases or indications similar to those treated by our trading pharmaceutical products.
 
Our competitive position in pharmaceutical sector is affected by several factors, including, among others, the amount and effectiveness of our and our competitors' promotional resources; customer acceptance; product quality; our and our competitors' introduction of new products, ingredients, claims, dosage forms, or other forms of innovation; and pricing, regulatory and legislative matters (such as product labeling, patient access and prescription). 
 
The Branded pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive. Our products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the EU territory and internationally as well. Competitors include many of the major brand name and generic manufacturers of pharmaceutical products. If competitors introduce new products, delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages, our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales, or both.

In the Generic pharmaceutical market, we might face intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers, brand name pharmaceutical companies, existing brand equivalents and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs.
 
By specializing in high barrier to entry products, we endeavor to market more profitable and longer-lived products relative to commodity generic products. We believe that our competitive advantages include our integrated team-based approach to product development that combines our formulation, regulatory, legal and commercial capabilities; our ability to introduce new generic equivalents for brand-name drugs; our ability to meet customer expectations; and the breadth of our existing generic product portfolio offering.
 
Newly introduced Generic products with limited or no other generic competition typically garner higher prices. At the expiration of the exclusivity period, other generic distributors may enter the market, resulting in a significant price decline for the drug. Consequently, the maintenance of profitable operations in generic pharmaceuticals depends, in part, on our ability to select, develop and launch new generic products in a timely and cost efficient manner and to maintain efficient, high quality business capabilities.
 
Operating conditions have become more challenging under the mounting global pressures of competition, industry regulation and cost containment. We continue to take measures to evaluate, adapt and improve our organization and business practices to better meet customer and public needs. We also seek to continually enhance the organizational effectiveness of all of our functions, including efforts to accurately and ethically launch and promote our products. 
 
As far as Amplerissimo is concerned we face significant competition delivering data mining, statistical data analysis, research and analysis, negotiating services, credit risk analysis, credit management, conducting case studies, introduction services, e-commerce consulting, marketing management consulting, expansion strategies consulting, information systems consulting, and business management software consulting services.
 
Some of our competitors have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do and some are better known than we are. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against these organizations. As a result these competitors may:
 

- | Succeed in providing services that are equal to or superior to our services or that achieve greater market acceptance than our service; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- | Devote greater resources to developing, marketing or selling their services; 
- | Respond more quickly to new or emerging information or service technologies, which could render our services less preferable; 
- | Withstand competition in the industry more effectively than we can. 
- | Establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties that enhance their ability to address the needs of our customers or prospective customers; and
- | Take advantage of other opportunities more readily than we can. 

 
Since there are no substantial barriers to entry into the markets in which we participate, we expect that additional competitors will continue to enter these markets.
 
We will compete based upon our flexibility to customize our services and products to our client's specific needs utilizing our knowledge of a large number service provides and what we believe is our ability to provide services at faster and more efficiently than our competitors with the same quality of service and finished products as our competitors. We also believe that these characteristics enable us to provide our services at lower cost than our competitors.

Government Regulations
 
Government authorities in the EU and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, approval, manufacturing, labeling, post-approval monitoring and reporting, packaging, advertising and promotion, storage, distribution, marketing and export and import of pharmaceutical products. As such, our branded pharmaceutical products and the generic product candidates are subject to extensive regulation both before and after approval. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in, among other things, warning letters, civil penalties, delays in approving or refusal to approve a pharmaceutical product. 
Patents, Trademarks, Licenses and Proprietary Property
 
As of July 22, 2015 the Company has acquired the license for the wholesale of pharmaceutical products for human use by the Hellenic Ministry of Health and more specifically the National Organization for Medicines. The license is valid for a period of five years and pursuant to the EU directive of (2013/C 343/01) the Company is subject to fulfill the Guidelines of the Good Distribution Practices of medical products for human use. 
 
At present, besides the above license we do not have any intellectual property or other licenses, including, but not limited to, patents, trademarks, franchises, concessions, and royalty agreements or other proprietary interests.
 
We will rely on confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and other parties to protect, among other things, trade secrets and other proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that other third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and other intellectual property

We have a team with a significant track record in the pharmaceutical business. In order to achieve our strategic objectives, we have, and will remain, focused on hiring and retaining a highly skilled management team that has extensive experience and specific skill sets relating to the sales, selection, development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. We intend to continue our efforts to build and expand this team as we grow our business. No assurances can be given that the Company will be able to retain any additional persons.
 
Product Insurance
 
We do not have to insure our trading products since we are selling ex-works, thus our client is responsible for the transportation and the insurance of the products against any damage. In the future, we will continue to reevaluate our decision and may purchase product liability insurance to cover some of or all of our product liability risk.
Research and Development Expenditures
 
We have not incurred any research or development expenditures since our incorporation.
