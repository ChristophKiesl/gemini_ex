Medical and Healthcare
Chamberlain
Chamberlain was founded in 1889 as Deaconess College of Nursing and acquired by Adtalem in 2005. In May 2017, Chamberlain College of Nursing broadened its reach in healthcare education through the establishment of Chamberlain University and now offers its programs through its College of Nursing and College of Health Professions. Nursing degree offerings include a three-year onsite Bachelor of Science in Nursing (“BSN”) degree, an online Registered Nurse (“RN”) to BSN (“RN-to-BSN”) degree completion option, an online Master of Science in Nursing (“MSN”) degree, including Family Nurse Practitioner (“FNP”) and other specialties, and the online Doctor of Nursing Practice (“DNP”) degree.
Chamberlain offers an online Master of Public Health (“MPH”) degree program and an online Master of Social Work (“MSW”) degree program, which launched in July 2017 and September 2019, respectively, both of which are offered through its College of Health Professions.
 Chamberlain provides an educational experience distinguished by a high level of care for students, academic excellence, and integrity delivered through its 23 campuses and online. Chamberlain is committed to graduating health professionals who are empowered to transform healthcare worldwide. Chamberlain had 34,930 students enrolled in the May 2021 session, an increase of 4.6% over the prior year.
Chamberlain’s pre-licensure BSN degree is a baccalaureate program offered at its campus locations as well as online in specific states. The BSN program enables students to complete their BSN degree in three years of full-time study as opposed to the typical four-year BSN program with summer breaks. Beginning in September 2019, Chamberlain also began offering an evening/weekend BSN option at select campuses. In September 2020, Chamberlain launched its online BSN option which offers a blend of flexibility, interactivity, and experiential learning. The program is available to students living in eleven states (Alaska, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Minnesota, New Mexico, Oklahoma, South Dakota, West Virginia, and Wisconsin). Chamberlain pre-licensure BSN students who completed the National Council Licensure Examination (“NCLEX”) had an overall pass rate of 91% in 2020 and 88% in 2019. The national NCLEX pass rate was 90% for 2020 and 91% for 2019.
 Students who already have passed their NCLEX exam and achieved RN designation through a diploma or associate degree can complete their BSN degree online through Chamberlain’s RN-to-BSN completion option in three semesters of full-time study, although most students enroll part-time while they continue working as nurses.

The online MSN degree program offers five non-direct-care specialty tracks: Educator, Executive, Informatics, Population Health, and Healthcare Policy. These programs require 36 credit hours and are designed to be completed in approximately two years of part-time study. Chamberlain also offers three direct-care nurse practitioner tracks: FNP, Adult-Gerontology Acute Care Nurse Practitioner (“AGACNP”), and Adult-Gerontology Primary Care Nurse Practitioner (“AGPCNP”). The FNP and AGPCNP programs require 45 credit hours along with 650 lab and clinical hours and are designed to be completed in two and a half years of part-time study. The AGPCNP and AGACNP programs launched in July 2020. Chamberlain also offers an accelerated MSN option that students can complete in 30 credit hours and receive a generalist degree.
The online DNP degree program is based on the eight essentials of doctoral education outlined by the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (“AACN”). The DNP program is designed for nurses seeking a terminal degree in nursing and offers an alternative to research-focused Ph.D. programs. The program requires 32 to 40 credit hours along with 1,000 clinical practicum hours. The program can be completed in five to six semesters of study.
Chamberlain’s College of Health Professions MPH degree program focuses on preparing students to become public health practitioners to work with communities and populations globally to promote healthy communities and to prevent community health problems such as disease, poverty, health access disparities, and violence through interdisciplinary coursework. The program requires 43 credit hours. The MSW degree program aims to develop and empower students to be agents of social change in their communities and throughout the world. The MSW degree program prepares students for generalist or specialized practice and offers three specializations, including Crisis and Response Interventions, Trauma, and Medical Social Work. The program offers both a traditional and advanced standing option. The traditional option requires 60 credit hours while the advanced standing option requires 36 credit hours and is for students who have completed a baccalaureate degree in social work.
Student Admissions and Admissions Standards
Pre-Licensure BSN Program
The Chamberlain undergraduate pre-licensure admission process is made up of two phases: Academic Eligibility and Clinical Clearance. Applicants must meet both sets of requirements to be eligible for admission. Academic Eligibility requires proof of graduation with a minimum grade point average of 2.75 from a recognized high school or other college, along with a minimum custom score on the A2 Admission Assessment test. The admissions committee reviews each application and selects the most qualified candidates. Applicants who are deemed Academically Eligible must receive Clinical Clearance, which includes a background check, fingerprint screen, and drug screen for acceptance to be granted. Chamberlain enrolls students in its pre-licensure program at least three times per year, during the January, May, and September sessions and select campuses may offer additional opportunities to start.
RN-to-BSN Option
Admission to the RN-to-BSN option requires a nursing diploma or Associate Degree in Nursing from an accredited institution, a minimum grade point average of 2.0, and a current, active, unrestricted RN license in the U.S. or other jurisdiction that is an associate member of the National Council of State Boards of Nursing (“NCSBN”). Chamberlain enrolls students in its RN-to-BSN program six times per year, during the January, March, May, July, September, and November sessions.
Graduate Programs
To enroll in the MSN program, a prospective student must possess a degree in nursing at the bachelor’s level or higher from an accredited institution, a minimum grade point average of 3.0, and a current, active, unrestricted RN license in the U.S. or other jurisdiction that is an associate member of the NCSBN. Provisional admission may be granted to students who have a grade point average of at least 2.75 but less than 3.0.
The DNP program requires a degree at the master’s level or higher from an accredited institution, a minimum grade point average of 3.0, and a current, active, unrestricted RN license in the U.S. or other jurisdiction that is an associate member of the NCSBN.

Enrollment in the MPH program requires a bachelor’s level degree or higher from an accredited institution and a minimum grade point average of 3.0.
Students seeking to enroll in the MSW program must have a bachelor’s degree or higher from an accredited institution with a minimum grade point average of 2.5. Students must also pass a background and fingerprint check.
Chamberlain enrolls students in its graduate programs six times per year, during the January, March, May, July, September, and November sessions.
Medical and Veterinary Schools
Together, the three schools, along with the Medical Education Readiness Program (“MERP”) and the Veterinary Preparation Program, had 5,126 students enrolled in the May 2021 semester, a 1.2% decrease compared to the same term last year.
AUC
AUC, founded in 1978 and acquired by Adtalem in 2011, provides medical education and confers the Doctor of Medicine degree. AUC is located in St. Maarten and is one of the most established international medical schools in the Caribbean, producing over 7,500 graduates from over 78 countries. The mission of AUC is to train tomorrow’s physicians, whose service to their communities and their patients is enhanced by international learning experiences, a diverse learning community, and an emphasis on social accountability and engagement. 
RUSM
RUSM, founded in 1978 and acquired by Adtalem in 2003, provides medical education and confers the Doctor of Medicine degree. RUSM has graduated more than 15,000 physicians since inception. The mission of RUSM is to prepare highly dedicated students to become effective and successful physicians. RUSM seeks to accomplish this by focusing on imparting the knowledge, skills, and values required for its students to establish a successful and satisfying career as a physician. In January 2019, RUSM moved its basic science instruction from Dominica to Barbados.
AUC’s and RUSM’s respective medical education programs are comparable to the educational programs offered at U.S. medical schools as evidenced by student performance on the U.S. Medical Licensing Examination (“USMLE”) tests and residency placement. AUC’s and RUSM’s programs consist of three academic semesters per year, which begin in January, May, and September, allowing students to begin their basic science instruction at the most convenient time for them.
Initially, AUC and RUSM students complete a program of concentrated study of medical sciences after which they sit for Step 1 of the USMLE, which assesses whether students understand and can apply scientific concepts that are basic to the practice of medicine. Under AUC and RUSM direction, students then complete the remainder of their program by participating in clinical rotations conducted at over 40 affiliated teaching hospitals or medical centers connected with accredited medical education programs in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Successfully passing USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills previously was a requirement for graduation and for certification by the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates (“ECFMG”) to enter the U.S. residency match. Due to COVID-19 restrictions, USMLE Step 2 Clinical Skills has been discontinued. ECFMG has developed alternative pathways to replace this requirement, for which AUC and RUSM are generally eligible. In addition, flexibility to use some online clinical training has been allowed by accreditors and other U.S. regulatory bodies. These alternatives are critical to keeping many students on track to graduate and enter the 2022 residency match.
Upon successful completion of their medical degree requirements, students apply for a residency position in their area of specialty through the National Residency Matching Program (“NRMP”). This process is also known as “The Match”® and utilizes an algorithm to “match” applicants to programs using the certified rank order lists of the applicants and program directors.
AUC students achieved a 94% and 93% first-time pass rate on the USMLE Step 1 exam in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Of first-time eligible AUC graduates, 92% attained residency positions in both 2020 and 2021.

4



RUSM students achieved a 97% and 91% first-time pass rate on the USMLE Step 1 exam in 2019 and 2020, respectively. Of first-time eligible RUSM graduates, 95% and 92% attained residency positions in 2020 and 2021, respectively.
In September 2019, AUC opened its medical education program in the U.K. in partnership with University of Central Lancashire (“UCLAN”). The program offers students a Post Graduate Diploma in International Medical Sciences from UCLAN, followed by their Doctor of Medicine degree from AUC. Students are eligible to do clinical rotations at AUC’s clinical sites, which include hospitals in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada. This program is aimed at preparing students for the USMLE. 
MERP is a 15-week medical school preparatory program focused on enhancing the academic foundation of prospective AUC and RUSM students and providing them with the skills they need to be successful in medical school and to achieve their goals of becoming physicians. Upon successful completion of the MERP program, students are guaranteed admission to AUC or RUSM. Data has shown that the performance of students who complete the MERP program are consistent with students who were admitted directly into medical school.
RUSVM
RUSVM, founded in 1982 and acquired by Adtalem in 2003, provides veterinary education and confers the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine, as well as Masters of Science and Ph.D. degrees. RUSVM is one of 54 American Veterinary Medical Association (“AVMA”) accredited veterinary education institutions in the world. RUSVM is located in St. Kitts and has graduated nearly 6,000 veterinarians since inception. The mission of RUSVM is to provide the best learning environment to prepare students to become members and leaders of the worldwide public and professional healthcare system and to advance human and animal health through research and knowledge exchange.
The RUSVM program is structured to provide a veterinary education that is comparable to educational programs at U.S. veterinary schools. RUSVM students complete a seven-semester, pre-clinical curriculum at the campus in St. Kitts. After completing their pre-clinical curriculum, RUSVM students enter a clinical clerkship under RUSVM direction lasting approximately 45 weeks at one of 31 clinical affiliates located in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the U.K.
RUSVM offers a one-semester Veterinary Preparatory Program (“Vet Prep”) designed to enhance the pre-clinical science knowledge and study skills that are critical to success in veterinary school. The Vet Prep advancement rate for 2018-2019 is 92%, which represents the percent of Vet Prep students in 2018-2019 who started at RUSVM within one year.
In 2020 and 2021, instruction for both the RUSVM and Vet Prep programs was partially offered online in response to COVID-19 travel restrictions. As of June 30, 2021, all students except those in Vet Prep had returned to full-time instruction in St. Kitts.
Student Admissions and Admissions Standards
AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM employ regional admissions representatives in locations throughout the U.S. and Canada who provide information to students interested in their respective programs. A successful applicant must have completed the required prerequisite courses and, for AUC and RUSM, taken the Medical College Admission Test (“MCAT”), while RUSVM applicants must have completed the Graduate Record Exam (“GRE”). Candidates for admission must interview with an admissions representative and all admission decisions are made by the admissions committees of the medical and veterinary schools. AUC allows several entrance examinations for its international students. The MCAT (and other entrance exams) requirement is currently waived due to lack of availability of testing caused by COVID-19 closures. The Department of Education (“ED”), which usually mandates that the schools require MCAT for U.S. citizens, has waived this requirement for the calendar 2021 because of limited testing availability due to COVID-19. Both AUC and RUSM waived MCAT requirements, and the first students with waived MCAT requirements began their education in September 2020. For classes starting in September 2021, AUC and RUSM will continue to waive the MCAT requirement. RUSVM waived GRE requirements for classes starting in January 2021 and May 2021 because of limited testing availability due to COVID-19.

Overview of the Impact of COVID-19
On March 11, 2020, the COVID-19 outbreak was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization. COVID-19 has had tragic consequences across the globe and altered business and consumer activity across many industries. Management initiated several changes to the operations of our institutions and administrative functions in order to protect the health of Adtalem employees, students, and customers and to mitigate the financial effects of COVID-19 and its resultant economic slowdown. We will continue to evaluate, and if appropriate, adopt other measures in the future required for the ongoing safety of our students, customers, and employees. See also the COVID-19 section in Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for additional information, including the effects of COVID-19 on our operations.
●Chamberlain: Approximately 30% of Chamberlain’s students are based at campus locations and pursuing their BSN degree; at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak, all campus-based students transitioned to online learning for didactic and select clinical experiences. The remaining 70% of Chamberlain’s students are enrolled in online programs that may or may not have clinical components and those programs continued to successfully operate. For the September 2020 session, students and employees returned to several Chamberlain campuses for limited onsite instruction. COVID-19 did not result in significant revenue losses or increased costs at Chamberlain in fiscal year 2021 and 2020. The extent of the impact in fiscal year 2022 and beyond will be determined based on the length and severity of the effects of COVID-19, the efficacy and distribution of the vaccines, and whether any pandemic surge affects healthcare facilities’ ability to continue to provide clinical experiences, most of which have resumed. Chamberlain has clinical partnerships with healthcare facilities across the U.S., minimizing the risk of suspension of all onsite clinical education experiences.

●AUC and RUSM: Medical students enrolled in the basic science portion of their program transitioned to online learning at the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak. Many students left St. Maarten and Barbados to continue their studies remotely from other locations. AUC and RUSM were able to provide remote learning and have students remain eligible for U.S. federal financial aid assistance under a waiver provided by the U.S. Secretary of Education that was included in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) signed into law in March 2020. The waiver was dependent upon the host country’s coronavirus state of emergency declaration. The nation of St. Maarten lifted their declaration in June 2020, and as a result, AUC’s ability to offer distance education ended after the September 2020 semester, requiring all AUC students to return to St. Maarten for basic science instruction effective January 2021. A limited number of RUSM students began returning to Barbados in January and May 2021 with a full return expected for the September 2021 semester. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 (the “Appropriations Act”) was signed into law in December 2020, and corrected technical errors in the CARES Act, which clarified the authority to operate via distance learning due to a declaration of an emergency in an applicable country or a qualifying emergency in the U.S. This section also extends these flexibilities through the end of the qualifying emergency or June 30, 2022, whichever is later. The Appropriations Act provides Adtalem’s foreign institutions the ability to continue distance education without disruption to their students’ Title IV federal financial aid. COVID-19 did not result in significant revenue losses or increased costs within the basic science programs at the medical schools in fiscal year 2021 and 2020, except with respect to housing operations, as discussed below. COVID-19 will likely have minimal impact on basic science program revenue in fiscal

year 2022, except with respect to housing operations, unless students choose to not continue or start their studies during this time of uncertainty. The extent of the impact in fiscal year 2022 and beyond will be determined based on the length and severity of the effects of COVID-19 and the efficacy and distribution of the vaccines. Students who have completed their basic science education progress to clinical rotations in the U.S. and the U.K. Clinical rotations for all students were temporarily suspended in March 2020; however, some students were able to participate in online clinical elective courses during this transition period and beyond. The COVID-19 surge experienced during the winter in fiscal year 2021 across the U.S. caused many partner hospitals to again reduce the hours available for clinical experiences. As a result, although many students were able to resume their clinical education during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, not being able to offer a full clinical program reduced revenue and operating income of AUC and RUSM in fiscal year 2021 and 2020. As of June 2021, all clinical partners of AUC and RUSM have resumed their clinical programs; however, should future surges in COVID-19 again restrict the number of clinical hours available to our students, we could experience negative effects on revenue and operating income in fiscal year 2022 and beyond. Adtalem has clinical partnerships with hospitals across the U.S. and the U.K., minimizing the risk of suspension of all onsite clinical education experiences. In addition to the loss of clinical revenue and operating income at AUC and RUSM, housing and student transportation revenue and operating income losses in fiscal year 2021 and 2020 were also impacted due to students leaving the St. Maarten and Barbados campuses to continue basic science studies remotely.
●RUSVM: All basic science veterinary students transitioned to online learning beginning in March 2020. Many students left St. Kitts in March 2020 to continue their studies remotely from other locations. As of May 2021, all basic science students have returned to St. Kitts where lectures continue to be delivered remotely and labs are in-person. COVID-19 did not result in significant revenue losses or increased costs within the basic science program in fiscal year 2021 and 2020. We do not expect a significant impact from COVID-19 on the basic science program in fiscal year 2022, unless students choose to not continue or start their studies during this time of uncertainty. RUSVM continues to be able to provide remote learning during the pandemic and have students remain eligible for U.S. federal financial aid assistance under a waiver provided by the CARES Act and the Appropriations Act through the end of the qualifying emergency or June 30, 2022, whichever is later, as described above. Students who have completed their basic science education progress to clinical rotations at select universities in the U.S., Canada, Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, and the U.K. A few universities initially suspended onsite clinical experiences and transitioned students to online education. All universities have since resumed onsite clinical courses. The initial suspensions did not significantly reduce revenue or operating income in fiscal year 2021 and 2020. While we do not expect a significant impact from COVID-19 at RUSVM, the extent of the impact on clinical experiences in fiscal year 2022 and beyond will be determined based on the length and severity of the effects of COVID-19 and the efficacy and distribution of the vaccines.
●Financial Services: Most Financial Services content, including exam preparation, certification training, continuing education, and subscriptions is delivered online. Any classroom-based learning has been moved to online. No significant COVID-19 related cost increases were realized in Financial Services in fiscal year 2021 and 2020. COVID-19 did result in revenue losses and operating income losses in fiscal year 2021 and 2020, primarily driven by the cancellation of ACAMS live conferences. Fiscal year 2020 lost revenue and operating income was also impacted at Becker from Prometric, a global leader in the provision of technology-enabled testing and assessment solutions, closing CPA testing sites, along with a number of CPA firms either delaying start dates for, or rescinding altogether, offers of employment to recent college graduates. This dampened a key driver of demand in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, which is normally a time of robust demand because of the influx of new college graduates looking to begin their CPA exam preparation. ACAMS live conference revenue is not expected to return to pre-pandemic levels until COVID-19 restrictions are fully lifted and customer apprehension dissipates. COVID-19 is expected to negatively impact Financial Services revenue and operating income in fiscal year 2022 and beyond driven by lower ACAMS live conference revenue and possible weakness in demand at Becker, primarily with CPA firm customers. Virtual conferences were conducted in late fiscal year 2020 and throughout fiscal year 2021, and additional conference revenue could be replaced with virtual or hybrid events in the future; however virtual conferences are unlikely to generate the same level of revenue and operating income as live conferences. Loss of conference revenue is likely in fiscal year 2022 as ACAMS has only recently been able to offer a limited number of live conferences, mostly overseas. Large live and hybrid conferences in the U.S. are not expected to resume until possibly September 2021, and management expects any such events will not initially generate pre-pandemic levels of revenue. Management believes that other than the ACAMS conferences, longer-term operating results in the Financial Services segment will not be significantly affected by COVID-19 unless there are major employment losses with accounting professionals and recent accounting graduates, or in the banking and mortgage sectors. This is not known and cannot be

predicted at this time. At Becker, CPA, testing sites are operating with available capacity; however, management believes hiring at CPA firms has not yet fully recovered.
●Administrative Operations: Most institution and home office administrative operations continue to principally be performed remotely. This includes operations in both the U.S. and all foreign locations. These remote work arrangements have not adversely affected Adtalem’s ability to maintain operations, financial reporting systems, internal control over financial reporting, or disclosure controls and procedures. The effectiveness of our remote technology enables our ability to maintain these systems and controls. Management does not anticipate Adtalem will be materially impacted by any constraints or other impacts on our human capital resources and productivity. Travel restrictions and border closures are not expected to have a material impact on our ability to operate and achieve operational goals. While recent travel expenditures have decreased, we would expect these costs to increase as the effects of COVID-19 dissipate. No significant home office costs were incurred related to COVID-19 in fiscal year 2021 and 2020, and no such costs are anticipated in fiscal year 2022, and beyond.

Market Trends and Competition
Medical and Healthcare
Chamberlain
Chamberlain competes in the U.S. nursing education market, which has more than 2,000 programs leading to RN licensure. These include four-year educational institutions, two-year community colleges, and diploma schools of nursing. The market consists of two distinct segments: pre-licensure nursing programs that prepare students to take the NCLEX-RN licensure exam and post-licensure nursing programs that allow existing RNs to advance their education.
In the pre-licensure nursing market, capacity limitations and restricted new student enrollment are common among traditional four-year educational institutions and community colleges. Chamberlain has 23 campuses located in 15 states. In Fall 2020, according to data obtained from the American Association of Colleges of Nursing (“AACN”), Chamberlain had the largest pre-licensure program in the U.S.
In post-licensure nursing education, there are more than 700 institutions offering RN-to-BSN programs and more than 600 institutions offering MSN programs. Chamberlain’s RN-to-BSN degree completion option has received three certifications from Quality Matters, an independent global organization leading quality assurance in online teaching and learning environments. Chamberlain has earned the Online Learning Support, Online Teaching Support, and Online Learner Success certifications. Chamberlain’s RN-to-BSN degree completion option, MSN degree program, and DNP degree program are approved in 50 states, the District of Columbia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The MSN FNP track is approved in 46 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands, while the AGACP and AGPCP tracks are approved in 42 states and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The MPH program is approved in 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The MSW program is approved in 37 states and Puerto Rico.
In Fall 2020, according to AACN data, Chamberlain had the largest FNP and DNP programs in the U.S.
Medical and Veterinary Schools
AUC and RUSM compete with approximately 150 U.S. schools of medicine, 48 U.S. colleges of osteopathic medicine, and more than 40 Caribbean medical schools as well as with international medical schools recruiting U.S. students who may be eligible to receive funding from ED Title IV programs. RUSVM competes with AVMA accredited schools, of which 33 are U.S.-based, 5 are Canadian and 16 are other international veterinary schools.
There has been some recent expansion in the U.S. medical education and veterinary education enrollment capacities because of the growing supply/demand imbalance for medical doctors and veterinarians. Despite this expansion, management believes the imbalance will continue to spur demand for medical and veterinary education.

Financial Services
ACAMS
Money laundering and the financing of terrorism are financial crimes with significant economic impact. Money laundering can occur in various forms including corruption, drug trafficking, tax evasion, and cybercrime. AML is the set of procedures, laws, and regulations designed to combat the practice of generating income through illegal actions. Professionals who need effective AML procedures include financial institutions, insurers, asset managers, lawyers, broker-dealers, private equity firms, consultants, law enforcement, and credit institutions. This training protects companies against various costs, such as financial penalties from regulatory bodies, personal liability, financial action from shareholders or employees, and reputational damage.
Organizations’ training methods are met by third-parties or internally developed informal training. Regulators are encouraging companies to maintain higher control standards. Due to frequent regulatory changes, internal training is being supplemented with third-party developed training programs to meet the higher regulatory standards. ACAMS is the largest AML certifier and is recognized as an industry leader in AML credentialing.
As of June 30, 2021, more than 43,000 professionals have been certified, which is completed by passing the ACAMS CAMS certification examination, CGSS certification or other ACAMS certification examinations as a qualified applicant. Two of the highly regarded industry publications are ACAMS Today and ACAMS moneylaundering.com. Prior to COVID-19, conferences and seminars are held in 32 countries and host approximately 10,000 attendees annually. ACAMS also has chapters in 60 countries around the world, led by professionals from the respective countries or geographic regions on a voluntary basis.
Becker
In 2018, the AICPA reported that there were approximately 76,000 accounting graduates combined across bachelor’s and master’s degree candidates and in 2018, approximately 37,000 new candidates began the CPA exam. The number of accounting graduates has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 1.4% over the last ten years. Over that same time period, the number of first-time CPA exam test takers has declined at a compound annual rate of 1.8%; although the number of test-takers may fluctuate in specific years based on the timing of student demand and exam changes. In 2018, the number of first-time CPA exam test takers fell 14% below the ten-year average (2008-2017). Further, 2018 employment of accounting graduates at U.S. public accounting firms, a key driver of CPA demand, declined 13% from the ten-year average as firms seek alternative skill sets to expand services.
Becker competes with other purveyors of exam preparation, including courses offered by colleges, universities, and other public and private training companies.
Becker is the industry leader in providing CPA exam review services and has been preparing candidates to pass the CPA exam for over 60 years. From 2007-2020, 90% of all Watt Sells Award winners, which are individuals who achieved the highest cumulative scores on the CPA exam, prepared with Becker.
OCL
Professionals in the financial services and mortgage industry require mandatory compliance training to meet regulatory requirements and internal compliance requirements; those in the mortgage industry have licensure and continuing education requirements. The regulatory environment for the financial services and mortgage industries continues to change at a rapid pace, which requires companies to maintain higher control standards. OCL’s offerings address these needs as well as the growing importance of specialized skills and up-skilling the workforce. Organizations meet their training needs by partnering with third-party training providers and internally developed informal training. Due to frequent regulatory changes, internal training is being supplemented with third-party developed training programs to meet higher regulatory standards. OCL is one of the largest national providers of training in both the bank, credit union, and mortgage industries.

Accreditation and Other Regulatory Approvals
Educational institutions and their individual programs are awarded accreditation by achieving a level of quality that entitles them to the confidence of the educational community and the public they serve. Accredited institutions are subject to periodic review by accrediting bodies to ensure continued high performance and institutional and program improvement and integrity, and to confirm that accreditation requirements continue to be satisfied. College and university administrators depend on the accredited status of an institution when evaluating transfer credit and applicants to their schools; employers rely on the accreditation status of an institution when evaluating a candidate’s credentials; parents and high school counselors look to accreditation for assurance that an institution meets quality educational standards; and many professions require candidates to graduate from an accredited program in order to obtain professional licensure in their respective fields. Moreover, in the U.S., accreditation is necessary for students to qualify for federal financial assistance and most scholarship commissions restrict their awards to students attending accredited institutions.
Medical and Healthcare
Chamberlain
Chamberlain is institutionally accredited by the Higher Learning Commission (“HLC”), a regional accreditation agency recognized by ED. In addition to institutional accreditation, Chamberlain has also obtained, or is in the process of obtaining, programmatic accreditation for specific programs. BSN, MSN, DNP, and post-graduate Advanced Practice Registered Nurses (“APRN”) certificate programs are accredited by the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education. Chamberlain’s MPH program has commenced the accreditation process with the Council on Education for Public Health, which accepted Chamberlain’s application in October 2017. Chamberlain’s MSW program has commenced the accreditation process with the Council on Social Work Education’s Commission on Accreditation, which accepted Chamberlain’s application in May 2019 and granted candidacy status in June 2020.
Medical and Veterinary Schools
The Government of St. Maarten authorizes AUC to confer the Doctor of Medicine degree. AUC is accredited by the Accreditation Commission on Colleges of Medicine (“ACCM”). The ACCM is an international medical school accrediting organization for countries that do not have a national medical school accreditation body. The U.S. Department of Education National Committee on Foreign Medical Education and Accreditation (“NCFMEA”) has affirmed that the ACCM has established and enforces standards of educational accreditation that are comparable to those promulgated by the U.S. Liaison Committee on Medical Education (“LCME”). In addition, AUC is authorized to place students in clinical rotations in the majority of U.S. states, including California, Florida, and New York, where robust processes are in place to evaluate and approve an international medical school’s programs. AUC students can join residency training programs in all 50 states. AUC has also been approved by the Graduate Medical Council (“GMC”), the accrediting body in the U.K., which allows AUC graduates to apply for post-graduate (residency) programs in the U.K.
RUSM’s primary accreditor is Caribbean Accreditation Authority for Education in Medicine and other Health Professions (“CAAM-HP”). CAAM-HP is authorized to accredit medical programs by the government of Barbados. On July 26, 2018, Barbados authorized RUSM to confer the Doctor of Medicine degree. The NCFMEA has affirmed that CAAM-HP has established and enforces standards of educational accreditation that are comparable to those promulgated by the LCME. In addition, RUSM is authorized to place students in clinical rotations in the majority of U.S. states, including California, Florida, New Jersey, and New York, where robust processes are in place to evaluate and accredit an international medical school’s programs. RUSM students can join residency training programs in all 50 states.
RUSVM has been recognized by the government of the Federation of St. Christopher and Nevis (“St. Kitts”) and is chartered to confer the Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree. The Doctor of Veterinary Medicine degree is accredited by the American Veterinary Medical Association Council on Education (“AVMA COE”). RUSVM has affiliations with 31 AVMA-accredited U.S. and international colleges of veterinary medicine so that RUSVM students can complete their final three clinical semesters of study in the U.S. or abroad. RUSVM has received accreditation for its Postgraduate Studies program from the St. Christopher & Nevis Accreditation Board. The Postgraduate Studies program offers Master of Science and Ph.D. degrees in all research areas supported by RUSVM. Areas of emphasis are guided by RUSVM's themed research centers.

Regulatory Environment
Student Payments
Adtalem’s primary source of liquidity is the cash received from payments for student tuition, books, other educational materials, and fees. These payments include funds originating as financial aid from various federal and state loan and grant programs, student and family educational loans (“private loans”), employer educational reimbursements, scholarships, and student and family financial resources. Adtalem continues to provide financing options for its students, including Adtalem’s credit extension programs.
The following table, which excludes Adtalem Brazil, Carrington, and DeVry University revenue, summarizes Adtalem’s revenue by fund source as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal years 2020 and 2019. Final data for fiscal year 2021 is not yet available.

Financial Aid
All financial aid and assistance programs are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations. In the U.S., the Higher Education Act (as reauthorized, the “HEA”) guides the federal government’s support of postsecondary education. The HEA was last reauthorized by the U.S. Congress in July 2008 and was signed into law in August 2008. In the 117th Congress, a comprehensive HEA reauthorization bill has not been introduced. However, standalone bills impacting Title IV federal financial aid programs have been introduced in both chambers of Congress. Some of these bills could be included in a larger legislative package, which could include the HEA. When the HEA is reauthorized, existing programs and participation requirements are subject to change. Additionally, funding for student financial assistance programs may be impacted during appropriations and budget actions.
Information about Particular U.S. and Canadian Government Financial Aid Programs
Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM students participate in many U.S. and Canadian financial aid programs. Each of these programs is briefly described below.
U.S. Federal Financial Aid Programs
Students in the U.S. rely on three types of ED student financial aid programs under Title IV of the HEA.
1. Grants. Chamberlain undergraduate students may participate in the Federal Pell Grant and Federal Supplemental Education Opportunity Grant programs.

● | Federal Pell Grants: These funds do not have to be repaid and are available to eligible undergraduate students who demonstrate financial need and who have not already received a baccalaureate degree. For the 2020-2021 school year, eligible students could receive Federal Pell Grants ranging from $320 to $9,517.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant (“FSEOG”): This is a supplement to the Federal Pell Grant and is only available to the neediest undergraduate students. Federal rules restrict the amount of FSEOG funds that may go to a single institution. The maximum individual FSEOG award is established by the institution but cannot exceed $4,000 per academic year. Educational institutions are required to supplement federal funds with a 25% matching contribution. Institutional matching contributions may be satisfied, in whole or in part, by state grants, scholarship funds (discussed below), or by externally provided scholarship grants.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Loans. Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM students may participate in the Direct Unsubsidized and PLUS programs within the Federal Direct Student Loan Program. Chamberlain undergraduate students may also be eligible for Subsidized Loans within the Federal Direct Student Loan Program.

● | Direct Subsidized Loan: Awarded on the basis of student financial need, it is a low-interest loan (a portion of the interest is subsidized by the Federal government) available to undergraduate students with interest charges and principal repayment deferred until six months after a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis (the student is responsible for paying the interest charges during the six months after no longer attending school on at least a half-time basis for those loans with a first disbursement between July 1, 2012 and July 1, 2014). First time borrowers after July 1, 2013 are eligible for Direct Subsidized Loans only for 150% of the published length of their academic program. Loan limits per academic year range from $3,500 for students in their first and second academic year to $5,500 for students in their third or higher undergraduate academic year.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Direct Unsubsidized Loan: Awarded to students who do not meet the needs test or as an additional supplement to the Direct Subsidized Loan. These loans incur interest from the time funds are disbursed, but actual principal and interest payments may be deferred until six months after a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis. Direct Unsubsidized Loan limits per academic year range from $2,000 for students in their first and second academic year to $7,000 in later undergraduate years and increasing to $20,500 per academic year for graduate and professional program students. Additionally, a student without financial need may borrow an additional Direct Unsubsidized Loan amount up to the limit of the Direct Subsidized Loan at their respective academic grade level. The total Direct Subsidized and/or Direct Unsubsidized Loan aggregate borrowing limit for undergraduate students is $57,500 and $138,500 for graduate students, which is inclusive of Direct Subsidized and Direct Unsubsidized Loan amounts borrowed as an undergraduate.

● | Direct Grad PLUS and Direct Parent PLUS Loans: Enables a graduate student or parents of a dependent undergraduate student to borrow additional funds to meet the cost of the student’s education. These loans are not based on financial need, nor are they subsidized. These loans incur interest from the time funds are disbursed, but actual principal and interest payments may be deferred until a student no longer attends school on at least a half-time basis. Graduate students and parents may borrow funds up to the cost of attendance, which includes allowances for tuition, fees, and living expenses. Both Direct Grad PLUS and Direct Parent PLUS Loans are subject to credit approval, which generally requires the borrower to be free of any current adverse credit conditions. A co-borrower may be used to meet the credit requirements.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Federal Work-study. Chamberlain participates in this program, which offers work opportunities, both on or off campus, on a part-time basis to students who demonstrate financial need. Federal Work-study wages are paid partly from federal funds and partly from qualified employer funds.
State Financial Aid Programs
Certain states, including Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, and Vermont, offer state grant or loan assistance to eligible undergraduate students attending Adtalem institutions.
Canadian Government Financial Aid Programs
Canadian citizens or permanent residents of Canada (other than students from the Northwest Territories, Nunavet, or Quebec) are eligible for loans under the Canada Student Loans Program, which is financed by the Canadian government. Eligibility and amount of funding vary by province. Students attending Chamberlain online while in the U.S., or attending AUC, RUSM, or RUSVM, may be eligible for the Canada Student Loan Program. The loans are interest-free while the student is in school, and repayment begins six months after the student leaves school. Qualified students also may benefit from Canada Study Grants (designed for students whose financial needs and special circumstances cannot otherwise be met), tax-free withdrawals from retirement savings plans, tax-free education savings plans, loan repayment extensions, and interest relief on loans.

Information about Other Financial Aid Programs
Private Loan Programs
Some Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM students rely on private (non-federal) loan programs borrowed from private lenders for financial assistance. These programs are used to finance the gap between a student’s educational and living costs and their financial aid awards. The amount of the typical loan varies significantly according to the student’s enrollment and financial aid awards.
Most private loans are approved using the student’s or a co-borrower’s credit history. The cost of these loans varies, but in almost all cases will be more expensive than the federal programs. The application process is separate from the federal financial aid process. Student finance personnel at Adtalem’s degree-granting institutions coordinate these processes so that students generally receive assistance from the federal and state programs before utilizing private loans.
Adtalem does not maintain a preferred lender list, but does list all of the lenders that it is aware of that made private loans to Adtalem students in the previous year and still offer loans to Adtalem students.
Tax-Favored Programs
The U.S. has a number of tax-favored programs aimed at promoting savings for future college expenses. These include state-sponsored “529” college savings plans, state-sponsored prepaid tuition plans, education savings accounts (formerly known as education IRAs), custodial accounts for minors, Hope and Lifetime Learning tax credits, and tax deductions for interest on student loans.
Adtalem-Provided Financial Assistance
Each of our institutions offer a variety of scholarships to assist with tuition and fee expenses, some of which are one-time awards while others are renewable. Some students may also qualify for more than one scholarship at a time.
Chamberlain students are eligible for numerous institutional scholarships with awards up to $2,500 per semester.
Students at AUC may be eligible for an institutional scholarship, ranging from $5,000 to $80,000 to cover expenses incurred from tuition and fees. Students at RUSM may be eligible for various institutional scholarships, ranging from $5,000 to $108,000, to cover expenses incurred from housing, tuition and fees. Students at RUSVM may be eligible for an institutional scholarship, ranging from $2,000 to $27,123 to cover expenses incurred from tuition and fees.
Adtalem’s credit extension programs are available to students at Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM. These credit extension programs are designed to assist students who are unable to completely cover educational costs consisting of tuition, books, and fees, and are available only after all other student financial assistance has been applied toward those purposes. In addition, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM allow students to finance their living expenses. Repayment plans for financing agreements are developed to address the financial circumstances of the particular student. Interest charges at rates from 3.0% to 12.0% per annum accrue each month on the unpaid balance once a student withdraws or graduates from a program. Most students are required to begin repaying their loans while they are still in school with a minimum payment level designed to demonstrate their capability to repay, which reduces the possibility of over borrowing. Payments may increase upon completing or departing school. After a student leaves school, the student typically will have a monthly installment repayment plan.
The finance agreements do not impose any origination fees, in general have a fixed rate of interest, and most carry annual and aggregate maximums that ensure that they are only a supplemental source of funding and not relied on as the main source. Borrowers must be current in their payments in order to be eligible for subsequent disbursements. Borrowers are advised about the terms of the financing agreements and counseled to utilize all other available private and federal funding options before securing financing through the institution.
Adtalem financing agreements are carried on our balance sheet, net of related reserves, and there are no relationships with external parties that reduce Adtalem’s risk of collections.

15



Employer-Provided Tuition Assistance
Chamberlain students who receive employer tuition assistance may choose from several deferred tuition payment plans. Students eligible for tuition reimbursement plans may have their tuition billed directly to their employers or payment may be deferred until after the end of the session. Educational expenses paid by an employer on behalf of an employee generally are excludable from the employee’s income if provided under a qualified educational assistance plan. At present, the maximum annual exclusion is $5,250.
Becker
Students taking the Becker review courses are not eligible for federal or state financial aid, but many receive partial or full tuition reimbursement from their employers. Private loans are also available to students to help meet the program costs.
Legislative and Regulatory Requirements
Government-funded financial assistance programs are governed by extensive and complex regulations in the U.S. Like any other educational institution, Adtalem’s administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies and is subject to audit or investigation by other governmental authorities. Any violation could be the basis for penalties or other disciplinary action, including initiation of a suspension, limitation, or termination proceeding.
U.S. Federal Regulations
Our domestic postsecondary institutions are subject to extensive federal and state regulations. The HEA and the related ED regulations govern all higher education institutions participating in Title IV programs, and provide for a regulatory triad by mandating specific regulatory responsibilities for each of the following: (1) the federal government through ED, (2) the accrediting agencies recognized by ED, and (3) state higher education regulatory bodies.
To be eligible to participate in Title IV programs, a postsecondary institution must be accredited by an accrediting body recognized by ED, must comply with the HEA and all applicable regulations thereunder, and must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state in which the institution operates, as applicable.
In addition to governance by the regulatory triad, there has been increased focus by members of the U.S. Congress and federal agencies, including ED, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (“CFPB”), and the Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”), on the role that proprietary educational institutions play in higher education. We expect that this challenging regulatory environment will continue for the foreseeable future.
Changes in or new interpretations of applicable laws, rules, or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, accreditation, authorization to operate in various states, permissible activities, and operating costs. The failure to maintain or renew any required regulatory approvals, accreditation, or state authorizations could have a material adverse effect on us. ED regulations regarding financial responsibility provide that, if any one of our Title IV participating institutions (“Title IV Institutions”) is unable to pay its obligations under its program participation agreement as a result of operational issues and/or an enforcement action, our other Title IV Institutions, regardless of their compliance with applicable laws and regulations, would not be able to maintain their Title IV eligibility without assisting in the repayment of the non-compliant institution’s Title IV obligations. As a result, even though Adtalem’s Title IV Institutions are operated through independent entities, an enforcement action against one of our institutions could also have a material adverse effect on the businesses, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of Adtalem’s other Title IV Institutions and Adtalem as a whole and could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on the ability of Adtalem’s other Title IV Institutions and Adtalem as a whole to operate. For further information, see “A bankruptcy filing by us or by any of our Title IV Institutions, or a closure of one of our Title IV Institutions, would lead to an immediate loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs” under subsection “Risks Related to Adtalem’s Highly Regulated Industry” in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
We have summarized the most significant regulatory requirements applicable to our domestic postsecondary operations. Adtalem has been impacted by these regulations and enforcement efforts and is currently facing multiple related lawsuits arising from the enhanced scrutiny facing the proprietary education sector. For information regarding such pending 

16



investigations and litigation, and the potential impact such matters could have on our institutions or on Adtalem, see in this Annual Report on Form 10-K: (1) Note 20 “Commitments and Contingencies” to the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8. “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” (2) the subsection of Item 1A. “Risk Factors” titled “Risks Related to Adtalem’s Highly Regulated Industry,” and (3) the subsection of Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” titled “Regulatory Environment.”
Eligibility and Certification Procedures
The HEA specifies the manner in which ED reviews institutions for eligibility and certification to participate in Title IV programs. Every educational institution participating in the Title IV programs must be certified to participate and is required to periodically renew this certification. Institutions that violate certain ED Title IV regulations, including its financial responsibility and administrative capability regulations, may lose their eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or may only continue participation under provisional certification. Schools that do not meet financial responsibility requirements are required to submit a letter of credit equal to at least 10% of their prior fiscal year Title IV disbursements and submit to ED’s heightened cash monitoring process. Provisional certification status also carries fewer due process protections than full certification. As a result, ED may withdraw an institution’s provisional certification more easily than if it is fully certified. Provisional certification does not otherwise limit access to Title IV program funds by students attending the institution.
Defense to Repayment Regulations
Under the HEA, ED is authorized to specify in regulations, which acts or omissions of an institution of higher education a borrower may assert as a Defense to Repayment of a Direct Loan made under the Federal Direct Loan Program. On July 1, 2020, new Defense to Repayment regulations went into effect that include a higher threshold for establishing misrepresentation, provides for a statute of limitation for claims submission, narrows the current triggers allowed for letter of credit requirements, and eliminates provisions for group discharges. The new regulations are effective with claims on loans disbursed on or after July 1, 2020.
The “90/10 Rule”
An ED regulation known as the “90/10 Rule” affects only proprietary postsecondary institutions, such as Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM. Under this regulation, an institution that derives more than 90% of its revenue on a cash basis from Title IV student financial assistance programs in two consecutive fiscal years loses eligibility to participate in these programs for at least two fiscal years. The American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the “Rescue Act”) enacted on March 11, 2021 amended the 90/10 rule to require that a proprietary institution derive no more than 90% of its revenue from federal education assistance funds, including but not limited to previously excluded U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and military tuition assistance benefits. This change is subject to negotiated rulemaking, which will not begin prior to October 1, 2021. The amended rule will first apply to institutional fiscal years beginning on or after January 1, 2023. The following table details the percentage of revenue on a cash basis from federal financial assistance programs (excluding the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and military tuition assistance benefits) for each of Adtalem’s Title IV-eligible institutions for fiscal years 2020 and 2019. Final data for fiscal year 2021 is not yet available.

American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine | | 81 | % | 75 | %
Ross University School of Medicine | | 85 | % | 83 | %

In September 2016, Adtalem committed to voluntarily limit to 85% the amount of revenue that each of its Title IV-eligible institutions derive from federal funding, including the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and military tuition assistance benefits. As disclosed in the third-party review reports that have been made publicly available, Adtalem’s institutions have met this lower threshold for each fiscal year since the commitment was made. Adtalem is committed to implementing measures to promote responsible recruitment and enrollment, successful student outcomes, and informed student choice. Management believes students deserve greater transparency to make informed choices about their 

17



education. This commitment builds upon a solid foundation and brings Adtalem to a new self-imposed level of public accountability and transparency.
Incentive Compensation
An educational institution participating in Title IV programs may not pay any commission, bonus, or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment or awarding of Title IV program funds, if such payments are based directly or indirectly in any part on success in enrolling students or obtaining student financial aid. The law and regulations governing this requirement have not established clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances, but, prior to 2011, there were 12 safe harbors that defined specific types of compensation that were deemed to constitute permissible incentive compensation. New rules effective in 2011 eliminated the 12 safe harbors. These changes increased the uncertainty about what constitutes incentive compensation and which employees are covered by the regulation. This makes the development of effective and compliant performance metrics more difficult to establish. As such, these changes have limited and are expected to continue to limit Adtalem’s ability to compensate our employees based on their performance of their job responsibilities, which could make it more difficult to attract and retain highly-qualified employees. Management believes that Adtalem has not been, nor is currently, involved in any activities that violate the restrictions on commissions, bonuses, or other incentive payments to any person involved in student recruitment, admissions, or awarding of Title IV program funds.
Standards of Financial Responsibility
A financial responsibility test is required for continued participation by an institution’s students in U.S. federal financial assistance programs. For Adtalem’s participating institutions, this test is calculated at the consolidated Adtalem level. The test is based upon a composite score of three ratios: an equity ratio that measures the institution’s capital resources; a primary reserve ratio that measures an institution’s ability to fund its operations from current resources; and a net income ratio that measures an institution’s ability to operate profitably. A minimum score of 1.5 is necessary to meet ED’s financial standards. Institutions with scores of less than 1.5 but greater than or equal to 1.0 are considered financially responsible, but require additional oversight. These institutions are subject to heightened cash monitoring and other participation requirements. An institution with a score of less than 1.0 is considered not financially responsible. However, an institution with a score of less than 1.0 may continue to participate in the Title IV programs under provisional certification. In addition, this lower score typically requires that the institution be subject to heightened cash monitoring requirements and post a letter of credit (equal to a minimum of 10% of the Title IV aid it received in the institution's most recent fiscal year).
For the past several years, Adtalem’s composite score has exceeded the required minimum of 1.5. Changes to the manner in which the composite score is calculated that were effective on July 1, 2020 has negatively affected Adtalem’s composite score for fiscal year 2021 and will continue to negatively affect future Adtalem scores. At this time, management does not believe these changes by themselves will result in the score falling below 1.5. However, as a result of the acquisition of Walden and the related transactions, Adtalem expects its consolidated composite score to fall below 1.5 at its next financial responsibility test. If Adtalem becomes unable to meet requisite financial responsibility standards within the regulations, management believes it will be able to otherwise demonstrate its ability to continue to provide educational services; however, our institutions could still be subject to heightened cash monitoring or be required to post a letter of credit to continue to participate in federal and state financial assistance programs.
Administrative Capability
The HEA directs ED to assess the administrative capability of each institution to participate in Title IV programs. The failure of an institution to satisfy any of the criteria used to assess administrative capability may cause ED to determine that the institution lacks administrative capability and, therefore, subject the institution to additional scrutiny or deny its eligibility for Title IV programs.
State Authorization
Institutions that participate in Title IV programs must be authorized to operate by the appropriate postsecondary regulatory authority in each state where the institution has a physical presence. Chamberlain is specifically authorized to operate in all of the domestic jurisdictions that require such authorizations. Some states assert authority to regulate all 

18



degree-granting institutions if their educational programs are available to their residents, whether or not the institutions maintain a physical presence within those states. Chamberlain has obtained licensure in states which require such licensure and where their students are enrolled and is an institutional participant in the National Council for State Authorization Reciprocity Agreements (“NC-SARA”) initiative.
On December 19, 2016, ED published new rules concerning requirements for institutional eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. These regulations, which would have become effective beginning July 1, 2018, but were delayed until July 1, 2020, were subsequently renegotiated as part of the 2018-2019 Accreditation and Innovation rule-making sessions. The renegotiated rule went into effect on July 1, 2020 and requires an institution offering distance education or correspondence courses to be authorized by each state from which the institution enrolls students, if such authorization is required by the state. If an institution offers postsecondary education through distance education or correspondence courses in a state that participates in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, and the institution offering the program is located in a state where it is also covered by such an agreement, the institution would be considered legally authorized to offer postsecondary distance or correspondence education in the state where courses are offered via distance education, subject to any limitations in that agreement. The regulations also require an institution to document the state processes for resolving complaints from students enrolled in programs offered through distance education or correspondence courses. Lastly, the regulations require that an institution provide certain disclosures to enrolled and prospective students regarding its programs that lead to professional licensure.
Cohort Default Rates
ED has instituted strict regulations that penalize institutions whose students have high default rates on federal student loans. Depending on the type of loan, a loan is considered in default after the borrower becomes at least 270 or 360 days past due. For a variety of reasons, higher default rates are often found in private-sector institutions and community colleges, many of which tend to have a higher percentage of low-income students enrolled compared to four-year publicly supported and independent colleges and universities.
Educational institutions are penalized to varying degrees under the Federal Direct Student Loan Program, depending on the default rate for the “cohort” defined in the statute. An institution with a cohort default rate that exceeds 20% for the year is required to develop a plan to reduce defaults, but the institution’s operations and its students’ ability to utilize student loans are not restricted. An institution with a cohort default rate of 30% or more for three consecutive years is ineligible to participate in these loan programs and cannot offer student loans administered by ED for the fiscal year in which the ineligibility determination is made and for the next two fiscal years. Students attending an institution whose cohort default rate has exceeded 30% for three consecutive years are also ineligible for Federal Pell Grants. Any institution with a cohort default rate of 40% or more in any year is subject to immediate limitation, suspension, or termination proceedings from all federal aid programs.
According to ED, the three-year cohort default rate for all colleges and universities eligible for federal financial aid was 9.7% in fiscal year 2017 (the latest period for which data are available) and 10.1% in fiscal year 2016.
The latest period for which final three-year data is available is fiscal year 2017. Default rates for Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, and RUSVM students are as follows:

​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​ | ​
--------------------------------------------------------+---+---------------------+---+------+--
​ | ​ | Cohort Default Rate | 
​ | ​ | 2017 | ​ | 2016 | 
Chamberlain University | ​ | 3.4 | % | 3.5 | %
American University of the Caribbean School of Medicine | ​ | 1.4 | % | 0.7 | %
Ross University School of Medicine | ​ | 1.3 | % | 1.1 | %
Ross University School of Veterinary Medicine | ​ | 0.9 | % | 1.2 | %

Satisfactory Academic Progress
In addition to the requirements that educational institutions must meet, student recipients of financial aid must maintain satisfactory academic progress toward completion of their program of study and an appropriate grade point average.

Change of Ownership or Control
Any material change of ownership or change of control of Adtalem, depending on the type of change, may have significant regulatory consequences for each of our Title IV Institutions. Such a change of ownership or control could require recertification by ED, the reevaluation of accreditation by each institution’s accreditors and/or reauthorization by each institutions’ state licensing agencies. If Adtalem experiences a material change of ownership or change of control, then our Title IV Institutions may cease to be eligible to participate in Title IV programs until recertified by ED. There is no assurance that such recertification would be obtained on a timely basis. After a material change in ownership or change of control, most institutions will participate in Title IV programs on a provisional basis for a period of one to three years.
In addition, each Title IV Institution is required to report any material change in stock ownership to its principal institutional accrediting body and would generally be required to obtain approval prior to undergoing any transaction that affects, or may affect, its corporate control or governance. In the event of any such change, each of our institution’s accreditors may undertake an evaluation of the effect of the change on the continuing operations of our institution for purposes of determining if continued accreditation is appropriate, which evaluation may include a comprehensive review.
In addition, some states in which our Title IV Institutions are licensed require approval (in some cases, advance approval) of changes in ownership or control in order to remain authorized to operate in those states, and participation in grant programs in some states may be interrupted or otherwise affected by a change in ownership or control.
Refer to the risk factor titled “If regulators do not approve, or delay their approval, of transactions involving a material change of ownership or change of control of Adtalem, the eligibility of our institutions to participate in Title IV programs, our institutions’ accreditation and our institutions’ state licenses may be impaired in a manner that materially and adversely affects our business” under subsection “Risks Related to Adtalem’s Highly Regulated Industry” in Item 1A. “Risk Factors.”
State Approvals and Licensing
Adtalem institutions require authorizations from many state higher education authorities to recruit students, operate schools, conduct exam preparation courses, and grant degrees. Generally, the addition of any new program of study or new operating location also requires approval by the appropriate licensing and regulatory agencies. In the U.S., each Chamberlain location is approved to grant degrees by the respective state in which it is located. Additionally, many states require approval for out-of-state institutions to recruit within their state or offer instruction through online modalities to residents of their states. Adtalem believes its institutions are in compliance with all state requirements as an out-of-state institution. AUC and RUSM clinical programs are accredited as part of their programs of medical education by their respective accrediting bodies, approved by the appropriate boards in those states that have a formal process to do so, and are reported to ED as required.
Many states require private-sector postsecondary education institutions to post surety bonds for licensure. In the U.S., Adtalem has posted approximately $8.9 million of surety bonds with regulatory authorities on behalf of Chamberlain, AUC, RUSM, RUSVM, Becker, and OCL.
Certain states have set standards of financial responsibility that differ from those prescribed by federal regulation. Adtalem believes its institutions are in compliance with state and Canadian provincial regulations. If Adtalem were unable to meet the tests of financial responsibility for a specific jurisdiction, and could not otherwise demonstrate financial responsibility, Adtalem could be required to cease operations in that state. To date, Adtalem has successfully demonstrated its financial responsibility where required.
Seasonality
The seasonal pattern of Adtalem’s enrollments and its educational programs’ starting dates affect the results of operations and timing of cash flows.

Adtalem also utilizes approximately 2,500 independent contractors who teach as adjunct faculty and instructors. These independent contractors are not included in the above table. Our management believes that Adtalem has good relations with its employees.
We regularly gather feedback from our employees through our Engagement Survey to gain insight into how our employees perceive their work environment, the resources to do their job, the quality of communications within and across teams, and their commitment to the organization. Engagement is a part of our culture. We want to understand what is working well and where we have areas for improvement.
Two important measures that we examine through the Engagement Survey are Engagement and Enablement. Engagement is the “want to” of work, or more specifically, whether employees are committed to the organization and if they are willing to put in extra effort for the good of the organization. Enablement is the “can do” of work, meaning employee skills and abilities are fully utilized in their roles and whether the organizational environment supports them in getting their work done. Where global benchmarks are available, we are typically 5-10% above the benchmark for overall Engagement and Enablement, illustrating our strong focus on the employee experience and eye towards continuous improvement.
Over the last year, we have added dimensions to our Engagement Survey to gather feedback on our response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the comfort level of our employees to return to the workplace. This feedback was invaluable when developing a thoughtful approach for returning to the workplace across all office locations. Selected results from our Engagement Surveys were as follows:

Diversity and inclusion are core tenets of our culture at Adtalem. Not only do we focus on ensuring a diverse workforce through our Talent First agenda, our leadership team participates in initiatives that further the advancement of historically 

21



under-represented groups in society. We have been highly intentional with our practices, programs, and policies to ensure that women and people of color are getting equitable access and experience to opportunities that can better position them for career growth. By doing this, we believe that we can strengthen our ability to better serve our students, members, and employer partners, as well as make a greater social and economic impact in our global communities. One important program around this initiative is Adtalem EDGE, which stands for Empowerment, Diversity, Growth, and Excellence. Adtalem EDGE is a network of leadership scholars and professionals that promotes the enhanced career experience and advancement of women in leadership roles, while also fostering a culture of diversity and overall inclusiveness at Adtalem and in the community. This mission is supported by providing educational resources, professional development and networking, and affording leadership opportunities that facilitates career advancement.
We continuously measure representation amongst our employee population and also make it a focus in our aforementioned Engagement Survey to ensure there are no significant differences amongst groups in terms of engagement, enablement, and our employee’s view of their psychological safety within our organization.
As of June 30, 2021, our employee diversity was as follows:
