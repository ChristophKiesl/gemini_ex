Segments
 In prior years, and in 2021 prior to the fourth quarter, the Company reported its results in one segment. This included operating segments for each of North America and Europe. The services the Company provided, regardless of geography or industry, were similar in nature and produced similar results. Additionally, the CEO, who is the Company’s chief operating decision maker, made decisions on investments and allocated resources at the North America or Europe level. Accordingly, given the consistency in the services provided and the results, the Company aggregated those results into one reporting segment.
 During the 2021 fourth quarter, the Company further refined its strategy around providing digital services within its IT solutions business in both North America and Europe. As part of this process, the Company also determined that there are certain accounts that are no longer part of the Company’s long-term business plan. Accordingly, the Company is operating and reporting in three segments within its business; North America IT Solutions and Services, Europe IT Solutions and Services, and Non-Strategic Technology Services.

CTG’s revenue by segment for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:
 
 
(amounts in thousands) | 2021 | | 2020 | | | 2019
----------------------------------------+------+---------+------+---+---------+-----
North America IT Solutions and Services | $ | 101,506 | | $ | 67,948 | | $ | 74,123 
Europe IT Solutions and Services | | 169,341 | | | 154,847 | | | 148,108
Non-Strategic Technology Services | | 121,438 | | | 143,296 | | | 171,939
Total | $ | 392,285 | | $ | 366,091 | | $ | 394,170

 
Overall, the Company’s revenue increased from the prior year as demand for the Company’s IT Solutions and Services was strong, and the impact from the global COVID-19 pandemic (“Pandemic”) on demand for the Company’s services was lower in 2021 as compared with 2020. 
 IT Solutions and Services (North America and Europe)
 Consistent with its long-term strategy, the Company invested in recent years in business development, solutions, delivery, recruiting and marketing resources to drive its IT Solutions and Services. IT Solutions and Services include the activities described under “IT Solutions and Services” and “Capabilities” above. In North America, IT Solutions and Services revenue increased 49.4% in 2021 from 2020, while the increase in revenue was 9.4% in Europe over that same time period. The increases were mainly the result of strong demand for the Company’s services, and as a direct result of the business development investments that had previously been made. In 2020, as compared with 2019, North American IT Solutions and Services revenue decreased 8.3%, while Europe increased 4.6% over that same time period. The North American decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in demand resulting from the impact the COVID-19 pandemic had on the North American IT solutions and services market. 
Non-Strategic Technology Services
 Consistent with its long-term strategy, the Company is not investing in low margin Non-Strategic Technology Services, and as these contracts expire, is often electing to disengage from the project. This segment only consists of lower margin IT staffing and related services in North America and Europe as described in “Staffing” above. The revenue in this segment decreased 15.3% in 2021 as compared to 2020, and 16.7% in 2020 as compared to 2019.
Vertical Markets
 The Company provides a majority of its services through five vertical market focus areas: technology service providers, healthcare (which includes services provided to healthcare providers, health insurers (payers), and life sciences companies), financial services, manufacturing, and energy. The remainder of CTG’s revenue is derived from general markets.
 CTG’s revenue by vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was as follows:
 
 
 | 2021 | | | 2020 | | 2019
-----------------------------+------+-------+---+------+-------+-----
Technology service providers | | 26.7 | % | | 31.3 | % | 32.2 | %
Healthcare | | 21.6 | % | | 14.9 | % | 16.6 | %
Financial services | | 16.2 | % | | 15.8 | % | 13.8 | %
Manufacturing | | 11.7 | % | | 13.5 | % | 16.8 | %
Energy | | 5.1 | % | | 6.2 | % | 5.2 | %
General markets | | 18.7 | % | | 18.3 | % | 15.4 | %
Total | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

Technology Service Providers
 Demand from our largest Non-Strategic Technology Services client, IBM, which is included in this vertical market, decreased in both 2021 and 2020. The revenue as a percentage of consolidated revenue decreased in 2021 as compared with previous years due to a change in business mix as the Company focused on driving its IT Solutions and Services, which are not included in this vertical market. Revenue for the Company's technology service providers vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased slightly in 2020 as compared with 2019 mainly due to a reduction in demand in other vertical markets at a higher rate than this vertical market.
 6

Healthcare
 In 2021, the overall demand from our healthcare clients increased as a result of a large training, implementation, and support engagement for a health system in North America completed in the fourth quarter. In contrast, consolidated revenue for the Company’s healthcare vertical market decreased in 2020 as compared to 2019 as a significant project in this vertical market was essentially complete by the end of 2019 and was not replaced in 2020, and due to lower demand for this vertical market as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Financial Services
 Revenue for the Company’s financial services vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased in 2021 as compared with 2020 due to strong demand from several clients for project related work in the North America IT Solutions and Services segment. Revenue for the Company’s financial services vertical market as a percentage of consolidated revenue increased in 2020 as compared to 2019 due to acquisitions completed by the Company in 2019 and 2020. 
Manufacturing
 The consolidated revenue in our manufacturing vertical market is primarily generated from several large Non-Strategic Technology Services clients, including Lenovo (through SDI International as a vendor manager for Lenovo), which is one of our largest clients. Revenue from Lenovo and other large clients decreased in 2021 as compared with 2020, and in 2020 as compared with 2019, as the demand for these services decreased in recent years. Additionally, the Company continues to disengage from its lowest margin Non-Strategic Technology Services business, which is generally included in this vertical market. 
Energy
 Revenue for the Company's energy vertical market decreased as a percentage of consolidated revenue in 2021, but increased in 2020 given strong demand at that time for our services in this vertical market.
 For the year ended December 31, 2021, CTG provided its services to 676 clients, primarily in North America and Europe. In North America, the Company operates in the United States and Canada, with about 99% of 2021 North American revenue generated in the United States. In Europe, the Company operates in Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom. Of total 2021 consolidated revenue of $392.3 million, approximately 55.7% was generated in North America and 44.3% in Europe. Revenue generated in India and Colombia was insignificant. One client, IBM, accounted for greater than 10% of CTG’s consolidated revenue in 2021.
Revenue Recognition and Backlog
 The Company recognizes revenue when control of the promised good or service is transferred to clients, in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. For time-and-material contracts, revenue is recognized as hours are incurred and costs are expended. For contracts with progress billing schedules, primarily monthly, revenue is recognized as services are rendered to the client. Revenue for fixed-price contracts is recognized over time using an input-based approach. Over time revenue recognition best portrays the Company’s performance in transferring control of the goods or services to the client. On most fixed-price contracts, revenue recognition is supported through contractual clauses that require the client to pay for work performed to date, including cost plus a reasonable profit margin, for goods or services that have no alternative use to the Company. On certain contracts, revenue recognition is supported through contractual clauses that indicate the client controls the asset, or work in process, as the Company creates or enhances the asset. On a given project, actual salary and indirect labor costs incurred are measured and compared with the total estimate of costs of such items at the completion of the project. Revenue is recognized based upon the percentage-of-completion calculation of total incurred costs to total estimated costs. The Company infrequently works on fixed-price projects that include significant amounts of material or other non-labor related costs that could distort the percent complete within a percentage-of-completion calculation. The Company’s estimate of the total labor costs it expects to incur over the term of the contract is based on the nature of the project and our experience on similar projects, and includes management judgments and estimates that affect the amount of revenue recognized on fixed-price contracts in any accounting period. Losses on fixed-price projects are recorded when identified.

The Company’s revenue from contracts accounted for under time-and-material, progress billing, and percentage-of-completion methods as a percentage of consolidated revenue for the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was as follows:
 
 
 | 2021 | | | 2020 | | 2019
-------------------------+------+-------+---+------+-------+-----
Time-and-material | | 79.8 | % | | 81.0 | % | 79.6 | %
Progress billing | | 17.8 | % | | 15.9 | % | 10.2 | %
Percentage-of-completion | | 2.4 | % | | 3.1 | % | 10.2 | %
Total | | 100.0 | % | | 100.0 | % | 100.0 | %

 
As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the backlog for fixed-price and all managed-support contracts was approximately $68.5 million and $50.9 million, respectively. Approximately 58% or $39.9 million of the December 31, 2021 backlog is expected to be earned in 2022. Approximately 65% of the $50.9 million of backlog at December 31, 2020, or $33.1 million, was earned in 2021. Revenue is subject to slight seasonal variations, with a minor slowdown and a decrease in billable resource utilization in months of high vacation and legal holidays (July, August, and December). Backlog does not tend to be seasonal; however, it does fluctuate based upon the timing of entry into long-term contracts.
 Competition
 The IT services market, for both information and technology solutions and IT and professional staffing services, is highly competitive. The market is also highly fragmented with many providers and no single competitor maintaining clear market leadership. Competition varies by location, the type of service, and the client to whom services are provided. The Company’s competition comes from four major channels: large national or international companies, including major accounting and consulting firms and large companies headquartered in India; hardware vendors and suppliers of packaged software systems; small local firms or individuals specializing in specific programming services or applications; and from a client’s internal IT staff. CTG competes against all four of these channels for its share of the market. The Company believes that to compete successfully, it is necessary to have a local geographic presence, offer appropriate IT solutions, provide skilled professional resources, and price its services competitively.
Intellectual Property
 The Company has registered its symbol and logo with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and has taken steps to preserve its rights in other countries where it operates. We regard patents, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property as important to our success, and we rely on them in the United States and foreign countries to protect our investments in products and technology. Our patents expire at various times, but we believe that the loss or expiration of any individual patent would not materially affect our business. We, like any other company, may be subject to claims of alleged infringement of the patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties from time to time in the ordinary course of business. CTG has entered into agreements with various software and hardware vendors from time to time in the normal course of business, and has capitalized certain costs under software development projects.
Human Capital Resources
 Employees
 CTG’s business depends on the Company’s ability to attract, develop and retain qualified professional staff to execute our strategy and provide services to its clients. The Company has a structured recruiting organization that works with its clients to meet their requirements by recruiting, retaining, and providing high quality, motivated staff. As the Company works with a number of subcontractors, the Company includes subcontractors in its total headcount, which equals approximately 3,450 total resources worldwide, with approximately 1,950 in the United States and Canada and 1,500 in Europe, as of December 31, 2021. Of these resources, approximately 90% are IT professionals and 10% are individuals who work in sales, recruiting, delivery, administrative and support positions. The Company believes that its relationship with its employees is good and supported by the Company’s 2021 recognition as a Great Place to Work® in all countries in which we operate. No employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement or are represented by a labor union. CTG is an equal opportunity employer.
 In 2021, we focused on adding additional staff with IT Solutions backgrounds in both North America and Europe to drive our IT Solutions and Services segments in line with our business strategy. Employees are encouraged to learn and grow their careers, by using our internal learning tools to complete classes or reach certifications, externally through 
 8

classes primarily to achieve certifications, or through external classes paid for in part or in full through a tuition reimbursement program.
 COVID-19 Response
 The health, well-being and safety of our employees, clients and communities is our top priority. COVID-19 became a potentially significant issue during the first quarter of 2020 as we followed global developments and observed the impacts of COVID-19 in North America, Western Europe, and other regions where we operate. Our senior management team initiated regular COVID-19 planning sessions to address the critical safety, operational and business risks associated with the Pandemic. With our continued commitment to monitor, assess and implement guidance and best practices for the Company as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), we have been able to maintain the continuity of the essential services that we provide to our clients, while also managing the impact of the spread of the virus within our business, as well as promoting the health, well-being and safety of our employees, clients and communities. 
Social Responsibility
 Our social responsibility principles inform the way we work. CTG is committed to the highest standards in our labor practices, the health and safety of our employees, and business ethics.
 CTG has business operations in North America, Western Europe, India and Colombia, all regions with strict labor laws regarding human rights. We have internal policies intended to ensure our compliance with these laws, and we will not knowingly conduct business with anyone who violates these laws or basic human rights. We are committed to adhering to the Fair Labor Standards Act (“FLSA”), local labor laws, and prevailing wage rates. CTG prohibits any form of workplace or sexual harassment, and all employees are required to work in a manner that prevents harassment in the workplace. This policy is one component of CTG’s commitment to a discrimination-free work environment.
 None of CTG’s leased office space is subject to industrial hazards and all adhere to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) office standards. We will not knowingly transact business with, or place our team members at, companies that do not enforce appropriate workplace safety and health standards.
 Our Code of Business Conduct serves as our baseline for business ethics, and all employees are required to adhere to these guidelines. We are committed to providing clients with high-quality services that conform to mutually agreed-upon requirements and maintain certifications that support our Quality Policy, including 9001:2015 certification for our European operations. 
 CTG Luxembourg PSF holds the “Entreprise Socialement Responsable” (Socially Responsible Enterprise) label that is awarded by the INDR Luxembourg (Institut National pour le Développement Durable et la Responsabilité Sociale des Entreprises), an organization that aims to promote responsible business practices in Luxembourg.
 Our whistleblower hotline ensures that there is a confidential way to report any concerns with CTG business practices. Specific to CTG Luxembourg, PSF S.A., we have complaint handling (traitement des réclamations) processes for clients, in accordance with CSSF’s Regulation 16-07 and Circular 17/671.
 Environmental Responsibility
 CTG maintains a relatively small carbon/environmental footprint. As a professional services provider, much of our focus is on the individual behavior of our team members and the decisions we make in managing our office spaces. Our environmental strategy has three areas of focus:
Personal Initiative
 Many of our improvements come from our employee's environmentally conscious efforts. CTG supports these efforts by:
  
• | Maintaining policies and initiatives to reduce our carbon/environmental footprint and tracking results
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Providing flexible and remote-working opportunities to reduce emissions
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Supporting environment-focused programs, such as Earth Day
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


• | Raising awareness of environmentally sound practices through policy manuals, in-house publications, and websites

Corporate Stewardship
 We are conscious of our impact on the communities our teams call home. Over the years, we have made significant improvements that support reducing the carbon/environmental footprint of our North American corporate headquarters, located in Buffalo, New York.
