Overview 
Arlo Technologies, Inc. (“we”, “Arlo” or the “Company”) combines an intelligent cloud infrastructure and mobile app with a variety of smart connected devices that is transforming the way people experience the connected lifestyle. Arlo’s deep expertise in product design, wireless connectivity, cloud infrastructure and cutting-edge AI capabilities focuses on delivering a seamless, smart home experience for Arlo users that is easy to setup and interact with every day. Our cloud-based platform provides users with visibility, insight and a powerful means to help protect and connect in real-time with the people and things that matter most, from any location with a Wi-Fi or a cellular connection. To date, we have launched several categories of award-winning smart connected devices, including wired and wire-free smart Wi-Fi and LTE-enabled cameras, audio and video doorbells, and floodlight cameras. In addition, Arlo’s broad compatibility allows the platform to seamlessly integrate with third-party internet-of-things (“IoT”) products and protocols, such as Amazon Alexa, Apple HomeKit, Apple TV, Google Assistant, IFTTT, Stringify and Samsung SmartThings. Since the launch of our first product in December 2014, we have shipped over 19.2 million smart connected devices, and, as of December 31, 2020, our smart platform had approximately 5.0 million cumulative registered accounts across more than 100 countries around the world. We plan to continue to introduce new smart connected devices to the Arlo platform both in cameras and new categories, increase the number of registered accounts on our platform, keep them highly engaged through our mobile app and generate incremental recurring revenue by offering them paid subscription services. 
On February 6, 2018, NETGEAR, Inc. (“NETGEAR”) announced that its board of directors had unanimously approved the pursuit of a separation of its Arlo business from NETGEAR (the “Separation”) to be effected through an initial public offering (the “IPO”) of newly issued shares of the common stock of Arlo, then a wholly owned subsidiary of NETGEAR. On July 6, 2018, the Company filed a registration statement (as amended, the "IPO Registration Statement") relating to the IPO of common stock of Arlo with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC"). Following a series of restructuring steps prior to the completion of the IPO of Arlo common stock, the Arlo business was transferred from NETGEAR to Arlo (collectively, the " Contribution").
On August 2, 2018, NETGEAR and Arlo announced the pricing of the IPO of 10,215,000 shares of Arlo’s common stock at a price to the public of $16.00 per share. On August 3, 2018, Arlo’s shares began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “ARLO.” On August 7, 2018, the Company completed its IPO of 11,747,250 shares of common stock (including 1,532,250 shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares, which was exercised in full on August 3, 2018), at $16.00 per share, before underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs. Cash proceeds from the IPO were $173.4 million, net of the portion of the offering cost paid by Arlo, which portion was $1.4 million. The total offering cost was $4.6 million, of which $3.2 million was paid by NETGEAR. 
Prior to the completion of the IPO, the Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of NETGEAR and upon the closing of the IPO (including the issuance of additional shares of common stock pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares, which was exercised in full) on August 7, 2018, NETGEAR owned approximately 84.2% of the shares of Arlo’s outstanding common stock.
On November 29, 2018, NETGEAR announced that its board of directors had approved a special stock dividend (the “Distribution”) to NETGEAR stockholders of the 62,500,000 shares of Arlo common stock owned by NETGEAR. 
The Distribution was made on December 31, 2018 (the "Distribution Date") to all NETGEAR stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 17, 2018 (the "Record Date"). In the Distribution, each NETGEAR stockholder of record on the Record Date received 1.980295 shares of Arlo common stock for every share of NETGEAR common stock held on the Record Date, subject to cash in lieu of fractional shares. The Distribution was intended to qualify as generally tax free to NETGEAR stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes. In connection with the Distribution, 62,500,000 shares of Arlo common stock held by NETGEAR were distributed to its stockholders and NETGEAR is no longer considered a related party to the Company.

In addition, some of our older camera products come with a prepaid service that provides users with rolling seven-day cloud video storage, the ability to connect up to five cameras and 90 days of customer support.
In January 2020, we launched Arlo SmartCloud, a SaaS solution to deliver scalable security cloud services for business. Its comprehensive offering includes computer vision, multi-object detection, audio analysis, security services, scaled storage and numerous ecosystem integrations. Arlo SmartCloud is a fully managed robust global platform of capabilities built for security, scalability, and reliability that can be deployed as part of advanced subscription services for hardware companies, automotive companies, service providers, insurance companies, home builders, smart communities, smart cities, traditional security companies, and other related verticals.
Our services also include certain development services provided to Verisure S.à.r.l. under a Non-recurring Engineering arrangement as part of the disposal of our commercial operations in Europe in the fourth quarter of 2019. Refer to the "Agreements with Verisure" section below for details.
Sales Channels 
We sell our products through multiple sales channels worldwide, including traditional and online retailers, wholesale distributors, broadcast channels, wireless carriers and security solution providers. 
Retailers. We sell to traditional and online retailers, either directly or through wholesale distributors. We work directly with our retail channels on market development activities, such as co-advertising, including digital and traditional media, online promotions and video demonstrations, instant rebate programs, event sponsorship and sales associate training.

Agreements with Verisure S.à.r.l.
On November 4, 2019, we concurrently entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”) and Supply Agreement (the “Supply Agreement” and together with the Purchase Agreement, the “Verisure Agreements”) with Verisure S.à.r.l. ("Verisure"). Verisure is a leading European provider of professionally monitored security systems with 24/7 response services to both residential and small business customers. The Verisure Agreements created a strategic partnership that leverages both the Company and Verisure’s capabilities to create incremental scale to address the ever-growing demand for residential and commercial security. The strategic partnership will combine our innovative connected cameras and cloud services platform with Verisure’s professionally monitored security solutions to provide a new level of smart security for European customers. The transactions contemplated by the Verisure Agreements closed on December 30, 2019.
The Purchase Agreement provided that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Purchase Agreement, we transferred, sold and assigned to Verisure certain assets (the "Assets") related to our commercial operations in Europe (the "Business") to Verisure for $50.0 million in cash plus additional cash for certain inventory. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties regarding Verisure, the Business and the Assets, indemnification provisions, termination rights and other customary provisions. Further, we agreed not to engage in any business that competes with the Business for a period of three years. 
The Supply Agreement provides that, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the Supply Agreement, Verisure will become the exclusive distributor of our products in Europe for all channels, and will non-exclusively distribute our products through its direct channels globally in connection with Verisure’s security business. During the five-year period commencing January 1, 2020, Verisure has an aggregate purchase commitment of $500.0 million. As of December 31, 2020, $47.3 million of the purchase commitment has been fulfilled. On December 30, 2019, Verisure prepaid $20.0 million for product purchases in fiscal 2020 and on December 21, 2020, Verisure prepaid $40.0 million for product purchases in fiscal 2021 and fiscal 2022.
The Supply Agreement also provides for certain development services to Verisure under the Non-recurring Engineering ("NRE") arrangement, including development of certain custom products specified by Verisure, in exchange for an aggregate of $10.0 million, payable in installments upon meeting certain development milestones. In the second fiscal quarter of 2020, an additional $3.5 million was added to the contract price as a result of a modification to Verisure's specification for the Outdoor Custom Camera.
As part of the Purchase Agreement, we also entered into a Transition Services Agreement with Verisure ("Verisure TSA") to assist Verisure with the transition of the Company’s European commercial operations. These transition services primarily include IT support and other services, including sales and marketing, operations and supply chain, finance, legal, and human resources. As compensation for these transition services, we will be reimbursed by Verisure based on actual direct costs plus allocation of overhead.
Competition 
We believe we are well-positioned to compete within the broader connected lifestyle market, both within and beyond the home as we continue to launch new product lines and services within our smart platform. However, our market is highly competitive and evolving, and we expect competition to increase in the future. We believe the principal competitive factors impacting the market for our products include price, service offerings, functionality, brand, technology, design, distribution channels and customer service. 
We believe that we compete favorably in these areas on the basis of our market leadership position in the U.S. consumer network connected camera systems market, best-in-class technology, direct relationship with users and user engagement, trusted Arlo platform, strong Arlo brand and channel partners and deep strategic partnerships with key suppliers, such as Cypress Semiconductor Co., OmniVision Technologies Inc. and Qualcomm Incorporated. Moreover, our focus on building a connected lifestyle platform, combined with our leadership in innovation in the consumer network connected camera systems market, has led to the strength of our Arlo brand worldwide. We believe this focus allows us to compete favorably with companies that have introduced or have announced plans to introduce devices with connected lifestyle functionalities. Nevertheless, the connected lifestyle market remains highly competitive, and has a multitude of participants, including: large global technology companies, such as Amazon (Ring and Blink) and Google (Nest); security service vendors, such as ADT; telecom service providers, such as AT&T and Comcast; and smaller point product companies. 
Many of our existing and potential competitors have longer operating histories, greater name recognition and substantially greater financial, technical, sales, marketing and other resources than we do. We anticipate that current and potential competitors will also intensify their efforts to penetrate our target markets. For additional information, see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-Some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do, and to be competitive we may be required to lower our prices or increase our sales and marketing expenses, which could result in reduced margins and loss of market share.” 
Research and Development 
We are passionate about developing new and innovative products and services that enable the connected lifestyle. Our research and development team collaborates with our product team to design and build differentiated new products and improve upon our existing products and services. Our goal is to create unique user experiences within the connected lifestyle. For example, our original Arlo camera was the world’s first commercially available 100% battery-operated Wi-Fi security camera with 720p HD video, IP65-rated weather resistance and night vision. The groundbreaking nature of the product, first launched in December 2014, gathered critical acclaim and market success. Our research and development team has taken this same approach to all of our subsequent product releases, constantly innovating to stay ahead of the competition. 
As of December 31, 2020, our research and development staff consisted of 137 employees, located in our offices worldwide, and was comprised of front-end and back-end software engineers, RF engineers, electrical engineers, mechanical engineers, system test engineers, computer vision scientists and data analysis engineers, UX and industrial design engineers and mobile app developers. We intend to continue to invest in research and development to expand our platform and capabilities in the future. 
Manufacturing
While all of our products are primarily designed in North America, we currently outsource manufacturing to Foxconn Cloud Network Technology Singapore Pte. Ltd., Pegatron Corporation, and Sky Light Industrial Ltd. , which are all headquartered in Asia. Although we do not have any long-term purchase contracts, we have executed master product supply agreements with these manufacturers, which typically provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement, epidemic failure clauses, agreed-upon price concessions, division of each party’s intellectual property and product quality requirements. Since we outsource our manufacturing, we have the flexibility and ability to adapt to market 
changes, product supply and component pricing while keeping our costs low. In addition to their responsibility for the manufacturing of our products, our manufacturers typically purchase all necessary parts and materials to produce finished goods. To maintain quality standards for our suppliers, we have established our own product quality organization based in Vietnam, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Indonesia, and mainland China, which is responsible for auditing and inspecting process and product quality on the premises of our manufacturers. Our strategic relationships with our manufacturers are an important component of our ability to introduce new products and grow our business.
We focus on driving alignment of our product roadmaps with our manufacturers and determining what we can do collectively to reduce costs across the supply chain. Our operations teams based in the United States, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Vietnam, Indonesia and mainland China coordinate with our manufacturers’ engineering, manufacturing and quality control personnel to develop the requisite manufacturing processes, quality checks and testing and general oversight of the manufacturing activities. We believe this model has enabled us to quickly and efficiently deliver high-quality and innovative products, while enabling us to minimize costs and manage inventory. 
Our products are manufactured and packaged for retail sale by our manufacturers mostly in Vietnam and Indonesia, with minimal manufacturers in China, and shipped to our logistics hubs located in the United States, Hong Kong and Australia. Our operations team coordinates with our manufacturers to ensure that the shipment of our products from the manufacturers to these logistics hubs meets customer demand. 
Marketing 
Our marketing programs are focused on building global brand awareness, increasing product adoption and driving sales. Our marketing efforts target individuals interested in a connected lifestyle and we believe our marketing programs allow us to attract and engage with customers efficiently and at scale. We also increase brand awareness by augmenting word-of-mouth recommendations from Arlo customers and key influencers, interact digitally with current and prospective customers and maintain and develop our strong channel partnerships and strong shelf presence. We collaborate with our retail partners on market development activities to drive in-store and online engagement with the brand and drive purchases. 
Customer Care 
We provide customer care to Arlo users globally through a variety of communication channels, including phone, chat, email, social media and our Arlo Community, as well as self-guided resources such as knowledge-base articles, how-to videos and technical documentation on our website. We believe that providing timely, responsive customer support and educational content to our users helps foster an ongoing engagement that builds loyalty to our brand and also enables Arlo to understand user needs as they evolve. The online Arlo Community in particular serves as an efficient and engaging platform through which we can deliver customer care and receive feedback from users. We gather and analyze user feedback from all platforms to help inform our design and engineering teams about future enhancements to our products and services. 
In order to best serve our users globally, we manage and continually adjust our resources worldwide through a mixture of permanent employees and subcontracted, outsourced resources. As our installed base continues to grow in new geographies, new categories and technologies, we will continue to focus on building a scalable support infrastructure that enables our users to engage with us through the channel that is most convenient and efficient for their needs. 
Arlo Cloud Engineering Operations 
We currently serve our users from third-party data center hosting facilities. Our cloud platform runs in data centers in the United States and a data center in Ireland to serve our European Union users. We also utilize data centers in Singapore, Australia and China. We have designed our cloud environments to be highly resilient with built-in redundancy and provide failover to other data centers in our network. 
Fiscal periods 
Our fiscal year begins on January 1 of the year stated and ends on December 31 of the same year. We report our results on a fiscal quarter basis rather than on a calendar quarter basis. Under the fiscal quarter basis, each of the first three fiscal quarters ends on the Sunday closest to the calendar quarter end, with the fourth quarter ending on December 31. 
Seasonality
Historically, we have generated higher revenue in the third and fourth quarters of each year compared to the first and second quarters due to seasonal demand from consumer markets, primarily relating to the beginning of the school year and the holiday season. For example, for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our third and fourth quarters collectively represented 63.0%, 61.8% and 54.5%, respectively, of our revenue for such years. Therefore, timely and effective product and service introductions are critical to our results of operations.
Backlog 
Our backlog consists of products for which customer purchase orders have been received and that are scheduled or in the process of being scheduled for shipment. As of December 31, 2020, we had a backlog of $5.7 million, compared to $5.4 million as of December 31, 2019 and $18.9 million as of December 31, 2018. As we typically fulfill orders received within a relatively short period after receipt, our revenue in any fiscal year depends primarily upon orders booked and the availability of supply of our products in that year. In addition, most of our backlog is subject to rescheduling or cancellation with minimal penalties. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date may not be an indicator of revenue for any succeeding period. Similarly, there is a lack of meaningful correlation between year-over-year changes in backlog as compared with year-over-year changes in revenue. Accordingly, we do not believe that backlog information is material to an understanding of our overall business, and backlog as of any particular date should not be considered a reliable indicator of our ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to protect our intellectual property will be an important factor in the success and continued growth of our business. We rely upon a combination of patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark laws and contractual restrictions, such as confidentiality agreements and licenses, to establish and protect our proprietary rights. Some of our technology relies upon third-party licensed intellectual property. 
We currently hold 72 U.S. issued patents, 32 pending U.S. patent applications, seven international patents, including patents issued by China and and the EU, 13 pending patent applications outside of the United States. All the patents and patent applications generally relate to certain aspects of our hardware devices, accessories, software and services. We continually review our development efforts to assess the existence and patentability of new intellectual property. 
We also pursue the registration of our domain names and trademarks and service marks in the United States and in certain locations outside the United States. We currently have six registered trademarks and three pending trademark applications in the United States, as well as 38 registered trademarks and 10 pending trademark applications outside of the United States. We currently hold trademark registrations for “ARLO” in nine countries, including the United States, Australia, Canada, China, and Japan, as well as the World Intellectual Property Organization. For more information, see “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Business-If we are unable to secure and protect our intellectual property rights, our ability to compete could be harmed.” 
Environmental Laws 
Our products and manufacturing processes are subject to numerous governmental regulations, which cover both the use of various materials and environmental concerns. Environmental issues such as pollution and climate change have had significant legislative and regulatory efforts on a global basis, and there are expected to be additional changes to the regulations in these areas. These changes could directly increase the cost of energy, which may have an impact on the way we manufacture products. In addition, any new regulations or laws in the environmental area might increase the cost of the raw materials we use in our products and the cost of compliance. Other regulations in the environmental area may require us to continue to monitor and ensure proper disposal or recycling of our products. To the best of our knowledge, we maintain compliance with all current government regulations concerning our production processes for all locations in which we operate. Since we operate on a global basis, this is also a complex process that requires continual monitoring of regulations and an ongoing compliance process to ensure that we and our suppliers are in compliance with all existing regulations.
