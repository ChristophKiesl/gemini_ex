 utilizing viral marketing, the practice of getting consumers to refer friends to the site through e-mail or word of mouth. The Company will aggressively trigger viral marketing through strategic campaigns which may include posting on blogs and online communities such as Yahoo!® Groups, contests, implementation of features on our website which encourage users to generate an email to a friend, or give aways tied to a viral process. Other viral techniques under consideration include creating short videos that people can view on our website or on amateur websites such as YouTube.com and e-mail to others to watch, and branded interactive online applications on our website
 
-
 developing a search engine optimization or SEO campaign. SEO is the process of improving the volume and quality of traffic to a web site from search engines via natural (organic or algorithmic) search results. Usually, the earlier a site is presented in the search results, or the higher it ranks", the more searchers will visit that site

-
 developing a search engine marketing or SEM campaign. SEM is the process of marketing a website via search engines, by purchasing sponsored placement in search results. For example, a user might go to Google and put in the term foreclosed  our strategic purchasing of these keyword search terms will cause our ad to come up. It might read Find information of foreclosed properties at www.foreclosurecat.com and when clicked, it will take the user to our site.
 
-
 utilize direct e-mail marketing firms who specialize in our target market via subscriber based lists with detailed criteria obtained by third party research groups.
 
-
 entering into affiliate marketing relationships with website providers to increase our access to Internet consumers. Affiliate marketing means that we would place a link to our website or a banner advertisement on the websites of other companies in exchange for placing their link or banner advertisement on our website. Such marketing increases access to users, because the users of other websites may visit our website as a result of those links or banner advertisements.
 
We expect to rely on SEO, SEM, direct e-mail and affiliate marketing as our primary marketing strategies, with viral marketing as a secondary marketing strategy.

Costs associated with the customer acquisition, retention, continued product development, overhead and management and continued servicing are budgeted individually for each project. Contingencies are allowed for as deemed necessary. Each engagement contemplates that we will offer up to fifty tax lien investment opportunities.

The Company intends to offer our services through our current officer and by retaining, when feasible, highly skilled real estate professionals. Although, we have limited competition in the tax certificate and tax lien consulting industry. Our competitors are in the realtor services industry include franchisees of Century 21, Prudential, GMAC Real Estate, and RE/MAX insomuch that they are the largest source of all real estate investment opportunities. All of these companies may have greater financial resources than we do, including greater marketing and technology budgets. We also compete with smaller regional and local realtor companies and independent realtors. 
 
Realtors compete for business primarily on the basis of services offered, reputation, personal contacts, and realtor commission. We may have to reduce the fees we charge our clients to be competitive with those charged by competitors, which may accelerate if market conditions deteriorate. The companys strategy is to leverage broad geographic reach, long-term client relationships, and full-range and service offerings to become a larger, more robust real estate services firm. The companys growth plan is focused on the achievement of four primary objectives:

-
 Hire and retain highly qualified, experienced third party associates. We believe our highly qualified, experienced third party associates will provide us with a distinct competitive advantage. Therefore, one of our priorities is to attract and retain high-caliber real estate sales professionals. We believe we will attract and retain qualified professionals by providing attractive sales commission arrangements
 
-
 Leverage existing real estate industry relationships. We will emphasize a relationship-oriented approach to business rather than a transaction-oriented or assignment-oriented approach. We believe the real estate professional services experience of our associates will enable us to understand the needs of our clients and to deliver an integrated, relationship-oriented approach to meeting their needs, while offering many of these individuals a new real estate investment opportunity that they may not otherwise be familiar or experienced with
 
-
 Offer robust information services. Our anticipated approach is to identify, attract and obtain new customers by offering a comprehensive tax lien information platform. The companys computer systems will be designed to deliver an array of tax lien investment data relevant to the customers investment profile with minimal time and effort
