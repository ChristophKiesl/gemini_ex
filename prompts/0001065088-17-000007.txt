ITEM 1: BUSINESS
Overview
eBay Inc. was formed as a sole proprietorship in September 1995 and was incorporated in California in May 1996. In April 1998, we reincorporated in Delaware, and in September 1998, we completed the initial public offering of our common stock. Our principal executive offices are located at 2025 Hamilton Avenue, San Jose, California 95125, and our telephone number is (408) 376-7400. Unless otherwise expressly stated or the context otherwise requires, when we refer to “we,” “our,” “us” or “eBay” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we mean the current Delaware corporation (eBay Inc.) and its California predecessor, as well as all of its consolidated subsidiaries. When we refer to “eBay Inc.” we mean our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. 
eBay Inc. is a global commerce leader, which includes our Marketplace, StubHub and Classifieds platforms. Collectively, we connect millions of buyers and sellers around the world. The technologies and services that power our platforms are designed to enable sellers worldwide to organize and offer their inventory for sale, and buyers to find and purchase it, virtually anytime and anywhere. Our Marketplace platforms include our online marketplace located at www.ebay.com, its localized counterparts and the eBay mobile apps. We believe that these are among the world’s largest and most vibrant marketplaces for discovering great value and unique selection. Our StubHub platforms include our online ticket platform located at www.stubhub.com, its localized counterparts, the StubHub mobile apps and Ticketbis. These platforms connect fans with their favorite sporting events, shows and artists and enable them to buy and sell tens of thousands of tickets whenever they want. Our Classifieds platforms include a collection of brands such as mobile.de, Kijiji, Gumtree, Marktplaats, eBay Kleinanzeigen and others. Offering online classifieds in more than 1,500 cities around the world, these platforms help people find whatever they are looking for in their local communities.
Our platforms are accessible through a traditional online experience (e.g., desktop and laptop computers), from mobile devices (e.g., smartphones and tablets) and by API (platform access for third party software developers). Our multi-screen approach offers downloadable, easy-to-use applications for iOS and Android mobile devices that allow access to ebay.com and some of our other websites and vertical shopping experiences. In addition, our platform is increasingly based on open source technologies that provide industry-standard ways for software developers and merchants to access our application programming interfaces, or APIs, to develop software and solutions for commerce.

Offerings
Delivering the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform
Our objective is to drive the best choice, the most relevance and the most powerful selling platform for our buyers and sellers. We continue to focus on customizing our buying and selling experiences to make it easier for users to list, find and buy items by offering formats dedicated to specific products or categories. On our Marketplace platforms, we have built specialized experiences such as eBay Deals, which offers a variety of products in multiple categories at discounted prices with free shipping. Other experiences include Fashion, Motors and Electronics. 
One of the changes we are making to our Marketplace platform is the shift to better understand, organize and leverage the inventory on eBay. This initiative, which we call structured data, will allow us to expand new experiences to more traffic and drive data quality.
As one of the world’s largest ticket marketplaces, StubHub connects people through inspiring live experiences. Event-goers can find more than 10 million live sports, music, theater and other events in more than 40 countries on our StubHub platforms, and can browse, buy and sell anytime, anywhere through desktop and mobile devices.
As a world leader in online classifieds, eBay’s Classifieds platforms are designed to help people list their products and services generally for free, find whatever they are looking for in their local communities and trade at a local level. eBay Classifieds Group’s 11 global brands offer both horizontal and vertical experiences, such as motors, real estate and jobs.
Business model and pricing
Our business model and pricing are designed so that our business is successful primarily when our sellers are successful. We partner, but do not compete with, our sellers to enable their success on eBay’s platforms. Our eBay Top Rated Seller program rewards qualifying sellers with fee discounts and improved search standing for qualifying listings if they are able to maintain excellent customer service ratings and meet specified criteria for shipping and returns. We believe that sellers who fulfill these standards help promote our goal of maintaining an online marketplace that is safe and hassle-free.
eBay Money Back Guarantee covers most items purchased on our websites in a number of countries, including the U.S., the U.K., Germany and Australia, through a qualifying payment method and protects most buyers with respect to items that are not received or are received but not as described in the listing. Some purchases, including some vehicles, are not covered. eBay Money Back Guarantee provides coverage for the purchase price of the item, plus original shipping costs, for a limited period of time from the original date of transaction, and includes a streamlined interface to help buyers and sellers navigate the process.
The size and scale of our platforms are designed to enable our buyers and sellers to leverage economies of scale and capital investment, for example in sales and marketing, mobile, customer acquisition and customer service.
Providing value to buyers and sellers
We believe that our sellers offer some of the best value and deals available for a number of consumer products. In the U.S., the U.K. and Germany, the majority of transactions included free shipping during 2016. We have developed a number of features on our Marketplace platforms in the areas of trust and safety (including our Seller Performance Standards, eBay Top Rated Seller program, eBay Money Back Guarantee, Verified Rights Owner Program and Feedback Forum), customer support and value-added tools and services, as well as loyalty programs (for both buyers and sellers). These features are designed to build trust and make users more comfortable buying and selling with unknown partners and completing transactions online or through mobile devices, as well as rewarding our top sellers for their loyalty.
For sellers in particular, in 2016 we implemented a number of changes to our seller policies to primarily help small- and medium-sized sellers be more successful on our platforms and better reward sellers who provide exceptional service to eBay buyers. These changes included providing more objective standards; giving sellers the ability to customize how they manage returns based on their specific business needs; and launching the Seller Hub, which puts a seller’s listing and marketing tools in one central place.

Offering buyers and sellers choice
We offer choice to buyers and sellers across a number of dimensions.
For sellers, this includes:

• | Sellers can choose to list their products and services through fixed price listings or an auction-style format on our platforms. The fixed price format on eBay allows buyers and sellers to close transactions at a pre-determined price set by the seller. Sellers also are able to signal that they would be willing to close the transaction at a lower price through the Best Offer feature. Additionally, our auction-style format allows a seller to select a minimum price for opening bids.


• | Sellers can list items that are new, refurbished and used, and common and rare on our Marketplace platforms.

For buyers, this includes:

• | Buyers can search for and purchase items that are new, refurbished and used, and common and rare on our Marketplace platforms.


• | Buyers also can have items shipped to them through shipping options offered by the seller and selected by the buyer on our Marketplace platforms. For certain items purchased from certain retailers, buyers can pick up items they purchased online or through mobile devices in one of the retailer’s physical stores (which we refer to as in-store pickup).

Our Impact and Responsibility
eBay was founded on the simple belief that people are basically good. Our technology has levelled the playing field by enabling people to connect and trade around the world, regardless of their circumstances or location. We believe that commerce should be not just transactional but rather transformational. Through our platforms, we are creating a better, more sustainable form of commerce that empowers people and creates opportunity. And we are committed to reducing the environmental impact of our platform by increasing efficiency, expanding our use of cleaner energy and using our global marketplace to extend the life of goods in a more circular economy.
Financial Information
We measure our footprint in our addressable market according to Gross Merchandise Volume (“GMV”). GMV consists of the total value of all successfully closed transactions between users on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms during the applicable period, regardless of whether the buyer and seller actually consummated the transaction.
 At the end of 2016, our Marketplace and StubHub platforms had more than 167 million active buyers and over one billion live listings globally. The term “active buyer” means, as of any date, all buyers who successfully closed a transaction on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms within the previous 12-month period. Buyers may register more than once and, as a result, may have more than one account.
We generate revenue from the transactions we successfully enable and through marketing services, including classifieds and advertising. The majority of our revenue comes from a take rate on the GMV of transactions closed on our Marketplace and StubHub platforms. We define “take rate” as net transaction revenues divided by GMV. In 2016, we generated $84 billion in GMV, of which approximately 59% was generated outside the U.S.
For additional financial information as well as the geographic areas where we conduct business, please see “Note 6 - Segments” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report. Additionally, please see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption “Our international operations are subject to increased risks, which may harm our business,” which describes risks associated with eBay Inc.’s foreign operations.

Notable Business Transactions in 2016
eBay makes acquisitions to help enable commerce on our platforms for buyers and sellers.  In 2016, eBay completed six acquisitions — Cargigi Inc., Expertmaker, SalesPredict, Ticketbis, Ticket Utils and Corrigon Ltd. — for an aggregate purchase consideration of approximately $212 million, consisting of cash.  We believe these acquisitions will help us build a better user experience, improve discoverability and grow our international presence. See “Note 3 - Business Combinations and Divestitures” to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for additional information.

We also regularly review and manage our investments to ensure that our investments support eBay’s strategic direction and complement our disciplined approach to value creation, profitability and capital allocation.  During the fourth quarter of 2016, we sold our equity holdings of MercadoLibre, Inc. for a pre-tax gain of $1.3 billion. 
Competition
We encounter vigorous competition in our business from numerous sources. Our users can find, buy, sell and pay for similar items through a variety of competing online, mobile and offline channels. These include, but are not limited to, retailers, distributors, liquidators, import and export companies, auctioneers, catalog and mail-order companies, classifieds, directories, search engines, commerce participants (consumer-to-consumer, business-to-consumer and business-to-business), shopping channels and networks. As our product offerings continue to broaden into new categories of items and new commerce formats, we expect to face additional competition from other online, mobile and offline channels for those new offerings. We compete on the basis of price, product selection and services.
For more information regarding these risks, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the captions “Substantial and increasingly intense competition worldwide in ecommerce may harm our business” and “We are subject to regulatory activity and antitrust litigation under competition laws.”
To compete effectively, we will need to continue to expend significant resources in technology and marketing. These efforts require substantial expenditures, which could reduce our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, operating results and cash flows and reduce the market price of our common stock and outstanding debt. Despite our efforts to preserve and expand the size, diversity and transaction activity of our buyers and sellers and to enhance the user experience, we may not be able to effectively manage our operating expenses, to increase or maintain our revenue or to avoid a decline in our consolidated net income or a net loss.
Government Regulation
Government regulation impacts key aspects of our business. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations that affect the ecommerce industry in many countries where we operate. For more information regarding these risks, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the caption “Our business is subject to extensive government regulation and oversight.”
Seasonality 
We expect transaction activity patterns on our platforms to mirror general consumer buying patterns. Please see the additional information in “Item 7: Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the caption “Seasonality.” 
Technology 
eBay Inc.’s platforms utilize a combination of proprietary technologies and services as well as technologies and services provided by others. We have developed intuitive user interfaces, buyer and seller tools and transaction processing, database and network applications that help enable our users to reliably and securely complete transactions on our sites. Our technology infrastructure simplifies the storage and processing of large amounts of data, eases the deployment and operation of large-scale global products and services and automates much of the administration of large-scale clusters of computers. Our infrastructure has been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences. We strive to continually improve our technology to enhance the buyer and seller experience and to increase efficiency, scalability and security. Additionally, we recently embarked on a multi-year evolution of our shopping platform that aims to deliver relevant, persistent and personalized experiences for consumers. For information regarding technology-related risks, see the information in “Item 1A: Risk

Factors” under the caption “Systems failures or cyberattacks and resulting interruptions in the availability of or degradation in the performance of our websites, applications, products or services could harm our business.”
Intellectual Property 
We regard the protection of our intellectual property, including our trademarks (particularly those covering the eBay name), patents, copyrights, domain names, trade dress and trade secrets as critical to our success. We aggressively protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights in the U.S. and internationally, as well as a variety of administrative procedures. We also rely on contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights in products and services. We routinely enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors and nondisclosure agreements with parties with whom we conduct business to limit access to and disclosure of our proprietary information.
We pursue the registration of our domain names, trademarks and service marks in the U.S. and internationally. Additionally, we have filed U.S. and international patent applications covering certain aspects of our proprietary technology. Effective trademark, copyright, patent, domain name, trade dress and trade secret protection is typically expensive to maintain and may require litigation. We must protect our intellectual property rights and other proprietary rights in an increasing number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and time consuming and may not be successful.
We have registered our core brands as trademarks and domain names in the U.S. and a large number of other jurisdictions and have in place an active program to continue to secure trademarks and domain names that correspond to our brands in markets of interest. If we are unable to register or protect our trademarks or domain names, we could be adversely affected in any jurisdiction in which our trademarks or domain names are not registered or protected. We have licensed in the past, and expect to license in the future, certain of our proprietary rights, such as trademarks or copyrighted material, to others.
From time to time, third parties have claimed - and others will likely claim in the future - that we have infringed their intellectual property rights. We are typically involved in a number of such legal proceedings at any time. Please see the information in “Item 3: Legal Proceedings” and in “Item 1A: Risk Factors” under the captions “We are subject to patent litigation,” “The listing or sale by our users of items that allegedly infringe the intellectual property rights of rights owners, including pirated or counterfeit items, may harm its business,” and “We may be unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, or third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property rights.”
Employees 
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 12,600 people globally. Approximately 6,600 of our employees were located in the U.S.
