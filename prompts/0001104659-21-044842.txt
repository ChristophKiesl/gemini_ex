Item 1. Business
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless the content otherwise dictates, "NexGel", the "Company", "we" or "our" mean NexGel Inc. NexGel was previously known as AquaMed Technologies, Inc. (“AquaMed”) before changing its name to NexGel, Inc. on November 14, 2019.
 
Our Company
 
We were incorporated in Delaware on January 13, 2009. We manufacture high water content, electron beam cross-linked, aqueous polymer hydrogels, or gels, used for wound care, medical diagnostics, transdermal drug delivery and cosmetics. We specialize in custom gels by capitalizing on proprietary manufacturing technologies. We have historically served as a contract manufacturer, supplying our gels to third parties who incorporate them into their own products. Our products are manufactured using proprietary and non-proprietary mixing, coating and cross-linking technologies. Together, these technologies enable us to produce gels that can satisfy rigid tolerance specifications with respect to a wide range of physical characteristics (e.g., thickness, water content, adherence, absorption, moisture vapor transmission rate (a measure of the passage of water vapor through a substance) and release rate) while maintaining product integrity. Additionally, we have the manufacturing ability to offer broad choices in the selection of liners onto which the gels are coated. Consequently, our customers are able to determine tolerances in moisture vapor transmission rate and active ingredient release rates while personalizing color and texture. Once the gels are manufactured according to a customer’s specifications, the gels are generally shipped to the customer via a contract carrier (e.g., United Parcel Service, Inc.). The Company is implementing a new strategy to become a consumer products business focused on proprietary branded products and white label opportunities.
Industry and Markets
 
Our hydrogels are currently being marketed in the U.S. and abroad for the following applications:
 

• | Drug Delivery. Delivering medication through hydrogel patches has important advantages over traditional methods of drug delivery. Hydrogel patches are less intrusive, painless, allow for pre-planned medication time periods, can potentially release medication in a manner consistent with the body’s own glandular activity (by avoiding dosage spikes and/or digestive alteration), and minimize side effects related to the medication via injection or ingestion.

• | Other Medical Applications. Hydrogel patches are being used for transdermal applications such as hormone replacement therapy and contraception, treatment of acne, shingles, diabetes, motion sickness, treatment of angina with nitroglycerin and treatment of smoking addiction using nicotine and palliatives (i.e., pain relievers).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Non-Prescription Therapeutic Applications. Hydrogel patches are also used in the medical community and are also directly marketed to consumers for topical application of over the counter (“OTC”) drugs such as non-prescription acne treatments, pain relievers, diet preparations, cough suppressants, treatment of warts, calluses and corns, and pain relief.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Moist Wound and Burn Dressings. Hydrogel dressings have long been used for treating wounds and burns. Clinical trials have demonstrated the benefits of moist wound healing versus traditional dressings. Some of these benefits include immediate anti-inflammatory effects, allowing for freer cell flow and less scarring, increased absorption of exudate, and accelerated healing.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Components of Medical Devices. Several medical devices utilize hydrogels as components. These devices include active drug delivery systems such as iontophoresis, warming and cooling devices, medical electrodes and various medical products for sensitive skin.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cosmetic Applications. Hydrogel patches and applications can deliver cosmetic skin care products to consumers and skin care providers for uses that include moisturizers, face masks, cooling masks and applicators.

Sales and Marketing
 
We continue to focus on sales and marketing efforts in the United States. As of December 31, 2020, we did not have any employees solely dedicated to sales, however, some of our employees perform in a sales capacity in addition to their other duties. In February 2021, the Company began contracting two independent salesmen for current year sales efforts.

Competition
 
To our knowledge, NexGel is one of three manufacturers using electron beam technology for high performance hydrogels for the wound care, cosmetic and drug delivery industries.
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials; Principal Suppliers
 
In general, raw materials essential to our business are readily available from multiple sources. For reasons of quality assurance, availability, or cost effectiveness, certain components and raw materials are available only from a sole supplier. The principal suppliers for our raw materials are Berry Global, Inc., DeWolf Chemical, Inc. and Univar Inc. Our policy is to maintain sufficient inventory of components so that our production will not be significantly disrupted even if a particular component or material is not available for a period of time.
 
Because we have no direct control over these suppliers, interruptions or delays in the products and services provided by these parties may be difficult to remedy in a timely fashion. In addition, if such suppliers are unable or unwilling to deliver the necessary products or raw materials, we may be unable to redesign or adapt our technology to work without such raw materials or products or find alternative suppliers or manufacturers. In such events, we could experience interruptions, delays, increased costs or quality control problems, or be unable to sell the applicable products, all of which could have a significant adverse impact on our revenue.
 
Other than as discussed above, we believe that, due to the size and scale of production of our suppliers, there should be an adequate supply of raw materials from our other suppliers.
 
Customers
 
During the year ended December 31, 2020, three major customers accounted for approximately 78% of our revenue, with each customer individually accounting for 45%, 22%, and 11% respectively. We cannot be certain as to these customers’ intentions to use our services during the fiscal year ending December 31, 2021 since we do not currently have a contract with these customers. However, we have been supplying these customers for more than fifteen years and have no reason to anticipate any change. Our contract manufacturing business, including with respect to these customers, operates on a purchase order basis.
Patents, Proprietary Rights and Trademarks
 
We own or license trademarks covering our company and our products. We currently hold patent rights to one patent in Europe, which covers the use of lignin for inhibiting restenosis and thrombosis formation, and coated medical devices where the coating includes lignin. These patent rights are set to expire in September 2021, however we believe the expiration of these patents will not have an adverse impact on our overall business. In addition, in connection with our Spin-Off, we received an exclusive license with right to sub-license from Specialty Pharmaceutical Products, L.L.C. (which was held by Adynxx) to two issued patents, one in the U.S. and one in Europe, which cover technology relating to a transdermal patch containing transcutol. The transdermal patch is effective to deliver lidocaine to a patient. These licensed patent rights are expected to expire in April 2032. We also rely upon trade secrets and continuing technological innovations to develop and maintain our competitive position.
Government Regulation
 
Product Regulation. Under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, medical devices are classified by the FDA into one of three classes - Class I, Class II or Class III - depending on the degree of risk associated with each medical device and the extent of control needed to ensure safety and effectiveness. While some applications of hydrogels fall under the jurisdiction of the FDA, hydrogels are generally classified as Class I exempt devices and the majority of the hydrogel products that we manufacture are thereby exempt from the FDA filing of any regulatory submissions and/or pre-market notification requirements. To the extent that any FDA regulatory submissions are required, we will be required to file these submissions and maintain all appropriate documentation. With respect to registering the manufacturing facility with the FDA under the Code of Federal Regulations, 21 CFR 820.1, Scope: Part A, it is stated that the regulation does not apply to manufacturers of component parts of finished devices. Currently, hydrogels are sold as component parts to various medical device/cosmetic manufacturers.
Quality Assurance Requirements. The FDA enforces regulations to ensure that the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of drugs and medical devices conform with current good manufacturing practice (CGMP). The CGMP regulations enforced by the FDA are comprehensive and cover all aspects of manufacturing operations, from receipt of raw materials to finished product distribution, insofar as they bear upon whether drugs meet all the identity, strength, quality and purity characteristics required of them. The CGMP regulations for devices, called the Quality System Regulation, are also comprehensive and cover all aspects of device manufacture, from pre-production design validation to installation and servicing, insofar as they bear upon the safe and effective use of the device and whether the device otherwise meets the requirements of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. To assure compliance requires a continuous commitment of time, money and effort in all operational areas.

The FDA also conducts periodic inspections of drug and device registered facilities to assess their current CGMP status. If the FDA were to find serious non-compliant manufacturing or processing practices during such an inspection, it could take regulatory actions that could adversely affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. With respect to domestic establishments, the FDA could initiate product seizures or in some instances require product recalls and seek to enjoin a product’s manufacture and distribution. In certain circumstances, violations could support civil penalties and criminal prosecutions. In addition, if the FDA concludes that a company is not in compliance with CGMP requirements, sanctions may be imposed that include preventing that company from receiving the necessary licenses to export its products and classifying that company as an “unacceptable supplier”, thereby disqualifying that company from selling products to federal agencies.
 
We conduct audits of our outside manufacturers and believe that we and our suppliers and outside manufacturers are currently in compliance with CGMP requirements. We are currently registered as a device manufacturer and human tissue distributor with the FDA and we intend to register as a drug facility with the FDA when we are required to do so.
 
Environmental Regulation. We are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the U.S. and other countries. We have made, and continue to make, significant investments to comply with these laws and regulations. We cannot predict the future capital expenditures or operating costs required to comply with environmental laws and regulations. We believe that we are currently compliant with applicable environmental, health and safety requirements in all material respects. However, we cannot assure you that current or future regulatory, governmental, or private action will not have a material adverse effect on our performance, results or financial condition.
 
In the future, if a loss contingency related to environmental matters, employee safety, health or conditional asset retirement obligations is recognized, we would record a liability for the obligation and it may result in a material impact on net income for the annual or interim period during which the liability is recorded. The investigation and remediation of environmental obligations generally occur over an extended period of time, and therefore we do not know if these events would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, or cash flow, nor can we assure you that such liabilities would not have a material adverse effect on our performance, results or financial condition.
 
Federal and State Anti-kickback, Self-referral, False Claims and Similar Laws. Our relationships with physicians, hospitals and the marketers of our products are subject to scrutiny under various federal anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims and similar laws, often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws. Healthcare fraud and abuse laws are complex, and even minor, inadvertent violations can give rise to claims that the relevant law has been violated. Certain states have similar fraud and abuse laws, imposing substantial penalties for violations. Any government investigation or a finding of a violation of these laws would likely result in a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations. We believe that we are currently compliant with applicable anti-kickback, self-referral, false claims in all material respects.
Research and Development Costs
 
For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we did not incur any research and development costs.
 
We intend to commit capital resources to research and development only as our cash resources allow. We have incurred all costs associated with the launch of our proprietary products and will only require research and development expenses for product enhancements and modifications and to obtain additional reimbursement coverage, which we do not expect to be significant.

Employees
 
As of December 31, 2020, we had eight full-time employees. Of these employees, one is involved with finance, sales, marketing, and administration and five are involved with manufacturing and regulatory matters. Our employees are not represented by a labor union or other collective bargaining groups, and we consider relations with our employees to be good. We currently plan to retain and utilize the services of outside consultants for additional research, testing, regulatory, legal compliance and other services on an as needed basis.
