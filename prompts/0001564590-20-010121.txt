Overview
 CRH is a North American company focused on providing physicians throughout the United States with innovative products and services for the treatment of gastrointestinal (“GI”) diseases. The CRH O’Regan System is a single-use, disposable, hemorrhoid banding technology that is safe and highly effective in treating all grades of hemorrhoids. CRH distributes the CRH O’Regan System, treatment protocols, operational and marketing expertise as a complete, turnkey package directly to gastroenterology practices, creating meaningful relationships with the gastroenterologists (“GIs”) it serves. The CRH O’Regan System is currently used in all 48 lower U.S. states.
 In 2014, CRH acquired Gastroenterology Anesthesia Associates, LLC (“GAA”), a full-service gastroenterology anesthesia company that provides anesthesia services for patients undergoing endoscopic procedures. Performing these procedures under anesthetic provides more comfort for patients and increases the operating efficiency of ASC’s. CRH has continued to leverage the capabilities it acquired through GAA to consolidate the highly fragmented gastroenterology anesthesia provider business. The Company’s goal is to establish itself as the premier provider of innovative products and essential services to GIs throughout the United States. Each of the Company’s two primary lines of business, the sale of medical products and the provision of anesthesia services, is discussed below. As of December 31, 2019, CRH has a majority ownership interest in 25 GI anesthesia practices in 11 U.S. states and services approximately 378,000 patient cases annually. 
 In 2019, the Company completed seven transactions. All transactions completed during 2019 have been included in the anesthesia segment of the Company. In January 2019, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire 100% of certain assets of Anesthesia Care Associates LLC, an anesthesia services provider in Indiana. In April 2019, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement to purchase the remaining 49% interest in Arapahoe Gastroenterology Anesthesia Associates LLC. In May 2019 a subsidiary of the Company entered into an asset contribution and exchange agreement to acquire 55% of the ownership interest in South Metro Anesthesia Associates, an anesthesia services provider in Georgia. In July 2019 a subsidiary of the Company entered into an asset contribution and exchange agreement to acquire 51% of the ownership interest in Crystal River Anesthesia Associates, an anesthesia services provider in Florida. In August 2019, a subsidiary of the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement to purchase the remaining 49% interest in Central Colorado Anesthesia Associates LLC. In November 2019, the Company entered into a membership interest purchase agreement to acquire an additional 36% interest in Triad Sedation Associates, LLC. In December 2019, a subsidiary of the Company entered into an asset contribution and exchange agreement to acquire 51% of the ownership interest in Florida Panhandle Anesthesia Associates LLC, an anesthesia services provider in Florida. 
 The CRH O’Regan System
 Invented in 1997 by laparoscopic surgeon Dr. Patrick J. O’Regan, and cleared by the FDA in 2000, the CRH O’Regan System represents a significant advancement in rubber band ligation treatment of hemorrhoids. The technology was improved in the 2016 version, which added a new level of functionality for the practitioner and a new level of comfort and safety for the patient, by incorporating several new unique features to the CRH O’Regan System. 
 The CRH O’Regan System is an entirely disposable, single-use device for hemorrhoid treatment, as compared to previous metal instruments that were introduced in the 1950s and 1960s, before the advent of virulent, blood borne pathogens such as HIV and Hepatitis B and C. The CRH O’Regan System eliminates reprocessing challenges and concerns about cross-patient infection.
 The ligator is a plastic plunger suction device resembling a syringe, with a built-in obturator to ease insertion, which allows for a band to be applied to a given hemorrhoid. This procedure can be performed under direct visualization with a specially designed anoscope or using a “touch” technique where the device is inserted up to a mark through the anus and directed to one of the hemorrhoid cushions, which is then banded.
 What are Hemorrhoids?
 Hemorrhoids are normal cushions of tissue and blood vessels in the lower rectum which normally play a role in maintaining continence. In a large number of people, these hemorrhoidal cushions undergo changes which typically lead to any number of perianal symptoms, including swelling, pain, and leakage. It is at this point when patients typically seek treatment for their hemorrhoidal disease.  Hemorrhoids are classified as either external or internal:
 5
 

External – swollen vascular and soft tissue that is present below the “Dentate Line,” which can often be seen and felt under the skin outside the anal canal. They often appear as a small bulge and are the same color as the skin. These can become irritated, inflamed or thrombosed, are generally treated by over the counter remedies or in some cases, a surgical procedure. External hemorrhoids are often mistakenly “blamed” for patients’ symptoms that are actually caused by their internal hemorrhoids, explaining why so many patients with “external” symptoms respond to treating their internal hemorrhoids.
 Internal – swollen and prolapsing vascular tissue that are inside of the anal opening, and which originates above the “Dentate Line.” When internal hemorrhoids become problematic, they may protrude out through the anus while straining or during defecation. A reference to “hemorrhoids” in a clinical setting is generally a reference to internal hemorrhoids.
 Internal hemorrhoids fall into one of four “grades” depending on the degree of severity. Grade I hemorrhoids do not prolapse, and so very infrequently cause symptoms. These patients are usually treated with over the counter remedies and diet, and if any symptoms are present, they are typically self-limited. Grades I through IV are typically in need of treatment and rubber band ligation is the most frequent type of treatment utilized for Grade I and III disease, while most Grade IV patients require surgical intervention, which is quite costly and painful. Successful treatment of lesser grades of hemorrhoids may well prevent the development of Grade IV disease.
 There are many presumed factors that may increase the likelihood of developing hemorrhoidal symptoms. These factors include aging, chronic constipation or diarrhea, pregnancy, hereditary issues, chronic straining during bowel movements and faulty bowel function due to overuse of laxatives or enemas. Hemorrhoid symptoms include: itching, bleeding, swelling, prolapse, leakage, and in patients with associated external hemorrhoids, lumps and pain.
 According to the National Institute of Health, approximately 50% of the U.S. population will develop symptomatic hemorrhoids by age 50, and 75% will be symptomatic at some point during their lifetime.
 According to the American Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons, hemorrhoids are one of the most common ailments, with the onset typically occurring usually after age 20. The peak prevalence occurs between 45 and 65 years of age. Most patients with milder cases appear to suffer in silence, or may seek over-the-counter remedies, rather than turning to a medical professional.
 Hemorrhoid Treatment Procedures
 Rubber Band Ligation
 A small rubber band is placed around the base of the hemorrhoid inside the rectum. The band cuts off circulation, the banded tissue sloughs within a few days, and scar tissue forms, preventing the tissue from prolapsing or causing symptoms. Rubber band ligation may be utilized for the vast majority of hemorrhoid patients.
 The banding technique is the most widely accepted form of treatment. The CRH O’Regan System requires no bowel preparation, no anesthesia, is simple to perform, can be done in a doctor’s office, and is relatively inexpensive and effective.  
 Coagulation by use of infrared light (“IRC”)
 Coagulation by use of infrared light causes the treated hemorrhoid tissue to coagulate, creating scar tissue that is intended to stop the prolapse, lessening the hemorrhoidal symptoms. It is mostly used for grade 1 or small grade II hemorrhoids.  IRC has been shown to be less effective than rubber band ligation, can be more expensive for the provider to use, and it typically requires more treatments with a higher recurrence rate. 
 Injection sclerotherapy with chemicals
 With injection sclerotherapy, a doctor injects a chemical solution under the surface of the hemorrhoid. The solution causes inflammation and scarring of the tissue in an attempt to keep the hemorrhoidal tissue from causing symptoms. This technique is not widely used, and serious complications can occur if the solution is not injected precisely where it is needed.
 
Surgery
 A hemorrhoidectomy is performed by a surgeon with local anesthetic plus sedation, or more typically a spinal anesthetic or a general anesthetic. It is sometimes performed on an outpatient basis, but an overnight or inpatient hospital stay can be required. It is a more expensive procedure than the other options as it is required to be performed in a hospital or ambulatory surgery center. Surgery is accompanied by greater cost, as well as post procedural pain and disability.
 6
 

Stapling
 A “PPH” or a “stapled hemorrhoidectomy” utilizes a specialized device which can cut and then staple together a portion of the rectal lining, causing scar tissue that typically keeps the hemorrhoid tissue in place, minimizing the patient’s symptoms. This procedure gained favor because it caused less pain and disability than the conventional surgical hemorrhoidectomy, but more recent experience has shown that this procedure is not without the potential for significant complications.
Transanal Hemorrhoidal Dearterialization
 A more recent development, this surgical procedure utilizes a specialized scope to help identify the arteries which supply blood to the hemorrhoidal tissues. This localization allows for the surgeon to suture those vessels, reducing blood flow to the hemorrhoids as well as to cause scarring which helps to minimize hemorrhoidal symptoms. This technique demonstrates promise, but it is still a surgical procedure, causing significantly more pain and disability than the non-surgical approaches outlined above.  This technique has demonstrated as high as a 25% short term failure rate.
 Evidence of Use for the CRH O’Regan System
 A large 2005 study of the CRH O’Regan System reported the lowest hemorrhoid treatment complication rate ever published at 16 out of 5,424 procedures, or 0.3%. Post-band bleed occurred in eight patients (0.4%), post-band pain in three patients (0.2%) and post-band thrombosis in five patients (0.3%). No other complications were observed. Compared to conventional rubber band ligation, these figures demonstrate a ten-fold reduction in complications. The results also showed the CRH O’Regan System to have lower recurrence (4.8%) at two years than previous banding techniques (12%) or even hemorrhoidectomy (5-8%). However, patient compliance with dietary changes and recommended bowel habits may have marked influence on recurrence rates and long-term studies to confirm whether this distinction exists at late follow-up have not been conducted.
 A 2006 study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness and complications associated with rubber band ligation using the CRH O’Regan System. The study included treatment for 60 patients and no major complications were noted. The study concluded that the CRH O’Regan System is associated with a good response and low complication rate. Minor early and late bleeding was reported in 10% and 6.7% of patients, respectively, but none was severe. Pain occurred in 6.7% of patients but was not severe. In all cases clinical and endoscopic improvement was observed and patients of all ages, including the elderly, were found to be tolerant to the procedure. The study concluded the technique is a safe and reliable treatment option.
 A 2008 study involving 113 patients and a total of 257 banding events concluded that the outpatient treatment of hemorrhoids by GIs using the CRH O’Regan System is safe and effective. Initial symptoms were resolved in 94% of patients, and rectal bleeding resolved in 90% of patients after at least one banding event. These results were sustained at three months. There were no cases of pelvic sepsis. Patient satisfaction with the CRH O’Regan System was high. Overall, 81% of patients were highly satisfied with their treatment and 75% of patients said they would choose this therapy again over a surgical option and/or recommend it to a friend. Patients do not require time off from work after the procedure.
 A 2010 study titled The Long Term Results of Hemorrhoid Banding Using the O’Regan Disposable Suction Ligator, involved 20,286 ligations with the CRH O’Regan System on 6,690 patients. The results indicated an 8% recurrence of all three hemorrhoids over an average of 42 months 
and a 5% partial recurrence (one or two hemorrhoids). Complications were 0.2% per band or 0.6% per course of treatment. In light of the low recurrence and partial recurrence rates, the study concluded that the use of the CRH O’Regan System was a significant improvement on Barron’s original rubber band ligation device and that the CRH O’Regan System has performed well since its introduction. 
 In order to improve ease of use and patient comfort, the Company began distributing its upgraded ligator in 2016. The
 improved CRH O’Regan System incorporated a built-in 
obturator which eases insertion as well as limits the trauma that can be inflicted by utilizing an alternative device with an “open jaw.” The “anti-pinch” feature further adds to patient comfort, and a f
eature which helps to prevent misfires makes the device more reliable when treating patients.  These upgrades have improved the safety profile of the device and have 
further reduced patient pain and post-banding complaints. 
 Commercialization Strategies
 I
n 2008, as a strategy to achieve rapid adoption of the CRH O’Regan System by a broader segment of the medical community, the Company began developing the capability to bring our CRH O’Regan System directly to physicians. We believe this strategy, called th
e “Direct-to-Physician Program,
” positions the Company to increase the number of physicians who use 
utilize its 
products and 
capture more 
market share while building brand awareness and value.

An estimated 15 million colonoscopies are performed annually in the United States by approximately 14,000 GIs. Studies have shown that as many as 40% of colonoscopies demonstrate significant hemorrhoidal changes. Given that hemorrhoids are a common indication for seeking medical attention, they have also placed a considerable financial burden on the health care system. A recent study in the American Journal of Gastroenterology estimated that $2.4 billion in hemorrhoid related claims were accrued by 2.5 million employer insured patients in 2014. In equipping physicians with a definitive treatment option which reduces the frequency of repeated office visits and unnecessary screening, CRH also supports them in offering value-based care by reducing the costs associated with ineffective hemorrhoid treatment.
 Given that gastroenterologists perform the majority of colonoscopies in the United States, CRH’s Direct-to-Physician Program specifically targets these providers because they are regularly diagnosing hemorrhoids and are able to adequately screen patients prior to the procedure. CRH is actively expanding the Direct-to-Physician Program by targeting the distribution of the CRH O’Regan System directly to the over 14,000 GIs practicing in the United States. CRH utilizes many methods to create awareness and demand for the CRH O’Regan System. Awareness is created through a number of channels and tactics, including key opinion leader endorsement and GI word-of-mouth; articles and advertisements in professional journals and publications; “Grand Rounds”-type presentations at academic institutions and Gastroenterology Fellowship Training Programs; exhibits and product demonstrations at GI conferences; and targeted email and direct mail campaigns. The information on the CRH O’Regan System website, including procedure videos and published research, also serves as an educational tool and an important source of awareness to the GI community. To date, CRH has provided training relating to the use of the CRH O’Regan System to approximately 3,200 GI’s at over 1,200 practices.
 The Company is introducing the CRH O’Regan System into the curriculum of the approximately 190 academic and hospital-based Gastroenterology Fellowship Programs throughout the United States as perianal care is not traditionally a topic covered during training. The treatment of hemorrhoids is a natural extension of the GI practice. Hemorrhoid treatment with the CRH O’Regan System expands the continuum of care and provides a fast and painless solution to patients. Since many hemorrhoid patients also require colonoscopy and other endoscopic services, adoption of the CRH O’Regan System creates additional patient and procedural revenue for the GIs’ traditional practice.
 In addition, the 
integration of the CRH O’Regan System into a GI practice 

may increase practice revenues. For example, the treatment of patients using the CRH O’Regan System generates an hourly procedural reimbursement approximately equal to or greater than that of colonoscopy procedures. Offering these treatments also brings new patients into the practice, many of whom require additional diagnostic procedures.  Moreover, the reimbursement is typically generated without the need for any additional staff, capital expenditures or facility requirements.
 In contrast to other treatment modalities, the CRH O’Regan System procedure takes less than a minute to perform, does not require anesthesia or bowel preparation, is well tolerated by patients, and can be performed in an office setting as well as in ASCs. The CRH O’Regan System is totally disposable and does not require any capital investment.
 CRH provides a comprehensive support program for GI practices, including providing clinical training, operational training and marketing programs and materials.
 CRH provides physician-to-physician training for GIs at their own practice setting with patients they identify and recruit for treatment. This enables the GI to see a variety of pathologies and learn the procedure by treating patients in a “hands-on” manner, ultimately leading to a greater comfort level with the technology and the associated necessary treatment protocols. These initial patients are also then scheduled for subsequent bandings, contributing to the start-up and growth of hemorrhoid procedures within the practice.
 CRH also provides operational training and support to ensure that GI office staff are comfortable describing the procedure and are able to address the questions most frequently asked by hemorrhoid sufferers seeking our treatment. The training includes hemorrhoid education, technology facts, phone scripts, frequently-asked questions, optimal patient flow processes and scheduling methodologies, and a billing and coding overview. In addition, CRH provides hemorrhoid content that may be added to the GI practice website. The goal is to ensure that the GI practice can effectively convert treatment inquiries into patient appointments and bring new patients in.
 CRH provides a comprehensive marketing support program to assist GIs with integrating the CRH O’Regan System into their practice. Marketing programs and materials are available at no charge and are designed to quickly and effectively educate new and existing patients about the procedure.

CRH also provides web-based marketing resources to GI practices by adding their practice profile to the CRH website. The CRH consumer website (www.crhsystem.com) directs hemorrhoid sufferers to trained physicians near them who offer our procedure. The creation of a direct link between the practice website and the CRH website has been one of the most beneficial tools for driving new patients to our GI partner practices. Information contained on, or accessible through, our website is not a part of this Annual Report, and the inclusion of our website address in this Annual Report is an inactive textual reference.
 Specialized Skill & Knowledge
 The Company’s management, medical and support teams have developed specific skills and knowledge in the U.S. healthcare market from the Company’s prior operation of Centers for Colorectal Health and many years managing and developing its Direc
t-to-Physician Program. We believe that the extent and breadth of the Company’s experience delivering 
healthcare services, developed through years of operating across multiple U.S. states, have provided 
it with a national scope of knowledge that is not eas
ily acquired or replicated. On a national scale, there 
is a significant amount of fragmentation of legal requirements, divergence in 
medical service reimbursement levels, and local healthcare contracting that the Company must evaluate prior to penetrating 
any particular market. Over the course of its operating history, we believe 
the Company has acquired the knowledge necessary 
to gather and process the critical information required to measure quantifiable decisions to enter prospective markets. The Company
 continues to develop 
this knowledge and expertise 
by expanding the know-how of its existing management and acquiring new personnel with the requisite skill sets.
 Competition
 The majority of rubber band ligation procedures are performed using metal re-usable ligators and retractors. In the same way that disposable syringes have replaced re-usable syringes in most medical applications, disposable ligators have replaced re-usable
 ligators. The table below compares the CRH O’Regan Ligator to the traditional ligation 
device and other hemorrhoid treatment devices.

Foreign Operations
 While the Company’s headquarters are in Vancouver, British Columbia, substantially all of the Company’s revenues from sales of the CRH O’Regan System are generated in the United States.

Regulatory Approval
 The FDA, Health Canada, and comparable agencies in other foreign countries impose requirements upon the design, development, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of medical devices. The applicable regulations require clearance or approval before the devices can be sold. After the applicable approvals and/or clearances are granted the regulatory agencies require companies to comply with quality system requirements, investigate complaints, report and investigate certain adverse events and device malfunctions, comply with marketing restrictions and maintain annual registrations.
 The Company has FDA 510(k) clearance (K963166 and K020702) for the United States and Medical Device License #65043 for Health Canada. These registrations are legal prerequisites for the Company to market and sell the CRH O’Regan Ligator, Anoscope and CRH O’Regan System in the United States and Canada, and many countries worldwide that accept these registrations. The Company sub-contracts the design and manufacture of its O’Regan products to a Canadian manufacturer that holds certification for CRH products to ISO13485:2016 MDSAP.  As the applicable holder, however, the Company remains responsible for compliance with the regulatory laws applicable to the manufacture and sale of the medical devices.
 For a more fulsome description of 
the regulations applicable to the Company’s products and services, see the section below titled “Government Regulation.”
 Operations and Manufacturing
 The Company manages sub-contracted activities and Quality Management System activities to ensure compliance with the requirements of ISO 13485:2016 MDSAP and Current Good Manufacturing Practice and is committed to continuously improve the quality of our products and services to better satisfy the needs and expectations of our customers.
 All subcontractors are monitored and evaluated on a regular basis to ensure the highest quality product. We manage the activities of our supply chain on a continuous basis. While the Company has outsourced design and manufacturing activities, we maintain direct control over customer service activities to ensure that we provide our best service to our customers. Through an established system of customer feedback we are able to monitor for signs of quality problems and customer issues.
 Customer, Professional and Technical Services
 The Company has established a feedback system to provide early warning of quality problems and to determine whether it has met the customer’s requirements. Customer complaints, expressions of satisfaction and other unsolicited customer feedback are collect
ed and processed by Customer Service. As discussed above, our licensed physician medical directors provide professional and consultative support to our Customers.
 Cycles and Economic Dependence
 The provision of healthcare services in the United States has changed as a result of the shifts within the healthcare insurance market. Some of these shifts include a decline in overall Health Maintenance Organization market-share due to patients demand to see “out of network” physicians. Other shifts are high deductible plans and health savings plans that are shifting the burden of healthcare expenditures directly to patients. These shifts have an effect on the frequency and the types of treatment that patients will seek and thus have an effect on treatments that may be considered elective. Although the treatment of hemorrhoids with ligation is a covered procedure by most insurance plans, some patients may still consider the treatment as elective due to the above factors.
 The Company is economically dependent on one critical supplier for the CRH O’Regan System. The supplier, a clean room injection molding manufacturing company based in Ontario, Canada, performs contract manufacturing and assembly for the Company. Currently, the Company has one set of manufacturing molds for each product produced, which is used for the injection molding and these molds are inventoried at the supplier’s facility. See the risk factor titled “Our dependence on suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations” in Item 1A.
 Revenue from the sale of the CRH O’Regan System was $10,078,843 and $10,959,215 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Many healthcare plans in the United States have deductibles and other patient related costs for the treatment of hemorrhoids. As a result of these plans, and other factors, the Company may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue.  
 Intellectual Property
 A vital part of the Company’s business strategy is to protect its products and technologies through the use of patents, proprietary technologies and trademarks, to the extent available. Success will depend, in part, upon the ability to obtain and enforce strong patents, to maintain trade secret protection and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. Current CRH policy is to seek patent protection for proprietary technology whenever and wherever commercially practical. CRH has acquired or received patents for marketing in the United States, Canada, Europe and in some parts of Asia. See the risk factor titled “If we are unable to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property, our competitive position could be impaired” in Item 1A.
 10
 

As of December 31, 2019, our patent portfolio consists of 11 issued U.S. and foreign patents and 4 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications. Of these, our issued patents expire between approximately 2021 and 2034. Pursuant to an agreement dated May 8, 2001 as amended, the Company acquired the patent and all other rights to the CRH O’Regan Ligator from Dr. Patrick J. O’Regan, a former director of the Company, in exchange for common shares of the Company. The patent regarding the CRH O’Regan Ligator was registered in the name of the Company in the patent office on August 27, 2002. The CRH O’Regan System consists of the CRH O’Regan Ligator and the slotted Anoscope. The CRH O’Regan Ligator is a disposable, minimally invasive hemorrhoid banding device. The CRH O’Regan Ligator was patented in the United States by Dr. Patrick O’Regan.
In addition, we also have 3 U.S. and foreign trademark registrations.
 We routinely monitor the status of existing and emerging intellectual property disclosed by third parties that may impact our business, and to the extent we identify any such disclosures, evaluate them and take appropriate courses of action. We also protect our proprietary information by ensuring that our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors execute agreements requiring non-disclosure and assignment of inventions prior to their engagement.
 Gastroenterology Anesthesia Services
 In 2014, CRH added a full-service gastroenterology anesthesia service with the platform purchase of Gastroenterology Anesthesia Associates, LLC (“GAA”).  In all, CRH has since completed 25 anesthesia acquisitions to date. The Company provides anesthesia services for patients undergoing endoscopic procedures performed by GIs in Ambulatory Surgery Centers (“ASC’s”) in the United States. Most commonly this is propofol sedation for upper endoscopy and lower endoscopy procedures performed in ASCs. As part of each acquisition, the Company enters into a service agreement with each ASC to become the exclusive provider of anesthesia services at that location. In return, CRH undertakes to staff the facility with the appropriately trained and experienced anesthetists and board-certified anesthesiologists. The Company receives and records revenue through fee for service arrangements with commercial and government insurance providers. The serviced GI group or ASC is not responsible for payment for the procedure. 
 The Company currently provides anesthesia services in 58 GI-focused ASCs in 11 states, to more than 378,000 patients per year, using a team of more than 500 Certified Registered Nurse Anesthetists and Physician Anesthesiologists.
 Evidence of Use
 Based upon Medicare claims data, more than 50% of the approximately 25 million GI endoscopy procedures are performed with monitored anesthesia care. The remaining procedures use moderate sedation, typically by combining an opioid and benzodiazepine (e.g. the fentanyl-Versed regimen), which does not require the involvement of an anesthetist. 
 The use of anesthesia for GI endoscopic procedures has shown a significant increase in use over the last decade. A Medicare cohort study showed an anesthesia utilizatio
n rate of 11% in 2000, rising to 23.4% in 2006, while a published survey of commercial payor data showed anesthesia was used in 13.6% of cases in 2003, increasing to 35.5% in 2009, and was forecasted to increase to 53.7% during 2015. We believe anesthesia for GI endoscopy is the standard of care and that adoption will continue to increase.
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (“CDC”) launched the Screen for Life: National Colorectal Cancer Action Campaign in 1999 with the goal of raising awareness about the importance of colorectal cancer screening. As of 2016, the program found that only 67.3% of U.S. adults were up to date with their colorectal screening. The campaign’s goal was to have 80% of the population between the ages of 50 and 75 up to date on their screening by 2018.
 The United States Census Bureau projects that the number of Americans between the ages of 50 to 75, the group targeted for screening, will grow from 91 million in 2014 to 99 million in 2020. Assuming 80% of that population gets screened, as targeted by the CDC, an additional 6.4 million colonoscopies would have to be performed in that period.
 Physician and Patient Preference
 GIs prefer Propofol sedation due to its pharmacologic properties that include rapid onset, rapid recovery and fewer recovery-associated symptoms compared to moderate sedation. This is associated with increased patient compliance during the procedure and less utilization of resources during recovery, which can improve costs, procedure throughput and scheduling efficiency.
 Patients also strongly prefer the use of anesthesia, which allows for a more comfortable procedure and a reduced recovery time that is free from nausea, memory loss and drowsiness associated with the moderate sedation regimen.

Commercialization Strategies
 The Company’s anesthesia business strategy has been to establish itself as a high quality, reliable provider of anesthesia services to ASCs performing GI endoscopies. There are approximately 1,000 single-specialty-GI Medicare certified ASCs in the United States, of which the Company currently serves 58. The Company expects to further penetrate the market through its acquisition and partnering 
strategies, with the goal of increasing the number of facilities in which it serves.
 As with GAA and the Company’s other 24 acquisitions, the Company seeks to acquire or partner with established GI-focused anesthesia groups. GI anesthesia acquisitions consist of either a 100% acquisition, joint venture acquisition, or other partnering structure where the Company acquires or obtains a controlling interest. The joint venture model allows the physician group to participate in the management of the anesthesia service, but also to realize value in a portion of their anesthesia business while retaining an ongoing revenue stream and reducing risk from an operational, regulatory, and reimbursement standpoint. The acquired anesthesia group provides anesthesia services to the partner ASC under a professional services agreement.
 We believe there are many GI grou
ps that 
lack the knowledge and resources to launch and maintain their own anesthesia group. To address these opportunities
, the Company has created a Monitored Anesthesia Care (“MAC”) Development Program as an option for groups wishing to provide anesthesia services to their patients. This arrangement provides greater control over the anesthesia services through a co-management arrangement with the Company while also providing additional revenue for the physicians. These business arrangements include the initial development and ongoing management of the anesthesia group for a fee, equity or a combination of both. Additionally, CRH may be provided a future opportunity to purchase a controlling interest in the anesthesia group. In each case, the Company integrates the acquired professional service agreements into its established billing and staffing processes to maximize quality assurance and efficiencies.
 There are some GI groups, for one reason or another, that may not be candidates for an acquisition but would still benefit from a relationship with CRH. This could include CRH’s typical joint venture model, but without a transaction. In other cases, a management agreement that simply provides management services for a fee is the most appropriate, and yet provides the basis of a relationship for a potential future transaction. 
 Overall, these acquisitions and other models generally experience annual volume growth, primarily driven by patient case growth of the referring GI group. 
 CRH provides an anesthesia services solution that integrates quickly with the GI group practice with little or no disruption. While the GIs are actively involved with CRH in establishing the anesthesia group, CRH’s involvement allows GIs to focus more on their core business of endoscopic procedures to achieve great results for their patients. In addition to the daily assistance in the management of the anesthesia group through billing, collections, staff recruitment, credentialing, and scheduling, those partnering with CRH take advantage
 of our quality assurance and 
quality improvement program, data collection and reporting, and patient questionnaires. We believe that all of these processes are critical to measuring quality and treatment outcomes, but without CRH, all of these processes can be a challenge for many GI practices to manage on their own.  
 CRH has established itself as a long-standing, trusted partner in the GI community through the CRH O’Regan System due to its focus on the patient and by providing a level of service to both the GI and practice staff that we believe is unparalleled in the industry. CRH Anesthesia Services continues to achieve this same high level of quality and service, while leveraging the relationships that have been established with approximately 3,200 GIs throughout the country to date. 
 As a result, we believe the Company has established its reputation as a high-quality provider of, anesthesia services, thereby fostering maintenance and adoption of its services. This may lead to other non-GI anesthesia opportunities in the future.
 Specialized Skill and Knowledge
 The Company maintains national medical directors responsible for reviewing, implementing and supporting evidence based clinical practices. The Company’s clinical and operational thought leaders serve on the Quality Management Committee, chartered to help drive the clinical quality of the Company and to ensure that all patients receive the highest quality of care. Committee members review specific cases, research, survey readiness practices and various other data with the intent to continuously enhance their understanding of anesthesia care and to disseminate learnings and best practices Company-wide. Often these learnings are transferred through on-site provider education sessions and in-services.

To support the independent needs of providers, the Company offers both full-time as well as intermittent work schedules and compensation structures. The Company has insourced recruitment to ensure alignment and focuses efforts on experienced providers, typically maintaining three or more years of clinical experience. A defined provider on-boarding process orients each provider to their respective facilities and clinical policies and procedures of the Company. Once onboarded, the ability to retain these providers resides in the Company’s competitive compensation and benefits, strong clinical support and expansive clinical opportunities across the broad portfolio of sites nationally. 
 The Company focuses diligently on the overall patient experience delivered across the communities served. Patient experience is measured through a survey system, offering real-time patient and caregiver insights. Feedback from the surveys is consistently monitored at the local level as well as by the centralized Quality Management Committee in order to drive change. 
 Additional areas of expertise include payer and provider credentialing, payer contracting and revenue cycle management and optimization, which is provided through an exclusive relationship with an outsourced provider. These key practices ensure continual alignment with regulatory requirements as well as the efficient and optimal collection of revenue. 
 The Company has streamlined and standardized their ability to deliver these specialized skills to businesses through their dedicated integration resources. The integration team ensures a seamless transition and onboarding experience for GI physicians and anesthesia providers alike.  As part of the integration process, clinical and regulatory compliance policies and practices promote ethical and compliant practices, while also providing internal controls to proactively address any identified potential concerns. Fundamentals include provider education and access to compliance leadership to report and address potential concerns or non-compliant behaviors. 
 Competition
 The majority of GI ASCs are currently utilizing anesthesia services for its endoscopic procedures through groups affiliated with their GI practice. It is these groups the Company targets for acquisition or partnership. The remainder primarily utilize 3rd party management or staffing companies. These 3rd parties are generally small, fragmented, and not well-capitalized, offering a more limited opportunity for acquisition.
 Those GI ASCs not currently utilizing anesthesia for its endoscopic procedures are targets for the Company’s MAC Development Program. Local 3rd party management and staffing companies compete for these programs, however they do not offer the GI ASCs the same breadth of services, nor the potential for a future acquisition. 
 Additionally, large GI practices, increasingly led by private equity groups, are active in acquiring and consolidating physician practices, including related ancillary services, such as GI anesthesia.  The Company believes its best-in-class offering provides a compelling service partnership opportunity to these platforms, allowing them to scale without being distracted by trying to resource and manage a non-core function.
 The Company plans to continue to primarily focus on the GI market and leverage its reputation for high-quality value-added service, established through its CRH O’Regan System business, to consolidate the market and further establish itself as a trusted anesthesia provider.
 Intangible Properties
 The Company’s intangible properties pertaining to the anesthesia business include its exclusive professional service agreements with each of the serviced facilities. The majority of our agreements are multi-year and contain auto-renewal features.
Foreign Operations
 While the Company’s headquarters are in Vancouver, British Columbia, all of the Company’s revenues for anesthesia services are generated in the United States. 
 Economic Dependence
 Though highly recommended, GI endoscopies such as colorectal screenings, are primarily elective procedures and are therefore susceptible to the dynamics of the general economy, which can influence the proportion of the population covered by private insurance and the number of patients willing to pay relevant copays and deductibles, thereby influencing overall procedure volumes.

The Company’s anesthesia services are dependent upon the continuous recruitment and retention of qualified Anesthetists and Anesthesiologists. As the demand for Anesthetists and Anesthesiologists in hospitals and non GI ASC’s increases, there is a potential for cost increases and competition for these resources. See the risk factor titled “Our ability to successfully recruit and retain qualified anesthesiologists or other independent contractors” in Item 1A.
 The Company’s anesthesia services rely upon the ample and continual supply of Propofol or potential sedation alternative. When necessary, CRH currently sources Propofol through supply agreements with narcotics manufacturers and its physicians and medical practitioners. See the risk factor titled “Our dependence on suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations” in Item 1A.
 
We depend primarily on U.S. government, third party commercial and private and governmental third-party sources of payment for the services provided to patients. The amount we receive for our services may be adversely affected by market and cost factors, as well as other factors over which we have no control, including changes to the Medicare and Medicaid payment systems. For a description of the risks relating to changes in U.S. government health care programs, see the risk factors titled “Changes to payment rates or methods of third-party payors, including United States government healthcare programs, changes to the United States laws and regulations that regulate payments for medical services, the failure of payment rates to increase as our costs increase, or changes to our payor mix, could adversely affect our operating margins and revenues”, “We are unable to predict the impact of health reform initiatives, including reform initiatives relating to the ACA”, and “Congress or states may enact laws restricting the amount out-of-network providers of services can charge and recover for such services”  in Item 1A.
 Though the co-pay and deductible for anesthesia during screening colonoscopies was eliminated in 2015 as a part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, the “PPACA”), many private healthcare plans in the United States have deductibles and other patient-related costs. As a result of these plans, payor mix, and other factors, the Company may experience fluctuations in quarterly revenue.
 Revenue from anesthesia services was $110,306,431 and $101,790,165 for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. This increase in anesthesia revenue was driven by organic growth in patient cases and deployment of available capital for acquisitions, and we expect these to be similar drivers in the future.
 Research and Development
 The Company is not engaged in any research and development activities.
 Government Regulation 
 Healthcare Reform
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the “ACA”) contains a number of provisions that have affected us and, absent amendment or repeal, may continue to affect us over the next several years. These provisions include the establishment of health insurance exchanges to facilitate the purchase of qualified health plans, expanded Medicaid eligibility, subsidized insurance premiums and additional requirements and incentives for businesses to provide healthcare benefits. Other provisions have expanded the scope and reach of the Federal Civil False Claims Act and other healthcare fraud and abuse laws. Moreover, we could be affected by potential changes to various aspects of the ACA, including changes to subsidies, healthcare insurance marketplaces and Medicaid expansion.
 The ACA remains subject to continuing legislative and administrative flux and uncertainty. In 2017, Congress unsuccessfully sought to replace substantial parts of the ACA with different mechanisms for facilitating insurance coverage in the commercial and Medicaid markets. Congress may again attempt to enact substantial or target changes to the ACA in the future. Additionally, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) has administratively revised a number of provisions and may seek to advance additional significant changes through regulation, guidance and enforcement in the future.
 At the end of 2017, Congress repealed the part of the ACA that required most individuals to purchase and maintain health insurance or face a tax penalty, known as the individual mandate. In light of these changes, in December 2018, a federal district court in Texas declared that key portions of the ACA were inconsistent with the United States Constitution and that the entire ACA is invalid as a result. Several states appealed this decision, and in December 2019, a federal court of appeals upheld the district court’s conclusion that part of the ACA is unconstitutional but remanded for further evaluation whether in light of this defect the entire ACA must be invalidated. These legal proceedings are likely to continue for several years, and the fate of the ACA will be unresolved and uncertain during this period.

In 2020, there will be federal and state elections that could affect which persons and parties occupy the Office of the President of the United States, control one or both chambers of Congress and many states’ governors and legislatures. Many candidates running for President of the United States are proposing sweeping changes to the U.S. healthcare system, including replacing current healthcare financing mechanisms with systems that would be entirely administered by the federal government.
 If the ACA is repealed or further substantially modified by judicial, legislative or administrative action, or if implementation of certain aspects of the ACA are diluted, delayed or replaced with a “Medicare for All” or single payor system, such repeal, modification or delay may impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities. We are unable to predict the impact of any repeal, modification or delay in the implementation of the ACA, including the repeal of the individual mandate or implementation of a single payor system, on us at this time.
 The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act
 Medicare pays for most physician services based upon a national service-specific fee schedule. The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act (“MACRA”) provided physicians 0.5% annual increases in reimbursement through 2019 as Medicare transitioned to a payment system designed to reward physicians for the quality of care provided, rather than the quantity of procedures performed. MACRA requires physicians to choose to participate in one of two payment formulas, Merit-Based Incentive Payment System (“MIPS”) or Alternative Payment Models (“APMs”). Beginning in 2020, MIPS will allow eligible physicians to receive incentive payments based on the achievement of certain quality and cost metrics, among other measures, and be reduced for those who are underperforming against those same metrics and measures. As an alternative, physicians can choose to participate in advanced APMs, and physicians who are meaningful participants in APMs will receive bonus payments from Medicare pursuant to the law. MACRA also remains subject to review and potential modification by Congress, as well as shifting regulatory requirements established by CMS. Our affiliated physicians achieved bonus payments in 2020 through participation in the MIPS, although the amounts of such bonus payments is not currently known. We will continue to operationalize the provisions of MACRA and assess any further changes to the law or additional regulations enacted pursuant to the law.
 We cannot predict the ultimate effect that these changes will have on us, nor can we provide any assurance that its provisions will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.
 “Surprise” Billing Legislation
 “Surprise” medical bills arise when an insured patient receives care from an out-of-network provider resulting in costs that were not expected by the patient. The bill is a “surprise” either because the patient did not expect to receive care from an out-of-network provider, or because their cost-sharing responsibility is higher than the patient expected. For the past several years, state legislatures have been enacting laws that are intended to address the problems associated with surprise billing or balance billing.
 More recently, Congress and President Trump have proposed bipartisan solutions to address this circumstance, either by working in tandem with, or in the absence of, applicable state laws. Several committees of jurisdiction in the U.S. House of Representatives and in the U.S. Senate have proposed solutions to address surprise medical bills, but it is unclear whether any of the proposed solutions will become law. In addition, state legislatures and regulatory bodies continue to address and modify existing laws on the same issue. Any state or federal legislation on the topic of surprise billing may have an unfavorable impact on out-of-network reimbursement that we receive. In addition, actual or prospective legislative changes in this area may impact, and may have impacted, our ability to contract with private payors at favorable reimbursement rates or remain in contract with such payors.
 We cannot predict the ultimate effect that these changes will have on us, nor can we provide any assurance that future legislation or regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and the trading price of our securities.
 Employees
 As of December 31, 2019, we had 44 employees supporting our CRH O’Regan business, CRH Anesthesia Management LLC and corporate operations.  In addition, we have 351 employed anesthesia providers, including 105 full-time, 6 part-time, and relationships with 241 independent contractors and other third party providers in connection with the Company’s anesthesia services business. None of our employees are represented by a labor organization or covered by a collective bargaining arrangement. We consider our relationship with our employees and independent contractors to be excellent.
