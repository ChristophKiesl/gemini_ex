Item 1.Business.
GENERAL DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS
Oceaneering International, Inc. is a global provider of engineered services and products, primarily to the offshore oil and gas industry. Oceaneering also serves the offshore renewables, defense, aerospace and commercial theme park industries. Oceaneering was organized as a Delaware corporation in 1969 out of the combination of three diving service companies founded in the early 1960s. Since our establishment, we have concentrated on the development and marketing of underwater services and products to meet customer needs requiring the use of advanced technology. We believe we are one of the world's largest underwater services contractors. The services and products we provide to the energy industry include remotely operated vehicles, specialty subsea hardware, engineering and project management, subsea intervention services, including manned diving, survey and positioning services, seabed preparation and asset integrity and nondestructive testing services. Our foreign operations, principally in the North Sea, Africa, Brazil, Australia and Asia, accounted for approximately 53% of our revenue, or $967 million, for the year ended December 31, 2020.
Realignment of Reportable Segments
As described in Note 11—“Operations by Business Segment and Geographic Area” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report, in the third quarter of 2020, we changed our organizational structure as part of the transformation to realign our businesses to achieve greater cost efficiencies and to bring together business units that frequently work together and promote increased synergies in bidding, project management and the use of offshore technicians. As a result, information that our chief operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore, for the years ended December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, we are reporting our financial results consistent with our newly realigned operating segments and have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage our businesses and monitor segment performance. Our new structure aligns our company around five reportable segments: (1) Subsea Robotics; (2) Manufactured Products; (3) Offshore Projects Group; (4) Integrity Management & Digital Solutions; and (5) Aerospace and Defense Technologies.
Our business segments are contained within two businesses – services and products provided primarily to the oil and gas industry, and to a lesser extent, the offshore renewables and mobility solutions industries (“Energy Services and Products”) and services and products provided to non-energy industries (“Aerospace and Defense Technologies”). Our four business segments within the Energy Services and Products business are Subsea Robotics, Manufactured Products, Offshore Projects Group and Integrity Management & Digital Solutions. We report our Aerospace and Defense Technologies business as one segment. Unallocated Expenses are expenses not associated with a specific business segment. These consist of expenses related to our incentive and deferred compensation plans, including restricted stock and bonuses, as well as other general expenses.
Energy Services and Products. The primary focus of our Energy Services and Products business over the last several years has been toward leveraging our asset base and capabilities for providing services and products for offshore energy operations and subsea completions, inclusive of our customers' operating expenses and the offshore renewable energy market.
Subsea Robotics. Our Subsea Robotics segment consists of our Remotely Operated Vehicles (“ROVs”), survey services and ROV tooling businesses, merging our underwater robotics and automation capabilities with our subsea delivery systems. Our Subsea Robotics segment consists of our prior ROV segment, and ROV tooling (previously in our Subsea Products segment) and survey services (previously in our Subsea Projects segment).
We provide ROVs, which are tethered submersible vehicles remotely operated from the surface, to customers in the energy industry for drilling support and vessel-based services, including subsea hardware installation, construction, pipeline inspection, survey and facilities inspection, maintenance and repair (“IMR”). We design, build, retrofit and upgrade our new and existing ROVs at in-house facilities, the largest of which is in Morgan City, Louisiana. In 2020, we added three ROVs to our fleet and retired three. Our work-class ROV fleet size was 250 as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, and 275 as of December 31, 2018.
Manufactured Products. Our Manufactured Products segment consists of our manufactured products business (previously in our Subsea Products segment), as well as theme park entertainment systems and automated guided vehicles (“AGV”) (both previously in our Advanced Technologies segment).
Our Manufactured Products segment provides distribution systems such as production control umbilicals and connection systems made up of specialty subsea hardware, and provides turnkey solutions that include program management, engineering design, fabrication/assembly and installation to the commercial theme park industry and mobile robotics solutions, including AGV technology to a variety of industries.
We provide various types of subsea umbilicals through our Umbilical Solutions division from plants in the United States, Scotland and Brazil. Offshore operators use umbilicals to control subsea wellhead hydrocarbon flow rates, monitor downhole and wellhead conditions and perform chemical injection. Subsea umbilicals are also used to provide power and fluids to other subsea processing hardware, including pumps and gas separation equipment.
Offshore Projects Group. Our Offshore Projects Group (“OPG”) segment consists of: (1) our prior Subsea Projects segment, less survey services and global data solutions; and (2) our service and rental business, less ROV tooling (previously in our Subsea Products segment). This combination brings together business units that frequently work together and promotes increased efficiency in bidding, project management, and the use of offshore technicians. 
Our OPG segment provides a broad portfolio of integrated subsea project capabilities and solutions. Our OPG segment provides the following:
•subsea installation and intervention, including riserless light well intervention (“RLWI”) services and inspection, maintenance and repair (“IMR”) services, utilizing owned and chartered vessels;
•installation and workover control systems (“IWOCS”) and ROV workover control systems (“RWOCS”);
•project management and engineering; and
•seabed preparation, route clearance and trenching services for submarine cables for the renewable energy markets.
Our OPG segment provides services principally in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore Angola, utilizing a fleet consisting of three owned and three chartered dynamically positioned deepwater vessels with integrated high-specification work-class ROVs onboard, and two owned shallow water diving support and survey vessels, other spot-chartered vessels and other assets. Our owned vessels are Jones Act-compliant. The dynamically positioned vessels are equipped with thrusters that allow them to maintain a constant position at a location without the use of anchors. They are used in the IMR of subsea facilities, pipeline or flowline tie-ins, pipeline crossings and installations. These vessels can also carry and install equipment or umbilicals required to bring subsea well completions into production (tie-back to production facilities). With our acquisition of Ecosse Subsea Limited (“Ecosse”) in 2018, further described below, we provide route clearance and trenching services.
We previously had several deepwater vessels under long-term charter. The last of our long-term charters expired in March 2018. With the current vessel market conditions, we have entered into some minimum-day, short-term, time charter party agreements and, for specific projects, we continue to charter on a back-to-back basis with the vessel owners. This generally minimizes our contract exposure by closely matching our obligations with our revenue.
In March 2018, we acquired Ecosse for approximately $68 million. Ecosse builds and operates tools for seabed preparation, route clearance and trenching for the installation of submarine cables and pipelines. These services are offered on an integrated basis that includes vessels, ROVs and survey services. Enabling technologies acquired in the transaction include Ecosse's modular seabed system, capable of completing the entire trenching work scope (route preparation, boulder clearance, trenching and backfill), and its newly developed trenching system. These systems primarily serve the shallow water offshore renewables market.
In the second quarter of 2019, we placed our new-build, Jones Act-compliant, multiservice vessel (“MSV”), the Ocean Evolution, into service. The Ocean Evolution is U.S.-flagged and documented with a coastwise endorsement by the U.S. Coast Guard. The vessel has an overall length of 353 feet, a Class 2 dynamic positioning system, accommodations for 110 personnel, a helideck, a 250-ton active heave-compensated crane, a working moonpool, and two of our high specification 4,000 meter work-class ROVs. The vessel has five low-emission Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) Tier 4 diesel engines. The Tier 4 rating is the EPA’s strictest emission requirements for non-road diesel engines. The vessel is also equipped with a satellite communications system capable of transmitting streaming video for real-time work observation by shore-based personnel. The vessel is being used to 
augment our ability to provide subsea intervention services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. These services are required to perform IMR projects and hardware installations.
Integrity Management & Digital Solutions. Our IMDS segment consists of our prior Asset Integrity segment plus our global data solutions (“GDS”) and maritime shipping businesses (both previously in our Subsea Projects segment). The inclusion of GDS in this segment facilitates optimized digital and software solutions to our integrity management services. Maritime shipping, an emerging business in GDS, provides essential vessel asset, scheduling and transportation data required by customers shipping cargo by sea to make informed, value-added decisions. 
Through our IMDS segment, we provide asset integrity management, corrosion management, inspection and non-destructive testing services, principally to customers in the oil and gas, power generation, and petrochemical industries. We perform these services on both onshore and offshore facilities, both topside and subsea. We also provide software, digital and connectivity solution for the energy industry and software and analytical solutions for the bulk cargo maritime industry. 
Aerospace and Defense Technologies. Our Aerospace and Defense Technologies (“ADTech”) segment consists of our government business (previously in our Advanced Technologies segment), focused on defense subsea technologies, marine services, and space systems. 
Our ADTech segment provides government services and products including engineering and related manufacturing in defense and space exploration activities, principally to U.S. government agencies and their prime contractors.
General. During the last five years, we have also made several small acquisitions to add complementary technology or serve niche markets. We intend to continue our strategy of acquiring, as opportunities arise, additional assets or businesses, to improve our market position or expand into related service and product lines. However, our primary focus continues to be on capital discipline and generating positive free cash flows. 
DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
Energy Services and Products
Our Energy Services and Products business consists of the Subsea Robotics, Manufactured Products, Offshore Projects Group and Integrity Management & Digital Solutions segments.
Subsea Robotics. ROVs are tethered submersible vehicles remotely operated from the surface. We use our ROVs in the offshore energy industry to perform a variety of underwater tasks, including drill support, vessel-based IMR, installation and construction support, pipeline inspection and surveys, and subsea production facility operation and maintenance. Work-class ROVs are outfitted with manipulators, sonar and video cameras, and can operate specialized tooling packages and other equipment or features to facilitate the performance of specific underwater tasks. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 250 work-class ROVs. We believe we own and operate the largest fleet of work-class ROVs in the world. We also believe we are the industry leader in providing ROV services for offshore drill support, with an estimated 58% market share of the contracted floating drilling rigs at the end of 2020.

MARKETING
Energy Services and Products. Oil and gas exploration and development expenditures fluctuate from year to year. In particular, budgetary approval for more expensive drilling and production in deepwater, an area in which we have a high degree of focus, may be postponed or suspended during periods when exploration and production companies reduce their offshore capital spending. In recent years, we have focused on increasing our service and product offerings toward our oil and gas customers' operating expenses and the offshore renewable energy market.
We market our Subsea Robotics, Manufactured Products, Offshore Projects Group and Integrity Management & Digital Solutions services and products to domestic, international and foreign national oil and gas companies engaged in offshore exploration, development and production. We also provide services and products as a subcontractor to other oilfield service companies operating as prime contractors. In addition, we market our Manufactured Products mobile robotic solutions to domestic and international theme park operators, automotive manufacturers and retail warehousing operators. Customers for these services typically award contracts on a competitive-bid basis. These contracts are typically less than one year in duration, although we enter into multi-year contracts from time to time.
In connection with the services we perform in our Energy Services and Products business, we generally seek contracts that compensate us on a dayrate basis. Under dayrate contracts, the contractor provides the ROV, vessel or equipment and the required personnel to operate the unit and compensation is based on a rate per day for each day the unit is used. The typical dayrate depends on market conditions, the nature of the operations to be performed, the duration of the work, the equipment and services to be provided, the geographical areas involved 
and other variables. Dayrate contracts may also contain an alternate, lower dayrate that applies when a unit is moving to a new site or when operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns, adverse weather or water conditions or other conditions beyond the contractor's control. Contracts for our product sales are generally for a fixed price.
Aerospace and Defense Technologies.  We market our engineered products and services primarily to U.S. government agencies and their prime contractors in defense and space exploration activities. 
Major Customers. Our top five customers in 2020, 2019 and 2018 accounted for 32%, 32% and 39%, respectively, of our consolidated revenue. In 2020, 2019 and 2018, four of our top five customers were oil and gas exploration and production companies served by our Energy Services and Products business segments, with the other one being the U.S. Navy or other parts of the U.S. Government, which is served by our Aerospace and Defense Technologies segment. No individual customer accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue during 2020. During 2019, revenue from one customer, BP plc and subsidiaries, accounted for 10% of our total consolidated annual revenue. During 2018, revenue from Royal Dutch Shell and subsidiaries accounted for 10% of our total consolidated annual revenue.
Although we do not depend on any one customer, the loss of one of our significant customers could, at least on a short-term basis, have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.
RAW MATERIALS
Most of the raw materials we use in our manufacturing operations, such as steel in various forms, copper, electronic components and plastics, are available from many sources. However, some components we use to manufacture subsea umbilicals are available from limited sources. With the exception of certain kinds of steel tube, where we are limited in the number of available suppliers, we can offer alternative materials or technologies in many cases, which depends on the requisite approval of our customers. We believe we have secured a sufficient amount of steel tubes to satisfy existing backlog and anticipated orders to be produced in 2021.
COMPETITION
Our businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments.
Energy Services and Products
We are one of several companies that provide underwater services and specialty subsea hardware on a worldwide basis. We compete for contracts with companies that have worldwide operations, as well as numerous others operating locally in various areas. We believe that our ability to safely provide a wide range of underwater services and products on a worldwide basis enables us to compete effectively in all phases of the offshore oilfield life cycle. In some cases involving projects that require less sophisticated equipment, small companies have been able to bid for contracts at prices uneconomical to us. Additionally, in some jurisdictions we are subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These regulations may adversely affect our ability to compete.
The adverse impacts of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the resulting supply and demand imbalance along with lower crude oil prices are resulting in lower levels of activity and profitability. As we expect a recovery will take time to restore profitability and generate satisfactory returns, we have been reviewing our cost structure and aggressively implementing cost improvement initiatives.
Subsea Robotics. We believe we are the world's largest owner/operator of work-class ROVs employed in energy related operations. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 250 work-class ROVs. We compete with several major companies on a worldwide basis and with numerous others operating locally in various areas. Competition for ROV services, including ROV tooling, historically has been based on equipment availability, location of or ability to deploy the equipment, quality of service and price. The relative importance of these factors can vary over time based on market conditions. The ability to develop improved equipment and techniques and to train and retain skilled personnel is also an important competitive factor in our markets.
Our survey and positioning services, along with our seabed preparation, route clearance and trenching services, operate in a competitive environment as one of several companies that provide these services. 
Manufactured Products. With our manufactured products business, we are one of several companies that compete on a worldwide basis for the provision of steel tube and thermoplastic control umbilicals, and, compared to current and forecasted market demand for the currently foreseeable future, we are faced with some overcapacity in the umbilical manufacturing market.
Within our mobility solutions businesses, there are many competitors offering specialized services and products, both on a regional and global basis.
Offshore Projects Group. We perform subsea intervention and hardware installation services, principally in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and offshore Angola, from multiservice deepwater vessels. We are one of many companies that offer these services. In general, our competitors can move their vessels to where we operate from other locations with relative ease. We also have many competitors that supply commercial diving services to the oil and gas industry in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Within our service and rental business, there are many competitors offering specialized services and products both on a regional and global basis.
Integrity Management & Digital Solutions. The worldwide asset integrity and inspection markets consist of a wide range of inspection and certification requirements in many industries. We currently compete in only selected portions of this market. We are expanding our integrity management services into adjacent markets and are developing our digitization services. We believe that our broad geographic sales and operational coverage, long history of operations, technical and safety reputation, application of various inspection technologies and accreditation to international quality standards enable us to compete effectively in our selected asset integrity and inspection services market segments. 
Aerospace and Defense Technologies
Engineering services is a very broad market with a large number of competitors. We compete in specialized areas in which we can combine our extensive program management experience, mechanical engineering expertise and the capability to continue the development of conceptual project designs into the manufacture of custom equipment for customers.
SEASONALITY AND BACKLOG
We generate a material amount of our consolidated revenue from contracts for services in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in our Offshore Projects Group segment, which is usually more active in the second and third quarters, as compared to the rest of the year. The European operations of our Integrity Management & Digital Solutions segment are also seasonally more active in the second and third quarters. Revenue in our Subsea Robotics segment is subject to seasonal variations in demand, with our first quarter generally being the low quarter of the year. The level of our Subsea Robotics seasonality depends on the number of ROVs we have engaged in vessel-based subsea infrastructure IMR and installation, which is more seasonal than drilling support. Revenue in each of our Manufactured Products and Aerospace and Defense Technologies segments generally has not been seasonal.
The amounts of backlog orders we believed to be firm as of 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in millions):

† Represents amounts that were not expected to be performed within one year.

No material portion of our business is subject to renegotiation of profits or termination of contracts by the U.S. Government.
PATENTS AND LICENSES
We currently hold numerous U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications. We have acquired patents and licenses and granted licenses to others when we have considered it advantageous for us to do so. Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent or license or group of related patents or licenses as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities and the application of know-how rather than patents and licenses in the conduct of our operations.
REGULATION
Our operations are affected from time to time and in varying degrees by foreign and domestic political developments and foreign, federal and local laws and regulations, including those relating to:
•operating from and around offshore drilling, production and marine facilities;
•national preference for local equipment and personnel;
•marine vessel safety;
•protection of the environment, including pollution and climate change;
•workplace health and safety;
•data privacy;
•taxation;
•license requirements for exportation of our equipment and technology; and
•currency conversion and repatriation.
In addition, our Energy Services and Products business primarily depends on the demand for our services and products from the oil and gas industry and, therefore, is affected by changing taxes, price controls and other laws and regulations relating to the oil and gas industry generally. The adoption of laws and regulations curtailing offshore exploration and development drilling for oil and gas for economic and other policy reasons would adversely affect our operations by limiting demand for our services. We cannot determine the extent to which new legislation, new regulations or changes in existing laws or regulations may affect our future operations.
Our operations and properties are subject to a wide variety of increasingly complex and stringent foreign, federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those governing discharges into the air and water, the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes, the remediation of soil and groundwater contaminated by hazardous substances and the health and safety of employees. Sanctions for noncompliance may include revocation of permits, corrective action orders, administrative or civil penalties and criminal prosecution. Some environmental laws provide for strict, joint and several liability for remediation of spills and other releases of hazardous substances, as well as damage to natural resources. In addition, companies may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances. These laws and regulations may also expose us to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others, or for our acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed.
Environmental laws and regulations that apply to our operations include the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (each, as amended) and similar laws that provide for responses to, and liability for, releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Environmental laws and regulations also include similar foreign, state or local counterparts to the above-mentioned federal laws, which regulate air emissions, water discharges, hazardous substances and waste, and require public disclosure related to the use of various hazardous substances. Our operations are also governed by laws and regulations relating to workplace safety and worker health, primarily, in the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Act and regulations promulgated thereunder.
Compliance with federal, state and local provisions regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or relating to the protection of the environment has not had a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. We cannot predict all of the environmental requirements or circumstances that will exist in the future but anticipate that environmental control and protection standards will become increasingly stringent and 
costly. Based on our experience to date, we do not currently anticipate any material adverse effect on our business or consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows as a result of future compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations. However, future events, such as changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation, more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, or stricter or different interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require additional expenditures by us, which may be material. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will not incur significant environmental compliance costs in the future.
Our quality management systems are registered as being in conformance with ISO 9001:2015 and cover:

HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 8,300 employees, of whom approximately 40% were employed in the United States and approximately 60% were employed outside of the United States. Our workforce varies seasonally and typically peaks during the second and third quarters of each year. In 2020, we worked in approximately 50 countries across six continents and employed people representing over 100 different nationalities. 
We believe that our future success largely depends on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled employees. We provide our employees with competitive compensation packages, development programs that enable continued learning and growth, and comprehensive and competitive benefit packages worldwide. Our compensation and benefits arrangements generally are tailored to local markets of operation. Employee benefits, therefore, typically depend on role and work location.
As part of our retention and promotion efforts, we invest in ongoing leadership development. We have a strong history of internal promotion. We regularly provide our employees with training, including health, safety and environmental (“HSE”) awareness training, technical courses, management development seminars, and leadership and supervisory training. 
Our core values and culture reflect our commitments to safety, diversity and inclusion, human health, the environment, ethical business practices and responsible corporate citizenship in the communities in which we live and work around the world. All employees are responsible for upholding our core values. We believe our core values and culture foster employee engagement and innovation, and allow us to draw on our employees' skills and aspirations in a mutually beneficial way. 
Safety is a key focus of all Oceaneering operations. We have a strong HSE program that includes processes implemented by our operating groups that are aimed at preventing injuries to our employees and others with whom we work, as well as preventing damage to equipment and the environment.

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT CONCERNING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
We are including the following discussion to inform our existing and potential security holders generally of some of the risks and uncertainties that can affect our company and to take advantage of the “safe harbor” protection for forward-looking statements that applicable federal securities law affords.
From time to time, our management or persons acting on our behalf make forward-looking statements to inform existing and potential security holders about our company. These statements may include projections and estimates concerning the timing and success of specific projects and our future orders, revenue, income and capital spending. Forward-looking statements are generally accompanied by words such as “estimate,” “plan,” “project,” “predict,” “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “plan,” “forecast,” “budget,” “goal,” “may,” “should,” or other words that convey the uncertainty of future events or outcomes. In addition, sometimes we will specifically describe a statement as being a forward-looking statement and refer to this cautionary statement.
In addition, various statements this report contains, including those that express a belief, expectation or intention are forward-looking statements. Those forward-looking statements appear in Part I of this report in Item 1—“Business,” Item 2—“Properties” and Item 3—“Legal Proceedings” and in Part II of this report in Item 7—“Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” Item 7A—“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk” and in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements incorporated into Item 8 and elsewhere in this report. These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this report, we disclaim any obligation to update these statements, and we caution you not to rely unduly on them. We have based these forward-looking statements on our current expectations and assumptions about future events. While our management considers these expectations and assumptions to be reasonable, they are inherently subject to significant business, economic, competitive, regulatory and other risks, contingencies and uncertainties, most of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. These risks, contingencies and uncertainties relate to, among other matters, the following:
•factors affecting the level of activity in the energy industry, including worldwide demand for and prices of oil and natural gas, oil and natural gas production growth and the supply and demand of offshore drilling rigs;
•actions by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other oil exporting countries;
•decisions about offshore developments to be made by oil and gas exploration, development and production companies;
•decisions about offshore developments to be made by offshore renewables companies;
•the use of subsea completions and our ability to capture our share of the associated market;
•factors affecting the level of activity in each of our government and entertainment businesses, including decisions on spending and funding by the U.S. Government and capital expenditure decisions by entertainment business customers, such as theme park operators;
•general economic and business conditions and industry trends, including the ongoing transition to alternative sources of energy to reduce worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide and other “greenhouse gases”;
•the strength of the industry segments in which we are involved;
•the continuing effects of the coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic and the governmental, customer, supplier and other responses to the pandemic;
•cancellations of contracts, change orders and other contractual modifications and the resulting adjustments to our backlog;
•collections from our customers;
•our future financial performance, including as a result of the availability, terms and deployment of capital;
•the consequences of significant changes in currency exchange rates;
•the volatility and uncertainties of credit markets;
•our ability to comply with covenants in our credit agreements and other debt instruments and the availability, terms and deployment of capital; 
•changes in tax laws, regulations and interpretation by taxing authorities;
•changes in, or our ability to comply with, other laws and governmental regulations, including those relating to the environment (including pollution and climate change);
•the continued availability of qualified personnel;
•our ability to obtain raw materials and parts on a timely basis and, in some cases, from limited sources;
•operating risks normally incident to offshore exploration, development and production operations;
•hurricanes and other adverse weather and sea conditions;
•cost and time associated with drydocking of our vessels;
•the highly competitive nature of our businesses;
•adverse outcomes from legal or regulatory proceedings;
•the risks associated with integrating businesses we acquire;
•the risks associated with the transition to a more remote workforce;
•the risks associated with the use of complex information technology systems, including cybersecurity risks and the risks associated with failures to protect data privacy in accordance with applicable legal requirements and contractual provisions binding upon us;
•rapid technological changes; and
•social, political, military and economic situations in foreign countries where we do business and the possibilities of civil disturbances, war, other armed conflicts or terrorist attacks.
We believe the items we have outlined above are important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in a forward-looking statement made in this report or elsewhere by us or on our behalf. We have discussed most of these factors in more detail elsewhere in this report. These factors are not necessarily all the factors that could affect us. Unpredictable or unanticipated factors we have not discussed in this report could also have material adverse effects on actual results of matters that are the subject of our forward-looking statements. We do not intend to update our description of important factors each time a potential important factor arises. We advise our security holders that they should (1) be aware that important factors we do not refer to above could affect the accuracy of our forward-looking statements and (2) use caution and common sense when considering our forward-looking statements.
