Item 1. Business
Overview
GoPro is enabling the way people capture and share their lives from a perspective only achieved with a GoPro. What began as an idea to help athletes document themselves engaged in sport, GoPro has become a mobile storytelling solution that helps the world share itself through immersive content. To date, our cameras and mountable and wearable accessories have generated substantially all of our revenue. We sell our products globally through retailers, wholesale distributors, and on our website. 
Our product offerings include the following:

• | HERO5 is our all-new line of cloud-connected cameras launched in Fall 2016 featuring image stabilization, telemetry, cloud connectivity and voice control.


• | GoPro Plus is a new cloud-based storage solution that enables subscribers to easily access, edit and share content. HERO5 cameras can automatically upload new photos and videos to a subscriber's GoPro cloud account.


• | Quik is our primary mobile editing app that makes it simple to create stunning edits on a smartphone. Our Quik desktop app provides expanded editing options for power users.


• | Capture is a mobile app that allows users to preview and play back shots, control their GoPro cameras and share content on the fly using their smartphones.


• | Karma is our compact and foldable drone and versatile stabilization solution that includes the Karma controller, and camera stabilizer, and it all fits in a custom backpack.


• | Karma Grip is a handheld, body-mountable camera stabilizer that makes it easy to capture zero-shake, smooth video.


• | We also offer a full ecosystem of mountable, wearable and voice activated accessories. See "Products" below for additional information.

We believe our investments in hardware, cloud and mobile have yielded a solid foundational experience for consumers that we will continue to build upon in 2017.

Our strategy 
Helping our consumers capture and share experiences is at the core of our business. We are committed to developing solutions that create an easy, seamless experience for consumers to capture, create and enjoy engaging personal content. When consumers use our products and services, those products and services enable compelling, authentic content that organically increases awareness for GoPro, driving a virtuous cycle and a self-reinforcing demand for our products. We believe revenue growth may be driven by the introduction of new cameras, drones, accessories and software applications. We believe new camera features drive a replacement cycle and attract new users, and mobile editing solutions, auto-upload capabilities, local language user-interfaces and voice recognition in multiple languages drive the expansion of our total addressable market. Key components of our growth strategy for 2017 and beyond include the following: 
Drive profitability through improved efficiency, lower costs and better execution. We incurred material operating losses in 2016 and our future success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our operating expenses effectively. In the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented a company-wide restructuring of our business resulting in a global reduction-in-force, the elimination of several high-cost initiatives, including the closure of our entertainment group in order to focus our resources on our hardware and software integrated storytelling solution, and the consolidation of certain leased office facilities. (See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" below for information regarding restructuring charges in 2016 and future periods.) We believe the actions we have taken will reduce our operating expenses by more than $100 million in 2017 compared to 2016, while providing a flatter more efficient global organization that will allow for improved communication and alignment among our functional teams. For 2017 and beyond, we plan to operate efficiently while continuing to invest in those areas that we believe will grow revenue. 
Make the smartphone central to the GoPro experience. We seek to eliminate the pain point of managing content and making it a seamless and near automatic process for our users to stay engaged in an activity or moment without having to pause to document their experience. Our new cloud-connected HERO5 cameras, GoPro Plus service and Quik editing applications all work together enabling an experience that allows users to capture, auto-upload and edit content on a mobile device without ever touching an SD card or computer. We believe HERO5's auto-upload and voice control features provide game-changing experiences for consumers that we will continue to build upon in the future with our next-generation cameras. Our Quik editing applications enable users to quickly produce high-quality videos that are fun to create and easy to share across multiple platforms. We expect to continue to enhance our software and services offerings, including solutions that automate editing on-the-go and enable content transfer from GoPro cameras to mobile devices, with a focus on making the smartphone a key component in the GoPro user experience.
Market the improved GoPro experience to our extended community. We believe the global market for enabling people to self-capture compelling, immersive photo and video content of their everyday life and activities is large. To date, our business strategies have enabled us to be a leader in outdoor recreational markets such as skiing, snowboarding, surfing, motorsports, kayaking, hunting and fishing, and we continue to target other categories, such as music, families, travel and fitness. We believe many consumers in these other markets may not be as familiar with our brand and products, and while other consumers may know of our brand, have not recognized GoPro as the go-to product and service for capturing and sharing meaningful moments in their lives. We believe there is a significant opportunity for GoPro to expand awareness through the greater GoPro community of users, followers and fans and through more targeted media campaigns. Although we ceased our pursuit of monetizing GoPro content with the recent closure of our entertainment group, we will continue to develop content that builds awareness for our brand, products and partner platforms. 
Grow our business internationally. We believe that international markets represent a significant growth opportunity for GoPro. Revenue from outside the United States comprised 53%, 52% and 43% of our revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We believe our continued investments in innovative and easy-to-use cameras and drones, as well as intuitive and simple software tools and services, will enable us to expand our user base to a broader group of international consumers. We plan to increase our presence globally through the active promotion of our brand, the creation and cultivation of regional strategic and marketing partnerships, the introduction of localized products in international markets with region specific marketing, and an investment focus on the biggest opportunities in Europe and the Asia-Pacific region.

Expand the GoPro experience for advanced users.  We will continue to pursue our goal of developing the world’s most versatile cameras, drones and stabilization products for enabling self-capture during any activity or moment. We will seek to leverage our brand strength and product expertise to drive a hardware upgrade cycle for our users and opportunistically enter complementary new device categories, including our recent re-entry into the consumer drone market with our first aerial drone, Karma, as well as virtual reality products beyond 2017. With our drone and our robust ecosystem of mounts and accessories, including a voice-control remote, GoPro products allow our users to live the moment they wish to capture without having to step outside of that moment to capture it.
Products 
Cameras. We offer the cloud connected HERO5 Black and HERO5 Session cameras as well as the HERO Session. The HERO5 line of cameras are waterproof (without a housing), come with select mounting accessories, and have built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth providing connectivity with a mobile device to enable remote control, content viewing, editing and sharing functionality. Our HERO5 cameras shoot in 4K at 30 frames per second and also feature multi-language voice control, electronic image stabilization, simplified controls, and the ability to auto-upload photos and videos to the cloud via Wi-Fi for easy access and editing with our Quik application. HERO5 Black features GPS and additional sensors that capture location, elevation, speed and G-force loads. 
Drone and image stabilization. The Karma drone features a compact design that fits in a small backpack, and the drone is flown using a game-style controller with an integrated touch display. Karma also includes a 3-axis camera stabilizer that can be removed from the drone and attached to the Karma Grip. Karma Grip, which we also offer as a standalone accessory, is a handheld, body-mountable camera stabilizer product that makes it easy to capture zero-shake, smooth video. 
Virtual reality. Omni is a professional spherical camera rig plus related stitching software. It's an end-to-end solution that connects and synchronizes six HERO4 Black cameras for capturing, stitching and publishing high-resolution virtual reality (360°) and immersive content. 
Mounts and accessories.  We offer a wide range of mounts and accessories, either bundled with a camera or sold separately, that enhance the functionality and versatility of our cameras and drone, and enable our consumers to self-capture their experiences during a variety of activities or moments, and from different viewpoints. These include equipment-based mounts, such as the helmet, handlebar, roll bar, as well as tripod mounts, such as the 3-way, a 3-in-1 mount that can be used as a camera grip, extension arm or tripod. We also enable consumers to wear mounts on their bodies, such as our wrist housing, chest harness and head strap. Our accessories include the Remo voice-activated waterproof remote, a micro-USB card reader, Quik Key, that plugs into a smartphone for quick transfer of content from the camera, Karma Grip, Smart Remote, Floaty Backdoor and Battery BacPac, all of which expand the features, versatility and convenience of our cameras. Additionally, we offer spare batteries, charging accessories and cables to connect our GoPro cameras to television monitors, flotation devices, dive filters and anti-fogging solutions.
Applications.  We offer mobile and desktop applications to all consumers at no charge that help our users manage, edit, view and share their content. The Quik mobile app is a fast, easy way to automatically create awesome videos from users' smartphone content or from their GoPro Plus account. Quik for desktop automatically imports content from a GoPro camera and makes it simple for users to create awe-inspiring videos synced to music with just a few clicks of the mouse. Our Capture app allows users to preview and play back shots, control their GoPro and share content on the fly using their smartphones. The GoPro VR app allows users to explore exciting virtual reality experiences on their smartphone. Our GoPro Passenger app for Karma allows one person to view the flight and control the GoPro mounted camera while another person flies the drone using the Karma controller.
Services. GoPro Plus is a cloud-based subscription service that offers a range of premium benefits to our consumers, including easy auto-upload from a GoPro camera to the cloud for on-the-go access, editing and sharing using a smartphone and the Quik app, an expanded library of soundtracks, premium support, and exclusive discounts on mounts and accessories. GoPro Care is a fee-based service that offers a range of support options to our consumers, including extended warranty and accidental damage coverage. Revenue earned to date from GoPro Plus and GoPro Care was not material to our results in 2016.

Seasonality
Our sales are subject to seasonal fluctuation. Historically, we have experienced the highest levels of revenue in the fourth quarter of the year, coinciding with the holiday shopping season. Our fourth quarter revenue comprised 46%, 27% and 45% of our 2016, 2015 and 2014 revenue, respectively. Sales of consumer products are also heavily influenced by the timing of the release of new products. Fourth quarter 2016 revenue benefited from the launch of our HERO5 cameras just prior to the holiday season. In 2015, we launched our products earlier in the year. Neither historical seasonal patterns nor historical patterns of product introductions should be considered reliable indicators of our future pattern of product introductions, future revenue or financial performance.
Segment information and geographic data
We operate as one reportable segment. Financial information about geographic areas is presented in Note 12 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Backlog
We do not believe that backlog information is material or meaningful as of any particular date or indicative of future sales, as our customers can change or cancel orders with limited or no penalty and limited advance notice prior to shipment.
Research and development
We are passionate about developing new and innovative products that inspire our consumers and enhance our brand. We are constantly innovating to deliver better performance, expanded functionality and increased convenience to enhance the appeal of our products. In particular, we have increased our investment in software application development to facilitate convenient and seamless content management, editing and sharing. We strive to remain a market leader by consistently introducing innovative products that offer optimal performance at affordable price points and better software functionality.
We have a user experience-driven approach to product development and our CEO leads product design. By engaging with customers, consumers and opinion leaders in our core markets around the world, our development team strives to introduce meaningful and empowering new features that expand the versatility and performance of our products. We also benefit from input received from our in-house production team, our sponsored athletes and our brand advocates that regularly travel the world capturing content using our products. We believe leveraging this input will help refine our existing products and influence future products that give us a competitive advantage.
The engineering team supports the development of cameras, drones, related mounts and accessories, firmware and software. The hardware engineering team is responsible for developing technologies to support the concepts developed by our product team. These core technologies include new image silicon processors, image sensors and lenses, as well as the core algorithms that enable the systems to operate and provide optimal performance and features. The hardware engineering team also integrates these innovations and firmware into our product designs and develops our cameras, drones, mounts and accessories. 
The software engineering team develops applications that enhance the functionality of our products and facilitate the management, editing, sharing and viewing of content. These applications are being developed for mobile, desktop and web-based platforms and powered by server-side services. The core technologies include rendering engines to enable video editing, video encoding and decoding for smooth playback and algorithms for moment identification.
Our research and development expense was $358.9 million, $241.7 million and $151.9 million for 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. 
Manufacturing, logistics and fulfillment
Our products are designed and developed in California, Switzerland, France and China, and a significant majority of our manufacturing is outsourced to contract manufacturers located in China. We believe that using outsourced manufacturing enables greater scale and flexibility than establishing our own manufacturing facilities. Our strategic commodity team manages the pricing and supply of the key components of our cameras and drones, including digital signal processors, sensors, lenses and motors. Several key strategic parts are purchased from suppliers by us and 
6

then consigned to our manufacturers, while the vast majority of parts are procured directly by our contract manufacturers. We seek to use our commodity team to achieve competitive pricing on the largest value-add components, and leverage our contract manufacturers’ volume purchases for best pricing on common parts.
We have third-party fulfillment centers in California, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Brazil and the Netherlands that deliver our products from multiple locations worldwide. These facilities are either warehouse/fulfillment centers or full service postponement centers (that perform light assembly in addition to warehouse/fulfillment). In addition, we have third-party centers in California, Czech Republic and China that perform in-region final packaging services. Cameras are typically air freighted while accessories and packaging are generally regionally procured or shipped via ocean freighter from our manufacturers in China to these fulfillment centers, where the products are packaged for retail sale. Our fulfillment strategy allows us to reduce shipping costs, reduce custom levies, customize products for local languages and improve inventory flexibility.
Sales channels and customers 
We offer our products in over 45,000 retail outlets and in over 100 countries through our direct sales channel and indirectly through our distribution channel. In 2016 and 2015, our direct sales accounted for 55% and 52% of our revenue, respectively, and our distributors accounted for 45% and 48% of our revenue, respectively. 
Direct sales
We sell directly to most of our retailers in the United States, some of our retailers in Europe and directly to consumers around the world through our e-commerce channels, as described below. We believe that our diverse direct sales channels are a key differentiator for GoPro. 
Independent specialty retailers. We use a network of location-based independent manufacturer representatives to sell our products to independent specialty retailers in the United States focused on sports and consumer activity capture markets. Our representatives provide highly personalized service to these retailers, including in-store merchandising, taking orders and providing clinics to educate retail sales personnel about GoPro products and services. We also have an internal, regionally focused sales team that provides a secondary level of service to both the independent specialty retailers and manufacturer representatives. Independent specialty retailers generally carry our higher end products, targeting their core customers who we believe tend to be early adopters of new technologies. Independent specialty retailers outside of the United States represent a similarly important sales channel for us, and we reach these customers indirectly through our network of international distributors.
Big box retailers. We sell to large retailers with a national presence, including Amazon.com, Inc., Best Buy, Inc., Target Corporation and Wal-Mart, Inc. We support these retailers with a dedicated and experienced sales management team that we believe enables us to reduce channel conflict. Best Buy, Inc. accounted for 17%, 14% and 20%, of our total revenue in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, and Amazon.com, Inc. accounted for 11% and 12% of our total revenue in 2016 and 2015, respectively. 
Mid-market retailers.  We also sell to retailers with a large regional or national presence, often focused on specific verticals such as consumer electronics, sporting goods, military, hunting and fishing and motor sports. In the U.S., we sell directly to these mid-market retailers through our experienced sales teams assigned to particular accounts and regions. 
e-commerce channel.  We sell our full line of products directly to consumers around the world through our online store at gopro.com, which we market through online and offline advertising. Sales through gopro.com were less than 10% of our total revenue for 2016, 2015 and 2014. 
Distribution
We sell to over 50 distributors who resell our products to retailers in international markets and to certain specific verticals in the United States. We have dedicated sales personnel focused on providing a high level of service to these distributors, including assisting with product mix planning, channel marketing and in-store merchandising, development of marketing materials, order assistance and educating the distributors’ sales personnel about GoPro products.

In-store merchandising 
Our in-store merchandising strategy focuses on our iconic GoPro-branded, video-enabled point of purchase ("POP") merchandising displays that are located in nearly all retail outlets where our products are sold. These displays showcase GoPro videos and attractively present our product ecosystem in a customer-friendly manner. Our larger retailers help us represent a broader range of products due to their deployment in their stores of our larger and custom POP displays. Having recognized our success in these stores, coupled with our expanding product portfolio, we have been successful working with our retailers to further expand the footprint of our POP displays within existing stores. As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 29,000 POP displays in retail outlets worldwide, up year-over-year from approximately 25,000 at December 31, 2015.
Marketing and advertising 
Our marketing and advertising programs are focused on engaging consumers by exposing them to compelling GoPro content and educating them about the new hardware features as well as the power of our solutions for software editing (Quik mobile and desktop) and content management (GoPro Plus). We believe this approach enhances our brand while demonstrating the performance, durability and versatility of our products. Our marketing and advertising efforts span a wide range of consumer interests and leverage both traditional consumer marketing and lifestyle marketing strategies. 
Consumer marketing. Social media plays an important role in our consumer marketing strategy. Our consumers capture and share personal GoPro content on social media and content sharing platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, Twitter, Vimeo and YouTube. We estimate social media views of GoPro content reached approximately 238 million, up over 40% year-over-year, driven by an estimated 160% year-over-year increase in views on Facebook. In 2016, we gained almost 6 million new followers to our social accounts, which represented an estimated 30% increase over 2015 to a total of approximately 25.5 million followers. We also integrate user-generated content and GoPro originally produced content into advertising campaigns across various platforms including television, print, online, billboards and other out of home advertising, and at consumer and trade facing events. This content also supports our in-store channel marketing efforts, appearing on our POP displays and other in-store marketing materials. Although we ceased our pursuit of monetizing GoPro content with the recent closure of our entertainment group, we continue to believe GoPro content remains a significant asset that builds awareness for our brand and products. 
Lifestyle marketing. Our lifestyle marketing programs focus on expanding GoPro brand awareness by engaging consumers through relationships with key influencers, event promotions and other outreach efforts. We cultivate strong relationships with influential athletes, celebrities, entertainers and brands, all of whom use our products to create and share engaging content with their own fans and consumers. We also work directly with these partners to create compelling content that we leverage to our mutual benefit across the GoPro Network, a collection of GoPro Channels hosted on a variety of online destinations and partner platforms.
Competition
The market for cameras is highly competitive and characterized by frequent product introductions and rapid technological advances. We believe the principal competitive factors impacting the market for our products include quality, reliability and user experience, price and performance, design innovation, brand recognition, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and brand reputation.
We compete against established, well-known camera manufacturers such as Canon Inc., Fujifilm Corporation, Nikon Corporation, Olympus Corporation and Vivitar Corporation, as well as large, diversified electronics companies such as, Panasonic Corporation, Samsung Electronics Co. and Sony Corporation and specialty companies such as Garmin Ltd. We believe we compete favorably with these companies’ products. Our durable and versatile product design facilitates increased functionality and wearability and we offer a variety of mounts and other accessories that enable a wide range of consumer use cases that are difficult for other competing products to address. Further, we offer many professional-grade features within our good, better, best product offering at attractive consumer price points, including our superview mode, which allows a user to capture an immersive wide-angle perspective, super high resolution video capability, voice control features, and image stabilization. We also provide users with a suite of free mobile and desktop applications that enhance the overall GoPro experience. Moreover, we believe we have achieved significant brand recognition in our target vertical markets. We believe our years of experience working with active 
8

and influential consumers contributes to our ability to develop attractive products and establishes the authenticity of our brand, thereby differentiating us from current and potential competitors. 
Smartphones and tablets with photo and video functionality have significantly displaced the market for traditional camera sales, and the makers of those devices also have mobile and other content editing applications and storage for content captured with those devices. Our Quik mobile and desktop editing applications, our Capture application and our GoPro Plus service may not be as compelling a solution as those offered by other companies, such as Apple, Inc. and Google, although the Quik mobile application supports content from other platforms including content from Apple. Also, it is possible that, in the future, the manufacturers of such devices, such as Apple, Google and Samsung, may design them for use in a range of conditions, including challenging physical environments, or develop products with features similar to ours. In addition, new companies may emerge and offer competitive products directly in our category.
We recently entered the consumer drone market and face significant competition from other companies promoting their own drone and related products. These include established and start up drone manufacturers, such as DJI Technology Co., Parrot SA and Yuneec International Co., who currently have or are attempting to gain a substantial share of the emerging international drone market. We believe we compete favorably with these companies’ products because our Karma system delivers strong versatility to consumers. The combination of a GoPro camera, removable camera stabilizer, portable drone and backpack allows consumers to create high quality, stabilized content, in the air, on the ground and mounted to their gear. We believe that our focus on versatility, GoPro compatibility, ease of use and portability contributes to the attractiveness of our aerial and stabilization products and differentiates us from current and potential competitors. 
Intellectual property
Intellectual property is an important aspect of our business, and our practice is to seek protection for our intellectual property as appropriate. Our trademarks, including “GOPRO,” “HERO,” “SESSION,” and “KARMA,” and the GoPro logos, among others, are a critical component of the value of our business. In addition, we hold many issued and pending utility and design patents for innovations that help our consumers capture, create, and share their content using our cameras, drones, mounts, accessories, and software. Our patents cover areas that include physical structures, image processing, operational firmware and software, post-processing software, distribution software, mount and accessory structures, as well as the ornamental aspects of our hardware and software products. As of December 31, 2016, we had 208 issued patents and 497 patent applications pending in the United States, and 112 corresponding issued patents and 165 patent applications pending in foreign countries. Our issued U.S. patents will expire between 2022 and 2036 and our issued foreign patents will expire between 2022 and 2041. We cannot be certain that our patent applications will be issued or that any issued patents will provide us with any competitive advantage or will not be challenged by third parties. We continually review our development efforts to assess our innovations, including their patentability. We take active measures to protect our intellectual property against unauthorized third party use, including misuse of our patents, copyrights, and trademarks, and other proprietary rights. 
In addition to the foregoing protections, we generally control access to and use of our proprietary and other confidential information through the use of internal and external controls, including contractual protections in agreements with employees, contract manufacturers, distributors and others. Despite these protections, we may be unable to prevent third parties from using our intellectual property without our authorization, breaching any nondisclosure agreements with us, or independently developing products that are similar to ours, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary and intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States.
Employees
As of December 31, 2016 we had 1,552 employees. None of our employees are currently covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and we have experienced no work stoppages. We consider our relationship with our employees to be good.
