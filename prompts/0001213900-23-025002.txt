The Sellers own and control an aggregate of approximately 2.0 Mega Watt (MW) green energy projects consisting of integrated and operational assembly of solar photovoltaic in working and operational status, mounting, assemblies, inverters, converters, metering, lighting fixtures, transformers, ballasts, disconnects, combiners, switches, wiring devices and wiring, and all other material for producing and delivering green energy.

Going Concern



Our cash balance is $Nil as of November 30, 2021. We do not believe that our cash balance is sufficient to fund our limited levels of operations beyond one year’s time.



Our current and predecessor independent registered public accountants have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an on-going business for the next twelve months unless we obtain additional capital to pay our bills. This is because we have not generated revenues and no revenues are anticipated until we complete our initial business development. There is no assurance we will ever reach that stage.



We anticipate that our current cash and cash equivalents and cash generated from operations, if any, will be insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months. We will require additional funds prior to such time and the Company will seek to obtain these funds by selling additional capital through private equity placements, debt or other sources of financing. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional financing, we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned operations, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results. Additional funding to meet our requirements may not be available on favorable terms, if at all.



At the present time, we have been able to raise additional cash by selling of common stock, it will likely not be sufficient to support our planned operations. If we are unable to raise the cash needed to support our operations, we will either suspend product development and marketing activities until we do raise the cash, or cease operations entirely



Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements



We have no off-balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.

Limited operating history; Need for additional capital



There is no historical financial information about us upon which to base an evaluation of our performance. We are in start-up stage operations and have not generated any revenues. We cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations. Our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including limited capital resources and possible cost overruns due to price and cost increases in services and products.



We have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms. If financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to continue, develop or expand our operations. Equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders.
