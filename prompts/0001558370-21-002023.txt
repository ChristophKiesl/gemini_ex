● | Balancing our revenue and profit mix. We seek to differentiate ourselves from our competition with our ability to offer full-service logistics solutions with a wide variety of fulfillment options, which can include our own assets. As our Asset-Light operations continue to grow alongside our Asset-Based services, we are balancing the mix of our revenue and profit between our Asset-Based segment and our Asset-Light operations. This growth in our Asset-Light business better reflects our customers’ spend for these services, and it drives long-term financial sustainability for us by making our business less capital-intensive relative to its size and by reducing volatility in our business performance through varying cycles, events, and/or environments.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Optimizing our cost structure. We are focused on profitable growth, which causes us to continually review our costs and investment decisions accordingly. Our technology infrastructure enables business processes, insight and analytics that allow us to optimize our cost structure, and we continue to invest in technology to transform our business.

Business Description
​
We deliver innovative solutions for a variety of supply chain challenges. Our offerings include LTL freight transportation through the ABF Freight network; specialized transportation, logistics, and supply chain management services through our ArcBest segment, including ground expedite solutions through the Panther Premium Logistics brand and household goods moving services under the U-Pack brand; and commercial vehicle maintenance and repair from FleetNet. From Fortune 100 companies to small businesses, our customers trust ArcBest for their transportation and logistics needs. 
​
With a relentless focus on customer needs and unique access to assured transportation capacity, we create solutions for even the most complex and demanding supply chains. We strive to help customers solve their logistics challenges by efficiently providing a best-in-class experience with easy access to our broad suite of capabilities. 
​
For the year ended December 31, 2020, no single customer accounted for more than 3% of our consolidated revenues, and the 10 largest customers, on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 12% of our consolidated revenues. The Company was incorporated in Delaware in 1966 and is headquartered in Fort Smith, Arkansas. 
​
Asset-Based Segment
Our Asset-Based segment provides LTL services through ABF Freight’s motor carrier operations. Asset-Based revenues accounted for approximately 68% of our total revenues before other revenues and intercompany eliminations in 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, no single customer accounted for more than 4% of revenues in the Asset-Based segment, and the segment’s 10 largest customers, on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 11% of its revenues. Note M to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains additional segment financial information, including revenues and operating income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
​
Our Asset-Based carrier, ABF Freight, has been in continuous service since 1923. ABF Freight System, Inc. is the successor to Arkansas Motor Freight, a business originally organized in 1935 which was the successor to a local transfer and storage carrier that was originally organized in 1923. ABF Freight expanded operations through several strategic acquisitions and organic growth and is now one of the largest LTL motor carriers in North America, providing direct service to more than 98% of U.S. cities having a population of 30,000 or more. ABF Freight offers interstate and intrastate service to approximately 52,000 communities through 239 service centers in all 50 states, Canada, and Puerto Rico. ABF Freight also provides motor carrier freight transportation services to customers in Mexico through arrangements with trucking companies in that country.
​
Our Asset-Based operations offer transportation of general commodities through standard, time-critical, and guaranteed LTL services. General commodities include all freight except hazardous waste, dangerous explosives, commodities of exceptionally high value, commodities in bulk, and those requiring special equipment. Shipments of general commodities differ from shipments of bulk raw materials, which are commonly transported by railroad, truckload tank car, pipeline, and water carrier. General commodities transported by our Asset-Based operations include, among other things, food, textiles, apparel, furniture, appliances, chemicals, nonbulk petroleum products, rubber, plastics, metal and metal products, wood, glass, automotive parts, machinery, and miscellaneous manufactured products.
​
The LTL transportation industry, which requires networks of local pickup and delivery service centers combined with larger distribution facilities, is significantly more infrastructure-intensive than truckload operations and, as such, has higher 

5




barriers to entry. Costs associated with an expansive LTL network, including investments in or costs associated with real estate and labor costs related to local pickup, delivery, and cross-docking of shipments, are to a large extent fixed in nature unless service levels are significantly changed.
​
ArcBest Technologies, Inc., our wholly-owned subsidiary which is focused on the advancement of supply chain execution technologies, began a pilot test program (the “pilot”) in early 2019 to improve freight handling at ABF Freight. The pilot utilizes patented handling equipment, software, and a patented process to load and unload trailers more rapidly and safely, with full freight loads pulled out of the trailer onto the facility floor and accessible from multiple points. The pilot is in operation in a limited number of locations. ABF Freight has leased new facilities in the test pilot regions in Indiana and a new distribution center in Kansas City where operations commenced in late-third quarter 2020. The pilot provides ABF Freight an opportunity to evaluate the potential for improving safety and working conditions for employees and for providing a better experience for customers. Potential benefits include improved transit performance, reduced cargo claims, reduced injuries and workers’ compensation claims, and faster employee training. While we believe the pilot has potential to provide safer and improved freight-handling, a number of factors will be involved in determining proof of concept and there can be no assurances that pilot testing will be successful or expand beyond current testing locations.
​
Labor costs, which amounted to 52.4% of Asset-Based revenues for 2020, are the largest component of the segment’s operating expenses. As of December 2020, approximately 82% of the Asset-Based segment’s employees were covered under a collective bargaining agreement, the ABF National Master Freight Agreement (the “2018 ABF NMFA”), with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (the “IBT”), which was ratified on May 10, 2018 by a majority of ABF Freight’s IBT member employees who voted. Following ratification of the supplements to the collective bargaining agreement, the 2018 ABF NMFA was implemented on July 29, 2018, effective retroactive to April 1, 2018, and will remain in effect through June 30, 2023. The major economic provisions of the 2018 ABF NMFA include restoration of one week of vacation that was previously reduced in the prior collective bargaining agreement, which began accruing on anniversary dates on or after April 1, 2018, with the new vacation eligibility schedule being the same as the applicable 2008 to 2013 supplemental agreements; wage rate increases in each year of the contract, beginning July 1, 2018; ratification bonuses for qualifying employees; profit-sharing bonuses upon the Asset-Based segment’s achievement of certain annual operating ratios calculated in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) for any full calendar year under the contract; and changes to purchased transportation provisions with certain protections for road drivers as specified in the contract. The 2018 ABF NMFA and the related supplemental agreements provide for contributions to multiemployer pension plans frozen at the current rates for each fund, continuation of existing health coverage, and annual contribution rate increases to multiemployer health and welfare plans maintained for the benefit of ABF Freight’s employees who are members of the IBT. Under the 2018 ABF NMFA, the contractual wage and benefits costs, including the ratification bonuses and vacation restoration, are estimated to increase approximately 2.0% on a compounded annual basis through the end of the agreement. Profit-sharing bonuses based on the Asset-Based segment’s annual operating ratios for any full calendar year under the contract represent an additional increase in costs under the 2018 ABF NMFA. The profit-sharing bonus under the 2018 ABF NMFA was earned for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 upon the Asset-Based segment achieving an annual GAAP operating ratio of 95.3% for 2020 and 95.2% for 2019.
​
ABF Freight contributes to multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans, which have been established pursuant to the Taft-Hartley Act, to provide benefits for its contractual employees. Amendments to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), pursuant to the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 (the “MPPA Act”), substantially expanded the potential liabilities of employers who participate in multiemployer pension plans. Under ERISA, as amended by the MPPA Act, an employer who contributes to a multiemployer pension plan and the members of such employer’s controlled group are jointly and severally liable for their share of the plan’s unfunded vested benefits in the event the employer ceases to have an obligation to contribute to the plan or substantially reduces its contributions to the plan (i.e., in the event of a complete or partial withdrawal from the multiemployer plans). ABF Freight’s funding obligations to the multiemployer pension plans to which it contributes are intended to satisfy the requirements imposed by the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the “PPA”), which was permanently extended by the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act of 2014 (the “Reform Act”) included in the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015. Through the term of its current collective bargaining agreement, ABF Freight’s multiemployer pension plan contribution obligations generally will be satisfied by making the specified contributions when due. However, we cannot determine with any certainty the contributions that will be required under future collective bargaining agreements for ABF Freight’s contractual employees. See Note I to the consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more specific disclosures regarding the multiemployer pension plans to which ABF Freight contributes.

ABF Freight operates in a highly competitive industry which consists predominantly of nonunion motor carriers. Nonunion competitors have a lower fringe benefit cost structure and less stringent labor work rules, and certain carriers also have lower wage rates for their freight-handling and driving personnel. Wage and benefit concessions granted to certain union competitors also allow for a lower cost structure. ABF Freight has continued to address with the IBT the effect of the wage and benefit cost structure on its operating results. The combined effect under the contractual labor agreement in place prior to the 2018 ABF NMFA of cost reductions, lowered cost increases throughout the contract period, and increased flexibility in labor work rules were important factors in bringing ABF Freight’s labor cost structure closer in line with that of its competitors; however, ABF Freight continues to pay some of the highest benefit contribution rates in the industry. These rates include contributions to multiemployer plans, a portion of which are used to fund benefits for individuals who were never employed by ABF Freight. Information provided by a large multiemployer pension plan to which ABF Freight contributes indicates that approximately 50% of the plan’s benefit payments are made to retirees of companies that are no longer contributing employers to that plan. 
​
Asset-Light Operations 
The ArcBest and FleetNet reportable segments, combined, represent our Asset-Light operations. Our Asset-Light operations are a key component of our strategy to offer customers end-to-end logistics solutions, designed to satisfy the complex supply chain and unique shipping requirements they encounter. Through unique methods and processes, including technology solutions and the use of third-party service providers, our Asset-Light operations provide various logistics and maintenance services without significant investment in revenue equipment or real estate.
​
For the year ended December 31, 2020, the combined revenues of our Asset-Light operations accounted for approximately 32% of our total revenues before other revenues and intercompany eliminations. For the year ended December 31, 2020, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of the ArcBest segment’s revenues, and the segment’s 10 largest customers, on a combined basis, accounted for approximately 25% of its revenues. Note M to our consolidated financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contains additional segment financial information, including revenues and operating income for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018.
​
ArcBest Segment
Our ArcBest segment originated with the formation of ABF Logistics in July 2013, when we aligned the sales and operations functions of our organically developed logistics businesses. We have continued to strategically invest in our Asset-Light operations to help ensure we are positioned to serve the changing marketplace and meet our customers’ expanding needs by providing a comprehensive suite of transportation and logistics services. The ArcBest segment includes the acquired ground expedite services of the Panther Premium Logistics brand; our acquired truckload and dedicated operations; and household goods moving services under the U-Pack brand, for which the majority of the moves are provided with our Asset-Based operations. Under our enhanced market approach to offer customers a single source of end-to-end logistics, the service offerings of the ArcBest segment have become more integrated. Management’s operating decisions are increasingly focused on the ArcBest segment’s combined operations, rather than individual service offerings within the segment’s operations. The ArcBest segment offers the following solutions:
​
Expedite 
Through the Panther Premium Logistics brand, we offer expedite freight transportation services to commercial and government customers and premium logistics services that involve the rapid deployment of highly specialized equipment to meet extremely specific linehaul requirements, such as temperature control, hazardous materials, geofencing (routing a shipment across a mandatory, defined route with satellite monitoring and automated alerts concerning any deviation from the route), specialized government cargo, security services, and life sciences. Through these services, ArcBest solves the toughest shipping and logistics challenges that customers face through a global network of owner operators and contract carriers. 
​
Substantially all of the network capacity for our expedite operations is provided by third-party carriers, including owner operators, ground linehaul providers, cartage agents, and other transportation asset providers, which are selected based on their ability to serve our customers effectively with respect to price, technology capabilities, geographic coverage, and quality of service. Third-party owned vehicles are driven by independent contract drivers and by drivers engaged directly by independent owners of multiple pieces of equipment, commonly referred to as fleet owners. Our expedite operations own a fleet of trailers, the communication devices used by its owner operators, and certain highly specialized equipment, primarily temperature-controlled and temperature-validated trailers, to meet the service requirements of certain customers.
​

Truckload and Dedicated
Our truckload and dedicated services provide third-party transportation brokerage by sourcing a variety of capacity solutions, including dry van over the road, temperature-controlled and refrigerated, flatbed, intermodal or container shipping, and specialized equipment, coupled with strong technology and carrier- and customer-based Web tools. We offer a growing network of more than 40,000 qualified service providers, with services to 50 states, Canada, and Mexico. Additional value is created for customers through seamless access to the ABF Freight network.
​
International 
Our International shipping and logistics services provide international ocean and air shipping solutions by partnering with ocean shipping lines and air freight carriers worldwide, as well as cross-border shipping and ground transportation to and from ports. As a non-vessel operating common carrier, we provide less-than-container load and full-container load service, offering ocean transport to approximately 90% of the total ocean international market to and from the United States. We also offer warehousing and distribution services to and from major ports across the globe to streamline our customers’ ocean shipping processes.
​
Managed Transportation
Through our managed transportation solutions, we provide complete freight transportation management services which enable customers to continually optimize their supply chains. ArcBest seeks to offer value through identifying specific challenges relating to customers’ supply chain needs and providing customized solutions utilizing technology, both internally to manage its business processes and externally to provide shipment and inventory visibility to its customers. Additional value is created for customers through seamless access to the ABF Freight network, the Panther fleet, and other ArcBest capacity sources, offering strategic supply chain solutions with unique access to assured capacity. 
​
Moving 
Our moving services offer flexibility and convenience in the way people move through targeted service offerings for the “do-it-yourself” consumer. We offer these targeted services at competitive prices that reflect the additional value customers find in our convenient, reliable moving service offerings. Industry-leading technology, customer-friendly interfaces, and supply chain solutions are combined to provide a wide range of options customized to meet unique customer needs. 
​
Other Logistics Services
We also provide other services to meet our customers’ logistics needs, such as final mile, time critical, product launch, warehousing and distribution, retail logistics, supply chain optimization, and trade show shipping services. In 2019, we launched our Retail+ compliance solution which helps vendors better meet large retailers’ stringent shipping and delivery requirements by combining innovative software solutions with enhanced operations processes.
​
FleetNet Segment
The FleetNet segment includes the results of operations of FleetNet America, Inc. (“FleetNet”), our subsidiary that provides roadside repair solutions and vehicle maintenance management services for commercial and private fleets through a network of third-party service providers in the United States, Canada, and Puerto Rico. FleetNet began in 1953 as the internal breakdown department for Carolina Freight Carriers Corp. and was incorporated in 1993 as Carolina Breakdown Service, Inc. In 1995, we purchased WorldWay Corporation, which operated various subsidiaries including Carolina Freight Carriers Corp. and Carolina Breakdown Service, Inc. The name of Carolina Breakdown Service, Inc. was changed to FleetNet America, Inc. in 1997.
​
Competition, Pricing, and Industry Factors
​
Competition
Our Asset-Based segment actively competes for freight business with other national, regional, and local motor carriers and, to a lesser extent, with private carriage, domestic and international freight forwarders, railroads, and airlines. The segment competes most directly with nonunion and union LTL carriers, including Yellow Corporation, FedEx Freight Corporation (included in the FedEx Freight reporting segment of FedEx Corporation), UPS Freight (included in the Supply Chain & Freight reporting segment of United Parcel Service, Inc.), Old Dominion Freight Line, Inc., Saia, Inc., the LTL reporting segment of Roadrunner Transportation Systems, Inc., and the North American LTL operations of XPO Logistics, Inc. Competition is based primarily on price, service, and availability of flexible shipping options to customers. The Asset-Based segment’s careful cargo handling, access to other ArcBest logistics solutions, and use of technology, both internally to manage its business processes and externally to provide shipment visibility to its customers, are examples of how we add value to our services.

8




​
Our ArcBest segment operates in a very competitive asset-light logistics market that includes approximately 17,000 active brokerage authorities, as well as asset-based truckload carriers, logistics companies including large expedite carriers, smaller expedite carriers, foreign and U.S.-based non-vessel-operating common carriers, freight forwarders, internal shipping departments at companies that have substantial transportation requirements, smaller niche service providers, and a wide variety of solution providers, including large integrated transportation companies as well as regional warehouse and transportation management firms. The segment competes most directly with logistics companies including Landstar System, Inc., Echo Global Logistics, Inc., Hub Group, Inc., the North American Surface Transportation segment of C.H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc., the Integrated Capacity Solutions segment of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., and the Logistics segment of Knight-Swift Transportation Holdings Inc. ArcBest’s moving services compete with truck rental, self-move, and van line service providers, and a number of emerging self-move competitors who offer moving and storage container service. Quality of service, technological capabilities, and industry expertise are critical differentiators among the competition. In particular, companies with advanced systems that offer optimized shipping solutions, real-time visibility of shipments, verification of chain of custody procedures, and advanced security have significant operational advantages and create enhanced customer value. 
​
FleetNet competes in the commercial vehicle maintenance and repair industry in two major sectors: emergency roadside and preventive maintenance. FleetNet competes directly against other third-party service providers, automotive fleet managers, leasing companies, and companies handling repairs in-house via individual service providers. Market competition for FleetNet is based primarily on maintenance solutions service offerings. In partnership with best-in-class third-party vendors, FleetNet offers flexible, customized solutions and utilizes technology to provide valuable information and data to minimize fleet downtime, reduce maintenance events, and lower total maintenance costs for its customers.
​
Pricing
Approximately one fourth of our Asset-Based business is subject to base LTL tariffs, which are affected by general rate increases, combined with individually negotiated discounts. Rates on the other three fourths of our Asset-Based business, including business priced in the spot market, are subject to individual pricing arrangements that are negotiated at various times throughout the year. The majority of the business that is subject to negotiated pricing arrangements is associated with larger customer accounts with annually negotiated pricing arrangements, and the remaining business is priced on an individual shipment basis considering each shipment’s unique profile, the value we provide to the customer, and current market conditions. 
​
In December 2019, we began allowing shippers without negotiated published rates to obtain competitive LTL rates for their shipping needs with ABF Freight’s reliable service and capacity options. This innovative pricing mechanism allows customers to instantly access LTL rates online, by phone, or through application programming interface (“API”) technology for shipments within the United States, Canadian cross-border, Mexico, and Puerto Rico. We are able to offer customers the best price on each shipment by leveraging available capacity within the ABF Freight network at the time of the shipment. The market has been receptive to this pricing option for transactional LTL shipments and the program has been beneficial in optimizing our business levels during 2020.
​
In August 2017, we began applying space-based pricing on shipments subject to LTL tariffs to better reflect freight shipping trends that have evolved over the last several years. These trends include the overall growth and ongoing profile shift of bulkier shipments across the entire supply chain, the acceleration in e-commerce, and the unique requirements of many shipping and logistics solutions. An increasing percentage of freight is taking up more space in trailers without a corresponding increase in weight. Space-based pricing involves the use of freight dimensions (length, width, and height) to determine applicable cubic minimum charges (“CMC”) that supplement weight-based metrics when appropriate. Traditional LTL pricing is generally weight-based, while our linehaul costs are generally space-based (i.e., costs are impacted by the volume of space required for each shipment). We believe space-based pricing better aligns our pricing mechanisms with the metrics which affect our resources and, therefore, our costs to provide logistics services. We seek to provide logistics solutions to our customers’ businesses and the unique shipment characteristics of their various products and commodities, and we believe that we are particularly experienced in handling complicated freight. The CMC is an additional pricing mechanism to better capture the value we provide in transporting these shipments. 
​
Our Asset-Based and certain operations within our ArcBest segment assess a fuel surcharge based on the index of national on-highway average diesel fuel prices published weekly by the U.S. Department of Energy. While the fuel surcharge is one of several components in our overall rate structure, the actual rate paid by customers is governed by market forces and the overall value of services provided to the customer.

​
Industry Factors
According to management’s estimates and market studies by Armstrong & Associates, Inc. and the U.S. Department of Commerce, the total market potential in the industry segments we serve is approximately $330 billion, with $43 billion of potential revenue in the LTL market segment, $244 billion potential in the markets served by our ArcBest segment, and $43 billion in the maintenance and repair market served by our FleetNet segment. The LTL industry has significant barriers to entry and is highly competitive, as previously discussed in “Asset-Based Segment” within this Business section. Our Asset-Light operations represent a minor portion of the total market, which evidences the significant growth opportunity for us in the outsourced logistics market. More sophisticated supply chain practices are required as supply chains expand and become more complex, product and service needs continue to evolve, and companies look for solutions to their logistics challenges as well as for lower cost supply chain alternatives. 
​
The transportation industry is subject to numerous laws, rules, and regulations, as further discussed below within “Environmental and Other Government Regulations,” and carriers are required to obtain and maintain various licenses and permits, some of which are difficult to obtain. The trucking industry faces rising costs of compliance with government regulations on safety, equipment design and maintenance, driver utilization, and fuel economy, as well as increasing costs in certain non-industry specific areas, including health care and retirement benefits. Higher compliance costs will continue to impair the competitiveness of smaller carriers in the logistics market, which may lead to tighter capacity or consolidation within certain sectors. In addition, disruptions from unexpected events such as natural disasters and the COVID-19 pandemic have resulted in further utilization of expedited shipping and premium logistics services and have caused companies to focus on risk management within their supply chains. 
​
Seasonality
​
Our operations are impacted by seasonal fluctuations that affect tonnage, shipment or service event levels, and demand for our services, which in turn may impact our revenues and operating results. The COVID-19 pandemic had a significant negative impact on demand for our services during the second quarter of 2020, resulting in lower tonnage, shipment, and service event levels and, consequently, a decline in revenues. Although business levels improved in the third quarter of 2020, our results for 2020 do not reflect typical seasonal trends in business levels as described below for our reportable operating segments as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on second quarter business levels.
​
Freight shipments and operating costs of our Asset-Based and ArcBest segments can be adversely affected by inclement weather conditions. The second and third calendar quarters of each year usually have the highest tonnage levels, while, historically, the first quarter generally has the lowest, although other factors, including the state of the U.S. and global economies, available capacity in the market, and the impact of other adverse external events or conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic as previously described, may influence quarterly business levels. 
​
ArcBest segment operations are influenced by seasonal fluctuations that impact customers’ supply chains. Shipments of the ArcBest segment may decline during winter months because of post-holiday slowdowns, but expedite shipments can be subject to short-term increases depending on the impact of weather disruptions to customers’ supply chains. Plant shutdowns during summer months may affect shipments for automotive and manufacturing customers of the ArcBest segment, but severe weather events can result in higher demand for expedite services. Moving services of the ArcBest segment are impacted by seasonal fluctuations, generally resulting in higher business levels in the second and third quarters as the demand for moving services is typically stronger in the summer months.
​
Emergency roadside service events of the FleetNet segment are favorably impacted by extreme weather conditions that affect commercial vehicle operations, and the segment’s results of operations will be influenced by seasonal variations in service event volume and the impact of other external events or conditions, including the COVID-19 pandemic as previously described.
​
Technology
​
Our advancements in technology are important to customer experience, efficiency, and scalability, and provide a competitive advantage. We continue to make investments in technology and innovations to advance in these areas. The majority of the information technology applications we use have been developed internally and tailored specifically for customer, capacity supplier, or internal business processing needs by our ArcBest Technologies subsidiary. 

10




​
As previously disclosed in “Asset-Based Segment” within this Business section, ArcBest Technologies began a pilot in early 2019 to improve freight handling at ABF Freight, which utilizes patented handling equipment, software, and a patented process to load and unload trailers more rapidly and safely. We have made other technology investments in a variety of areas to improve customer experience and optimize costs in our operating segments. In the Asset-Based segment, we are using enhanced tools to improve city pickup and delivery productivity, including advanced hardware and software enabled by proprietary analytics and algorithms. We use certain cognitive technologies to improve customer service and optimize our operations. In the ArcBest segment, we have developed machine-learning cognitive technologies using algorithms embedded in the applications our employees use to simplify and drive better decision making. We have launched a capacity sourcing tool to optimize the utilization of internal equipment capacity while reducing the time it takes to secure external equipment capacity in meeting customer requirements. We also use common quoting systems and predictive analytics tools which are undergoing continuous development and require ongoing investment.
​
Freight transportation customers communicate their freight needs, typically on a shipment-by-shipment basis, by means of telephone, email, web, mobile applications, or electronic data interchange (“EDI”) and, more recently, by API. In the ArcBest segment, the information about each shipment is entered into a proprietary operating system which facilitates selection of a contracted carrier or carriers based on the carrier’s service capability, equipment availability, freight rates, and other relevant factors. Once the carrier is selected, the cost for the transportation has been agreed upon, and the carrier has committed to provide the transportation, we are in contact with the carrier through numerous means of communication (i.e., mobile apps, satellite tracking, electronic logging device (“ELD”), and other communication units on the vehicles) to continually update the position of equipment, to better meet customers’ requirements to track the status of the shipment from origin to delivery. The various tracking methods automatically update our fully integrated internal software and provide customers with real-time electronic updates. 
​
We make information readily accessible to our customers through various electronic pricing, billing, and tracking services, including mobile-responsive websites which allow customers to access information about their shipments, request shipment pickup, and utilize a variety of other digital tools. Online functions tailored to the services requested by customers include bill of lading generation, pickup planning, customer-specific price quotations, proactive tracking, customized e-mail notification, logistics reporting, dynamic rerouting, and Extensible Markup Language (XML) connectivity. This technology allows customers to incorporate data from our systems directly into their own website or backend information systems using EDI standards as well as secure API. As a result, our customers can provide shipping information and support directly to their own customers.
​
ArcBest launched an innovation accelerator to encourage new, transformative ideas. This accelerator represents a team of employees from across the organization who work closely with executive leadership to identify opportunities for disruptive innovation within our company, as well as evaluate potential external innovation partners. In 2020, ArcBest was a member of the Blockchain in Transport Alliance, which is a consortium of more than 250 freight transportation companies working to develop and set standards for the use of blockchain technology within the logistics and transportation industry. 
​
Insurance
​
Generally, claims exposure in the freight transportation and logistics industry consists of workers’ compensation, third-party casualty liability, and cargo loss and damage. We are effectively self-insured for $1.0 million of each workers’ compensation loss. For each third-party casualty loss, we are generally self-insured for $1.0 million. We are also self-insured for each cargo loss, up to a $0.3 million deductible for our Asset-Based segment and a $0.1 million deductible for our ArcBest segment. We maintain insurance that we believe is adequate to cover losses in excess of such self-insured amounts or deductibles. However, we cannot provide assurance that our insurance coverage will provide adequate protection under all circumstances or against all potential losses. We have experienced situations where excess insurance carriers have become insolvent. We pay assessments and fees to state guaranty funds in states where we have workers’ compensation self-insurance authority. In some of these states, depending on the specific state’s rules, the guaranty funds may pay excess claims if the insurer cannot pay due to insolvency. However, there can be no certainty of the solvency of individual state guaranty funds. 
​
We have been able to obtain what we believe to be adequate insurance coverage for 2021 and are not aware of any matters which would significantly impair our ability to obtain adequate insurance coverage at market rates for our operations in the foreseeable future. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, cargo claims, or workers’ 

11




compensation claims or the material unfavorable development of existing claims could have a material adverse effect on our cost of insurance and results of operations.
​
Environmental and Other Government Regulations
​
Various international, federal, state and local agencies exercise broad regulatory powers over the transportation industry, generally governing such activities as operations of and authorization to engage in motor carrier freight transportation, operations of non-vessel-operating common carriers, operations of ocean freight forwarders and ocean transportation intermediaries, indirect air carriage, safety, contract compliance, insurance and bonding requirements, tariff and trade policies, customs, import and export, food safety, employment practices, licensing and registration, taxation, environmental matters, data privacy and security, and financial reporting. Compliance with future modifications to the regulations impacting the transportation industry may impact our operating practices and costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Other carriers would be similarly affected by changes in industry regulations; therefore, the impact of such changes on our competitive position cannot be determined.
​
Environmental Regulations
We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations relating to, among other things: emissions control, transportation or handling of hazardous materials, underground and aboveground storage tanks, stormwater pollution prevention, contingency planning for spills of petroleum products, and disposal of waste oil.
​
In August 2016, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (the “NHTSA”) jointly finalized a national program establishing a second phase of greenhouse gas emissions (“EPA/NHTSA Phase 2”), imposing new fuel efficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty vehicles, such as those operated by our Asset-Based segment, for model years 2021-2027 and also instituting fuel efficiency improvement technology requirements for trailer model years 2018-2027. In September 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the portion of the EPA/NHTSA Phase 2 Final Rule regarding the trailer regulations, and the review of the Final Rule has an indefinite date of final ruling. 
​
In September 2019, the state of California signed legislation which directs the California Air Resources Board (the “CARB”) and other state agencies to develop and implement a comprehensive inspection and maintenance program for heavy-duty vehicles. A number of states have individually enacted, and California and certain other states may continue to enact, legislation relating to engine emissions, trailer regulations, fuel economy, and/or fuel formulation, such as regulations enacted by the CARB. In December 2019, the CARB announced it will be suspending, until at least January 2022, its previously approved plans to enforce certain provisions of the EPA/NHTSA Phase 2 Final Rule that would regulate glider kits and trailers. In the event the EPA does not enforce the trailer regulations of EPA/NHTSA Phase 2, certain other states may also individually enact legislation to enforce the regulations. At the present time, management believes that these regulations may not result in significant net additional overall costs should the technologies developed for tractors, as required in the EPA/NHTSA Phase 2 rulemaking, prove to be as cost-effective as forecasted by the EPA and the NHTSA. 
​
In November 2018, the EPA launched the “Cleaner Trucks Initiative” (the “CTI”) which includes plans for future rulemaking to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. In January 2020, the EPA published an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to solicit pre-proposal comments on the CTI. One planned feature of the initiative is to coordinate emissions standards nationwide in an effort to make compliance easier for the industry by preventing a further patchwork of state and local emissions regulations. The EPA intends to issue a proposed rulemaking in 2021 and is considering implementation of new standards beginning for 2027 model year engines. 
​
While fuel consumption and emissions may be reduced under the new standards, emission-related regulatory actions have historically resulted in increased costs of revenue equipment, diesel fuel, and equipment maintenance, and future legislation, if enacted, could result in increases in these and other costs. We are unable to determine with any certainty the effects of any future climate change legislation beyond the currently enacted regulations, and there can be no assurance that more restrictive regulations than those previously described will not be enacted either federally or locally.
​
At certain facilities of our Asset-Based operations, we store fuel and oil in underground and aboveground tanks for use in tractors and trucks. Maintenance of our 56 underground fuel storage tanks, which are located in 16 states, is regulated by the EPA and, in most cases, by state agencies. Management believes we are in substantial compliance with all such 

12




regulations. The underground storage tanks are required to have leak detection systems, and we are not aware of any leaks from such tanks that could reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on our operating results.
​
Certain of our Asset-Based service center facilities operate with no exposure certifications or stormwater permits under the federal Clean Water Act (“CWA”). The no exposure certification and stormwater permits may require periodic facility inspections and monitoring and reporting of stormwater sampling results. We are currently negotiating a settlement with the EPA regarding certain non-compliance issues with the CWA, the amount of which is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.
​
We have received notices from the EPA and others that we have been identified as a potentially responsible party under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act, or other federal or state environmental statutes, at several hazardous waste sites. After investigating our subsidiaries’ involvement in waste disposal or waste generation at such sites, we have either agreed to de minimis settlements or determined that our obligations, other than those specifically accrued with respect to such sites, would involve immaterial monetary liability, although there can be no assurance in this regard. It is anticipated that the resolution of our environmental matters could take place over several years. Our reserves for environmental compliance matters and cleanup costs are estimated based on management’s experience with similar environmental matters and on testing performed at certain sites.
​
Other Government Regulations
We operate in the United States, and from the United States for international transportation, pursuant to federal operating authority granted by the U.S. Department of Transportation (the “DOT”) and the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission. Our operations are subject to cargo security and transportation regulations issued by the Transportation Security Administration and regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.
​
Our Asset-Based operations and our ArcBest segment’s network of third-party contract carriers must comply with industry regulations, including the ELD mandate of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (the “FMCSA”) for interstate commercial trucks and hours-of-service, safety and fitness, and other regulations of the DOT, including requirements related to drug and alcohol testing. We are subject to the hazardous materials regulations of the FMCSA for our transportation and arrangement for transportation of hazardous materials and explosives, as well as our disposal of hazardous waste.
​
We provide transportation and logistics services to and from a number of international locations and are, therefore, subject to a wide variety of domestic and international laws and regulations, including export and import laws. We are also subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and hold Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism status for businesses within our Asset-Based and ArcBest segments.
​
If we were to violate the government regulations under which we operate, we may be subject to substantial fines or penalties or our business operations could be restricted, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.
​
​
Human Capital Resources
​
As of December 2020, we had approximately 13,000 employees, of which approximately 59% were members of labor unions. As previously described in “Asset-Based Segment” within this Business section, as of December 2020, approximately 82% of our Asset-Based segment’s employees were covered under the 2018 ABF NMFA, the collective bargaining agreement with the IBT, which will remain in effect through June 30, 2023.
​
Employee Attraction, Development, and Retention
Our business results and future growth opportunities depend on our ability to successfully manage our human capital resources, including attracting, developing, and retaining our personnel. Our data enriched, real-time linkage between forecasted demand and diverse talent pools, along with hiring for character, enable our unified recruiting team to attract and onboard the right candidates for the right roles faster than ever before. It all starts with hiring the right, values-aligned people. We then have intentional training and development plans throughout each stage of career progression that accelerate job mastery and development for future roles. We strive to recruit the right individual for each position and maintain a culture of continuous growth and development for our employees. Through our comprehensive 

13




learning program, we offer classroom, virtual, and web-based training options. We also offer a tuition reimbursement program, and we partner with a private university to offer onsite and virtual classes for employees to further their education.
​
We utilize a customized performance management system that incorporates goals and development planning to better position employees in their career paths. We also have a succession planning program to ensure continuity in critical roles within our organization. We evaluate compensation to ensure it remains competitive, including the insurance and retirement benefits we provide to support the four pillars of wellness for our employees – physical, financial, emotional, and social. An annual survey is conducted to request feedback from employees to help us assess and improve engagement and implement changes to enhance our work environment. 
​
Attracting and retaining qualified truck drivers is crucial to our business. To address the driver shortage that continues to impact the freight transportation industry, we have a partnership with the IBT that allows us to hire potential drivers and train them in-house through our Driver Development Program. 
​
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
We embrace and encourage diverse experience and perspectives which, in turn, help us create an environment in which our employees want to belong, and such diversity helps us better serve our customers around the globe. We recently partnered with a consulting firm who specializes in the areas of diversity, equity, and inclusion as we work to assess, develop, and measure these areas of human capital management in our organization. Our corporate Code of Conduct sets forth our general principles of business conduct and ethics. Our nonunion employees are required to participate in annual Code of Conduct training, which includes our anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies to further educate to our employees about the importance of diversity.
​
Health, Safety, and Security
We are focused on the health and wellbeing of our employees and we have numerous programs to support our people in embracing total health. In addition to health benefits and voluntary insurance options, we also offer a wellness program in which employees may receive reduced premiums, deductibles, and out-of-pocket expenses for their insurance by completing certain preventative health requirements. We offer a digital health platform and weight loss program, and we encourage healthy behaviors throughout the year through regular communications, educational sessions, wellness challenges, and other incentives.
​
As a transportation company, safety is critical to our business. We have safety procedures and guidelines, as well as required training and certification programs, for our drivers and freight handling personnel to promote safety on and off the road. Our safety policies and procedures extend to each of our company campuses to ensure the health, safety, and welfare of all employees. We also have safety measures and policies that apply to all independent contractors, owner operators, and fleet owners in our Panther fleet, for whom we have provided safety programs to heighten awareness, promote safe driving behaviors, and reduce violations and accidents.
​
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented business continuity processes focused on maintaining customer service levels while emphasizing the health, welfare, and safety of our employees and our customers. The additional measures we implemented to safeguard our employees and customers, which are in alignment with guidelines established by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, are described in “COVID-19” within Part II, Item 7 (Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
​
We expect all employees, suppliers, and business affiliates to obey and respect human rights laws, and we will not tolerate any conduct that violates these laws. Due to the nature of our industry, we are in a critical position to help raise awareness of human trafficking to potentially disrupt these networks. Through partnerships with Truckers Against Trafficking® and Polaris, we educate our employees and drivers on the realities of modern-day slavery and how they can play a role in supporting the fight against human trafficking.

​
We are actively involved in efforts to promote a cleaner environment by reducing both fuel consumption and emissions. For many years, our Asset-Based segment has voluntarily limited the maximum speed of its trucks, which reduces fuel consumption and emissions and contributes to ABF Freight’s excellent safety record. Our Asset-Based segment utilizes engine idle management programming to automatically shut down engines of parked tractors. Fuel consumption and emissions have also been minimized through a strict equipment maintenance schedule. To further enhance fuel economy and reduce emissions, our Asset-Based segment voluntarily installs aerodynamic aids on its fleet of over-the-road trailers. ABF Freight participates in the EPA’s SmartWay Transport Partnership, a collaboration between the EPA and the freight transportation industry that helps freight shippers, carriers, and logistics companies reduce greenhouse gases and diesel emissions.
