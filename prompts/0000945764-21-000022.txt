Item 1. Business and Properties
GENERAL
Denbury Inc., a Delaware corporation, is an independent energy company with 143.1 MMBOE of estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2020, of which 98% is oil.  Our operations are focused in two key operating areas: the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions.  The Company is differentiated by its focus on CO2 EOR and the emerging CCUS industry, supported by the Company’s CO2 EOR technical and operational expertise and its extensive CO2 pipeline infrastructure. The utilization of captured industrial-sourced CO2 in EOR significantly reduces the carbon footprint of the oil that Denbury produces, underpinning the Company’s goal to fully offset its Scope 1, 2, and 3 CO2 emissions within the decade. Throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K (“Form 10-K”) we use the terms “Denbury,” “Company,” “we,” “our” and “us” to refer to Denbury Inc. and, as the context may require, its subsidiaries.
As part of our corporate strategy, we are committed to creating long-term value for our shareholders through the following key principles:
•target specific regions where we either have, or believe we can create, a competitive advantage as a result of our ownership or use of CO2 reserves, oil fields and CO2 infrastructure;
•increase the value of our assets through applying our technical expertise in CO2 tertiary recovery, together with a combination of other exploration, development, exploitation and marketing skills and practices;
•seek to expand the use of industrial-sourced CO2 in our tertiary recovery operations, with an ultimate objective of producing oil with a negative carbon footprint;
•leverage our extensive CO2 pipeline assets and CO2 EOR expertise to expand our operations and leadership position in the emerging CCUS industry;
•acquire properties that give us a majority working interest and operational control or where we believe we can ultimately obtain it;
•maximize the value and cash flow generated from our operations by increasing production and reserves while controlling costs;
•optimize the timing and allocation of capital among our investment opportunities to maximize the rates of return on our investments;
•exercise financial discipline and maintain a strong balance sheet; and
•attract and maintain a highly competitive team of experienced and incentivized personnel.
As further described in Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code below, Denbury Inc. became the successor reporting company (the “Successor”) of Denbury Resources Inc. (the “Predecessor”) upon the Predecessor’s emergence from bankruptcy on September 18, 2020. On September 18, 2020, Denbury filed the Third Restated Certificate of Incorporation with the Delaware Secretary of State to effect a change of the Company’s corporate name from Denbury Resources Inc. to Denbury Inc. On September 21, 2020, the Successor’s new common stock commenced trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol DEN, as distinguished from, Denbury Resources Inc.’s common stock having been publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange since 1997. Our corporate headquarters is located at 5851 Legacy Circle, Plano, Texas 75024, and our phone number is 972-673-2000. We make our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, available free of charge on or through our website, www.denbury.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”).  The SEC also maintains a website, http://www.sec.gov, which contains periodic reports on Forms 8-K, 10-Q and 10-K filed with the SEC, along with other reports, proxy and information statements and other information filed by Denbury.
Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code 
On July 30, 2020 (the “Petition Date”), Denbury Resources Inc. and its subsidiaries filed petitions for reorganization in a “prepackaged” voluntary bankruptcy (the “Chapter 11 Restructuring”) under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (the “Bankruptcy Court”) under the caption “In re Denbury Resources Inc., et al., Case No. 20-33801”. On September 2, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order (the “Confirmation 
Denbury Inc.

Order”) confirming the chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the “Plan”) and approving the Disclosure Statement, and on September 18, 2020 (the “Emergence Date”), the Plan became effective in accordance with its terms and the Company emerged from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Key accomplishments of the Chapter 11 Restructuring included the following:
•Adopted an amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws with authorized capitalization of 250,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Denbury (the “New Common Stock”) and 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share;
•Cancelled all outstanding senior secured second lien notes, convertible senior notes, and senior subordinated notes issued by the Predecessor. In accordance with the Plan, claims against and interests in the Predecessor were treated as follows:
◦Holders of senior secured second lien notes claims received their pro rata share of 47,499,999 shares representing 95% of the New Common Stock issued on the Emergence Date, subject to dilution on account of warrants and a management incentive plan;
◦Holders of convertible senior notes claims received their pro rata share of (a) 2,500,000 shares representing 5% of the New Common Stock issued on the Emergence Date, subject to dilution on account of warrants and a management incentive plan and (b) 100% of the series A warrants (see below), reflecting up to a maximum of 5% ownership stake in the reorganized company’s equity interests;
◦Holders of subordinated notes claims received their pro rata share of 54.55% of the series B warrants (see below), reflecting up to a maximum of 3% of the reorganized company’s equity interests after giving effect to the exercise of the series A warrants;
◦Holders of existing equity interests received their pro rata share of 45.45% of the series B warrants (see below), reflecting up to a maximum of 2.5% of the reorganized company’s equity interests after giving effect to the exercise of the series A warrants;
◦Issued 2,631,579 five-year series A warrants at an exercise price of $32.59 per share to former holders of the Predecessor’s convertible senior notes and 2,894,740 three-year series B warrants at an exercise price of $35.41 per share to former holders of the Predecessor’s senior subordinated notes and Predecessor’s equity interests; and
◦Holders of general unsecured claims received payment in full in cash, reimbursement, or such other treatment rendering such general unsecured claim unimpaired.
•Reduced ongoing annual interest expense by approximately $165 million, significantly lowering our cash flow breakeven level;
•Established a new $575 million senior secured bank credit facility with $482.0 million of availability at December 31, 2020 after outstanding letters of credit; and
•Appointed a new board of directors (the “Board”) consisting of four new independent members: Anthony Abate, Caroline Angoorly, Brett Wiggs and James N. “Jim” Chapman, and three continuing members: Dr. Kevin O. Meyers (Chairman of the Board), Lynn A. Peterson and Chris Kendall, Denbury’s President and Chief Executive Officer.
For more information on the Chapter 11 Restructuring and related matters, refer to Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and Note 8, Long-Term Debt, to the consolidated financial statements.
Fresh Start Accounting 
Upon emergence from bankruptcy, we met the criteria and were required to adopt fresh start accounting in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board Codification (“FASC”) Topic 852, Reorganizations, which on the Emergence Date resulted in a new entity, the Successor, for financial reporting purposes, with no beginning retained earnings or deficit as of the fresh start reporting date. References to “Successor” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the Company subsequent to the Company’s emergence from bankruptcy on September 18, 2020, and references to “Predecessor” relate to the financial position and results of operations of the Company prior to, and including, September 18, 2020. In order to assist investors in understanding the comparability of our financial results for the applicable periods, we have provided certain comparative analysis on a combined basis, which management believes provides meaningful information to assist investors in understanding our financial results for the applicable period, but should not be considered in isolation, as a substitute for, or more meaningful than, independent results of the Predecessor and Successor periods for the year reported in accordance with GAAP.
Fresh start accounting requires that new fair values be established for the Company’s assets, liabilities and equity as of the date of emergence from bankruptcy, September 18, 2020, and therefore certain values and operational results of the 
Denbury Inc.

consolidated financial statements subsequent to September 18, 2020 are not comparable to the Company’s consolidated financial statements prior to, and including September 18, 2020, principally due to the Emergence Date re-evaluation of the fair value of our oil and natural gas properties, CO2 properties, and pipelines, together with the conversion of over $2 billion of previously outstanding debt into new common stock and/or warrants in the Successor. The reorganization value derived from the range of enterprise values associated with the Plan was allocated to the Company’s identifiable tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their fair values. The Emergence Date fair values of the Successor’s assets and liabilities differ materially from their recorded values as reflected on the historical balance sheet of the Predecessor and may materially affect our results of operations in Successor reporting periods.
Impact of the COVID-19 Pandemic

In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the ongoing COVID-19 coronavirus (“COVID-19”) outbreak a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a rapid and precipitous drop in oil demand, which worsened an already deteriorated oil market that followed the early-March 2020 failure by the group of oil producing nations known as OPEC+ to reach an agreement over proposed oil production cuts. Uncertainty about the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting economic consequences has resulted in abnormally high worldwide inventories of produced oil. While oil prices as of mid-February 2021 have improved to the low-$60s per barrel, which is significantly higher than the low points experienced during the second quarter of 2020, the concerns and uncertainties around the balance of supply and demand for oil are expected to continue for some time. Because the realized oil prices we received during 2020 were significantly reduced, our operating cash flow and liquidity were adversely affected.
2020 BUSINESS DEVELOPMENTS
Since our production is 97% oil, oil prices generally constitute the single largest variable in our operating results. Over the last several years, NYMEX oil prices have been extremely volatile, declining from a three-year peak of $76 per Bbl in October 2018 to lows averaging $17 per Bbl in April 2020 due to the significant interruption in worldwide economic activity and reduction in oil demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic, plus OPEC supply pressures, before gradually increasing to an average of $47 per Bbl in December 2020. Throughout this time, we have focused primarily on preservation of cash and liquidity, together with cost reductions and debt management, rather than concentration on expansion and growth. Our 2020 key business developments included the following:
•Completed financial restructuring and emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization on September 18, 2020 with a strong balance sheet and liquidity position (refer to Note 1, Nature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies – Emergence from Voluntary Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and Note 8, Long-Term Debt, to the consolidated financial statements).
•Reduced our originally planned capital expenditures in March 2020, deferred the CO2 pipeline extension to Cedar Creek Anticline and implementation of the enhanced oil recovery development project beyond 2020; implemented cost reduction measures including shutting down compressors, negotiating reductions with vendors, and delaying uneconomic well repairs and workovers.
•Restructured our CO2 pipeline financing arrangements with Genesis Energy, L.P. (“Genesis”), whereby we (1) reacquired the NEJD pipeline system from Genesis in exchange for $70 million to be paid in four equal payments during 2021, representing full settlement of all remaining obligations under the NEJD secured financing lease; and (2) reacquired the Free State Pipeline from Genesis in exchange for a one-time payment of $22.5 million on October 30, 2020. As a result, we reduced debt by $25 million and lowered interest expense while maximizing flexibility for future CCUS operations on these lines.
•Closed a farm-down transaction in March 2020 for the sale of half of our nearly 100% working interest positions in four conventional southeast Texas oil fields (consisting of Webster, Thompson, Manvel and East Hastings) for $40 million net cash and a carried interest in ten wells to be drilled by the purchaser (the “Gulf Coast Working Interests Sale”).
•Continued the monetization of valuable surface land with no active oil and natural gas operations, including the sale of multiple parcels primarily around Houston, Texas in transactions totaling $29 million in 2020.

Denbury Inc.

•Entered into an agreement in December 2020 to acquire a nearly 100% working interest (approximately 83% net revenue interest) in the Big Sand Draw and Beaver Creek oil fields located in Wyoming for $12 million cash, including surface facilities and a 46-mile CO2 transportation pipeline to the acquired fields. The agreement provides for us to make two contingent cash payments of $4 million each in 2021 and 2022 if NYMEX WTI oil prices average at least $50 per Bbl during the respective calendar years. The acquisition closed on March 3, 2021.
•Settled the Riley Ridge helium supply contract claim with APMTG Helium, LLC for $52.1 million, which was previously accrued as a liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.
2021 BUSINESS OUTLOOK
Oil prices continued to strengthen during the first two months of 2021, reaching the low-$60s per barrel in mid-February. Considering the current oil price environment and strategic importance of the CO2 flood at Cedar Creek Anticline (“CCA”), we plan to move forward in 2021 with the development of this significant long-term project. We expect to allocate approximately $150 million of capital in 2021 to this CCA development, consisting of approximately $100 million dedicated to the 105-mile extension of the Greencore CO2 pipeline from Bell Creek to CCA, with the remainder dedicated to facilities, well work and field development at CCA. In total, we estimate that our total development capital expenditures in 2021, excluding acquisitions and capitalized interest, will be in a range of $250 million to $270 million. Based on current oil prices and the Company’s hedge positions, we estimate that our 2021 cash flows from operations will exceed our budgeted level of planned development capital expenditures. In addition to our 2021 planned development capital, we acquired the Big Sand Draw and Beaver Creek oil fields in Wyoming in early March 2021 for a cash purchase price of $12 million before closing adjustments. Also, we plan to settle the remaining debt obligation to Genesis for the NEJD CO2 pipeline, with $70 million in payments to be made over the course of 2021. We expect to fulfill these remaining obligations from cash flow and borrowings under our bank credit facility. At December 31, 2020, we had $482 million of availability under our bank credit facility, which we believe is more than adequate to cover any near-term liquidity needs. To supplement our liquidity, we may seek other sources of funding for all or a portion of the CCA CO2 Pipeline expenditure.
Based on our capital spending plans, we currently anticipate 2021 average daily production to be between 47,500 BOE/d and 51,500 BOE/d, including the Big Sand Draw and Beaver Creek working interests acquisition expected to close in early March 2021. Our anticipated 2021 production level compares to 2020 average continuing production of 50,957 BOE/d, after reduction for 2020 property divestitures.
HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our employees are our greatest resource, and each individual helps shape Denbury into a unique and exceptional place to work. We recognize that our employees are crucial to Denbury’s future, and we care about our employees’ and their families’ well-being beyond the work environment. As of December 31, 2020, we had 657 employees, of whom 365 were employed in our field operations or at our field offices and 292 were employed at our headquarters in Plano, TX.
Workforce Health and Safety
We continuously seek to improve our health and safety performance by fostering a culture that prioritizes safe work, then ensuring that this culture is exemplified in all levels of leadership. We provide our employees with tools to succeed, including relevant and timely training, and we monitor our performance using established measurement statistics. Each year, Denbury establishes corporate goals specifically related to employee and contractor safety performance and monitors progress toward those goals throughout the year using performance metrics. Results are regularly reported to our Board of Directors, senior management and all employees to ensure accountability and to reinforce their importance. Two safety performance metrics Denbury closely monitors are the Total Recordable Incident Rate (“TRIR”) and the Significant Injury or Fatality Rate (“SIFR”), which also captures near misses that may not have resulted in an injury. As detailed in our Corporate Responsibility Report available on our website at www.denbury.com under the “Responsibility” link, Denbury has set new record lows for TRIR over the last four consecutive years and our 2020 SIFR was our second lowest ever.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we formed a COVID-19 task force comprised of members of senior management and other key employees. The task force developed a systematic, data-based approach to monitor national, state and local orders and guidelines related to the COVID-19 pandemic, 
Denbury Inc.

established internal processes, training and communications, conducted contract tracing, and engaged a third-party medical consulting firm to identify and clear COVID-19 cases and exposures. Additionally, we provided voluntary COVID-19 testing for all employees and their dependents and ensured that necessary sanitation supplies are available at all Denbury offices and locations. 
Compensation and Benefits
As part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain competitive compensation and benefit programs for our employees in order to attract and retain outstanding talent. In addition to competitive base wages, other programs include an annual bonus plan, long-term incentive plan, Company matched 401(k) plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts and employee assistance programs.
Diversity and Inclusion
We are committed to increasing diversity and fostering an inclusive work environment that supports the workforce and the communities where we operate. Denbury aims to ensure equal opportunity in recruitment, and we reach a pool of diverse candidates by utilizing a digital recruiting program that posts available employment opportunities to websites worldwide, several of which are specifically targeted to reach diverse candidates. In 2020, women and minorities accounted for 21% and 14% of our workforce, respectively, and 46% and 23% of our new hires, respectively.
Our diversity, equity and inclusion principles are also reflected in our employee training and policies. To foster a diverse and collaborative workplace, Denbury requires all employees to complete annual training to raise awareness and encourage diversity and inclusion. Each year, our employee training program includes courses related to diversity, anti-discrimination, and anti-harassment to help employees understand diversity, cultural differences, recognize unconscious bias, and increase collaboration. We continue to enhance our diversity, equity and inclusion policies which are guided by our Board and executive leadership team.
Talent Acquisition, Retention and Development
Our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to hire, develop, and retain highly skilled and experienced personnel, including our executive officers as well as other key management and technical specialists, such as geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other oil and gas industry professionals. Denbury provides employees with many ways to expand their skills and advance their careers through training and development initiatives. We believe this is critical to each employee’s professional growth and success, as well as to our success as a company.
Human Rights
Denbury is committed to protecting human rights in the workplace. This commitment includes respecting the dignity and worth of all individuals, encouraging all individuals to reach their full potential, encouraging the initiative of each employee, and providing equal opportunity for development to all employees. Specifically, Denbury recognizes its responsibility with regards to: workplace health and safety, the prohibition of forced and child labor, a workplace free from harassment or any form of discrimination, freedom of association, complying with all laws regarding hours and wages and employee privacy.

ESTIMATED NET QUANTITIES OF PROVED OIL AND NATURAL GAS RESERVES AND PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE NET REVENUES
Oil and Natural Gas Reserve Estimates
DeGolyer and MacNaughton (“D&M”) prepared estimates of our net proved oil and natural gas reserves as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 (see the summary of D&M’s report as of December 31, 2020, included as an exhibit to this Form 10-K). These estimates of reserves were prepared using an average price equal to the unweighted arithmetic average of hydrocarbon prices on the first day of each month within the 12-month period in accordance with rules and regulations of the SEC.  These oil and natural gas reserve estimates do not include any value for probable or possible reserves that may exist, nor do they include any value for undeveloped acreage.  The reserve estimates represent our net revenue interest in our properties.
Denbury Inc.

The following table provides estimated proved reserve information prepared by D&M as of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, as well as PV-10 Values and Standardized Measures for each period. The Company’s December 31, 2020 proved oil and natural gas reserve quantities and PV-10 Values declined significantly from December 31, 2019 due largely to the decrease in oil prices used in preparing the December 31, 2019 and 2020 reserve information, whereby the average NYMEX oil price used in estimating our proved reserves declined from $55.69 per Bbl at December 31, 2019, to $39.57 per Bbl at December 31, 2020. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and their values, including many factors beyond our control, which are further discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors – Estimating our reserves, production and future net cash flows is difficult to do with any certainty.  See also Oil and Natural Gas Operations – Field Summary Table and Supplemental Oil and Natural Gas Disclosures (Unaudited) to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of reserve inputs and changes between periods.

(1)The reference prices were based on the arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month NYMEX commodity prices for each month during the respective year. These prices do not reflect adjustments for market differentials and transportation expenses by field that are utilized in the preparation of our reserve report to arrive at the appropriate net price we receive. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Financial and Operating Results Tables for details of oil and natural gas prices received, both including and excluding the impact of derivative settlements.
Denbury Inc.

(2)Determined based on the average first-day-of-the-month prices for each month, adjusted to prices received by field in accordance with standards set forth in the FASC. PV-10 Values and the Standardized Measure are significantly impacted by the oil prices we receive relative to NYMEX oil prices (our NYMEX oil price differential). The weighted-average oil price differentials utilized were $3.73 per Bbl below representative NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2020, compared to $0.14 per Bbl below NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2019, and $0.24 per Bbl below NYMEX oil prices as of December 31, 2018.
(3)PV-10 Value is a non-GAAP measure and is different from the Standardized Measure in that PV-10 Value is a pre-tax number and the Standardized Measure is an after-tax number. See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Non-GAAP Financial Measure and Reconciliation for further discussion.
Our proved developed non-producing reserves primarily consist of (1) reserves within a proved tertiary flood in areas that have not yet experienced a response from CO2 injection, (2) reserves that will be recovered from currently productive zones utilizing minor modifications to manage the flow of CO2 or water within the reservoir, and (3) reserves that will be recovered through recompletions to other intervals above or below the currently producing interval.
As of December 31, 2020, our estimated proved undeveloped reserves totaled approximately 4.1 MMBOE, or approximately 3% of our estimated total proved reserves.  Approximately 83% (3.4 MMBOE) of our proved undeveloped oil reserves relate to planned future development within our CO2 tertiary operating fields.  We generally consider the CO2 tertiary proved undeveloped reserves to be lower risk than other proved undeveloped reserves that require drilling at locations offsetting existing production, because all of these proved undeveloped reserves are associated with tertiary recovery operations in fields and reservoirs that historically produced substantial volumes of oil under primary production. As of December 31, 2020, 3.2 MMBOE of our total proved undeveloped reserves are not scheduled to be developed within five years of initial booking, all of which are part of CO2 EOR projects. We believe these reserves satisfy the conditions to be included as proved reserves because (1) we have established and continue to follow the previously adopted development plan for each of these projects; (2) we have significant ongoing development activities in each of these CO2 EOR projects and (3) we have a historical record of completing the development of comparable long-term projects.
Our proved undeveloped reserves at December 31, 2020 were 19.2 MMBOE (82%) lower than at December 31, 2019. During 2020, we spent approximately $10 million to convert 1.5 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves to proved developed reserves, primarily related to continued tertiary development activities at Oyster Bayou Field. The primary changes in our proved undeveloped reserves during 2020 were related to recognizing net downward revisions of our proved undeveloped reserves of 17.7 MMBOE, primarily the result of the significant decline in commodity prices between December 31, 2019 and 2020.
During 2020, we provided oil and natural gas reserve estimates for 2019 to the United States Energy Information Agency that were substantially the same as the reserve estimates included in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019.
Internal Controls Over Reserve Estimates
Reserve information in this report is based on estimates prepared by D&M, independent petroleum engineers located in Dallas, Texas, utilizing data provided by our internal reservoir engineering team and is the responsibility of management. We rely on D&M’s expertise to ensure that our reserve estimates are prepared in compliance with SEC rules and regulations and that appropriate geologic, petroleum engineering, and evaluation principles and techniques are applied in accordance with practices generally recognized by the petroleum industry as presented in the publication of the Society of Petroleum Engineers entitled “Standards Pertaining to the Estimating and Auditing of Oil and Gas Reserves Information (Revision as of June 2019)”.  The person responsible for the preparation of the reserve report is a Senior Vice President and Division Manager of North America at D&M.

The internal reservoir engineering team reports directly to our Senior Vice President – Business Development and Technology.  In addition, our Audit Committee of the Board of Directors oversees the qualifications, independence, performance and hiring of our independent petroleum engineers and reviews the final report and subsequent reporting of our oil and natural gas reserve estimates.  The Chairman of the Board holds a Ph.D. in Chemical Engineering from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and bachelor’s degrees in Chemistry and Mathematics from Capital University in Ohio. He has more than 40 years of industry experience, with responsibilities including reserves preparation and approval.
CARBON CAPTURE, USE AND STORAGE
In addition to our oil and natural gas operations, our strategically located and extensive CO2 pipeline infrastructure provide a meaningful opportunity to grow our business in the emerging CCUS industry. We believe that the assets and expertise required for CCUS are highly aligned with Denbury’s existing CO2 EOR operations, providing Denbury with an advantage, particularly in the Gulf Coast region, where our CO2 infrastructure is located in close proximity to multiple large sources of industrial emissions. We also believe that supportive U.S. government policy and public pressure on industrial CO2 emitters could provide strong incentives for these entities to capture their CO2 emissions. In early January 2021, the U.S. Treasury and the IRS issued final regulations under Section 45Q on the expanded carbon capture tax credit, implementing a number of changes and clarifications to previously proposed regulations, including (1) simplifying the definition of carbon capture equipment; (2) allowing smaller carbon capture facilities to be aggregated for purposes of meeting minimum capture requirements; (3) reducing the tax credit recapture period to three years; and (4) extending the beginning construction date to January 1, 2026 for carbon capture projects. The tax credit structure provides the capturing parties a tax credit that escalates until 2026, when it reaches $35 per ton for CO2 used in EOR operations and $50 per ton for CO2 directly stored in geologic formations. CCUS is a proven technology with the potential for safe, long-term, deep underground containment of industrial-sourced CO2, and we believe Denbury is well positioned to leverage our existing CO2 pipeline infrastructure and EOR expertise to be a leader in this industry.
OIL AND NATURAL GAS OPERATIONS
Summary. Our oil and natural gas properties are concentrated in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions of the United States.  Currently our properties with proved and producing reserves in the Gulf Coast region are situated in Mississippi, Texas, and Louisiana, and in the Rocky Mountain region are situated in Montana, North Dakota and Wyoming. The Company is differentiated by its focus on CO2 EOR and the emerging CCUS industry, supported by the Company’s CO2 EOR technical and operational expertise and its extensive CO2 pipeline infrastructure. The utilization of captured industrial-sourced CO2 in EOR significantly reduces the carbon footprint of the oil that Denbury produces, underpinning the Company’s goal to fully offset its Scope 1, 2, and 3 CO2 emissions within the decade. Our current portfolio of CO2 EOR projects provides us significant oil production and reserve growth potential in the future, assuming crude oil prices are at levels that support the development of those projects.
We have been conducting and expanding EOR operations on our assets in the Gulf Coast region since 1999, and as a result, we currently have many more CO2 EOR projects in this region than in the Rocky Mountain region. We began operations in the Rocky Mountain region in 2010 in connection with, and following, our merger with Encore Acquisition Company (“Encore”). In 2012, as part of a significant sale and exchange transaction with Exxon Mobil Corporation (“ExxonMobil”), we sold to ExxonMobil our Bakken area assets in North Dakota and Montana in exchange for (1) $1.3 billion in cash, (2) operating interests in Hartzog Draw and Webster fields in Wyoming and Texas, respectively, and (3) an overriding royalty interest equivalent to an approximate one-third ownership interest in ExxonMobil’s CO2 reserves in LaBarge Field in Wyoming (the “Bakken Exchange Transaction”). In the Gulf Coast region, we own what is, to our knowledge, the region’s only significant naturally occurring source of CO2, and these large volumes of naturally occurring CO2 give us a significant competitive advantage in this area. In addition to this naturally occurring CO2 source, we utilize CO2 captured from industrial sources which would otherwise be released into the atmosphere (sometimes referred to as anthropogenic, man-made or industrial-sourced CO2) in our tertiary operations, including CO2 from the LaBarge Field in Wyoming, which is captured in conjunction with processing helium from the LaBarge Field gas stream at ExxonMobil’s Shute Creek gas plant. These industrial sources of CO2 help us recover additional oil from mature oil fields and, we believe, also provide an economical way to reduce

atmospheric CO2 emissions through the associated underground storage of CO2 which incidentally occurs as part of our oil-producing EOR operations.
Field Summary Table. The following table provides a summary by field and region of selected proved oil and natural gas reserve information, including total proved reserve quantities as of December 31, 2020, and average daily production for 2020, all based on Denbury’s net revenue interest (“NRI”).  The reserve estimates presented were prepared by D&M, independent petroleum engineers located in Dallas, Texas.  We serve as operator of nearly all of our significant properties, in which we also own most of the interests, although typically less than a 100% working interest, and a lesser NRI due to royalties and other burdens.

Enhanced Oil Recovery Overview. CO2 used in EOR is one of the most efficient tertiary recovery mechanisms for producing crude oil.  When injected under pressure into underground, oil-bearing rock formations, CO2 acts somewhat like a solvent as it travels through the reservoir rock, mixing with and modifying the characteristics of the oil so it can be produced and sold.  The terms “tertiary flood,” “CO2 flood” and “CO2 EOR” are used interchangeably throughout this document.
While enhanced oil recovery projects utilizing CO2 have been successfully performed by numerous oil and gas companies in a wide range of oil-bearing reservoirs in different oil-producing basins, we believe our investments, experience and acquired knowledge give us a strategic and competitive advantage in the areas in which we operate. We apply what we have learned and developed over the years to improve and increase sweep efficiency within the CO2 EOR projects we operate.
We began our CO2 operations in August 1999, when we acquired Little Creek Field, followed by our acquisition of Jackson Dome CO2 reserves and the NEJD pipeline in 2001.  Based upon our success at Little Creek and the ownership of the CO2 reserves, we began to transition our capital spending and acquisition efforts to focus more heavily on CO2 EOR and, over time, transformed our strategy to focus primarily on owning and operating oil fields that are well suited for CO2 EOR projects. Prior to tertiary flooding, we strive to maximize the currently sizeable primary and secondary production from our prospective tertiary fields and from fields in which tertiary floods have commenced but still contain significant non-tertiary production.  Our asset base today almost entirely consists of, or otherwise relates to, oil fields that we are currently flooding with CO2 or plan to flood with CO2 in the future, or assets that produce CO2.
Our tertiary operations have grown so that (1) 57% of our proved reserves at December 31, 2020 are proved tertiary oil reserves; (2) 67% of our 2020 total production was related to tertiary oil operations (on a BOE basis); and (3) 59% of our 2020 capital expenditures (excluding acquisitions) were related to our tertiary oil operations.  At year-end 2020, the proved oil reserves in our tertiary recovery oil fields had an estimated PV-10 Value of approximately $449.9 million, or 64% of our total PV-10 Value.  In addition, there are significant probable and possible reserves at several other fields for which tertiary operations are underway or planned.
Although the up-front cost of tertiary production infrastructure and time to construct pipelines and production facilities is greater than in primary oil recovery in most circumstances, we believe tertiary recovery has several favorable, offsetting and unique attributes, including (1) a lower exploration risk, as we are operating oil fields that have significant historical production and reservoir and geological data, (2) lower production decline rates than unconventional development, (3) reasonable return metrics at our anticipated long-term prices, (4) limited competition for this recovery method in our geographic regions and a strategic advantage due to our ownership of the CO2 reserves and CO2 pipeline infrastructure, (5) our EOR operations are generally less disruptive to new habitats in comparison to other oil and natural gas development because we further develop existing (as opposed to new) oil fields, and (6) through our oil-producing EOR operations, we concurrently store CO2 captured from industrial sources in the same underground formations that previously trapped and stored oil and natural gas.

CO2 Sources and Pipelines
Jackson Dome.  Our primary Gulf Coast CO2 source, Jackson Dome, located near Jackson, Mississippi, was discovered during the 1970s by oil and gas companies that were exploring for hydrocarbons.  This large and relatively pure source of naturally occurring CO2 (98% CO2) is, to our knowledge, the only significant underground deposit of CO2 in the United States east of the Mississippi River. Together with the related CO2 pipeline infrastructure, Jackson Dome provides us a significant 
15


Denbury Inc.

strategic advantage in the acquisition of properties in Mississippi, Louisiana and southeastern Texas that are well suited for CO2 EOR.
We acquired Jackson Dome in February 2001 in a purchase that also gave us ownership and control of the NEJD CO2 pipeline and provided us with a reliable supply of CO2 at a reasonable and predictable cost for our Gulf Coast CO2 tertiary recovery operations.  Since February 2001, we have acquired and drilled numerous CO2-producing wells, significantly increasing our estimated proved Gulf Coast CO2 reserves from approximately 800 Bcf at the time of acquisition of Jackson Dome to approximately 4.6 Tcf as of December 31, 2020.  The proved CO2 reserve estimates are based on a gross (8/8ths) basis, of which our net revenue interest is approximately 3.7 Tcf, and is included in the evaluation of proved CO2 reserves prepared by D&M, independent petroleum engineers.  In discussing our available CO2 reserves, we make reference to the gross amount of proved and probable reserves, as this is the amount that is available both for our own tertiary recovery programs and for industrial users who are customers of Denbury and others, as we are responsible for distributing the entire CO2 production stream.
In addition to our proved reserves, we estimate that we have 910.1 Bcf, on a gross (8/8ths) basis, of probable CO2 reserves at Jackson Dome.  While the majority of these probable reserves are located in structures that have been drilled and tested, such reserves are still considered probable reserves because (1) the original well is plugged; (2) they are located in fault blocks that are immediately adjacent to fault blocks with proved reserves; or (3) they are reserves associated with increasing the ultimate recovery factor from our existing reservoirs with proved reserves. In addition, a significant portion of these probable reserves at Jackson Dome are located in undrilled structures where we have sufficient subsurface and seismic data indicating geophysical attributes that, coupled with our historically high drilling success rate, provide a reasonably high degree of certainty that CO2 is present.
In addition to our drilling at Jackson Dome, we have the capability to expand our processing and dehydration capacities and install additional pipelines and/or pumping stations necessary to transport the CO2 through our controlled pipeline network. We expect our current proved reserves of CO2, coupled with a risked drilling program at Jackson Dome and CO2 expected to be captured from industrial sources, to provide sufficient quantities of CO2 for us to develop our proved and probable EOR reserves in the Gulf Coast region. In the future, we believe that once a CO2 flood in a field reaches its productive economic limit, we could recycle a portion of the CO2 that remains in that field’s reservoir and utilize it for oil production in another field’s tertiary flood.
In the Gulf Coast region, approximately 78% of our average daily CO2 produced from Jackson Dome or captured from industrial sources in 2020 was used in our tertiary recovery operations, compared to 84% in 2019 and 83% in 2018, with the balance delivered to third-party industrial users. During 2020, we used an average of 358 MMcf/d of CO2 (including CO2 captured from industrial sources) for our tertiary activities.
Gulf Coast CO2 Captured from Industrial Sources.  In addition to our natural source of CO2, we are currently party to two long-term contracts to purchase CO2 from industrial plants.  We have purchased CO2 from an industrial facility in Port Arthur, Texas since 2012 and from an industrial facility in Geismar, Louisiana since 2013, which supplied an average of approximately 57 MMcf/d of CO2 to our EOR operations during 2020.  Additionally, we are in ongoing discussions with other parties that are planning to capture CO2 from currently existing industrial facilities or proposed new industrial facilities near the Green Pipeline. In order to capture such volumes, we (or the plant owner) would need to install additional equipment, which includes, at a minimum, compression and dehydration facilities.
Gulf Coast CO2 Pipelines. We acquired the 183-mile NEJD CO2 pipeline that runs from Jackson Dome to near Donaldsonville, Louisiana, as part of the 2001 acquisition of our Jackson Dome CO2 source.  Since 2001, we have acquired or constructed nearly 750 miles of CO2 pipelines in the Gulf Coast, and as of December 31, 2020, we own nearly 925 miles of CO2 pipelines, which gives us the ability to deliver CO2 throughout the Gulf Coast region.  In addition to the NEJD CO2 pipeline, the major pipelines in the Gulf Coast region are the Free State Pipeline (90 miles), Delta Pipeline (110 miles), Green Pipeline Texas (120 miles), and Green Pipeline Louisiana (200 miles). In late October 2020, we restructured our NEJD and Free State CO2 pipeline agreements with Genesis (see 2020 Business Developments above).
Completion of the Green Pipeline allowed for the first CO2 injection into Hastings Field, located near Houston, Texas, in 2010, and gives us the ability to deliver CO2 to oil fields all along the Gulf Coast from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, to Alvin, Texas.  At the present time, most of the CO2 flowing in the Green Pipeline is delivered from the Jackson Dome area, but also includes the CO2 we are receiving from the industrial facilities in Port Arthur, Texas and Geismar, Louisiana, and we are 
16


Denbury Inc.

currently transporting a third party’s CO2 for a fee to the sales point at Hastings Field.  We currently have ample capacity within the Green Pipeline to handle additional volumes that may be required to develop our inventory of CO2 EOR projects in this area, as well as to support the transportation of CO2 for the emerging CCUS business.
Tertiary Properties with Tertiary Production and Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2020
Delhi Field. Delhi Field is located east of Monroe, Louisiana.  In May 2006, we purchased our initial interest in Delhi for $50 million.  We began well and facility development in 2008, began delivering CO2 to the field in 2009 via the Delta Pipeline, which runs from Tinsley Field to Delhi Field, and first tertiary production occurred at Delhi Field in 2010.  During 2016, we completed construction of a natural gas liquids extraction plant, which provides us with the ability to sell natural gas liquids from the produced stream, improve the efficiency of the CO2 flood, and utilize extracted methane to power the plant and reduce field operating expenses. Production from Delhi Field in the fourth quarter of 2020 averaged 3,132 Bbls/d, compared to 4,085 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Hastings Field.  Hastings Field is located south of Houston, Texas.  We acquired a majority interest in this field in February 2009 for $247 million.  We initiated CO2 injection in the West Hastings Unit during 2010 upon completion of the construction of the Green Pipeline.  Due to the large vertical oil column that exists in the field, we are developing the Frio reservoir using dedicated CO2 injection and producing wells for each of the major sand intervals. We began producing oil from our EOR operations at Hastings Field in 2012, and we booked initial proved tertiary reserves for the West Hastings Unit in 2012.  The Company also has future plans for continued tertiary development of existing proved undeveloped reserves at the field. During the fourth quarter of 2020, tertiary production from Hastings Field averaged 4,598 Bbls/d, compared to 5,097 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Heidelberg Field.  Heidelberg Field is located in Mississippi off of the Free State Pipeline and consists of an East Unit and a West Unit.  Construction of the CO2 facility, connecting pipeline and well work commenced on the West Heidelberg Unit during 2008, with our first CO2 injections into the Eutaw zone.  Our first tertiary oil production occurred in 2009, and we began flooding the Christmas and Tuscaloosa zones in 2013 and 2014, respectively.  During 2019, we expanded our tertiary flood of the Christmas zone and invested in non-tertiary behind pipe projects. During the fourth quarter of 2020, tertiary production at Heidelberg Field averaged 4,198 Bbls/d, compared to 4,409 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Oyster Bayou Field.  We acquired a majority interest in Oyster Bayou Field in 2007. The field is located in southeast Texas, east of Galveston Bay, and is somewhat unique when compared to our other CO2 EOR projects because the field covers a relatively small area of 3,912 acres. We began CO2 injections into Oyster Bayou Field in 2010, commenced tertiary production in 2011 from the Frio A-1 zone, and booked initial proved tertiary reserves for the field in 2012.  In 2014, we completed development of the Frio A-2 zone, and we further expanded the A-2 flood and increased compression capacity during 2020. During the fourth quarter of 2020, tertiary production at Oyster Bayou Field averaged 3,880 Bbls/d, compared to 4,261 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Tinsley Field.  We acquired Tinsley Field in 2006. This Mississippi field was discovered and first developed in the 1930s and is separated by different fault blocks.  As is the case with the majority of fields in Mississippi, Tinsley Field produces from multiple reservoirs.  Our CO2 enhanced oil recovery operations at Tinsley Field have thus far targeted the Woodruff formation, although there is additional potential in the Perry sandstone and other smaller reservoirs.  We commenced tertiary oil production from Tinsley Field in 2008 and substantially completed development of the Woodruff formation during 2014.  During the fourth quarter of 2020, tertiary oil production from the field averaged 3,654 Bbls/d, compared to 4,343 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2019. Although production from Tinsley Field peaked in 2015 and is generally on decline, we continue to evaluate future potential investment opportunities in this field.
West Yellow Creek Field. We acquired an approximate 48% non-operated working interest in West Yellow Creek Field in Mississippi in March 2017 for approximately $16 million, a field in which the operator had previously invested significant capital converting the field to a CO2 EOR flood. Under our arrangement with the operator, we supply CO2 to the field for a fee. West Yellow Creek Field is in close proximity and analogous to Eucutta Field, a very successful CO2 flood that we developed and continue to operate. We booked initial proved tertiary oil reserves at West Yellow Creek Field as of year-end 2017 and commenced tertiary production in early 2018. During the fourth quarter of 2020, tertiary oil production from the field averaged 614 Bbls/d, compared to 807 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2019.

Denbury Inc.

Mature properties. Mature properties include our longest-producing properties which are generally located along our NEJD CO2 pipeline in southwest Mississippi and Louisiana and our Free State Pipeline in east Mississippi.  This group of properties includes our initial CO2 field, Little Creek, as well as several other fields (Brookhaven, Cranfield, Eucutta, Mallalieu, Martinville, McComb and Soso fields).  These fields accounted for 17% of our total 2020 CO2 EOR production and approximately 5% of our year-end proved reserves.  These fields have been producing under CO2 flood for more than a decade, and their production is generally declining, though we continue to evaluate future potential investment opportunities in these fields.
Potential Future Tertiary Properties with No Tertiary Production or Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2020
Webster Field. We acquired our interest in Webster Field in 2012 as part of the Bakken Exchange Transaction. The field is located southeast of Houston, Texas, approximately eight miles northeast of our Hastings Field which we are currently flooding with CO2. At December 31, 2020, Webster Field had estimated proved non-tertiary reserves of approximately 1.3 MMBOE, net to our interest, all of which are proved developed.  During the fourth quarter of 2020, non-tertiary production at Webster Field averaged 442 BOE/d, compared to 923 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2019. In March 2020, we sold half of our working interest in Webster Field as part of our Gulf Coast Working Interests Sale (see Gulf Coast Working Interest Partner below).  Webster Field is geologically similar to our Hastings Field, producing oil from the Frio zone at similar depths; as a result, we believe it is well suited for CO2 EOR. In 2014, we completed a nine-mile lateral between the Green Pipeline and Webster Field, which we plan will eventually deliver CO2 to the field. Although we sold half of our working interest in Webster Field in 2020, we retained the right to execute a future CO2 flood in this field, the timing of which is primarily dependent upon capital availability and priorities and future oil prices.
Conroe Field.  Conroe Field, our largest potential tertiary flood in the Gulf Coast region, is located north of Houston, Texas.  We acquired a majority interest in this field in 2009 for $271 million in cash and 11.6 million shares of Denbury common stock, for a total aggregate value of $439 million.  Conroe Field had estimated proved non-tertiary reserves of approximately 7.8 MMBOE at December 31, 2020, net to our interest, all of which are proved developed.  During the fourth quarter of 2020, non-tertiary production at Conroe Field averaged 1,624 BOE/d, compared to 1,861 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2019.
To initiate a CO2 flood at Conroe Field, a pipeline must be constructed so that CO2 can be delivered to the field.  This pipeline, which is planned as an extension of our Green Pipeline, is preliminarily estimated to cover approximately 90 miles. The timing of the development of a CO2 flood at Conroe Field is primarily dependent upon capital availability and priorities, future oil prices and pipeline construction.
In addition to the currently-producing oil-bearing formations at Conroe Field, we are evaluating exploitation opportunities in other formations. We currently do not have any additional wells planned for 2021 but continue to evaluate additional opportunities and plan to de-risk other areas of the field in the future.
Thompson Field. We acquired our interest in Thompson Field in June 2012 for $366 million. The field is located in Texas, approximately 18 miles west of our Hastings Field. Thompson Field had estimated proved non-tertiary reserves of approximately 1.7 MMBOE at December 31, 2020, net to our interest, all of which are proved developed.  During the fourth quarter of 2020, non-tertiary production at Thompson Field averaged 455 BOE/d, compared to 1,008 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2019. In March 2020, we sold half of our working interest in Thompson Field as part of our Gulf Coast Working Interests Sale (see Gulf Coast Working Interest Partner below).  Thompson Field is geologically similar to Hastings Field, producing oil from the Frio zone at similar depths, and we therefore believe it has CO2 EOR potential. Under the terms of the Thompson Field acquisition agreement, after the initiation of CO2 injection, the seller will retain approximately a 5% gross revenue interest (less severance taxes) once average monthly oil production exceeds 3,000 Bbls/d. The timing of the development of a CO2 flood at Thompson Field is primarily dependent upon capital availability and priorities and future oil prices.
Gulf Coast Working Interest Partner. In March 2020, we sold half of our nearly 100% working interest positions in four conventional southeast Texas oil fields (consisting of Webster, Thompson, Manvel and East Hastings) for $40 million net cash and a carried interest in ten wells to be drilled by the purchaser.  Under the agreement, the purchaser is committed to funding 100% of the capital required to drill and complete an initial ten horizontal wells across the fields within 18 months after closing.  On these initial ten wells, Denbury will receive a 6.25% overriding royalty interest prior to the combined payout of the wells in a specified field and subsequent to payout, Denbury will receive production revenues from, and bear the cost of, its 
18


Denbury Inc.

50% working interest in each well.  As part of the agreement, we will retain 100% ownership of the future Webster Unit CO2 flood, wherein (1) the purchaser may elect to participate in the future CO2 flood through reimbursement to Denbury of the purchaser’s working interest share of project costs incurred to date, or (2) if the purchaser declines to participate in the CO2 flood, we have the right to repurchase the purchaser’s working interest in Webster Field under a contractually agreed valuation mechanism.
Rocky Mountain Region
CO2 Sources and Pipelines
LaBarge Field.  We acquired an overriding royalty interest equivalent to an approximate one-third ownership interest in ExxonMobil’s CO2 reserves in LaBarge Field in the fourth quarter of 2012 as part of the Bakken Exchange Transaction. LaBarge Field is located in southwestern Wyoming, and as of December 31, 2020, our interest in LaBarge Field consisted of approximately 1.1 Tcf of proved CO2 reserves.
During 2020, we received an average of approximately 85 MMcf/d of CO2 from the Shute Creek gas processing plant at LaBarge Field that we used in our Rocky Mountain region CO2 floods. Based on current capacity, and subject to availability of CO2, we currently expect our CO2 volumes from Shute Creek to increase in future years. We pay ExxonMobil a fee to process and deliver the CO2, which we use in our Rocky Mountain region CO2 floods.
Other Rocky Mountain CO2 Sources.  We have a contract in place to receive all of the CO2 from the ConocoPhillips-operated Lost Cabin gas plant in central Wyoming, which we estimate has the capability to provide us as much as 30 MMcf/d of CO2 for use in our Rocky Mountain region CO2 floods, although we did not receive any CO2 volumes for the period May 2020 through December 2020. We currently estimate that our existing CO2 sources, plus additional CO2 from those or other CO2 sources in the region, are sufficient to carry out our base Rocky Mountain region EOR development plans.
Rocky Mountain CO2 Pipelines.  The 20-inch Greencore pipeline in Wyoming is the first CO2 pipeline we constructed in the Rocky Mountain region.  We plan to use the pipeline as our trunk line in the Rocky Mountain region, eventually connecting our various Rocky Mountain region CO2 sources to the Cedar Creek Anticline in eastern Montana and western North Dakota. The 232-mile pipeline begins at the ConocoPhillips-operated Lost Cabin gas plant in Wyoming and terminates at Bell Creek Field in Montana.  We completed construction of the pipeline in 2012 and received our first CO2 deliveries from the ConocoPhillips-operated Lost Cabin gas plant during 2013.  During 2014, we completed construction of an interconnect between our Greencore pipeline and an existing third-party CO2 pipeline in Wyoming, which enables us to transport CO2 from LaBarge Field to our Bell Creek Field.
The CO2 enhanced oil recovery development project at Cedar Creek Anticline requires a 105-mile extension of the Greencore CO2 pipeline to CCA from Bell Creek Field. The capital outlay for the pipeline is projected to be approximately $150 million, of which we have incurred approximately $50 million through December 31, 2020 (see also Cedar Creek Anticline CO2 EOR Project below for further discussion).
Tertiary Properties with Tertiary Production and Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2020
Bell Creek Field.  We acquired our interest in Bell Creek Field in southeast Montana as part of the Encore merger in 2010.  The oil-producing reservoir in Bell Creek Field is a sandstone reservoir with characteristics similar to those we have successfully flooded with CO2 in the Gulf Coast region. During 2013, we began first CO2 injections into Bell Creek Field, recorded our first tertiary oil production, and booked initial proved tertiary reserves. During 2018, we completed the phase five expansion at the field, and in April 2019, commenced CO2 injection into phase six of the field development. Tertiary production during the fourth quarter of 2020 averaged 5,079 Bbls/d of oil, compared to 5,618 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2019.
Grieve Field. Under a 2011 farm-in agreement, we obtained a 65% working interest in Grieve Field, located in Natrona County, Wyoming, in exchange for developing the Grieve Field CO2 flood. During 2016, the Company and its joint venture partner in Grieve Field revised their development arrangement for the field so that our partner funded development of the facility and fieldwork in exchange for a 14% higher working interest and a disproportionate sharing of revenue from the first 2 million barrels of production. We commenced tertiary production from Grieve Field during the fourth quarter of 2018 and 
19


Denbury Inc.

booked initial proved tertiary reserves during 2019. In October 2020, we foreclosed on the joint venture partner’s interest, and we obtained record title to their interest in February 2021.
Salt Creek Field.  We acquired our 23% non-operated working interest in Salt Creek Field in Wyoming for approximately $72 million in June 2017. Tertiary production during the fourth quarter of 2020 averaged 2,007 Bbls/d of oil, compared to 2,223 Bbls/d in the fourth quarter of 2019.
March 2021 Acquisition of Wyoming CO2 EOR Fields
Wyoming CO2 EOR Fields. In December 2020, we entered into an agreement to acquire a nearly 100% working interest (approximately 83% net revenue interest) in the Big Sand Draw and Beaver Creek oil fields located in Wyoming for $12 million cash, including surface facilities and a 46-mile CO2 transportation pipeline to the acquired fields. The agreement provides for us to make two contingent cash payments of $4 million each in 2021 and 2022 if NYMEX WTI oil prices average at least $50 per Bbl during the respective calendar years. Net production from the acquired fields was approximately 2,800 BOE/d for the third quarter of 2020, of which approximately 85% was oil production. Based on December 1, 2020 oil and natural gas futures strip prices, net proved reserves for the acquired fields, which are 93% oil, were estimated at approximately 13.7 MMBOE, including 5.5 MMBOE of proved undeveloped reserves. The acquisition closed on March 3, 2021.
Future Tertiary Properties with No Tertiary Production or Proved Tertiary Reserves at December 31, 2020
Cedar Creek Anticline.  CCA is the largest potential EOR property that we own and currently our largest producing property, contributing approximately 23% of our 2020 total production. Historical production from the property has primarily been from the Red River interval. The field is primarily located in Montana but extends over such a large area (approximately 126 miles) that it also extends into North Dakota.  CCA is a series of 13 different operating areas on a common geological trend, each of which could be considered a field by itself.  We acquired our initial interest in CCA as part of the Encore merger in 2010 and acquired additional interests from a wholly-owned subsidiary of ConocoPhillips in 2013 for $1.0 billion, adding 42.2 MMBOE of incremental proved reserves at that date. Production from CCA averaged 11,433 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to production during the fourth quarter of 2019 of 13,730 BOE/d. The non-tertiary proved reserves associated with CCA were 45.2 MMBOE, net to our interest, as of December 31, 2020.
In addition to the Red River interval, CCA contains other oil-bearing intervals including Mission Canyon and Charles B. We began pursuing these additional exploitation opportunities in late 2017. We have drilled nine successful Mission Canyon exploitation wells and a successful initial test well in Cabin Creek’s Charles B formation over the last few years. We continue to evaluate the Charles B formation and believe it has characteristics that would make it a good candidate for secondary or tertiary flooding.
Cedar Creek Anticline CO2 EOR Project. CCA is located approximately 110 miles north of Bell Creek Field, and our current plan is to extend the Greencore pipeline to CCA by the end of 2021, with first CO2 injection planned during the first half of 2022. During 2021, we plan to spend approximately $100 million to complete the 105-mile extension of the Greencore CO2 pipeline and an additional $50 million on facilities, well work and field development to prepare both the Cedar Hills South Unit and East Lookout Butte for initial CO2 injections in the Red River formation. First tertiary production is currently expected in the latter part of 2023, or approximately 18 to 24 months after first injection, with additional phases of development expected to target the Interlake, Stony Mountain and Red River formations at Cabin Creek Field.
Hartzog Draw Field. We acquired our interest in Hartzog Draw Field in 2012 as part of the Bakken Exchange Transaction. The field is located in the Powder River Basin of northeastern Wyoming, approximately 12 miles from our Greencore pipeline. Hartzog Draw Field had estimated proved reserves of approximately 1.7 MMBOE at December 31, 2020, net to our interest, 0.3 MMBOE of which relate to the natural gas producing Big George coal zone.  During the fourth quarter of 2020, non-tertiary production averaged 955 BOE/d, compared to 1,172 BOE/d in the fourth quarter of 2019. Industry activity around this field has been increasing for the last several years, with several operators testing various formations such as the Turner, Niobrara, Shannon, Parkman and Mowry for potential development. We believe the oil reservoir characteristics of Hartzog Draw Field make it well suited for CO2 EOR in the future. The timing of development of a CO2 flood at Hartzog Draw Field is primarily dependent upon capital availability and priorities and future oil prices.

Other Non-Tertiary Oil Properties
Despite the majority of our oil and natural gas properties discussed above consisting of either existing or planned future tertiary floods, we also produce oil and natural gas from fields in both our Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions that are either not amenable to EOR or from specific reservoirs (within an existing tertiary field) that are not amenable to EOR. For example, at Heidelberg Field, we produce natural gas from the Selma Chalk reservoir, which is separate from the Christmas and Eutaw reservoirs currently being flooded with CO2. Continuing production from these other non-tertiary properties totaled 1,016 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2020, compared to 1,362 BOE/d during the fourth quarter of 2019.
OIL AND GAS ACREAGE, PRODUCTIVE WELLS AND DRILLING ACTIVITY
In the data below, “gross” represents the total acres or wells in which we own a working interest and “net” represents the gross acres or wells multiplied by our working interest percentage.  For the wells that produce both oil and gas, the well is typically classified as an oil or natural gas well based on the ratio of oil to natural gas production.
Oil and Gas Acreage
The following table sets forth our acreage position at December 31, 2020:

 | Developed | Undeveloped | | Total
 | Gross | Net | | Gross | Net | Gross | | Net

(1)An exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or natural gas in another reservoir.  Generally, an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well, an extension well, a service well or a stratigraphic test well.  A development well is a well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.
(2)A productive well is an exploratory or development well drilled and completed during the year and found to be capable of producing either oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to justify completion as an oil or natural gas well.
(3)A non-productive well is an exploratory or development well that is not a productive well.
(4)During 2019 and 2018, an additional 7 and 4 wells, respectively, were drilled for water or CO2 injection purposes.

PRODUCTION AND UNIT PRICES
Further information regarding average production rates, unit sales prices and unit costs per BOE are set forth under Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Results of Operations – Financial and Operating Results Tables, included herein.
TITLE TO PROPERTIES
As is customary in the oil and natural gas industry, Denbury conducts a limited title examination at the time of its acquisition of properties or leasehold interests targeted for enhanced recovery, and curative work is performed with respect to significant defects on higher-value properties of the greatest significance. We believe that title to our oil and natural gas 
Denbury Inc.

properties is good and defensible, subject only to such exceptions that we believe do not materially interfere with the use of such properties, including encumbrances, easements, restrictions and royalty, overriding royalty and other similar interests.
SIGNIFICANT OIL AND GAS PURCHASERS AND PRODUCT MARKETING
Oil and natural gas sales are made on a day-to-day basis or under short-term contracts at the current area market price. We would not expect the loss of any single purchaser to have a material adverse effect upon our operations; however, the loss of a large single purchaser could potentially reduce the competition for our oil and natural gas production, which in turn could negatively impact the prices we receive.  For the Successor period September 19, 2020 through December 31, 2020, three purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Plains Marketing LP (30%), Marathon Petroleum Corporation (13%) and Hunt Crude Oil Supply Company (12%), and for the Predecessor period January 1, 2020 through September 18, 2020, three purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Plains Marketing LP (30%), Hunt Crude Oil Supply Company (12%) and Marathon Petroleum Corporation (12%). For the year ended December 31, 2019 (Predecessor), three purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Plains Marketing LP (32%), Hunt Crude Oil Supply Company (11%) and Sunoco Inc. (11%). For the year ended December 31, 2018 (Predecessor), two purchasers accounted for 10% or more of our oil and natural gas revenues: Plains Marketing LP (24%) and Hunt Crude Oil Supply Company (10%).
Our ability to market oil and natural gas depends on many factors beyond our control, including the extent of domestic production and imports of oil and natural gas, available oil storage at Cushing, Oklahoma, and other inventory hubs, the proximity of our oil and natural gas production to pipelines and corresponding markets, the available capacity in such pipelines, the demand for oil and natural gas, the effects of weather, and the effects of state and federal regulation.  While we have not experienced significant difficulty in finding a market for our production as it becomes available or in transporting our production to those markets, during 2020, we experienced some level of disruption in off-take capacity as a result of storage constraints during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no assurance that we will always be able to market all of our production or obtain favorable prices.
Oil Marketing
Prices received in a regional market fluctuate frequently and can differ from NYMEX pricing due to a variety of reasons, including supply and/or demand factors, crude oil quality and location differentials. The oil differentials we received in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions are discussed in further detail below.
With the recent exception of 2020, our crude oil prices in the Gulf Coast region have generally been positive to NYMEX and highly correlated to the changes in prices of crude oil sold under Light Louisiana Sweet. Our average NYMEX oil differential in the Gulf Coast region was a negative $1.14 per Bbl during 2020, compared to a positive $3.30 per Bbl and a positive $2.94 per Bbl during 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our current markets at various sales points along the Gulf Coast have sufficient demand to accommodate our production, but there can be no assurance of future demand.
The marketing of our Rocky Mountain region oil production is dependent on transportation through local pipelines to our primary market centers in Guernsey, Wyoming and Cushing, Oklahoma, although some of our production may ultimately be transported by third parties to Wood River, Illinois.  Shipments on some of the pipelines are at or near capacity and may be subject to apportionment.  We currently have access to, or have contracted for, sufficient pipeline capacity to move our oil production; however, there can be no assurance that we will be allocated sufficient pipeline capacity to move all of our oil production in the future.  Because local demand for production is small in comparison to current production levels, much of the production in the Rocky Mountain region is transported to markets outside of the region. Therefore, prices in the Rocky Mountain region are further influenced by fluctuations in prices (primarily Brent and LLS) in coastal markets and by available pipeline capacity in the Midwest and Cushing markets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the discount for our oil production relative to NYMEX in the Rocky Mountain region averaged $2.80 per Bbl, compared to $2.01 per Bbl during 2019 and $1.50 per Bbl during 2018.
COMPETITION AND MARKETS
We face competition from other oil and natural gas companies in all aspects of our business, including acquisition of producing properties, oil and gas leases, drilling rights, and CO2 properties; marketing of oil and natural gas; and obtaining and maintaining goods, services and labor.  Many of our competitors have substantially larger financial and other 
24


Denbury Inc.

resources.  Factors that affect our ability to acquire producing properties include available liquidity, available information about prospective properties and our expectations for earning a minimum projected return on our investments.  Because of the primary nature of our core assets (our tertiary operations) and our ownership of relatively uncommon significant natural sources of CO2 in the Gulf Coast and Rocky Mountain regions, we believe that we are effective in competing in the market and have less competition than our peers in certain aspects of our business.
The demand for qualified and experienced field personnel to drill wells and conduct field operations and for geologists, geophysicists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and gas industry can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with commodity prices, causing periodic shortages in such personnel.  Prior to the downturn in oil prices that began in late 2014, the competition for qualified technical personnel had been extensive and personnel costs escalated. There were also periods with shortages of drilling rigs and other equipment, as demand for rigs and equipment increased along with the number of wells being drilled.  These factors also cause significant increases in costs for equipment, services and personnel.  We cannot be certain when we will experience these issues, and these types of shortages or price increases could significantly decrease our profit margin, cash flow and operating results and cause significant delays in our development operations.
FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS
Numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations govern the oil and gas industry.  Additions or changes to these laws and regulations are often made in response to the current political or economic environment. Compliance with the evolving regulatory landscape is often difficult, and noncompliance can result in substantial penalties or the potential shutdown of operations. Additionally, the future annual cost of complying with all laws and regulations applicable to our operations is uncertain and will be ultimately determined by several factors, including future changes to legal and regulatory requirements. Management believes that continued compliance with existing laws and regulations applicable to our operations and future compliance therewith will not have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance therewith, could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated.
The following sections describe some specific laws and regulations that may affect us.  We cannot predict the cost or impact of these or other future legislative or regulatory initiatives.
Regulation of Oil and Gas Exploration and Production
Our operations are subject to various types of regulation at the federal, state and local levels.  Such regulation includes requiring permits for drilling wells; maintaining bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells and regulating the location of wells; the method of drilling and casing wells; the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled; the plugging and abandoning of wells; and the composition or disposal of chemicals and fluids used in connection with operations.  Our operations are also subject to various environmental and conservation laws and regulations.  These include regulation of the size of drilling, spacing or proration units and the density of wells that may be drilled in those units, and the unitization or pooling of oil and gas properties.  In addition, federal and state environmental and conservation laws, which establish maximum rates of production from oil and gas wells, generally prohibit or restrict the venting or flaring of natural gas and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability of production.  The effect of these laws and regulations may limit the amount of oil and natural gas we can produce from our wells and may limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill.  Regulatory requirements and compliance relative to the oil and gas industry increase our costs of doing business and, consequently, affect our profitability.
Federal Energy and Climate Change Legislation and Regulation
The Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, among other things, updated federal pipeline safety standards, increased penalties for violations of such standards, gave the Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (the “PHMSA”) authority for new damage prevention and incident notification, and directed the PHMSA to prescribe new minimum safety standards for CO2 pipelines, which safety standards could affect our operations and the costs thereof. While the PHMSA has adopted or proposed to adopt a number of new regulations to implement this act, there has not been a substantial overhaul as to the regulation of CO2 pipelines.
Both federal and state authorities have in recent years proposed new regulations to limit the emission of pollutants, including greenhouse gas emissions, as part of climate change initiatives and the Clean Air Act.  For example, both the EPA 
25


Denbury Inc.

and Bureau of Land Management (“BLM”) have issued regulations for the control of methane emissions from the oil and gas industry. The EPA has promulgated regulations requiring permitting for certain sources of greenhouse gas emissions, and in May 2016, during the Obama Administration, the EPA promulgated final regulations to reduce methane and volatile organic compound emissions from the oil and gas sector. In July 2017, a federal appeals court rejected an attempt by the EPA under the Trump Administration to delay implementation of the rule. In September 2018, the EPA proposed amendments to the rule that were targeted at reducing regulatory requirements and streamlining the rule’s implementation. In September 2019, the EPA also issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to remove the methane specific regulations imposed by the 2016 final rule and to remove certain other emission limitations placed on new or reconstructed transmission and storage facilities. In August 2020, the EPA released final rules that, among other things, eliminated standards for methane emissions and adjusted requirements for fugitive emissions. Those rules went into effect in the last quarter of 2020. Immediate legal challenges ensued, and while the rules were initially stayed in light of the legal challenges, the stay has been dissolved and the rules are currently in effect. The Biden Administration recently directed the EPA to consider additional regulations to establish comprehensive standards of performance and guidelines for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from existing operations in the oil and gas sector. Any resulting regulations adopted by the EPA could possibly be similar to, or even more stringent than, those promulgated by the EPA in 2016. Enforcement of such regulations may impose additional costs related to compliance with these new emission limits, as well as inspections and maintenance of several types of equipment used in our operations. 
Federal, State or Indian Leases
As of December 31, 2020, approximately 25% of our net developed acreage and 12% of our fourth quarter of 2020 production related to oil and natural gas operations performed on federal acreage, including portions of CCA. Our operations on federal, state or Indian oil and gas leases, especially those in the Rocky Mountain region, are subject to numerous restrictions, including nondiscrimination statutes. Such operations must be conducted pursuant to certain on-site security regulations and other permits and authorizations issued by the BLM, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and other federal and state stakeholder agencies. The Biden Administration has, through executive action, recently suspended new leasing and other oil and natural gas approvals on federal lands. In addition, the Department of Interior recently has rescinded the ability to issue permits to drill on existing federal leases. The inability to secure new leases or permits to drill on existing leases could prevent us from expanding our oil and gas operations, in both new locations and in areas currently leased for which permits have not yet been obtained. In addition, any action by the federal government to rescind previously issued permits on the Company’s existing leases could significantly disrupt our existing and future operations.
Environmental Regulations
Our oil and natural gas production, saltwater disposal operations, injection of CO2, and the processing, handling and disposal of materials such as hydrocarbons and naturally occurring radioactive materials (“NORM”) are subject to stringent regulation.  We could incur significant costs, including cleanup costs resulting from a release of product, third-party claims for property damage and personal injuries, or penalties and other sanctions as a result of any violations or liabilities under environmental laws and regulations or other laws and regulations applicable to our operations.  Changes in, or more stringent enforcement of, environmental laws and other laws applicable to our operations could also result in delays or additional operating costs and capital expenditures.
Various federal, state and local laws and regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment, or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment and human health, directly impact our oil and gas exploration, development and production operations.  These include, among others, (1) regulations adopted by the EPA and various state agencies regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes; (2) the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act and analogous state laws that regulate the removal or remediation of previously disposed wastes (including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators), property contamination (including groundwater contamination), and remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination; (3) the Clean Air Act and comparable state and local requirements already applicable to our operations and new restrictions on air emissions from our operations, including greenhouse gas emissions and those that could discourage the production of fossil fuels that, when used, ultimately release CO2; (4) the Clean Water Act and comparable state and local requirements already applicable to our operations and new restrictions on wastewater discharges from our operations; (5) the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of, and response to, oil spills into waters of the United States; (6) the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes; (7) the Endangered Species Act and counterpart state legislation, which protects certain species (and their 
Denbury Inc.

related habitats), including certain species that could be present on our leases, as threatened or endangered; and (8) state regulations and statutes governing the handling, treatment, storage and disposal of NORM and other wastes.
In the Rocky Mountain region, federal agencies’ actions based upon their environmental review responsibilities under the National Environmental Policy Act can significantly impact the scope and timing of hydrocarbon development by slowing the timing of individual applications for permits to drill and requests for rights-of-way and delaying large scale planning associated with region-level resource management plans and project-level master development plans. The Biden Administration has signaled an intent to bolster agency review pursuant to the National Environmental Policy Act, including the potential of requiring climate change assessments for proposed projects.
Management believes that we are currently in substantial compliance with existing applicable environmental laws and regulations, and does not currently anticipate that future compliance will have a materially adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows, although such laws and regulations, and compliance therewith, could cause significant delays or otherwise impede operations, which may, among other things, cause our expected production rates and cash flows to be less than anticipated.
Hydraulic Fracturing
During 2020, we fracture stimulated three wells, at Bell Creek Field, consisting primarily of small skin fractures that are utilized to remove contaminants caused by drilling muds and increase permeability near the wellbore, utilizing water-based fluids. We currently have plans to potentially hydraulically fracture up to five wells of a similar nature during 2021. We are familiar with the laws and regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing operations and take steps to ensure compliance with these requirements.
