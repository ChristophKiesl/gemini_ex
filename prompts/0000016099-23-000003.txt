Item 1. Business
All references to the "Trust" refer to LUB Liquidating Trust and its consolidated subsidiaries and all references to "Luby's" refer to Luby’s, Inc., and the consolidated subsidiaries of Luby’s, Inc. References to “Luby’s Cafeteria” refer specifically to the Luby’s Cafeteria brand restaurants. With respect to the period prior to May 31, 2022, references to the "Company, "we", "our", or "us" refer to Luby's and with respect to the periods after May 31, 2022, refer to the Trust.
Substantially all of Luby's business was conducted through its wholly-owned subsidiary RFL, LLC (formerly known as Luby's Fuddruckers Restaurants, LLC), a Texas Limited Liability Company ("RFL"). RFL is now a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Trust and substantially all of the Trust's business is conducted through RFL.
Dissolution and Termination of the Company
On May 31, 2022, Luby's, the Trustees identified below and Delaware Trust Company (the “Resident Trustee”) entered into a Liquidating Trust Agreement (the “Liquidating Trust Agreement”) in connection with the formation of the Trust, for the benefit of the Luby's stockholders, to facilitate the dissolution and termination of Luby's in accordance with the Plan of Liquidation and Dissolution of the Company (the "Plan of Liquidation" or the “Plan”) that was previously approved by Luby's stockholders on November 17, 2020. The trustees of the Trust consist of John Garilli, Gerald Bodzy and Joe C. McKinney (collectively, the “Trustees”), and the Resident Trustee.
At 5:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time on May 31, 2022 ("the Effective Time"), Luby's transferred its remaining assets (including its member interest in Luby's Fuddruckers Restaurants, LLC, which has been renamed RFL, LLC) and liabilities to the Trust pursuant to the Plan of Liquidation. The last day of trading for Luby's common stock, par value $0.32 per share, on the New York Stock Exchange was May 27, 2022.
At the Effective Time of the transfer, holders of Luby's common stock automatically received one unit in the Trust ("Unit") for each share of Luby's common stock held by such holder. Units in the Trust are not and will not be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, or any other exchange, and are generally not transferable except by will, intestate succession or operation of law. Pursuant to the Liquidating Trust Agreement, on and after May 31, 2022, all Luby's outstanding shares were automatically deemed to be cancelled. In anticipation of the transfer, the 500,000 shares of common stock Luby's held as Treasury Shares were cancelled.
The Company filed a Certificate of Dissolution with the Delaware Secretary of State, effective May 31, 2022.
The Trust will terminate upon the earlier of three years from the date of creation or the final distribution from the Trust of all Trust assets in compliance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, unless the Trustees determine that a longer period is needed to sell real estate or collect payment in full of any installment obligations owed by a purchaser of assets of the Company or the Trust and to make any final distribution of any such proceeds.
The Trust is headquartered in Boston, Massachusetts, with its corporate headquarters located at Two Liberty Square, 9th Floor, Boston, MA 02109, telephone number (617) 570-4600.
