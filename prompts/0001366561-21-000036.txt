Item 1. Business
Overview
We are the enterprise platform for dynamic work, enabling teams and organizations of all sizes to plan, capture, manage, automate, and report on work at scale, resulting in more efficient processes and better business outcomes. The nature of work has changed and the majority of work is unstructured or dynamic. The growing volume and variety of information has complicated the process for executing work across teams that are increasingly multidisciplinary and geographically distributed. Unstructured or dynamic work is work that has historically been managed using a combination of email, spreadsheets, whiteboards, phone calls, and in-person meetings to communicate with team members and complete projects and processes. It is frequently changing, often ad-hoc, and highly reactive to new information. Rigid applications, such as ticketing, enterprise resource planning, or customer relationship management systems are poorly suited to manage unstructured work. For nearly 30 years, organizations have primarily relied on lightweight tools to manage dynamic or unstructured work. Reliance on these tools limits visibility and accountability, creates information silos that slow decision-making, and results in delays, errors, and suboptimal outcomes.
Business users need technology solutions they can configure and modify on their own. Today, many systems within an enterprise require IT to implement and manage them. Most tools that focus on the business user require some coding knowledge to incorporate business logic for workflows, integrate data from third-party systems, and adapt to changing business needs.
Smartsheet was founded in 2005 with a vision to build a universal application for work execution that does not require coding capabilities. Our platform serves as a single source of truth across work projects, processes, and initiatives and fosters accountability and engagement within teams, leading to more efficient decision-making and better business outcomes. Our platform provides a number of solutions that eliminate the obstacles to capturing information, including a familiar and intuitive spreadsheet interface as well as easily customizable forms. Our reporting and automation capabilities further increase speed by reducing time spent on administration and repetitive work. We make it easy for teams to apply business logic to automate repetitive actions using an extensive list of conditions. Business users, with little or no training, can configure and modify our platform to customize workflows to suit their needs. Our familiar and intuitive user interface and functionality allow users to realize the benefits of our platform without changing the behaviors developed using everyday productivity tools.
People across organizations have similar needs no matter where they work or what they do. They need to manage workflows across teams, gain visibility into progress on company-wide projects and initiatives in real-time, capture inputs, track and report on deliverables, prioritize actions, and provide consistency in processes. Smartsheet is adaptable to manage virtually any type of work. Our customers use Smartsheet for thousands of documented use cases, including software migration planning, vendor and contract management, brand launches, compliance reporting, event planning, customer onboarding, budget approvals, patent application processing, talent acquisition, benefit and retirement tracking, sales enablement, pipeline management, sales operations, commissions calculations, marketing programs management, investor relations tracking, and website management, among others.
Our customers include over 90 companies in the Fortune 100, and over 80% of the companies in the Fortune 500. As of January 31, 2021, our Fortune 100 and Fortune 500 customers had annualized contract values (“ACVs”) ranging from less than $200 to over $2.5 million, and approximately one fourth of our Fortune 500 customers had ACVs lower than $5,000 per year. Our customers typically begin using our platform for a single initiative or project. Over time, as users realize the benefits of improved execution, adoption of our platform expands across an organization through new use cases and teams.

We deliver our cloud-based software platform through a subscription model. We have a digital sales model for self-service adoption through our website. We employ an efficient inside sales team that utilizes machine learning and lead scoring to respond to and convert other interested users within new and existing organizations. We also have a targeted field sales team dedicated to expanding our presence within existing enterprise relationships where we have identified significant opportunity for growth, and have developed partner relationships to support new customers, use cases and markets. This blended go-to-market model allows us to serve a larger, diverse user base without incurring excessive costs. The breadth of solutions we offer reflects the flexibility our users desire to purchase and use our platform in a way that most closely aligns with their needs and level of adoption.
Our Platform
Our platform is purpose-built to improve work execution for organizations and teams. We provide our customers with a robust set of capabilities to plan, capture, manage, automate, and report on work. Our platform enhances visibility and accountability in work execution and eliminates behaviors and processes that hinder productivity. We designed our platform to be accessible and valuable to all knowledge workers. Business users with no coding ability can share their work in Smartsheet across internal and external teams, and create and modify workflows to address specific use cases with our platform. Smartsheet offers multiple ways for customers to plan and manage their work using grids, projects, cards, and calendars; users can easily toggle between views to support their team’s preferred way of working.
We also offer capabilities and functionality to enable teams to accelerate execution while maintaining the flexibility to apply our platform to thousands of documented use cases. Our premium capabilities include Control Center, Dynamic View, and Bridge to enable customers to execute work at scale with consistency and security. These capabilities are monetized based on the value they create for customers, not on a per seat basis. We also offer Accelerators, which are pre-packaged configurations designed as best-in-class solutions to support specific use cases. Through our 10,000ft offering, we provide real-time resource management, capacity planning, and reporting solutions.
In addition to our platform, through our acquisition of Brandfolder, Inc. (“Brandfolder”), we offer a solution for digital asset management. The combination of Brandfolder and Smartsheet allows our customers to create dynamic solutions to manage workflows around content and collaboration.
Benefits of our Platform
Automation across the organization saves time and minimizes manual processing
We enable users to organize their unstructured work and apply business logic to automate actions that shorten work execution timelines without the need to write code. Business logic is used to determine the conditions under which the following types of automated actions occur: update requests, intake and collection of information, sending of information, notifications, approval requests, and automated actions across systems. These elements of automation reduce errors and time spent by teams on administration.
Real-time visibility drives more informed, faster decision-making
Our platform is designed to provide a single source of truth for all stakeholders. We break down information silos across teams and provide real-time visibility into the status of work and the actions required by each stakeholder. This visibility ensures clear ownership of actions and outcomes. Teams feel empowered to take action, leading to stronger engagement and faster time to completion. Line of business managers benefit from visibility into progress against goals, allowing them to react quickly to real-time information and enabling faster and more informed decision-making.
Produce better content faster with Content Collaboration
We enable marketing, creative, and other functional teams to easily collaborate on content development through our image, document, and video proofing capabilities. Teams can easily share content, gather feedback, update versions, and approve content using our platform, resulting in faster development times and higher quality output.
Table of Contents

Ease of use enables broad adoption
Our platform is designed for broad adoption within and across organizations for virtually any use case. Users can begin using Smartsheet within minutes and configure our platform for their needs with limited or no training. As of January 31, 2021, we had over 1.2 million paying users and over 6.8 million additional free users which we refer to as collaborators. Collaborators inside or outside a user’s organization are invited to work on our platform by a paid user, and can use our platform with limited functionality. Our strategy is designed to monetize those seeking to enjoy the complete functionality of our platform or to enjoy tailored experiences while promoting greater usage within and across organizations. Teams and organizations buy into our platform because the productivity benefits derived through visibility and accountability are provided to all stakeholders. All team members can access the latest project information from a single location and can be held accountable without manual effort.
Multiple levels of integration to garner the most benefit from Smartsheet and other systems
We enable business users to engage with our platform through systems they currently use. Through connectors either built by Smartsheet or developed in collaboration with our partners, we extend the reach and consistency of data from other systems, such as those offered by Salesforce, Adobe, UiPath, Workday, DocuSign, Atlassian, ServiceNow, and Microsoft. These data connections combined with Smartsheet platform capabilities enable users to apply business logic and automate workflows, increasing the value of these existing applications to our users. We also integrate our platform into popular document and communication applications from Google, Microsoft, and others. Such functionality enables our users to incorporate documents directly into our platform or access our platform through the application of their choice. In addition, we offer extensible application programming interfaces (“APIs”) that enable a broad ecosystem of partners and customers to integrate directly into our platform, increasing the value of existing custom-built applications and improving the experience for our users.
Enterprise features and functionality for scalable adoption within businesses
Companies rely on Smartsheet to manage a diverse set of business processes. We provide the scalability, compliance, and security needed to operate reliably for our customers. Our platform provides consistent program execution, enabling teams and organizations to administer programs with management, visibility, and reporting at scale. Customers can use our professional services offerings to create and administer programs for specific use cases. We also provide user management and compliance features that enable organizations to control user access and audit activity within our platform. We provide enterprise-grade security controls and data governance to enable customer compliance with applicable privacy regulations.
Our Growth Strategies
Our goal is to make our platform accessible for every organization, team, and worker relying on collaborative work to achieve successful outcomes. We plan to pursue this goal with the following strategies.
Attract more customers to Smartsheet
We believe the need for a work execution platform such as ours is broad, and we believe there is significant opportunity to grow our paid user base. We will continue to invest in our digital sales model, direct sales force, brand, product, and partner marketing to continue to land new customers and increase enterprise adoption. In addition, we will continue to grow our professional services function, and develop new and enhanced premium solutions like our Connectors, Control Center, and Accelerators to help land larger accounts and increase the scale of our deployments with customers.
Expand into Government
Table of Contents

In August 2019, we announced that Smartsheet Gov achieved Provisional Authority to Operate (“P-ATO”) under the Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (“FedRAMP”). This means the Smartsheet platform has been fully approved for use by federal agencies and government contractors, giving them the ability to plan, capture, manage, automate, and report on work at scale. Additionally, Smartsheet can now be found on the AWS Gov Cloud Marketplace. This marketplace lists FedRAMP authorized offerings to help agencies research and select secure and compliant cloud providers available for federal use. In September 2020, Smartsheet Gov obtained the U.S. Department of Defense (“DoD”) Impact Level 4 (“IL4”) P-ATO per the Security Requirements Guide (“SRG”) for cloud computing by the Defense Information Systems Agency (“DISA”). This means that customers within the DoD can also use the Smartsheet Gov platform.
Expand within our existing customer base
Our customers frequently increase their use of our platform as they realize the value they derive from adopting Smartsheet. As a result, we are working with customers to help them define new use cases within existing deployments, and expand usage of Smartsheet to additional teams in their organizations that would benefit from our platform. There are more than 6.8 million existing collaborators that we are focused on converting to paid users. In addition to broader deployments, we enable our customers to further derive value from Smartsheet through premium solutions such as our Connectors, Control Center, Dynamic View, and Bridge. Our professional services, customer success, and training teams provide our customers with implementation, training, and support services to help them expand their use of, and realize the full benefit of, Smartsheet.
Expand internationally
For the year ended January 31, 2021, we derived approximately 19% of our revenue from customers outside the United States. We believe that there is significant opportunity to acquire new customers internationally and accelerate expansion with our existing international customers. Our platform is available in eight languages. By expanding our direct and indirect sales force focused outside of the United States, establishing international sales territories, and partnering with strategic resellers, we plan to continue to grow our international sales. In October 2018, we opened our first international sales office in the U.K. focused on growing our presence within Western Europe. In September 2019, we established an additional international office in Australia focused on expanding our position in the Australian market and the Asia Pacific region.
Expand product features and functionality
We intend to continually increase the value we provide to our customers by investing in extending the capabilities of our platform. We have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in research and development to bolster our existing technology and enhance usability to improve our customers’ productivity. 
Make additional investments in partnerships and integrations
To help drive adoption of Smartsheet and deliver value to our customers, we offer extensive embedded functionality at no cost to complement and enhance the use of the most common productivity tools from providers such as Microsoft, Google, Slack, Box, DocuSign and Dropbox. We offer powerful out-of-the-box Connectors with Salesforce, Adobe Creative Cloud, Atlassian, ServiceNow, and Microsoft that we sell for an additional fee on top of our user-based pricing. We intend to continue to invest in these integrations, develop new partnerships, and enhance our architecture to support a wider range of Connectors with leading enterprise applications to increase the value, awareness, and adoption of our platform.
Pursue selective strategic acquisitions
We plan to pursue strategic acquisitions that we believe will be complementary to our existing offering, enhance our technology, and increase the value proposition we deliver to our customers. Our acquisitions of Denver-based Brandfolder and Seattle-based Artefact Product Group, LLC (“10,000ft”) are examples of acquisitions that were complementary to our existing product capabilities. Through our acquisition of Brandfolder, we now offer a solution for digital asset management that allows our customers to create dynamic solutions to manage workflows around content and collaboration. 10,000ft accelerated our time to market for a resource planning software solution.

Our native mobile applications are built for both iOS and Android, and are designed to provide similar functionality to our desktop version, while also supporting mobile-first customer use cases.
Enterprise-grade security
Our customers frequently use our platform to store and manage highly-sensitive or proprietary information. Our approach to security includes a comprehensive information security program, governing the processing and security of customer information, and the appropriate physical, organizational, and technical controls designed to ensure the security of customer information collected, accessed, stored, or transmitted to or by Smartsheet. To ensure our controls remain up-to-date, we use external auditors to verify the adequacy of security measures and controls according to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants SOC2 standards as well as the International Organization for Standardization information security management systems standard 27001. In addition, we use external security experts to conduct penetration testing and application security testing at least annually and make these audit and penetration test reports available to customers.
Scalable and reliable infrastructure
Our scalable architecture and monitoring telemetry are designed to provide a highly reliable and available platform. We maintain this reliability by utilizing large public cloud providers, giving us the ability to scale our infrastructure efficiently and cost-effectively.
Our Products

Dashboards provide real-time visibility into the status of work to align individuals, managers, and executives. Our dashboards provide real-time status of key performance indicators, trends, summary reports, and important deadlines. Teams can customize dashboards to view and interact with live data and metrics most critical to their projects.
Portals
Portals allow business users to create customized landing pages for teams to easily locate and access from any device the entire set of resources available for a project without IT assistance. This ease of configuration and organization of data eliminates time wasted searching for information, allowing teams to focus on work execution rather than administration.

Human Capital
Table of Contents

At Smartsheet, our mission is to empower anyone to drive meaningful change. This starts with our own team. As of January 31, 2021 Smartsheet employed 1,915 people, with 1,741 in the United States and 174 internationally, including wholly owned subsidiaries. Our leadership team is comprised of eight executive officers, 25% of whom are women and 25% of whom are persons of color.
Engaging Our Team 
We believe in a culture of empowerment and know that the tenacity, adaptability, and integrity of our employees is our greatest asset. With a vision to be the dynamic platform to empower everyone everywhere to change the way the world works, we are dedicated to investing in and supporting our employees in their achievements.
We regularly conduct confidential surveys to seek feedback from our employees on a variety of topics, including but not limited to leadership effectiveness and company confidence, competitiveness of our total rewards offerings, career growth opportunities, and work/life fulfillment. The results are shared with employees and reviewed by leadership, who identify areas of progress or opportunity and prioritize actions to drive meaningful improvements. 
Given the unprecedented events of 2020, we closely monitored our employees’ sentiment around the COVID-19 pandemic and Smartsheet’s response. These activities included pulse surveys, weekly status reports, and a task force dedicated to crisis response, management, and the future of work. Our employees’ perseverance and resilience throughout the year was evident in their feedback, where we heard they felt supported during the global pandemic and felt confident in their ability to succeed. 
Growth and Development
To help our team members succeed, we continually emphasize and invest in talent development and training, provide career pathing, and promote internal mobility opportunities. 
Along with an online learning management system that hosts virtual content ranging from compliance training to security protocols to leadership skills, we subscribe to two separate platforms for continuous learning and professional development. In addition, we offer instructor-led training on topics such as leadership and communication. Further, our talent management team has grown this year to better provide employees with the resources they need to achieve their career goals and for Smartsheet to create true and fair opportunities for all. 
Total Rewards
We also invest in our employees by offering competitive compensation packages. Our total rewards programming includes base and variable compensation, new hire and retentive stock awards, and comprehensive benefits. We continually assess the current business environment and labor markets to refine our total rewards packages and ensure equity. 
Our benefit programs are responsive to our geographies with a consistent focus on comprehensive healthcare, well-being, and paid leave for important life events such as welcoming a child. Examples of global benefits include stock awards for all roles, online mental health counseling services, and employer retirement contributions.
We view well-being as a fundamental part of our employees’ lives, and given the COVID-19 pandemic, we emphasized and expanded our offerings to support our employees’ physical and mental health during the last year. We recognized the huge barrier for working caregivers, so we introduced a new benefit to support and partially subsidize child and adult care. Additionally, we hosted a five-month series of virtual well-being workshops designed to support employees through the emotional turmoil of the global pandemic.
Sales and Marketing
Our marketing and sales teams work closely together to provide an easy way for potential users to discover, try, adopt, and expand usage of Smartsheet over time. We include demand generation, customer success, customer support, and professional services under the sales organization to align these efforts to best support our customers.
Table of Contents

Marketing
Our marketing organization is responsible for corporate brand reputation and management, increasing awareness and demand for our platform, and fostering our community of users. We target potential users across a wide variety of departments and functions in organizations of all sizes and industries. We employ brand marketing, content marketing, search marketing, social marketing, digital marketing, influencer marketing, advertising, and other techniques designed to increase brand awareness and traffic to our website, meet prospects throughout the buyer's journey, and encourage new users via engagements, education, and sales interactions to sign up for a 30-day free trial and purchase our subscription services online. We engage frequently with respected industry analyst firms to educate them as to the benefits of our platform and accelerate the maturation of an appropriate market category.
We have also built marketing relationships with a number of technology companies, such as Microsoft and Google, to help promote and grow our user base and footprint. These partners offer access to our platform through links on their websites and expand our marketing reach. Additionally, in October 2020 we hosted our fourth annual global customer conference, Smartsheet ENGAGE, to provide current and prospective users a better understanding of our platform through interactions with peers and training, and to highlight customer successes, use cases and best practices.
Sales
Our sales organization is responsible for driving customer expansion and new customer opportunities. Our sales force is organized into separate teams focused on new customers, small to medium-sized businesses, large enterprises, geographic regions, and industries. Our assisted sales model relies on machine learning and lead scoring to identify users based on their likelihood to purchase our platform. Further, once we identify an opportunity for meaningful expansion within a customer organization, we can assign a customer success manager and an expansion sales representative to that customer. When an organization with more than 10,000 employees reaches a certain level of usage, we typically assign a field sales representative who is focused on growing adoption in these large accounts and expanding usage to a broader set of use cases.
Professional Services
Our professional services team provides our customers with implementation, training, and consulting services to help them realize the full benefits of Smartsheet. Our training programs include a mix of virtual and in-person offerings with different options focused either on helping onboard teams of users quickly or helping individuals achieve certification-level subject matter expertise. Our consulting and solution services teams provide configuration, use case optimization, integration and process automation services.
Customer Support
Our platform is designed to minimize the need for customer support, as users can easily sign up and begin using it without assistance. We provide significant self-help resources including our extensive help portal and our active online community. Additionally, we provide free support channels for users based on their plan type with additional paid support offerings available. These include email and ticket submission for all users at no cost, along with access to phone support and subject matter expert appointments as part of our paid plans. We also sell the allocation of support team member time to accounts for continuity of care through specialized offerings.
Customers
Our scalable collaborative work management platform helps teams and organizations of all sizes get work done fast and efficiently. As of January 31, 2021, we had domain-based customers with ACVs ranging from less than $200 to over $2.5 million. We define a domain-based customer as an organization with at least one paid user account associated with a unique domain name such as @cisco. An ISP customer is typically a small team or an individual that registers for our services with an email address hosted on a widely used domain such as @gmail, @outlook, or @yahoo.
Table of Contents

Our domain-based customers include organizations across virtually all sectors, including aerospace, automotive, biotechnology, consumer, e-commerce, education, finance, government, healthcare, IT services, marketing, media, non-profit, publishing, software, technology, and travel.
Backlog 
The majority of our invoiced customers sign up for subscription terms of one year and are invoiced for the full subscription term upfront. A small subset of customers sign multi-year subscription contracts but receive annual invoicing terms. Another smaller subset of customers with annual contract terms are invoiced on a quarterly or a semi-annual basis. When contract terms exceed invoicing terms, portions of those contracts which at a point in time remain uninvoiced, are not recorded in revenue, deferred revenue, or elsewhere in our consolidated financial statements. Those contracted but uninvoiced amounts are considered by us to be backlog. As of January 31, 2021 and January 31, 2020, we had backlog of approximately $35.1 million and $8.1 million, respectively. As the majority of our contracts are annual and as invoicing terms on the majority of our contracts are also annual, most of our customer contracts have no impact on backlog and therefore we do not utilize backlog as a key management metric internally. 
Research and Development
Our research and development team consists of our engineering, user experience, design, and product management teams. These groups are responsible for the design, development, testing, and delivery of new technologies and features for our platform. Our research and development team is also responsible for continuous availability, scalability, performance, and security of our platform and maintaining the underlying public cloud infrastructure. During the year ended January 31, 2021, we completed our transition from our legacy data center infrastructure to the public cloud. We invest substantial resources in research and development to drive core technology innovation and bring new products to market.
Competition
The market for work execution software is rapidly evolving. We face competition from a number of vendors with a variety of product offerings. Our primary competition remains a combination of manual, email- and spreadsheet-based processes from providers such as Microsoft and Google that users have historically relied on to manage work. Certain of our features compete with current products and services offered by Airtable, Asana, Atlassian, Monday.com, Planview, Workfront, Wrike, and others. Larger software vendors with substantial resources and smaller upstarts building on new technology platforms may also decide to enter our market by building or acquiring products that compete with our platform. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market include:
•ease of deployment and use of applications;
•product features, quality, and functionality;
•ability to automate multi-step processes;
•ability to integrate with other applications and systems;
•enterprise grade security, scalability, compliance, and administration capabilities;
•ability to support mission critical workloads at scale;
•vision for the market and product innovation;
•size of customer base and level of user adoption;
•pricing and total cost of ownership;
•strength of sales and marketing efforts;
Table of Contents

•brand awareness and reputation; and
•customer experience, including support.
We believe we are positioned favorably against our competitors based on our enterprise grade capabilities, focus on business user empowerment, and ability to support mission critical workflows at scale. Our ability to remain competitive will largely depend on our ongoing performance and the quality of our platform.
Intellectual Property
Smartsheet and Brandfolder rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, and trade secrets, as well as contractual provisions and restrictions, to protect intellectual property. As of January 31, 2021, we had thirteen issued and active patents, which expire between 2021 and 2038, as well as six pending patent applications in the United States. Brandfolder also, as of January 31, 2021, had two issued and active patents, which expire in 2038, as well as two pending patent applications in the United States. These patents and patent applications seek to protect proprietary inventions relevant to Smartsheet’s and Brandfolder’s business. While we believe the patents and patent applications in the aggregate are important to Smartsheet’s and Brandfolder’s competitive positions, no single patent or patent application is material as a whole. Smartsheet and Brandfolder intend to pursue additional patent protection to the extent we believe it would be beneficial and cost effective.
As of January 31, 2021, we owned two U.S. and twenty-four international trademark registrations for the mark SMARTSHEET and two U.S. registrations associated with the 10,000ft brand. We also own two pending trademark applications, and several domain names, including www.smartsheet.com. As of January 31, 2021, Brandfolder owned two U.S. trademark registrations for the mark BRANDFOLDER as well as several domain names, including www.brandfolder.com.

Our reports filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) and 15(d) of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), are available, free of charge, on our Investor Relations website at investors.smartsheet.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file such material with, or furnish it to the SEC. The SEC maintains an Internet website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers, including us, that file electronically with the SEC. The public can obtain any documents that we file with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
