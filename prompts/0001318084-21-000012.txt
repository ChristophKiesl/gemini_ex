ITEM 1.     BUSINESS
Unless the context indicates otherwise, all references in this Annual Report on Form 10-K to “Core-Mark,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our” refer to Core-Mark Holding Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries. 
Company Overview 
Core-Mark is one of the largest wholesale distributors to the convenience retail industry in North America, providing sales, marketing, technology, distribution and logistics services to approximately 40,000 customer locations across the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada through 32 distribution centers (excluding two distribution facilities we operate as a third-party logistics provider). Our origins date back to 1888, when Glaser Bros., a family-owned-and-operated candy and tobacco distribution business, was founded in San Francisco, California. 
Our mission is to be the most valued marketer of fresh, food and broad-line supply solutions to the convenience retail industry. Consistent with this mission, our strategic framework is centered around three key initiatives: growing sales and margins faster than the industry, providing industry-leading category management solutions and leveraging our cost structure.
We operate in an industry where, in 2019, total in-store sales at convenience retail locations across both the U.S. and Canada were approximately $293.5 billion. In the U.S., total in-store sales at convenience locations in 2019 were approximately $251.9 billion, an increase of 4.0% over the prior year, based on the National Association of Convenience Stores (“NACS”) State of the Industry (“SOI”) report. Over the ten years from 2010 through the end of 2019, U.S. convenience in-store sales have increased by a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 2.8%. The most recent NACS Convenience Industry Store Count noted that the U.S. had approximately 153,000 convenience store locations as of December 31, 2019. Approximately 100,000, or 65%, of the convenience stores in the U.S. are considered independents with ten or fewer stores. In Canada, we estimate that total in-store sales at convenience locations in 2019 were approximately CAD $55.2 billion generated through approximately 25,000 stores, based on the Convenience Industry Council of Canada 2020 SOI report.
Core-Mark is one of two national distributors to the convenience store industry in the U.S. and is the largest distributor in Canada. Our established national market presence rests primarily with our ability to service customers in every geographic region within the U.S. through 27 distribution centers and to service customers in Canada through our five Canadian distribution centers. We offer a wide array of products, marketing programs and services that leverage our scale to assist our customers in growing their business. Our leading category management strategies including our Vendor Consolidation Initiative (“VCI”), Focused Marketing Initiative (“FMI”) and “Fresh” products and food service programs have a proven track record of helping our customers grow their sales and profits at an accelerated rate. We believe this gives us a strong competitive advantage in the North American convenience retail industry.
Company Highlights
In 2020, our operating results were impacted by the effects of the novel coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”). We experienced a significant shift in our sales mix as a result of changes in consumer buying habits related to the COVID-19 pandemic and, in response, implemented cost savings initiatives which allowed us to achieve the following significant accomplishments:
•Record net sales of $16.96 billion.
•Our net income increased 9.5% to $63.2 million.
•Adjusted EBITDA increased 6.0% to $202.2 million.
Although we are seeing signs of recovery as consumer purchase trends improve, we expect future results to continue to be impacted by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Our growth the past several years has been driven primarily by our business strategies described more fully below. We believe these strategies have positioned us to continue to grow our approximate 7% market share of North American convenience store merchandise sales, and to take advantage of growth opportunities through acquisition and with other retail store formats.
Business Strategy Overview
Our overarching strategic mission is to increase shareholder return by growing faster and more profitably than our industry, being the industry leader in category management solutions and leveraging operating costs to increase profitability. We accomplish these strategic priorities through numerous vehicles designed to differentiate Core-Mark from its competition and bring value to convenience retail formats across our North American distribution area. Some key success drivers in this pursuit are:
Fresh Products and Food Service. There is an increasing trend among consumers to purchase fresh food and food service products from convenience and other retail store formats. To meet this demand, we have modified and upgraded our refrigerated capacity, including investing in chill docks, and tri-temperature (“tri-temp”) trailers, which provide the infrastructure to deliver a significant range of chilled items including milk, produce, fresh and food service items to retail outlets. We have established partnerships with leading national commissaries, strategically-located dairies, fresh kitchens, food service providers and bakeries to further enable us to deliver premium consumer items such as fresh pizza, fried chicken, fresh made sandwiches, wraps, cut-fruit, parfaits, pastries, doughnuts, bread and home meal replacement solutions. We continue to promote our fresh products through the development of unique and comprehensive marketing and equipment programs that assist retailers in showcasing their fresh product offerings. We believe our investments in infrastructure, combined with our strategically located suppliers and in-house expertise, positions us as a leader in providing fresh food and food service products and programs to the convenience retail industry. Fresh items are increasingly driving consumer decisions and will continue to be an important category.
Vendor Consolidation Initiative. We expect our VCI program will allow us to continue to grow our sales by capitalizing on the highly fragmented supply chain that services the convenience retail industry. A convenience retailer generally receives store merchandise through a large number of direct-store deliveries. This represents a highly inefficient and costly process for retailers. Our VCI program targets inefficiencies in the convenience store supply chain by offering the retailer the ability to receive multiple weekly deliveries for their products, including dairy and other merchandise they previously purchased from multiple direct-store delivery companies. This simplifies the customer supply chain and provides retailers with an opportunity to improve inventory turns and working capital, reduce operational and transaction costs, and greatly diminish their out-of-stocks.
Focused Marketing Initiative. Designed to enhance our relationship with our independent customer base and to further differentiate us in the market place, our FMI program is centered on increasing the sales and profitability of the independent store through improved category insights, optimized retail price strategy and demographic decision-making, along with providing Core-Mark’s marketing solutions to create a comprehensive retail marketing strategy. We believe our innovative approach, which focuses on building a trusted partnership with our customers, has established us as the market leader in providing valuable marketing and supply chain solutions to the convenience retail industry.
Center of Excellence (“COE”). During the first quarter of 2020, we opened the COE at our Westlake, Texas campus. The COE is a dynamic collaboration space for leaders in the convenience retail channel designed to inspire, educate and challenge visitors to think big in growing their sales and profits. Within the 14,000 sq. ft. space, we have created an environment that combines forward-looking consumer trends with real time data, which will allow us to align with our customers and define the future of convenience. The COE is physically designed with five unique hubs – Insights and Data Center, Collaboration Hub, Store Innovation, Culinary Test Kitchen and People Training Facility – to deliver an immersive experience for convenience retailers and strategic vendors.
Technology & Digital Solutions. We are committed to providing tangible value to our retail partners, and in doing so will create a level of differentiation from our competition. We have recently formed exclusive strategic partnerships that will bring operational and business-to-consumer technology solutions to our retailers, that will help them grow their sales, increase market share, meet consumer expectations and more effectively manage their business. These solutions include a two-tiered loyalty platform, enabling retailers to better connect and engage with their consumers to drive behavior in a meaningful way. Additionally, we offer scan data aggregation software and back-office solutions that will help retailers better manage their business and also capitalize on consumer packaged goods strategies for their benefit. And lastly, we can provide a frictionless checkout and payment solution, designed to enhance the experience of the consumers, while, over time, reducing demands on labor. As technologies advance, we are committed to providing relevant and compelling solutions, in our pursuit to be the leader in category management.
Acquisitions and Expansion. We believe there remains a significant opportunity to increase our market presence and revenue growth through strategic and opportunistic acquisitions and the continued expansion of our facility infrastructure. We completed five acquisitions and added four primary distribution centers between 2011 and 2020, which expanded our distribution network, product selection and customer base. We will continue to be opportunistic in pursuing acquisitions that 
allow further leveraging of our geographic footprint and bring Fresh Products, Food Service and our other category management solutions to a broader customer base.
Business Transformation. As a contributor to cost leverage, we have embarked on a multiyear transformation and efficiency process. Starting with the implementation of SAP in 2016, we sought to bring a technology solution that would help build a more efficient infrastructure for our finance organization. Leveraging this tool, we have consolidated numerous transactional activities such as accounts payable and payment processing along with enhancing value in our overall accounting function. In addition to our finance transformation, we have completed a significant sales transformation focused on driving growth and compensation alignment. From the operations and transportation front, we continue to add technologies, such as Omni-Trac One, pick-to-voice, and robotic tote sortation and stacking, and continue to look for other leverage and efficiency opportunities to provide further cost leverage.
Competitive Strengths 
We believe we have the following fundamental competitive strengths, which form the foundation for our business strategy:
Innovation and Flexibility. Wholesale distributors typically provide convenience retailers access to a broad product line, the ability to place small quantity orders, inventory management and access to trade credit. Our capability to increase sales and profitability with existing and new customers is based on our ability to deliver consistently high levels of service, innovative category management and marketing programs, technology solutions and logistics support. We believe we are the best in class at capitalizing on emerging trends and bringing retailers our unique category management solutions such as fresh foods, food service solutions and healthier options, as well as our VCI and FMI initiatives.
Distribution Capabilities. The wholesale distribution industry is highly fragmented and historically has consisted of a large number of small, privately-owned businesses and a small number of large, full-service wholesale distributors serving multiple geographic regions. Relative to smaller competitors, large national distributors such as Core-Mark benefit from several competitive advantages including: increased purchasing power, the ability to service large national chain accounts, economies of scale in sales and operations, and the resources to invest in information technology and other productivity-enhancing technologies. Our wholesale distributing capabilities provide valuable services to both manufacturers of consumer products and convenience retailers. Manufacturers benefit from our broad retail coverage, inventory management, efficiency in processing small orders and frequency of deliveries. Convenience retailers benefit from our distribution capabilities by gaining access to a broad product line, availability of multi-time per week delivery through the elimination of unnecessary vendors and speed of delivery, and optimizing inventory management.
Customers 
We service approximately 40,000 customer locations in all 50 states in the U.S., five Canadian provinces and two Canadian territories. Our traditional convenience store customers include many of the national and super-regional convenience store operators, as well as independently owned convenience stores. Our alternative outlet customers comprise a variety of store formats, including grocery stores, drug stores, mass merchants, liquor stores, cigarette and tobacco shops, hotel gift shops, military exchanges, college and corporate campuses, casinos, airport concessions and other specialty and small format stores that carry convenience products.
Our top ten customers accounted for approximately 41% of our net sales in 2020 including Murphy U.S.A., our largest customer, which accounted for 13.9% of our total net sales.
Products 
We purchase a variety of brand name and private label products, representing approximately 61,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”), from suppliers and manufacturers. Cigarette products represent less than 4% of our total SKUs purchased. We offer customers a variety of food/non-food products, including, candy, snacks, groceries, food, fresh products, dairy, bread, beverages, other tobacco products, alternative nicotine products, general merchandise, and health and beauty care products.

Cigarette Products. We purchase cigarette products from major U.S. and Canadian manufacturers. We have no long-term cigarette purchase agreements and buy substantially all of our products on an as-needed basis. Cigarette manufacturers historically offer structured incentive programs to wholesalers based on maintaining market share and executing promotional programs. Net sales of the cigarettes category increased 3.8% in 2020 to $11,310.5 million, accounting for approximately 66.7% of our total net sales and 25.2% of our total gross profit. We control major purchases of cigarettes centrally to optimize inventory levels and purchasing opportunities.
In 2020, our cigarette carton sales in the U.S. and Canada increased 0.2% and 0.7%, respectively. The increase in carton sales in the U.S. was driven primarily by an increase in sales to existing customers, partially offset by a net decrease in the number of stores serviced during the year. Cigarette carton sales to existing customers during 2020 outperformed the historical industry rate of decline arising primarily from changes in consumer buying behavior as a result of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic.
In the industry overall, U.S. and Canadian cigarette consumption has steadily declined over the last decade. Based on data compiled from the U.S. Department of Agriculture - Economic Research Service and provided by the Tobacco Merchants Association (“TMA”), total cigarette consumption in the U.S. declined from 309 billion cigarettes in 2010 to 229 billion cigarettes in 2019, or a compounded annual decline of approximately 3.0%. Total cigarette consumption declined in Canada from 32 billion cigarettes in 2010 to 25 billion cigarettes in 2019, or a compounded annual decline of approximately 2.4% based on statistics provided by the TMA. Although it is difficult to predict future cigarette consumption trends given the current COVID-19 pandemic environment, longer term we expect overall cigarette consumption to return to historical levels of decline. We expect cigarette manufacturers will continue to raise prices for the foreseeable future as carton sales decline in order to maintain or enhance their overall profitability.
Excise taxes are levied on cigarettes and other tobacco products by the U.S. and Canadian federal governments and are also imposed by various states, localities and provinces. We collect state, local, and provincial excise taxes from our customers and remit these amounts to the appropriate authorities based on the credit terms, if applicable, extended by each jurisdiction. Net sales and cost of sales includes amounts related to state, local and provincial excise taxes which were $3.3 billion, $3.3 billion and $3.5 billion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Food/Non-food Products. Our food products include food, candy, snacks, groceries, beverages and fresh products such as sandwiches, juices, salads, produce, dairy and bread. Our non-food products include cigars, tobacco, alternative nicotine products, health and beauty care products, general merchandise and equipment. In 2020, we experienced a significant shift in our sales mix as a result of changes in consumer buying habits related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Net sales of the combined food/non-food product categories declined 2.3% in 2020 to $5,647.4 million, which was 33.3% of our total net sales. While the changes in consumer buying habits impacted most of our food/non-food products, the largest sales declines were in the food, HB&G and candy categories, partially offset by growth in OTP sales. In addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer buying habits, our HB&G category was also impacted by a decline in sales of alternative nicotine products due to the enactment of regulations governing the sale of flavored products. Combined sales of our Food and Fresh categories decreased $164.1 million, or 7.3%, to $2,085.1 million and the HB&G category decreased $45.9 million or 5.4% in 2020. Total sales of OTP increased $119.7 million, or 8.3%.
Our strategy is to continue to grow sales of food/non-food products through our category management solutions including Fresh and Food Service, VCI and FMI. In order to take advantage of the significantly higher margins earned by food/non-food products, two of our key business strategies, Fresh and VCI, focus primarily on the highest margin categories in the food/non-food group. Gross profit for food/non-food categories declined $47.1 million, or 6.6%, to $664.7 million in 2020, which was 74.8% of our total gross profit. The decline in food/non-food gross profit in 2020 was driven primarily by the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift in sales mix away from higher margin product categories such as food and HB&G.
Suppliers
We purchase products for resale from approximately 2,400 active trade suppliers and manufacturers located across the U.S. and Canada. In 2020, we purchased approximately 81% of our products from our top 20 suppliers, with our top two suppliers, Altria Group, Inc. (the parent company of Philip Morris USA, Inc.) and R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, accounting for approximately 33% and 25% of our purchases, respectively. We coordinate our purchasing from suppliers by negotiating, on a company-wide basis, special arrangements to obtain volume discounts and additional incentives, while also taking advantage of promotional and marketing incentives offered to us as a wholesale distributor. In addition, buyers in each of our distribution facilities purchase products directly from manufacturers, improving product mix and availability for individual markets.
Operations 
As of December 31, 2020, we operated a network of 32 distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada (excluding two distribution facilities we operate as a third-party logistics provider). Twenty-seven of our distribution centers are located in the U.S. and five are located in Canada. 
The map below depicts the scope of our operations and the names of our distribution centers.
We operate five consolidation centers which buy products from our suppliers in bulk quantities and then redistribute the products to many of our other distribution centers. The products purchased by our consolidation centers may include frozen and chilled items, candy, snacks, beverages, health and beauty care and general merchandise products. We operate two additional facilities as a third-party logistics provider dedicated solely to supporting the logistics and management requirements of one of our major customers, Alimentation Couche-Tard, Inc. (“Couche-Tard”). These distribution facilities are located near Phoenix, Arizona and San Antonio, Texas. 
Our proprietary Distribution Center Management System platform provides our distribution centers with the flexibility to adapt rapidly to changing business needs and allows them to provide our customers with necessary information technology requirements and integration capabilities.
Distribution 
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 2,100 personnel in our transportation department, including delivery drivers, shuttle drivers, routers, training supervisors and managers, all of whom focus on achieving safe, on-time deliveries. Our daily orders are picked and loaded nightly in route sequence, with the majority reaching their destination within 24 hours. At December 31, 2020, our distribution fleet consisted of approximately 1,600 leased tractors and trailers and approximately 1,100 additional owned tractors and trailers. Our “tri-temp” trailer fleet gives us the capability to deliver frozen, chilled and non-refrigerated goods in one delivery and provides us the multiple temperature zone capability needed to support our focus on delivering fresh products to our customers. Substantially all of our trailers were “tri-temp” as of December 31, 2020.
A portion of our fleet runs on Compressed Natural Gas (“CNG”), which allows us to reduce our carbon footprint and lower our transportation costs. We utilize seven CNG stations, two of which we own (located in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania and Corona, California). The other five are owned and operated by U.S. Oil (a division of U.S. Venture, Inc.) under the name GAIN Clean Fuel (“GAIN”) and are located in Aurora, Colorado; Forrest City, Arkansas; Sanford, North Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia; and Tampa, Florida. In addition to providing fuel to our fleet, the GAIN stations are also open to other public fleets for fueling.
Competition 
Competition within the industry is based primarily on the range and quality of the services provided, price, product selection and the reliability of wholesalers’ logistics as well as proximity to the customer’s stores. We operate from a perspective that focuses heavily on flexibility and providing outstanding customer service, order fulfillment rates, on-time delivery, innovative marketing solutions and merchandising support as well as competitive pricing.
Core-Mark is one of the two largest wholesale convenience distributors (measured by annual sales) serving North America. We service both convenience store chain customers and independent operators with ten or fewer stores which comprise approximately 65% of the convenience retail store market. The McLane Company, Inc., a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., our largest competitor, focuses primarily on servicing large regional or national convenience store chains as well as chain customers in other trade channels. There are two other large companies that primarily cover the eastern half of the U.S.: H.T. Hackney Company and Eby-Brown Company, a division of Performance Food Group. In addition, there are many local distributors serving small regional chains and independent convenience retailers. In Canada, in addition to Core-Mark, several companies make-up the competitive landscape. Wallace & Carey, Inc., has national distribution capabilities. Sobeys Inc. is a large national convenience store and grocery wholesaler.
Beyond the traditional wholesale supply channels, we face potential competition from at least three other supply avenues. First, certain consumer product manufacturers such as Anheuser-Busch Companies, Inc., MillerCoors LLC, The Coca-Cola Company, and PepsiCo (including its Frito-Lay, Inc. division) deliver their products directly to convenience retailers. Secondly, club wholesalers such as Costco Wholesale Corporation and Sam’s West, Inc. (“Sam’s Club”) provide a limited selection of products at generally competitive prices; however, they often have limited delivery options and limited services. Finally, some large convenience retail chains self-distribute products due to the geographic density of their stores and their belief that they can economically service such locations.
We face competition from the diversion into certain U.S. and Canadian markets of cigarettes intended for sale outside of these markets, including the sale of cigarettes in non-taxable jurisdictions, inter-state/provincial and international smuggling of cigarettes, the sale of counterfeit cigarettes by third parties, the sale of cigarettes by third parties over the internet and by other means designed to avoid collection of applicable taxes. The competitive environment also continues to face a continued influx of generic products, tobacco, and nicotine alternatives that challenge sales of higher priced cigarettes.
Working Capital Practices 
We sell products on credit terms to our customers that averaged, as measured by days sales outstanding, about nine days for each of 2020, 2019 and 2018. Credit terms may impact pricing and are competitive within our industry. Many of our customers remit payment electronically, which facilitates efficient and timely monitoring of payment risk. Canadian days sales outstanding in receivables tend to be lower as Canadian industry practice is for shorter credit terms than in the U.S.
We maintain our inventory of products based on the level of sales of the particular product and manufacturer replenishment cycles. The number of days a particular item of inventory remains in our distribution centers varies by product and is principally driven by the turnover of that product and economic order quantities. We typically order and carry in 
inventory additional amounts of certain critical products to assure high order fulfillment levels for these items. Periodically, we may carry higher levels of inventory to take advantage of anticipated manufacturer price increases. The number of days of cost of sales in inventory averaged about 18 days, 17 days and 14 days, in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The cigarette category averaged 14 days, 12 days and 7 days, in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The food/non-food categories averaged 27 days, 27 days and 25 days in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
We obtain terms from our vendors and certain taxing jurisdictions based on industry practices, consistent with our credit standing. We take advantage of the full complement of term offerings, which may include enhanced cash discounts for earlier payment or prepayment. Terms for our accounts payable and cigarette and tobacco taxes payable range anywhere from three days prepaid to 120 days credit. Days payable outstanding for both categories, excluding the impact of prepayments, averaged 10 days, 10 days and 11 days, in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
Employees and Human Capital Resources
The following chart provides a breakdown of our employees by function and geographic region (including employees at our third-party logistics facilities) as of December 31, 2020:
TOTAL EMPLOYEES BY BUSINESS FUNCTION

 | U.S. | Canada | | Total
Sales and marketing | 1,020 | | 70 | | 1,090
Warehousing and distribution | 4,987 | | 467 | | 5,454
Management, administration, finance and purchasing | 837 | | 153 | | 990 
Total for all categories | 6,844 | | 690 | | 7,534

Four of our distribution centers, Hayward, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Calgary, have employees who are covered by collective bargaining agreements with local affiliates of The International Brotherhood of Teamsters (Hayward, Las Vegas and Los Angeles) and the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (Calgary). Approximately 400 employees, or 5% of our workforce, are unionized. There have been no disruptions in customer service, strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns as a result of union activities, and we believe we have satisfactory relations with our employees.
We consider our employees to be the foundation for our growth and are critical to our continued success. As such, we believe that the future of Core-Mark depends in large part on our ability to attract, train, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. Helping our Core-Mark family grow and develop to reach their full potential is an integral part of our core values. We are also committed to cultivating and fostering a culture of diversity and inclusion and appreciate that the Company’s ultimate success is linked to its ability to identify and hire talented individuals from all backgrounds and perspectives.
Regulation 
As a distributor of food, nicotine and health-related products in the U.S., we are subject to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and regulations promulgated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). In Canada, similar standards related to food and over-the-counter medications are governed by Health Canada. The products we distribute are also subject to federal, state, provincial and local regulation through such measures as: the licensing of our facilities; enforcement by state, provincial and local health agencies of relevant standards for the products we distribute; and regulation of our trade practices in connection with the sale of our products. Our facilities are inspected periodically by federal, state, provincial and local authorities, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) under the U.S. Department of Labor, which require us to comply with certain health and safety standards to protect our employees.
We are also subject to regulation by the U.S. and Canadian Departments of Transportation, and similar state, provincial and local agencies. Our distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada are subject to a broad spectrum of federal, state, provincial and local environmental protection statutes including those that govern emissions to air, soil and water, and the disposal of hazardous substances.
Our policy is to comply with all regulatory and legal requirements, and management is not aware of any related issues that may have a material effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.
Trademarks 
We have trademarks including the following: Arcadia Bay®, Arcadia Bay Coffee Company®, Cable Car®, Core-Mark®, Core Solutions Group®, EMERALD®, Java Street®, SmartStock®, Pine State Convenience™, Taco Depot® and Farner-Bocken™.
Segment and Geographic Information 
We have two operating segments which aggregate into one reportable segment. We also present certain financial information by operating segment region — the U.S. and Canada. See Note 16 - Segment and Geographic Information to our consolidated financial statements.
Seasonality
We typically generate higher net sales and gross profits during the warm weather months (April through September) than other times of the year. This occurs because the convenience store industry benefits from miles traveled and outdoor activity which accelerates during the summer months.
