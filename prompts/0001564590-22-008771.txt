Overview
 
We are a clinical-stage genetic medicine company pioneering genome editing and gene delivery platforms to address rare and serious diseases from infancy through adulthood. Our genome editing platform, GeneRide™, is a new approach to precise gene insertion harnessing a cell's natural deoxyribonucleic acid, or DNA, repair process potentially leading to durable therapeutic protein expression levels. Our gene delivery platform, sAAVy™, is an adeno-associated virus, or AAV, capsid engineering platform designed to optimize gene delivery for treatments in a broad range of indications and tissues.
 
Our lead product candidate, LB-001, is a single-administration, genome editing therapy developed using our GeneRide technology, currently in Phase 1/2 development for the treatment of methylmalonic acidemia, or MMA, in pediatric patients. MMA is a rare and life-threatening genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 50,000 newborns in the United States that often results in developmental delays and other long-term complications and a high rate of hospitalizations. In April 2021, we granted CANbridge Care Pharma Hong Kong Limited, or CANbridge, an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize LB-001 for the treatment of MMA in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, or Greater China. In February 2022, we announced that the FDA notified us that our Investigational New Drug application, or IND, of LB-001 has been placed on clinical hold.
 
In December 2021, we announced the nomination of a new product candidate, LB-401, based on our GeneRide technology. LB-401 is a genome editing therapy being developed for the treatment of hereditary tyrosinemia type 1, or HT1. HT1 is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by elevated blood levels of the amino acid tyrosine, a building block of most proteins, and affects 1 in 100,000 to 120,000 newborns worldwide.
 
Also based on our GeneRide technology, we completed the first phase of preclinical development of our product candidate, LB-301, for the treatment of Crigler-Najjar syndrome, or CN, a rare pediatric disease affecting approximately 1 in 1,000,000 newborns globally, in collaboration with Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited, or Takeda. In addition, we are developing treatments based on our GeneRide technology for two indications in collaboration with Daiichi Sankyo Company, or Daiichi. We have also demonstrated proof of concept of our GeneRide platform in hemophilia B and alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, or A1ATD, animal disease models, and more recently, in Wilson disease.
 
Based on our sAAVy technology, we are developing gene therapy candidates utilizing, among other things, sL65, the first capsid produced from sAAVy, for the treatment of Fabry and Pompe diseases in collaboration with CANbridge. We also granted CANbridge an option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to certain of our intellectual property rights, including those relating to sL65, to develop and commercialize gene therapy candidates for the treatment of two additional indications.
 
We expect to select future product candidates for diseases addressed by targeting the liver initially, and later by targeting other tissues such as the central nervous system, or CNS, muscle, or other tissues.

Our Pipeline
 
We have built a pipeline to further our mission of delivering the hope of genetic medicine to people impacted by devastating diseases.  Our pipeline is derived from our GeneRide and sAAVy platforms.
Figure 1. Our Pipeline.
 
Strategy
 
Our goal is to establish ourselves as the leading integrated genetic medicine company focused on developing and commercializing genome editing and gene therapy treatments based on our GeneRide and sAAVy platforms. Key elements of our strategy are as follows:

• | Advance our lead product candidate, LB-001, through successful clinical trials and ultimately into commercialization. LB-001 is a single-administration, genome editing therapy developed using our GeneRide technology, currently in Phase 1/2 development for the treatment of MMA in pediatric patients. We chose MMA as our first indication to enter clinical trials due to the high unmet medical need and the absence of therapeutic treatments for this disease. We have retained worldwide development and commercialization rights to LB-001 with the exception of Greater China, for which we granted CANbridge an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize LB-001.

• | Pursue a development strategy to rapidly advance LB-401, our product candidate for HT1, into clinical trials. We are developing LB-401, our genome editing therapy developed using our GeneRide technology, for the treatment of HT1. In preclinical studies presented at the 2021 European Society of Gene and Cell Therapy, or ESGCT, Annual Meeting in October 2021, HT1 models with acute liver damage showed that GeneRide-edited hepatocytes repopulated the entire liver within four weeks post-administration, replacing the diseased hepatocytes with corrected hepatocytes. HT1 mice that received the GeneRide-FAH vector were no longer reliant on the current standard of care for the disease, and demonstrated restored normal body growth, liver function, and undetectable succinyl acetone levels.

CN, Hemophilia B and A1ATD. In addition, our investment in developing sAAVy has yielded an initial set of capsids, including sL65, with enhanced liver tropism, functional transduction, and improved manufacturability, providing us with potentially differentiated delivery of our product candidates. We plan to continue our research to explore additional potential indications leveraging our modular approach, learnings from our lead programs and our strengths in genome editing and gene therapy.

• | Collaborate to realize the full potential of our platforms. We are currently developing treatments based on our GeneRide technology for two indications in collaboration with Daiichi. Based on our sAAVy technology, we are developing gene therapy candidates utilizing, among other things, sL65, for the treatment of Fabry and Pompe diseases in collaboration with CANbridge. In 2021, we completed the first phase of preclinical development of our product candidate, LB-301, for the treatment of CN in collaboration with Takeda. We also intend to seek additional collaborations to accelerate the development of our GeneRide and sAAVy platforms into genome editing and gene therapy products beyond those we plan to develop internally.

• | Leverage our experienced team to maximize the potential of our platforms. Delivering on the promise of our GeneRide and sAAVy technologies requires an exceptional organization. We have assembled a group of leaders and scientific talent in the fields of rare diseases, genome editing, gene therapy and process and analytical development to execute on our plans to develop and commercialize genetic medicines. We plan to apply our research and development expertise to enhance our platforms and expand our intellectual property portfolio.

Genetic Diseases and Their Treatment
 
Genetic diseases are caused by abnormalities in a person’s DNA that are either inherited or acquired early in embryonic development. We are currently focused on a subset of genetic diseases, known as monogenic diseases, which are caused by genetic abnormality in a single gene. There are believed to be over 6,500 monogenic diseases. Monogenic diseases have been of particular interest for biomedical innovators due to the perceived simplicity of their disease pathology; however, the vast majority of these diseases and disorders remain unaddressed. This is beginning to change largely due to innovation in two fields: gene editing and gene therapy. Both fields have experienced certain challenges that we believe we have the potential to address with therapies from our GeneRide and sAAVy platforms.
Overview of Gene Editing 
 
Many gene editing approaches work by disrupting, inserting, or modifying genes in the natural context of the genome. The vast majority of existing gene editing methods rely on a class of enzymes, called nucleases, to make a double-stranded break in the DNA at a targeted location. These enzymes include CRISPR, Zinc Fingers and TAL Nucleases, and, while these approaches have distinct technical features, they make the same type of edit and, therefore, share several similar limitations.
 
First, there is a lack of predictability in genetic outcomes when altering gene sequences with nucleases. The dominant, naturally-occurring DNA repair system that corrects double-stranded breaks within cells is called Non-Homologous End Joining, or NHEJ. This system can patch the broken ends of the chromosomes back together but can simultaneously insert or delete sequences at random near the location where the break occurs. While this NHEJ approach is effective if the desired outcome is to knock out or switch off the whole gene, it does not allow for precise control of the specific genetic outcome at the target site.
 
Second, there are potential toxicities associated with double-stranded breaks, such as cell death response and genomic instability. In addition, if the double-stranded break occurs in the wrong place, the break can also lead to unwanted gene disruptions. Multiple edits, and thus multiple double-stranded breaks, can compound this issue and lead to large-scale genomic translocations and rearrangements, potentially limiting the applicability of nuclease-based approaches in multiplex editing.
 
Third, while gene disruption with nucleases is highly efficient, making specific sequence changes to correct or modify genes remains largely inefficient. To change a gene sequence, gene editing using nucleases may use a DNA repair pathway called Homology Directed Repair, or HDR. HDR is a low-efficiency DNA repair mechanism, typically yielding single digit percentage editing. This mechanism also requires a DNA template containing the desired, corrected gene to drive the gene editing. The template may be an endogenous sequence or, more frequently, is an exogenously delivered DNA template, increasing the complexity of the therapy. More recently, approaches have been developed to insert sequences into certain highly expressed genes, such as the albumin locus in liver cells. These approaches rely on the strength of the selected promoter to overcome the initial low level of integration.

Overview of Gene Therapy
 
Gene therapy involves the use of viral vectors, including AAV, or retroviruses, such as lentiviruses, to deliver new copies of genes, or transgenes, to cells. In the case of traditional AAV gene therapy, it is unknown whether life-long AAV expression has been achieved in several organs. Any lack of persistence can be further exacerbated when treating children, since the transgene becomes diluted as the child grows and cells are rapidly dividing. In addition, preexisting immunity may limit use in some patients altogether and certain immune responses may prevent redosing in the context of lack of persistence.
 
Retroviral vectors, including lentiviral vectors, work by inserting a gene payload into the patient’s chromosome, typically ex vivo, and have demonstrated improved durability compared to AAV therapies. However, these vectors bear the risk of random genomic integration, which creates the potential of disrupting important genes or activating cancer-causing genes.
 
Our GeneRide Technology Platform
 
Our proprietary genome editing platform, GeneRide, is a new approach to gene editing that uses an AAV vector to deliver a gene into the nucleus of the cell and then uses a form of HDR called homologous recombination, or HR, with the goal of stably integrating the corrective gene into the genome of the recipient at a location where it is regulated by an endogenous promoter. We believe this approach will lead to life-long protein production, even as the body grows and changes over time. This gives GeneRide the potential to overcome some of the key limitations of both certain other gene editing and traditional gene therapy approaches to treat genetic diseases, particularly in pediatric patients. We describe our approach as “genome editing” because it uses HR to deliver the corrective gene to one specific location in the genome. 
 
Our GeneRide technology uses a synthetic viral vector to deliver a transgene to the nuclei of the patient’s cells in a precise manner via an infusion. Upon sensing the therapeutic DNA in the nucleus, the cell’s natural DNA repair process is expected to activate and integrate the transgene at a specific site in the patient’s genome. 
 
When our therapeutic transgene is integrated at the targeted locus, it is designed to leverage the strength of this endogenous promoter to drive expression of the transgene, without disrupting the target gene’s production. Shortly after treatment, the modified cells can begin producing therapeutic levels of protein to combat the disease.
 
The illustration below shows how a GeneRide construct inserts a transgene at a specific point next to a highly expressed gene using HR:
 


Figure 2. Schematic of the GeneRide construct before integration (AAV delivery) and following HR-mediated integration into the genome at the targeted highly expressed gene (HEG) locus.

The GeneRide technology consists of three fundamental components, each of which contributes to the potential benefits of the GeneRide approach:
 
 
• | Homology guides comprised of hundreds of nucleotides. Our flanking sequences, known as homology guides or arms, are designed to direct site-specific integration and limit potential off-target insertion of our construct. Each arm is 500-1500 nucleotides long, in contrast to guide sequences used in CRISPR/Cas9, which are only dozens of base pairs long, and we believe this increased length improves both precision and site-specific integration. GeneRide’s homology guides direct the integration of the transgene without the need of exogenous promoters.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Transgene. We choose corrective genes, known as transgenes, to integrate into the host cell’s genome. These transgenes are the functional versions of the disease-associated genes found in a patient’s cells. We optimize the combined size of the transgenes and the homology arms to increase the likelihood that these transgenes will ultimately be delivered appropriately in the patient.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 2A peptide for polycistronic expression. We include a short sequence coding for a 2A peptide, which plays a couple of important roles. First, the 2A peptide facilitates polycistronic expression, which is the production of two distinct proteins from the same mRNA. This, in turn, allows us to integrate our transgene in a non-disruptive way by coupling transcription of our transgene to a highly expressed target gene in the tissue of interest, driven by a strong endogenous promoter. Second, the patient’s targeted gene is produced normally, except for the addition of a C-terminal tag that serves as a circulating biomarker to indicate successful site-specific integration and expression of the transgene. We believe that this modification to the genome will have minimal effect on its function.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Potential advantages of our GeneRide approach include the following:
 
 
• | Targeted integration of transgene into the genome. Conventional gene therapy approaches deliver therapeutic transgenes to target cells. The genes are not expected to integrate into the host cell’s chromosomes and are vulnerable to dilution caused by the natural processes that lead to replication and segregation of DNA during cell division. This is particularly problematic when conventional gene therapies are introduced early in the patient’s life because the rapid growth of tissues during the child’s normal development will result in dilution and eventual loss of the therapeutic benefit associated with the transgene. Non-integrated genes expressed outside the genome on a separate strand of DNA are called episomes. Episomal expression is typically transient in target tissues such as the liver, in which there is high turnover of cells and which tends to grow considerably in size during the course of a pediatric patient’s life. With our GeneRide technology, the transgene is integrated into the genome, which has the potential to provide stable and durable transgene expression as the cells divide and the tissue of the patient grows, and may result in a durable therapeutic benefit.

• | Transgene expression without exogenous promoters. With our GeneRide technology, the transgene is expressed at a location where it is regulated by a potent endogenous promoter. Specifically, we use our long homology guides to insert the transgene at a precise site in the genome that is expressed under the control of a potent endogenous promoter. By not using exogenous promoters and integrating at the very end of a highly expressed gene, we can drive high levels of tissue-specific gene expression, without the possible detrimental issues associated with the use of exogenous promoters in case of off-target integration. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Nuclease-free genome editing. By harnessing the naturally occurring process of HR, GeneRide is designed to avoid undesired side effects associated with exogenous nucleases used in conventional gene editing technologies. The use of these engineered enzymes has been associated with genotoxicity, including chromosomal alterations, resulting from the error-prone DNA repair of double-stranded DNA cuts. Avoiding the use of nucleases also reduces the number of exogenous components needed to be delivered to the cell.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Modularity. We believe our modular approach has the potential to allow GeneRide to deliver robust, tissue-specific gene expression that will be adaptable across different therapeutics targeting the same tissue. The AAV capsid serves as the vehicle that enables delivery of the rest of the components to cells in the body. We and our research partners have done extensive work in developing vectors designed to be highly efficient in delivering their contents to specific target tissues such as the liver. We have also done extensive work developing various designs of homology guides, which direct the integration of the target gene to a precise location in the genome. We believe that our work on AAV capsids and homology guides gives us the potential to select optimal components in order to address different therapeutic indications with our GeneRide technology. We expect this approach will allow us to

leverage common manufacturing processes and analytics across our GeneRide product candidates and could potentially shorten the development process of future programs.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selective advantage. In MMA and other diseases like HT1 and Wilson disease, in our preclinical studies, we discovered a biologic phenomenon we call “selective advantage,” another key feature of the GeneRide technology. Selective advantage enables healthy edited hepatocytes carrying the corrective gene to survive and reproduce better than the endogenous mutated hepatocytes, and to ultimately repopulate a part or whole of the diseased liver. This is supported by our data from animal models where initial integration of the transgene into approximately 0.1 to 1% of cells resulted in therapeutic benefit over time. Use of strong endogenous promoters, such as the albumin promoter, appears to be helpful in overcoming the modest levels of integration to yield potentially therapeutic levels of transgene expression.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
A key step in applying the GeneRide platform is to identify the target genetic locus for integration. This is important because the location will dictate regulation of transgene expression, specifically the levels and tissues where the protein will be produced. 
 
For our liver-directed programs, including LB-001 and LB-401, which are described further below, we have selected the albumin locus as the site of integration. Albumin is only produced at meaningful levels in the liver, where it is the most highly expressed gene. Integration of the transgene downstream of a highly expressed tissue-specific gene, like albumin, is an important design feature of GeneRide. The following graphs show the expression of albumin relative to other genes in the liver, and the expression of albumin in the liver compared to other tissues with the highest expression of albumin.

ALB gene expression across the 15 tissues with the highest ALB gene expression levels


Figure 4. The liver is the organ where nearly all albumin is expressed in the body. Liver-specific GeneRide 
 constructs targeting the ALB locus will predominantly be expressed in the liver.
 
Targeting the albumin locus for liver indications allows us to leverage the strong endogenous promoter that drives the high level of albumin production to maximize the expression of our transgene. We believe that linking the expression of our transgene to albumin will allow the expression of our transgene at therapeutic levels without requiring the addition of exogenous promoters or the integration of our transgene in a majority of target cells.
 
The following tables show the relative expression levels of albumin as compared to select disease-related genes in the liver, including methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, or MUT, the deficient gene in patients with MMA. The naming convention for the gene encoding methylmalonyl-CoA mutase recently changed from MUT to MMUT but we will maintain the previous convention for consistency.
 















Figure 5. Albumin expression levels are at least 100x higher than other select liver genes associated with monogenic diseases. (PAH: phenylketonuria, F9: hemophilia B, MUT: MMA, UGT1A1: Crigler-Najjar syndrome).

We have observed that GeneRide leads to integration of the corrective gene at the albumin locus in preclinical mouse models of disease, non-human primates, or NHPs, and human cells. We expect that our future liver-directed product candidates will also target the albumin locus for integration. This feature should make both on-target and off-target integration a more predictable process across programs. We are exploring the possibility of delivering our therapy to other tissues and target locations in the genome. 
 
LB-001 for the Treatment of Methylmalonic Acidemia
 
Our lead product candidate, LB-001, is a single-administration, genome editing therapy developed using our GeneRide technology, currently in Phase 1/2 development for the treatment of MMA. 
 
Methylmalonic Acidemia
 
MMA is a rare genetic disorder that is caused by mutations in several genes that encode enzymes responsible for the normal metabolism of certain amino acids. The most common mutations are in the gene for MUT, which cause complete or partial deficiencies in its activity. As a result, a substance called methylmalonic acid and other potentially toxic compounds can accumulate, causing the signs and symptoms of MMA. 
 
The effects of MMA usually appear shortly after birth and can be severe and life-threatening, with symptoms including lethargy, vomiting, dehydration, acidosis and elevated ammonia levels and failure to thrive. Without treatment, MMA can lead to coma and death in infancy. Patients with MMA who survive the neonatal period or have later onset of disease are at high-risk of long-term complications including feeding problems, intellectual disability, kidney disease and pancreatitis. 
 
There are currently no approved therapies for the underlying cause of MMA, and the outlook for MMA patients remains poor. The current standard of care for MMA is chronic management of the disease limited mainly to a low-protein, high-calorie diet, lacking amino acids normally processed by the MUT pathway. Despite dietary management and vigilant care, MMA patients, especially those with the most severe deficiencies in MUT, often suffer neurologic and kidney damage exacerbated during periods of catabolic stress when injury, infection or illness trigger the breakdown of protein in the body. Because of the poor outcomes associated with the current standard of care, combined liver-kidney transplantation, or early liver transplantation, has emerged as an intervention aimed at improving metabolic control. However, the finite number of liver donors, significant risks associated with surgery, high procedural costs (in the United States, approximately $880,000 on average for liver transplantation and $1.3 million on average for combined liver and kidney transplantation) and lifetime dependence on immunosuppressive drugs limit the widespread implementation of liver transplantation in patients with MMA.
 
Life expectancy for patients with MMA has increased over the past few decades but is still estimated to be limited to approximately 20 to 30 years. Quality of life for both patients and their families and caregivers is significantly impacted by the disease due to the constraints it places on school life and social functioning. Early intervention in this vulnerable population is essential to combat the manifestation of irreversible clinical disease pathologies.
 
The incidence of MMA in the United States is reported to be 1 in 50,000 births, with a current U.S. prevalence of approximately 1,600 to 2,400 patients. The proportion of MMA patients with the MUT mutation, the genetic deficiency targeted by LB-001, is estimated at approximately 63% of the total MMA population. We estimate the number of MMA patients with the MUT mutations to be 3,400 to 5,100 patients in key global markets, of which 1,000 to 1,500 patients are in the United States. Because of the need for early intervention, newborns are screened for MMA in every state in the United States.
 
LB-001
 
LB-001 is designed to introduce a functional copy of the MUT gene into the genome of MMA patients. LB-001 consists of a DNA construct, which includes a gene encoding the human MUT enzyme encapsulated in an AAV capsid. The MUT enzyme coding sequence is coupled to the 2A peptide sequence and surrounded by homology guides that drive the integration of the MUT gene and the 2A peptide sequence into the chromosomal locus for the albumin gene. Based on the way our construct integrates into the albumin locus, the MUT gene is then expressed resulting in synthesis of MUT enzyme as a separate protein from albumin. We chose LK03, the AAV capsid we use in LB-001, because it has been optimized to target human liver cells and had demonstrated strong liver-targeting in human clinical trials.
 

LB-001 Clinical Development Program
 10



We are evaluating the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of LB-001 in our Phase 1/2 SUNRISE clinical trial in pediatric patients with MMA. The SUNRISE trial is designed to enroll up to eight patients with ages ranging from six months to twelve years and evaluate a single administration of LB-001 at two dose levels (5 x 10 vg/kg and 1 x 10 vg/kg). The primary endpoint of the SUNRISE trial is to assess the safety and tolerability of LB-001 at 52 weeks after a single infusion. Additional endpoints include changes in disease-related biomarkers, including serum methylmalonic acid, clinical outcomes such as growth and healthcare utilization, and the pharmacodynamic marker albumin-2A. Subject to the resolution of the clinical hold, we expect to enroll patients in up to seven centers in the United States and up to one center in Saudi Arabia.
 
In June 2021, we announced that the first patient was dosed in the SUNRISE trial. In accordance with the FDA-reviewed protocol, we initially enrolled patients in the three- to twelve-year-old age group at the lower dose. Mid-October 2021, we announced early results from the SUNRISE trial. The early results showed measurable levels of albumin-2A, the technology-related biomarker indicating site-specific gene insertion and protein expression. Detection of albumin-2A is an indication that we have achieved the first ever in vivo genome editing in children. We also announced in mid-October 2021 that, following an evaluation of the safety data from the first two patients enrolled in the SUNRISE trial, the independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, or DSMB, overseeing the SUNRISE trial recommended continuation of the trial without modification. Albumin-2A detection together with the DSMB continuation recommendation enabled us to begin enrolling two patients in the higher dose cohort (with ages ranging three to twelve years old), and two patients in the younger age group (six months to two years old) at the lower dose. 
 
In late October 2021, the third patient dosed in the SUNRISE trial, who received 5 x 1013 vg/kg of LB-001 and was in younger age group, experienced a drug-related serious adverse event, or SAE. The SAE was noted during a scheduled visit that took place two weeks after dosing. This SAE was categorized as a case of thrombotic microangiopathy, or TMA, which has been previously reported in association with other AAV genetic therapies. We announced in December 2021 that the SAE experienced by the third patient had resolved. We reported the SAE to the DSMB along with a proposed response plan, which was endorsed by the DSMB. The plan included proposed protocol amendments to increase patient monitoring. In accordance with our regulatory obligations, we also reported the SAE to the FDA and the Saudi Arabia Food & Drug Authority. 
 
In January 2022, the fourth patient dosed in the SUNRISE trial, who received 5 x 1013 vg/kg of LB-001 and was in the younger age group, experienced a drug-related SAE, which was categorized as a case of TMA. Following a hospitalization, the patient was discharged and the SAE has now resolved. We reported the SAE to the FDA and the Saudi Arabia Food and Drug Authority in accordance with our regulatory obligations. We also reported the SAE to the DSMB. On February 2, 2022, we announced that the FDA notified us that the IND for LB-001 has been placed on clinical hold. We are working closely with the FDA and the DSMB to determine the next steps for the SUNRISE trial and the LB-001 program. Until we have more clarity regarding the impact of the clinical hold, we have suspended guidance on the timing of announcing interim data for the SUNRISE trial.
 
In addition to the Phase 1/2 SUNRISE trial, we have also completed a retrospective natural history study designed to evaluate disease progression in pediatric patients with MMA. These data helped to provide us with a better understanding of the natural progression of the disease, the impact of a liver transplant on the outcomes of MMA patients and potential endpoints such as the relevance of methylmalonic acid levels on clinical outcomes, with the goal of informing our future clinical development in MMA and our discussions with regulatory agencies as we look toward advancing our MMA program. We presented preliminary findings from our retrospective natural history study at the American College of Medical Genetics in April 2021.
 
In July 2019, the FDA granted rare pediatric disease designation for LB-001 for the treatment of MMA, and in April 2019, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for LB-001 for the treatment of MMA. In November 2020, the FDA granted fast track designation for LB-001 for the treatment of MMA, and in June 2021, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation to LB-001 for the treatment of MMA.
 
LB-001 Preclinical Data
 
Preclinical data for LB-001 was generated in mouse models of MMA. When the MUT gene was rendered completely non-functional (MUT-/-), these mice died within the first few days of life if left untreated. To have a model that is more usable, a second mouse model of MMA, called MCK-MUT, was generated, which was a modification of the MUT -/- mouse in which a functional copy of the mouse MUT gene was placed under the control of the creatine kinase promoter to drive MUT
11


expression in the muscle. This partially rescued the lethal phenotype of MUT-/- mice and allowed mice to survive longer while still exhibiting many of the phenotypic changes seen in MMA patients.
 
In initial studies, where neonatal MCK-MUT mice received single injections of a murine GeneRide construct of LB-001, expression of MUT was observed and the mice showed significant improvements in weight gain compared to untreated MCK-MUT mice. GeneRide-treated MCK-MUT mice also had significant reductions in plasma levels of methylcitrate and methylmalonic acid, disease-relevant toxic metabolites and diagnostic biomarkers that accumulate in patients with MMA.
 
In subsequent studies, a diet management protocol was implemented for the MCK-MUT mice to better mimic the patient experience. Neonatal and adult mice received single injections of a murine GeneRide construct of LB-001. The diet managed mouse model of severe MMA allowed for the demonstration of efficacy with a clear improvement in animal survival, protection from body weight loss, and maintenance of lower circulating methylmalonic acid levels compared to vehicle-treated control animals in response to protein challenge that is designed to mimic metabolic stress. The results showed statistically significant improvements in body weight, and a reduction in plasma levels of methylmalonic acid.
 
The presence of a functional MUT enzyme has been observed in preclinical studies to provide a selective advantage to hepatocytes over those lacking MUT. Over time, this selective advantage leads to an increased proportion of liver cells that contain the functional copy of MUT. This can be observed in an experiment we conducted in mice in which a murine GeneRide construct was introduced into mice with and without a functioning native copy of MUT in the liver. The initial GeneRide integration frequencies in both sets of mice were less than 4%. Over time, the number of modified cells remained the same in mice that naturally express MUT in the liver (MUT+/- in liver). However, after more than one year, and at shorter timepoints, in the mice genetically deficient in liver MUT (MUT-/- in liver), the percent of cells expressing MUT increased to 24%. This selective advantage was also observed as early as 1.5, 3, and 6 months and could be attributed to improvements in mitochondrial function as a result of MUT expression and restoration of the deficient amino acid metabolic pathway. The increase in genome edited hepatocytes also led to an increase in the circulating biomarker albumin-2A over time. 
 
In contrast to conventional AAV gene therapy approaches, in which the percentage of cells containing the therapy decreases over time as cells replicate and lose the virally encoded transgene, in the MMA mouse studies, the percentage of cells containing a MUT GeneRide construct increased over time. These results support our belief that a single administration may provide life-long benefits.
 
LB-401 for the Treatment of Hereditary Tyrosinemia Type 1
 
In December 2021, we announced the nomination of a new development candidate, LB-401, for the treatment of HT1. This development candidate is based on our GeneRide platform. HT1 is a rare, genetic disorder characterized by elevated blood levels of the amino acid tyrosine that affects 1 in 100,000 to 120,000 newborns worldwide. This condition is caused by a shortage of the enzyme fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase, or FAH, one of the enzymes required for the multi-step process that breaks down tyrosine.
 
In preclinical studies we presented at the 2021 ESGCT Annual Meeting in October 2021, the data in HT1 models with acute liver damage showed that GeneRide-edited hepatocytes repopulated the entire liver within four weeks post-administration, replacing the diseased hepatocytes with corrected hepatocytes. HT1 mice that received the GeneRide-FAH vector were no longer reliant on the current standard of care for the disease, and demonstrated restored normal body growth, liver function, and undetectable succinyl acetone levels.
 
Other GeneRide Development Programs 
 
Also based on our GeneRide technology, we completed the first phase of preclinical development of our product candidate, LB-301, for the treatment of CN, a rare pediatric disease affecting approximately 1 in 1,000,000 newborns globally, in collaboration with Takeda. In initial proof-of-concept studies, a murine GeneRide construct of LB-301was used to correct the gene deficiency in an animal model of CN. The introduction of UGT1A1 into the albumin locus in mouse liver cells resulted in normalization of bilirubin levels and long-term survival of mice deficient in UGT1A1 from less than twenty days to at least one year. Our Takeda collaboration to further develop LB-301 in CN, resulted in the extension of our proof-of-concept data and was reported at American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy, or ASGCT, Annual Meeting in May 2020. In these reported studies, neonatal mice treated with a murine GeneRide construct of LB-301 resulted in a survival benefit and a dose-dependent reduction in total circulating bilirubin. The bilirubin levels achieved were within the range of that observed in patients with Gilbert’s syndrome (1-6mg/dL), a mild liver disorder usually requiring no medical treatment. Moreover, through a collaboration with Dr. Andrés Muro at the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology in 
 12


Trieste, Italy, we demonstrated that GeneRide treatment could improve motor discoordination in preclinical mouse models of CN.
 
In addition, we are developing treatments based on our GeneRide technology for two indications in collaboration with Daiichi. We also demonstrated proof of concept of our GeneRide platform in mouse models of hemophilia B, A1ATD, and Wilson disease.
 
sAAVy Platform
 
The Company's gene delivery engine, sAAVy, is an AAV capsid engineering platform designed to optimize gene delivery for treatments in a broad range of indications and tissues. We are developing sAAVy for use in gene editing and gene therapy programs. sAAVy is an evolutionary and iterative capsid development platform structured around three important components:
 
 
• | Novel capsid engineering. We seek to create large libraries of AAV capsids with novel sequences generated by DNA shuffling, followed by selection and screening in a translationally relevant humanized mouse model. We are collaborating with CMRI to create these libraries.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Selection in clinically relevant models. AAV capsids are designed to be highly efficient in delivering their contents to specific target tissues, such as the liver. Natural serotypes and engineered AAV capsids are screened and selected in mice and often show reduced efficacy from mouse to human. Extensive work has been done by our founders to identify capsids better suited for human use in indications that target the liver. Our sAAVy platform uses an innovative way to screen very diverse synthetic capsid libraries and to select the best human cell-tropic capsids using clinically relevant animal models, like chimeric humanized mice and NHPs. This approach has yielded a set of capsids highly efficient at functional transduction of human hepatocytes in a humanized mouse model. For example, see Figure 6 for data from the first capsid from sAAVy, sL65. At the ASGCT 2020 Annual Meeting in May 2020, CMRI presented data showing that novel capsids delivered highly efficient functional transduction of human hepatocytes in a humanized mouse model. Based on these data, we believe the top-tier capsid candidates from this effort demonstrated the potential to achieve significant improvements over benchmark AAVs that are currently in clinical development. We announced data generated from translational animal models using sL65 at the ASGCT 2021 Annual Meeting in May 2021. In addition, in January 2021, we announced the extension of our collaboration with CMRI to continue to develop next-generation capsids for gene therapy and gene editing applications in the liver as well as additional tissues.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Process development. We have also been able to achieve high production yields using LogicBio’s proprietary process compared to published data on AAV yields from various expression systems. For more information, see “Manufacturing.”

sL65 improves functional transduction compared to benchmark capsids, AAV2, AAV8 and LK03











Figure 6. sL65 showed improved transduction and expression (functional transduction right panel) where sL65 demonstrates a 10-fold improvement over AAV8 and a 2-fold improvement over LK03.
 
Based on our sAAVy technology, we are developing gene therapy candidates utilizing, among other things, sL65, for the treatment of Fabry and Pompe diseases in collaboration with CANbridge. We also granted CANbridge an option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to certain of our intellectual property rights, including those relating to sL65, to develop and commercialize gene therapy candidates for the treatment of two additional indications.

Manufacturing
 
Our genome editing and gene therapy product candidates are manufactured as viral vectors. Viral vector manufacturing is a complex process due to several factors, including the following: 

• | the use of complex biological raw materials, including plasmid DNA, and cell banks, that need to comply with stringent regulatory requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the use of complex manufacturing methods, such as transfection of suspension mammalian cell culture in large bioreactors (transfection is the process by which plasmid DNA enters the cells), and purification of intact viral particles;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the need to produce high-concentration, high purity drug product; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the challenges associated with scale-up, batch-to-batch consistency and product characterization, including measurement of potency and quality.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We have built extensive internal non-GMP process development, analytical development and vector development capabilities that are designed to optimize certain components of viral vector manufacturing, including the following:
 
 
• | Improved production yields. One challenge facing gene editing and gene therapy product candidates manufactured as viral vectors is production yield. Improvements in production yields have the potential to make drug product available to more patients in need by decreasing the drug product cost of goods. Initial results from our proprietary manufacturing process have demonstrated significantly improved production yields in comparison to published results (see Figure 7).
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased drug product purity. Another challenge facing gene editing and gene therapy product candidates manufactured as viral vectors is that, over the last several years, the occurrence of undesirable side effects in clinical trials have led the industry stakeholders and regulatory authorities to look for higher levels of purity of drug product for use in humans. The proprietary methods developed by our internal team are designed to increase the purity of drug product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Decreasing “empty” capsids. A challenge facing AAV vector manufacturing in particular is the formation of an excess of what are known as “empty” capsids, which are unable to provide a therapeutic benefit and may contribute to exacerbating adverse effects. Our internal team has developed proprietary and scalable methods designed to decrease the proportion of empty capsids in our drug product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reliable characterization methods. We have invested resources in developing a large panel of methods to enable accurate and consistent characterization of our clinical supply of our lead product, LB-001, that we can leverage for use in our other development programs if and as we optimize the drug product from those programs for use in humans. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any GMP manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for clinical testing and commercial manufacture of any drug we may commercialize. To date, we have obtained the clinical supply of LB-001 for our SUNRISE trial on a purchase order basis and do not have long-term supply arrangements in place. We rely primarily on single-source third-party suppliers to manufacture and supply our drugs and their raw materials and may from time to time explore opportunities to identify and qualify additional manufacturers to provide cell banks, plasmids, drug substance and drug product.

Competition
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the gene editing and gene therapy fields, are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property and proprietary products and processes. While we believe that our technology, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions that conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. Not only must we compete with other companies that are focused on gene editing and gene therapy technologies, any product candidate that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.
 
Our focus is the development of genetic medicines using our GeneRide and sAAVy technologies. If our current programs are approved for the indications we are pursuing or contemplate we may pursue, they may compete with other products currently under development, including gene editing and gene therapy products. There are a number of companies developing nuclease-based gene editing technologies using CRISPR/Cas9, TALENs, meganucleases, Mega-TALs and ZFNs, including bluebird bio, Caribou Biosciences, CRISPR Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, Intellia Therapeutics, Sangamo Therapeutics, Precision BioSciences, and Graphite Bio. We may also compete with companies developing gene therapy products, including Homology Medicines, Astellas Pharma, Pfizer, bluebird bio, uniQure and Generation Bio. There are also companies pursuing base editing technologies, including Beam Therapeutics.
 
Any products we may develop could also face competition from other products approved to treat the same disease based on other types of therapies, such as small molecule, antibody or protein therapies. There are several companies developing competing products that target MMA, the indication for which we are developing LB-001. These companies include Moderna Therapeutics with an mRNA-based approach, Selecta Biosciences using an AAV gene therapy, and HemoShear Therapeutics using a small molecule. If any of our competitors obtains regulatory approval for a treatment for MMA, it could negatively affect our ability to successfully commercialize LB-001, if approved.
 
There are several companies developing competing products that target CN, the indication for which we conducted research activities for LB-301, including Genethon, Selecta Biosciences, and the Institute for Life Changing Medicines. If any of our competitors obtain regulatory approval for a treatment for CN, it could negatively affect our ability to successfully commercialize LB-301.
 
Additionally, other companies may have or be developing competing products that target HT1, the indication for which we are developing LB-401. If any of our competitors obtain regulatory approval for a treatment for HT1, it could negatively affect our ability to successfully commercialize LB-401.
 
Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials 
 15


and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience and availability of reimbursement.
 
Furthermore, we rely upon a combination of patents and trade secret protection, as well as license and confidentiality agreements to protect the intellectual property related to our proprietary technologies, product candidate development programs and product candidates. Our success depends in large part on our ability to secure and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to any current or future product candidates. If we are unable to obtain and maintain patent protection for our technology and products or if the scope of the patent protection obtained or in-licensed is not sufficiently broad or if the validity of such patent is threatened, we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets, as it could create opportunities for competitors to enter the market or dissuade other companies from collaborating with us to develop products and technology, any of which would hurt our competitive position and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates in any indication for which they are approved. For more information regarding these competitive risks, see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Commercialization.”
 
Intellectual Property
 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing the valid, enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other things, exclusively licensing and filing U.S. and certain foreign patent applications related to our platform technology, existing and planned programs, and improvements that are important to the development of our business, where patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation, and confidential information to develop and maintain our proprietary position and protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection. We additionally rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity, market exclusivity, and patent term extensions where available.
 
Our in-licensed patents and patent applications are directed to various aspects of our gene insertion and gene targeting technologies, including technology applied to treatment of human diseases by targeted insertion and expression of therapeutic transgenes and viral vector technology for transgene delivery. The licenses are, in some cases, limited to certain technical fields and/or therapeutic indications. We intend to pursue, when possible, additional patent protection, including filing patent applications seeking to protect composition of matter, method of use, and process claims, directed to our product development programs. We also intend to pursue rights to existing technologies through one or more licenses from third parties.
 
Notwithstanding these efforts, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any patent applications we have licensed or may license or file in the future, and we cannot be sure that any patents we have licensed or patents that may be licensed or granted to us in the future will not be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented or that such patents will be commercially useful in protecting our technology. Moreover, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. While we have confidence in the measures we take to protect and preserve our trade secrets, such measures can be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”
 
Our intellectual property portfolio as of this filing is summarized below. For some of our pending patent applications, prosecution has yet to commence. Prosecution is a lengthy process, during which the scope of the claims initially submitted for examination by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Officer, or USPTO, is often significantly narrowed by the time they issue, if they issue at all. We expect this to be the case with respect to our pending patent applications referred to below.

Nucleic Acid Delivery
 
We have non-exclusively licensed from The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University, or Stanford, two families of patents and patent applications, or Family 1 and Family 2, relating to AAV capsid polypeptides with improved properties useful for nucleic acid transfer applications and their manufacture and methods of use. Family 1 includes four granted U.S. patents in the U.S. and one granted European patent. The issued U.S. patents in Family 1 are expected to expire in 2027. Patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates. Family 2 includes three granted U.S. patents, one granted European patent, one granted Hong Kong patent, and pending applications in the United States, Europe, and Hong Kong. The issued U.S. patents in Family 2, and any that may later issue from a pending Family 2 patent application, are expected to expire in 2032. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates. For more information regarding the terms of our license to Family 1 and Family 2, please see “License Agreements.”

We have exclusively licensed from Stanford patent applications relating to technology for the nuclease-free insertion of a gene or genes of interest at a target genomic locus without disruption of endogenous gene expression, or Family 4. Family 4 includes one granted U.S. patent, one granted Israeli patent, one granted Australian patent and patent applications pending in eleven jurisdictions including the United States, Europe, Canada, China, Korea, and Japan. Any patent that may issue from a pending Family 4 patent application is expected to expire in 2035. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates. For more information regarding the terms of our license to Family 4, please see “License Agreements.”
 
AAV Capsids 
 
We have non-exclusively licensed from Stanford patent applications, or Family 5, relating to recombinant AAV capsids resistant to pre-existing human neutralizing antibodies and/or characterized by increased transduction or tropism in human liver tissue or hepatocyte cells, useful for nucleic acid transfer applications and their manufacture and methods of use. Family 5 includes two granted U.S. patents, one granted European patent, one granted Japanese patent and patent applications pending in three jurisdictions including Australia, Canada and China. The issued U.S. patent in Family 5, and any patent that may issue from a pending Family 5 patent application, are expected to expire in 2037. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates. For more information regarding the terms of our license to Family 5, please see “License Agreements.”
 
We also jointly own a pending Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, patent application as part of our collaboration with CMRI, relating to novel AAV capsids including the sL65 capsid and capsids that facilitate efficient transduction of human cells, such as human hepatocytes, when contained in an AAV vector.  If granted, this patent application can provide the basis for patent protection that is expected to expire in 2041.  We announced expansion of our partnership with CMRI to develop next-generation AAV vectors for a range of gene editing and gene therapy applications in the treatment of serious diseases of the liver and other tissues.  For more information, please see the “sAAVy Platform” section above.
 
Synthetic Codon-optimized MUT Gene
 
We have non-exclusively licensed from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, as represented by the National Human Genome Research Institute, an Institute of the National Institutes of Health, or the NIH, patents and patent applications relating to synthetic polynucleotides encoding methylmalonyl-CoA mutase, or synMUT, and exhibiting augmented expression in cell culture and/or in a subject. The synMUT license includes at least four granted U.S. patents and one granted European patent. The issued U.S. patents under the synMUT license and any that may later issue from a pending patent application are expected to expire in 2034. Patent term adjustments or patent term extensions could result in later expiration dates. For more information regarding the terms of the synMUT license, please see “License Agreements.”

LogicBio-Owned Patent Filings
 
On August 10, 2018, we filed a U.S. Provisional application, followed by a PCT application that was filed on October 30, 2018. The applications are directed to non-disruptive gene therapy for the treatment of MMA. Applications have been filed in this patent family in each of Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, India, Japan, S. Korea, Mexico, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and the United States.
 
On April 15, 2019, we filed a U.S. Provisional application, followed by a PCT application that was filed on April 14, 2020.  The applications are directed to technologies for improving gene therapies, including through monitoring and/or assessment of a gene therapy treatment after administration. National phase applications have been filed in this patent family in each of Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Israel, India, Japan, S. Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and the United States.
 
The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted, provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each product and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications or the pending patent applications licensed to us will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents or the pending patent applications licensed to us.
 
As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates and technologies will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims, if granted. However, our pending patent applications, and any patent applications that we may in the future file or license from third parties may not result in the issuance of patents. We also cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or patents that we license. Any issued patents that we may receive or license in the future may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. For example, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending third-party patent applications. If third parties prepare and file patent applications in the U.S. that also claim technology or therapeutics to which we have rights, we may have to participate in interference proceedings in the USPTO to determine priority of invention, which could result in substantial costs to us, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us, which is highly unpredictable. In addition, because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a treatment method or product candidate we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our technology can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby limiting protection such patent would afford the respective technology and any competitive advantage such patent may provide.
 
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by executing collaboration agreements containing confidentiality obligations with our collaborators, and agreements containing non-competition, non-solicitation, confidentiality, and invention assignment obligations with our employees and consultants, including our scientific advisors. The confidentiality agreements we enter into are designed to protect our proprietary information and the agreements or clauses requiring assignment of inventions to us are designed to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through our relationship with the respective counterparty. We cannot guarantee, however, that these agreements will afford us adequate protection of our intellectual property and proprietary information rights.
 
Trademarks
 
Our trademark portfolio currently includes a trademark registration in the United States for the mark LOGICBIO, an allowed trademark application in the United States for the mark GENERIDE, and a pending trademark application in the United States for the mark SAAVY.
License and Collaboration Agreements
 
18



CANbridge Agreement
 
In April 2021, we entered into an Exclusive Research Collaboration, License and Option Agreement, or the CANbridge Agreement, with CANbridge. 
 
Under the terms of the CANbridge Agreement, we granted CANbridge (a) an exclusive worldwide license to certain of our intellectual property rights, including those relating to sL65 to develop, manufacture and commercialize gene therapy candidates for the treatment of Fabry and Pompe diseases, or the Fabry and Pompe License, (b) an option to obtain an exclusive worldwide license to certain of our intellectual property rights, including those relating to sL65, to develop and commercialize gene therapy candidates for the treatment of two additional indications, or the Candidate Option, and (c) an exclusive option to obtain an exclusive license to develop and commercialize LB-001 for the treatment of MMA, or the LB-001 Option, in Greater China. Pursuant to the CANbridge Agreement, we and CANbridge are collaborating to develop the gene therapy candidates referenced in (a) above for the treatment of Fabry and Pompe diseases plus, upon CANbridge’s exercise of the applicable Candidate Option, two additional indications under a mutually agreed research plan, or the CANbridge Research Plan.
 
Under the CANbridge Agreement, we received an upfront, non-refundable and non-creditable payment of $10 million from CANbridge, a portion of which we paid to a third party under certain of our in-licensing obligations. In addition, CANbridge is obligated to reimburse us for research and development costs we incur for activities related to the development of the gene therapy candidates for Fabry and Pompe diseases, under the CANbridge Research Plan.
 
We are eligible to receive up to $542 million in aggregate from CANbridge, contingent on the achievement of specified clinical, regulatory and sales milestones relating to the named gene therapy candidates for Fabry and Pompe diseases, the additional indications for which CANbridge exercises the Candidate Option, and the payment of any option exercise fees. We are also eligible to receive up to $49 million in aggregate clinical, regulatory and sales milestones for LB-001, subject to the exercise of the LB-001 Option, and the payment of the LB-001 Option fee. CANbridge is obligated to pay us royalties based on an escalating tiered, mid- to high-single digit percentage of the annual worldwide net sales for each non-LB-001 indication pursued. In addition, CANbridge will pay us royalties based on an escalating tiered, high-single digit to mid-double digit percentage of the annual Greater China net sales for LB-001 for the treatment of MMA, subject to the exercise of the LB-001 Option.
 
The term of the CANbridge Agreement will continue on a product-by-product basis until the expiration of the royalty period. If CANbridge exercises the LB-001 Option in Greater China, the term of the CANbridge Agreement will continue as long as such product is being commercialized.
 
The Board of Trustees of the Leland Stanford Junior University License Agreements
 
In December 2015, as restated in January 2018, we entered into a license agreement with Stanford pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell and sell products covered by certain patent rights to the GeneRide technology owned by Stanford within certain fields of use.
 
This exclusive license grant is limited to the following fields: (a) human therapeutics to treat MMA, propionic acidemia, HIV, influenza, malaria, CN, HT1, Wilson disease, hemophilia B, Glycogen Storage Disease 1 and Glycogen Storage Disease 3, progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis type 2 (PFIC-2) within the ABCB11 gene, lysosomal acid lipase deficiency (LAL-D), including Wolman Disease with the LIPA gene, and (b) the prevention, treatment or diagnosis via genome editing without a nuclease of certain additional indications with respect to liver tissue and certain other tissues to be nominated by us, subject to the terms of the agreement.
 
Pursuant to the Stanford license agreement, we also obtained (i) a non-exclusive license to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell and sell products covered by the foregoing GeneRide patent rights in the field of human therapeutics to treat hemophilia A (via genome editing without a nuclease) and A1ATD; (ii) a non-exclusive license to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell and sell products covered by certain patent rights with respect to AAV capsids owned by Stanford within the same fields of use that apply to the license under the patent rights to the GeneRide technology owned by Stanford; (iii) an exclusive license to make, have made, use, import, offer to sell and sell products covered by certain capsid-related patent rights owned by Stanford within the field of the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of phenylketonuria in humans; and (iv) a non-exclusive license to certain related know-how.
 
19



The license grant from Stanford under the patent rights to the GeneRide technology owned by Stanford does not extend to autologous ex vivo use for non-episomal DNA delivery and maintenance for hematopoietic stem cells for sickle cell or beta thalassemia.
 
The rights licensed to us are sublicensable through a single tier without Stanford’s consent.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, as amended, we paid a one-time, non-refundable upfront fee of $75,000, issued Stanford 130,894 shares of our common stock, and subsequently issued 56,097 additional shares of common stock pursuant to Stanford’s anti-dilution rights under the agreement. In addition, pursuant to its rights under the agreement, Stanford purchased shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. We are required to pay Stanford low single-digit royalties on net sales of products as well as a portion of non-royalty sublicensing revenues. Our obligation to pay royalties will expire (i) on country-by-country basis with respect to net sales of any specified product sold, used, manufactured or imported in an applicable country until the expiration of the last valid claim within the licensed patents in such country covering such licensed product; and (ii) with respect to net sales of any such product, ten years from the first commercial sale of any licensed product. We are also obligated to pay annual maintenance fees, which are fully creditable against any royalty payments made by us, and up to an aggregate amount of $1.3 million of development milestone payments. We were also required to reimburse Stanford for all patent prosecution costs incurred prior to the agreement with respect to the patent rights to the GeneRide technology and for all future patent prosecution costs with respect to the patent rights to the GeneRide technology. We do not have the right to control patent prosecution with respect to the licensed patent applications, but we do have the first right to enforce any patents which may issue from these patent applications.
 
The term of the license agreement will continue so long as there is a valid claim of a licensed patent. Stanford may terminate the agreement upon at least 60 days’ notice to us if (i) we are in material default in the provision of any report or payment of any amounts due to Stanford under the agreement; (ii) we do not use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or commercialize licensed products; (iii) we do not achieve certain diligence milestones within the mutually agreed timeline; (iv) we are in material breach of any provision of the agreement; or (v) provide any materially false report to Stanford. We may terminate the agreement at any time upon at least 30 days’ notice to Stanford.
 
The University of Texas License Agreement
 
In May 2018, we entered into a license agreement with the University of Texas, pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, worldwide license to manufacture, have manufactured, distribute, have distributed, use, offer for sale, sell, lease, loan or import products covered by certain patent rights to the GeneRide technology owned by the University of Texas (jointly with Stanford) within certain fields of use.
 
This exclusive license grant is limited to the following fields: (a) human therapeutics to treat MMA, propionic acidemia, HIV, influenza, malaria, CN, HT1, Wilson disease, hemophilia B, Glycogen Storage Disease 1, Glycogen Storage Disease 3 and any other human disease of liver tissue that affects less than 200,000 persons in the United States as of the effective date of the agreement, and (b) the prevention, treatment or diagnosis via genome editing without a nuclease of certain additional indications with respect to certain tissues to be nominated by us, subject to the terms of the agreement. Pursuant to the University of Texas license agreement, we also obtained a non-exclusive license to certain related know-how. The rights licensed to us are sublicensable through multiple tiers without the consent of the University of Texas.
 
Under the terms of the agreement, we paid a one-time, non-refundable upfront fee of $25,000. We are required to pay the University of Texas low single-digit royalties on all net sales of products as well as a portion of any sublicensing revenues. We are also obligated to pay annual maintenance fees, which are fully creditable against any royalty payments made by us, and certain development and sales milestone payments up to $3.0 million. We are also required to reimburse the University of Texas for all future patent prosecution costs on a pro rata basis with other licensees. We do not have the right to control patent prosecution with respect to the licensed patent applications, but we do have the first right to enforce any patents which may issue from these patent applications.
 
The term of the license agreement will continue on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim of a licensed patent that covers such product in such country and 10 years from the date of the first commercial sale of such product in such country. The University of Texas may terminate the agreement in its entirety or with respect to any applicable part of the licensed subject matter, field of use or licensed territory, or convert the exclusive license to a non-exclusive license, if (i) we fail to timely make a required payment to the University of Texas under the agreement; (ii) we are in material breach of a provision of the agreement and fail to timely cure such breach; (iii) we breach any payment obligation under the agreement three or more times in any 12-month period; (iv) we initiate, or an affiliate or sublicense initiates, a patent challenge against a licensed patent; or (v) we become bankrupt or insolvent, our 
 20


board elects to liquidate our assets or dissolve the business, we cease business operations, we make an assignment to the benefit of our creditors, or our business or assets are otherwise placed in the hands of a receiver, assignee or trustee. We may terminate the agreement in its entirety or with respect to any applicable part of the licensed subject matter, field of use or licensed territory upon at least 30 days’ notice to the University of Texas.
 
The NIH License Agreement
 
In December 2018, we entered into a license agreement with the NIH, pursuant to which we obtained a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain specified patent rights relating to a synthetic codon-optimized MUT gene that is incorporated into the LB-001 GeneRide construct, to exploit products and practice processes that are covered by the licensed patent rights in the field of research, development, manufacture and commercialization of pharmaceutical products for the treatment or prevention of MMA using gene therapy constructs in humans. We have the right to grant sublicenses under the license granted by the NIH, concurrently with licenses of its proprietary or other in-licensed intellectual property rights, with the NIH’s prior consent, not to be unreasonably withheld. The license grant is subject to typical statutory requirements and reserved rights as required under federal law and NIH requirements, including a requirement to manufacture substantially in the United States products used or sold in the United States that embody Licensed Products or are produced through the use of Licensed Processes, each as defined in the agreement.
 
Under the terms of the License Agreement, the NIH received an upfront payment of $25,000, and is entitled to receive payments of up to an aggregate of $9.7 million upon the achievement of certain specified development, regulatory and sales-based milestones. The NIH is also entitled to receive running royalties on annual net sales of Licensed Products (subject to reductions for combination products that include Licensed Products), at certain low- to mid-single digit royalty rates, which rates vary based on the geographic market in which a sale occurs (subject to certain annual minimum royalty payments).
 
The milestones and running royalties will be payable with respect to Licensed Products that are no longer covered by the licensed patent rights in a country, if the products are the subject of orphan drug exclusivity in the country. Additionally, if we receive a priority review voucher or a foreign equivalent for a Licensed Product, we have an obligation to pay to the NIH (a) a mid-single digit percentage of the sale price of the voucher, if we sell the priority review voucher, or (b) a low-single digit percentage of the fair market value of the voucher, if the we use the voucher to obtain regulatory approval of its product for an orphan indication or in the Licensed Field. The NIH is also entitled to receive a low-single digit percentage of upfront consideration that we receive for a sublicense of the rights licensed under the License Agreement and a low-single digit percentage of any consideration received for any assignment of the License Agreement by us.
 
Under the terms of the License Agreement, we have an obligation to use reasonable commercial efforts to make Licensed Products and Licensed Processes reasonably available in the United States following first commercial sale, make reasonable quantities of Licensed Products or materials produced through the use of Licensed Processes available to patient assistance programs and achieve certain diligence milestones.
 
Unless earlier terminated, the term of the License Agreement will continue until the last to expire of the licensed patent rights and any orphan drug exclusivity covering a Licensed Product in any jurisdiction. The NIH may terminate the License Agreement if we are in default in the performance of any material obligations under the License Agreement if the default has not been remedied within ninety days after the date of notice in writing of the default. In addition, the NIH may terminate or modify, at its option, the License Agreement, if the NIH determines, taking into account the normal course of commercial development programs conducted with sound and reasonable business practices and judgment, that we (i) have willfully made a false statement of, or willfully omitted, a material fact in the license application or in any report required by the License Agreement, (ii) have committed a material breach of a covenant or agreement contained in the License Agreement, (iii) are not keeping Licensed Products or Licensed Processes reasonably available to the public after first commercial sale, (iv) cannot reasonably satisfy unmet health and safety needs or (v) cannot reasonably justify a failure to comply with its domestic manufacturing requirements under the License Agreement. We have a unilateral right to terminate the License Agreement in any country or territory by giving the NIH 60 days’ written notice.
 
Government Regulation
 
Government authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, sale, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority.
 21



U.S. Government Regulation of Biological Products
 
In the United States, biological products, including gene editing and gene therapy products, are subject to regulation by the FDA under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHSA, and their implementing regulations. Products also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Each clinical study protocol for a product must be reviewed by the FDA. FDA approval must be obtained before marketing of biological products.
 
Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene editing and gene therapy products. FDA has indicated that it considers gene editing to fall under the category of gene therapy. The FDA has published guidance documents with respect to the development of gene therapy products. The FDA also has published guidance documents, including as recently as January 2020, related to, among other things, the overall gene therapy development process, preclinical assessment, observing subjects in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, orphan drug designation and exclusivity for gene therapy products, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in an IND for gene therapy. FDA also issued guidance documents in January 2021 addressing manufacturing considerations for licensed and investigational gene therapy products during the COVID-19 pandemic and in September 2021 describing FDA’s approach for determining whether two gene therapy products are the same or different for the purpose of assessing orphan drug exclusivity. These guidance documents apply in addition to laws and regulations governing biological products more generally.
 
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
 
 
• | completion of extensive preclinical studies and tests in accordance with applicable regulations, including Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practices, or GCPs, and other clinical-trial related regulations to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantive evidence of safety, purity, and potency from results of preclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to accept the filing for review;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of one or more FDA pre-approval inspections of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biologic will be produced to assess compliance with good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls used in product manufacture are adequate to preserve the biologic’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or GTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA inspection of the preclinical study, LogicBio as clinical trial sponsor, and/or the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | agreement with FDA on the final labeling for the product and the design and implementation of any required Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the BLA, including consideration by an FDA advisory committee, if applicable, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product in the United States.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for our investigational medicines and any future investigational medicines will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
 
Preclinical Studies
 
Before testing any biological product candidate, including our product candidates, in humans, the product candidate must undergo rigorous preclinical testing. The preclinical development stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of the chemistry, formulation and stability of the product candidate, as well as trials to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations.
 
The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request to the FDA to begin a clinical trial of an investigational product to humans, and must be allowed to proceed before human clinical trials may begin. An IND automatically is allowed to proceed 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions, such as concerns that human research subjects may be exposed to unreasonable health risks, and places the IND or the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before a clinical trial can begin. The FDA also may impose clinical holds on a biological product candidate at any time before or during clinical studies due to safety concerns or non-compliance. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, studies may not recommence before the FDA formally lifts the clinical hold and then only under terms aligned between the sponsor and the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical studies to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that suspend or terminate such studies.  Please see “LB-001 for the Treatment of Methylmalonic Acidemia—LB-001 Clinical Development Program” for information with respect to the clinical hold on our IND for LB-001 announced in February 2022. 
 
Clinical Trials
 
The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by, or under control of, the trial sponsor, in accordance with GCPs, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA and other relevant health authorities as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB also approves the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries, including on the www.clinicaltrials.gov website. Additional requirements apply when a gene editing or gene therapy study is conducted at, or sponsored by, institutions receiving NIH funding, such as the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, which require, among other things, institutional biosafety committee review and approval, risk assessments to evaluate appropriate containment, physical containment guidelines, and reporting certain accidents and events to NIH.
 
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
 
 
• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, side effect tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
23



 
• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a larger number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of the product for its intended use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of a BLA or, in certain circumstances, post-approval.
 
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical study investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the safety results of the clinical studies must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical studies may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, acting on its own or based on a recommendation from the sponsor’s data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical study at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical study at its institution if the clinical study is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 
Human gene editing and gene therapy products are new categories of therapeutics. Because these are relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety and efficacy, of human gene editing or gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
 
BLA Review and Approval
 
After the successful completion of clinical studies of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained prior to commercial marketing. The BLA must include results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, as amended, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals or full or partial waivers for submissions of pediatric data. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan drug designation has been granted. 
 
Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee, although the fee may be waived under certain circumstances. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA has ten months from the 60-day filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if, among other things, the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date.
 
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective, for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, safety, 
 24


strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a REMS is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
 
Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a gene editing or gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with GTPs, to the extent applicable. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are tested and processed in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical studies were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP, GTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production, and quality control.
 
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical studies are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical studies. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If the FDA issues a complete response letter, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.
 
If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval is typically limited to the specific diseases, dosages, patient population and other conditions of use studied, and FDA may further limit the scope of approval depending on its review of the relevant data.  Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may also impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS. Any of these actions taken by FDA could limit the commercial value of the product.  In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical studies, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product in the United States. An applicant must request orphan drug designation before submitting a BLA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process.
 
Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for limited grant funding towards clinical trial costs, research tax advantages, and user fee waivers. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. This means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, as defined by FDA, for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of either 
 25


a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication; in the latter case, because health care professionals are free to prescribe products for off-label uses, the competitor’s product could be used for the orphan indication despite our orphan exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do of the same drug and same indication, as defined by the FDA, for which we are seeking. In September 2021, FDA released a final guidance, entitled “Interpreting Sameness of Gene Therapy Products Under the Orphan Drug Regulations,” detailing how it will determine “sameness” of gene therapy products under the orphan drug regulations for the purposes of orphan drug designation and exclusivity. 
 
Expedited Development and Review Programs
 
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy and Regenerative Medicine Advanced Therapy, or RMAT, designations, accelerated approval, and priority review, which are intended to expedite or facilitate the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs and biologics to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures.
 
To be eligible for a fast-track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need by providing a therapy where none exists or a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. Fast track designation provides opportunities for more frequent interactions with the FDA review team to expedite development and review of the product. The FDA also may review sections of the BLA for a fast-track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor and the FDA agree on a schedule for the submission of the application sections, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the BLA.
 
In addition, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug or biologic that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug or biologic may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs or biologics designated as breakthrough therapies also are eligible for priority review. The FDA must take certain actions with respect to breakthrough therapies, such as holding timely meetings with and providing advice to the product sponsor, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy.
 
Another fast-track designation program is the RMAT designation. Unlike the breakthrough therapy designation, which generally applies to various classes of drugs and biologics, the RMAT designation is limited to regenerative medicine therapies, which include cell and gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products, but exclude human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products regulated solely under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act and 21 CFR Part 1271. This program is intended to facilitate development and expedite review of regenerative medicine therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and have the potential to address unmet medical needs for such condition as indicated by preliminary clinical evidence. A drug sponsor may request that the FDA designate a regenerative medicine therapy as a RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. A BLA for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review. 
 
Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical studies establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than survival or irreversible morbidity and is reasonably likely to predict an effect on survival, irreversible morbidity or another clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical studies. 
 
Once a BLA is submitted for a product intended to treat a serious condition, the FDA may assign a priority review designation if the FDA determines that the product, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness. Under priority review, the FDA has a PDUFA goal to review an application in six months, compared to ten 
 26


months for a standard review. Most products that are eligible for fast track or breakthrough therapy designation also are likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review.
 
Another way to obtain priority review for a product is through the rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program. Under this program, the sponsor of a BLA for a biologic designated to treat a rare pediatric disease may be awarded a voucher upon approval that can be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent BLA or sold and transferred to another party seeking priority review. A rare pediatric disease is a serious or life-threatening rare disease or condition, as defined under the Orphan Drug Act discussed above, in which the serious or life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years. The sponsor must request the voucher upon submission of the BLA for the rare pediatric disease biologic. Due to sunset provisions, the pediatric disease priority review voucher program was set to expire in September 2020, but Congress extended the authorization for FDA to continue operating the program through September 2024. After September 30, 2024, FDA will no longer grant rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers to those without rare pediatric disease designation, and after September 30, 2026, FDA will fully stop granting rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers unless the program is further extended. We cannot predict whether this program will be reauthorized after the new legislation sunsets and, if so, what additional conditions or requirements may be imposed.
 
Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. Furthermore, fast track designation, breakthrough therapy and RMAT designation, accelerated approval and priority review do not change the standards for approval and may not ultimately expedite the development or approval process.
 
Biosimilars and Exclusivity
 
An abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-licensed reference biological product was created by the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, as part of the Affordable Care Act. This amendment to the PHSA, in part, attempts to minimize duplicative testing. To date, the FDA has approved a number of biosimilars, and numerous biosimilars have been approved in Europe. The FDA approved its first interchangeable biologic in July 2021. The FDA has issued several guidance documents outlining its approach to reviewing and approving biosimilars.
 
Complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products as compared to small molecule drugs, as well as the processes by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA.
 
A reference biological product is granted 12 years of data exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the product, and the FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. One must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
 
The BPCIA is complex and FDA interpretation and implementation is ongoing. In addition, recent government proposals have sought to reduce the 12-year reference product exclusivity period. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. As a result, the ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning of the BPCIA is subject to significant uncertainty.
 
On December 20, 2019, the Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020, or FCAA 2020, became law. Section 610, entitled “Actions for Delays of Generic Drugs and Biological Products,” provides generic drug (abbreviated New Drug Application and 505(b)(2)) and biosimilar developers with a private right of action to obtain sufficient quantities of reference product from the brand manufacturer, or a generic or biosimilar manufacturer, necessary for approval of the developers’ generic or biosimilar product. If a generic drug or biosimilar developer is successful in its suit, the defendant manufacturer would be required to provide sufficient quantities of product on commercially-reasonable, market-based terms and may be required to pay the developer’s reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as well as financial compensation under certain circumstances. The purpose of Section 610 is to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar products. We cannot determine what effect Section 610 of the FCAA 2020 may have on manufacturers that may develop biosimilar or other competing versions of our products once approved.

Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act, or the BPCA, a biological product may also obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States if a sponsor conducts clinical trials in children in response to a written request from the FDA. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity runs from the end of other exclusivity protection.
 
Post-Approval Requirements
 
Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and recordkeeping activities, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, product sampling and distribution restrictions, complying with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations (i.e., “off-label use”) and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA or BLA supplement, which may require the applicant to develop additional data or conduct additional preclinical studies and clinical trials. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. 
 
FDA regulations require that products be manufactured in specific approved facilities and in accordance with cGMPs. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of our products in accordance with cGMP regulations. These manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations that require, among other things, quality control and quality assurance, the maintenance of records and documentation and the obligation to investigate and correct any deviations from cGMP. Manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs or biologics are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. The discovery of conditions that violate these rules, including failure to conform to cGMPs, could result in enforcement actions, and the discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved BLA, including voluntary recall.
 
Once approval or licensure of a drug or biologic is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval or license if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
 
 
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or other enforcement-related letters or clinical holds on post approval clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending BLAs or supplements to approved BLAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties; or
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | consent decrees, corporate integrity agreements, debarment, or exclusion from federal healthcare programs; or mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Foreign Regulation
 
28



In order to market any product outside of the United States, we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries and jurisdictions regarding quality, safety and efficacy and governing, among other things, clinical trials, marketing authorization, commercial sales and distribution of our products. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable foreign regulatory authorities before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in foreign countries and jurisdictions. Although many of the issues discussed above with respect to the United States apply similarly in the context of other geographies, the approval process varies between countries and jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods. The time required to obtain approval in other countries and jurisdictions might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain FDA approval. Regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country or jurisdiction may negatively affect the regulatory process in others.
Other Healthcare Laws and Regulations
 
In addition to FDA restrictions on the marketing of pharmaceutical products, we may be subject now or in the future to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we market, sell and distribute our product candidates for which we obtain approval. These laws include, but are not limited to the following:

• | The federal anti-kickback statute makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay anything of value in order to induce the referral of business for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements healthcare matters and which also impose certain requirements relating to privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain types of entities, which include many healthcare providers and health plans with which we interact;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The FDCA, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product and medical device marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products prior to approval or for unapproved indications and regulates the distribution of samples;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The U.S. Public Health Service Act, which prohibits, among other things, the introduction into interstate commerce of a biological product unless a biologics license is in effect for that product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Federal laws, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The so-called “federal sunshine” law, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report certain financial interactions with physicians, non-physician practitioners and teaching hospitals to the federal government for re-disclosure to the public.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply to claims reimbursed by private payors as well as government programs or regardless of reimbursement. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, impose specific restrictions on interactions between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers; or require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Other state laws may require pharmaceutical companies to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Finally, there are state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often 
 29


are not preempted by HIPAA. Many of these laws and regulations also contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation.
 
We are also subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, which prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. 
 
Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare and anti-corruption laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Given the breadth of the laws and regulations, limited guidance for certain laws and regulations and evolving government interpretations of the laws and regulations, governmental authorities may possibly conclude that our business practices may not comply with such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.
 
Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
 
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any biological products for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, patients who are prescribed products generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare costs. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations.  Providers and patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. If approved, sales of our product candidates will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. 
 
In the United States, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of pharmaceutical products, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. The coverage determination process usually requires manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of their products to each payor separately and is a time-consuming process. Third-party payors may only cover certain products approved treat a particular condition or impose controls designed to manage utilization of certain products (such as requiring prior authorization before a product will be covered or imposing higher cost obligations on patients). Even if favorable coverage is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable a manufacturer to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on its investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.  And coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time, which changes may not be favorable.
 
In addition, in many foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. In the European Union, governments influence the price of products through their pricing and reimbursement rules and control of national health care systems that fund a large part of the cost of those products to consumers. Some jurisdictions operate positive and negative list systems under which products may only be marketed once a reimbursement price has been agreed to by the government. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval, some of these countries may require the completion of clinical trials that compare the cost effectiveness of a particular product to currently available therapies. Other member states allow companies to fix their own prices for medicines, but monitor and control company profits. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. The downward pressure on health care costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross border imports from low priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.
 
30



Healthcare Reform
 
A primary trend in the U.S. healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payers, however, have attempted to control costs by implementing various measures, including price-controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic and biosimilar products for branded drug and biologic products, respectively. 
 
Within the United States, federal and state governments continue to propose and pass legislation designed to reform the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare, which include initiatives to reduce the cost of healthcare.  For example, in March 2010, the U.S. Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or Affordable Care Act, which expanded health care coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual mandate for health insurance coverage and which included changes to the coverage and reimbursement of drug products under government healthcare programs.
 
Under the Trump administration, there were ongoing efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the Affordable Care Act. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty established under Healthcare Reform Act for individuals who do not maintain mandated health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. The Affordable Care Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the latest judicial challenge to the Healthcare Reform Act brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Healthcare Reform Act.
 
Beyond the Affordable Care Act, there have been ongoing health care reform efforts, including a number of recent actions. Some recent healthcare reform efforts have sought to address certain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including an expansion of telehealth coverage under Medicare and accelerated or advanced Medicare payments to healthcare providers. Other reform efforts affect pricing or payment for drug products. For example, the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program has been subject to statutory and regulatory changes and the discount that manufacturers of Medicare Part D brand name drugs must provide to Medicare Part D beneficiaries during the coverage gap increased from 50% to 70%. Additional reform efforts are likely.  The Biden administration has focused on reforms that would address the high cost of drugs.  In response to an Executive Order from President Biden, the Secretary of HHS issued a comprehensive plan for addressing high drug prices that describes a number of legislative approaches and identifies administrative tools to address the high cost of drugs. And Democrats included drug pricing reform provisions reflecting elements of the plan in a broader proposed spending package in late 2021—such as capping Medicare Part D patients out-of-pocket costs; establishing penalties for drug prices that increase faster than inflation in Medicare; and authorizing the federal government to negotiate prices on certain, select high cost drugs under Medicare Parts B and D. Healthcare reform efforts have been and may continue to be subject to scrutiny and legal challenge. 
 
There have also been efforts by federal and state government officials or legislators to implement measures to regulate prices or payment for pharmaceutical products, including legislation on drug importation. Recently, there has been considerable public and government scrutiny of pharmaceutical pricing and proposals to address the perceived high cost of pharmaceuticals. There have also been recent state legislative efforts to address drug costs, which generally have focused on increasing transparency around drug costs or limiting drug prices.
 
General legislative cost control measures may also affect reimbursement for our product candidates. The Budget Control Act, as amended, resulted in the imposition of 2% reductions in Medicare (but not Medicaid) payments to providers in 2013 and will currently remain in effect through 2030 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022). Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs that may be implemented and/or any significant taxes or fees that may be imposed on us could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.
 
While we expect that additional foreign, federal and state healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, we cannot predict the nature, timing or effect of such efforts. There is no assurance that federal or state health care reform will not adversely affect our future business and financial results.
 
Data Privacy and Security
 
We may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business.
 
31



Within the United States, our operations may be affected by HIPAA as amended by HITECH and its implementing regulations, collectively, HIPAA, which impose obligations on certain “covered entities” (most healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses) and certain of their “business associate” contractors with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Although we believe that we currently are neither a “covered entity” nor a “business associate” under the regulations, the law may affect our interactions with customers who are covered entities or their business associates because the law affects the ability of these entities to disclose patient health information to us. Various states also have laws that regulate the privacy and security of patient information and so may affect our business operations. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, became effective on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California consumers (defined to include all California residents) certain rights, including the right to ask companies to disclose the types of personal information collected, specific pieces of information collected by a company, the categories of sources from which such information was collected, the business purpose for collecting or selling the consumer’s personal information, and the categories of third parties with whom a company shares personal information. The CCPA also imposes several obligations on companies to provide notice to California consumers regarding a company’s data processing activities. Additionally, the CCPA gives California consumers the right to ask companies to delete a consumer’s personal information and places limitations on a company’s ability to sell personal information, including providing consumers a right to opt out of sales of their personal information. On November 3, 2020, California voters passed a ballot initiative approving the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which will significantly expand the CCPA to incorporate additional provisions, including a requirement that the use, retention, and sharing of personal information of California residents be reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes of collection or processing, granting additional protections for sensitive personal information, and requiring greater disclosures related to notice to residents regarding retention of information. The CPRA will also expand personal information rights of California residents, including creating a right to opt out of sharing of personal information with third parties for advertising, expanding the lookback period for the right to know about personal information held by businesses, and expanding the right to erasure for information held by third parties. Most CPRA provisions will take effect on January 1, 2023, though the obligations will apply to any personal information collected after January 1, 2022.
 
Outside the United States, other data privacy and security regulations may apply. For example, the processing of personal data in the European Economic Area, or the EEA, is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which took effect in May 2018. The GDPR increases obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA, such as in relation to the provision of fair processing notices, exercising data subject rights and reporting certain data breaches to regulators and affected individuals, as well as how we document our relationships with third parties that process GDPR-covered personal data on our behalf. The GDPR places restrictions on the cross-border transfer of personal data from the EU to countries that have not been found by the European Commission to offer adequate data protection legislation, such as the United States. In July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or CJEU, invalidated the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, or the Privacy Shield, one of the mechanisms used to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the U.S. The CJEU decision also drew into question the long-term viability of an alternative means of data transfer, the standard contractual clauses, for transfers of personal data from the EEA to the U.S. This CJEU decision may lead to increased scrutiny on data transfers from the EEA to the U.S. generally and increase our costs of compliance with data privacy legislation.
 
Compliance with data privacy and security regulation can require allocation of resources as well as changes in operations. Any failure to comply with data protection and privacy laws could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, claims for damages by data subjects, regulatory investigations and enforcement action, litigation and significant costs for remediation, any of which could adversely affect our business. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.

 Item 1. Business—LB-001 for the 
 39


Treatment of Methylmalonic Acidemia—LB-001 Clinical Development Program.” SAEs or undesirable side effects that arise in the development of any of our product candidates and any resulting action taken by us, the DSMB, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, or the IRBs, may result in our needing to abandon their development or limit development to certain uses or subpopulations in which the serious adverse events, undesirable side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more acceptable from a risk-benefit perspective, any of which would harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Many product candidates that initially showed promise in early-stage testing have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further clinical development of the product candidates. Moreover, if we elect, or are required, to delay, suspend or terminate any clinical trial of any product candidate we may develop, the commercial prospects of such product candidates may be harmed and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates may be delayed or eliminated. Treatment-related side effects also could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. In addition, these side effects may not be appropriately recognized or managed by the treating medical staff. We may have to train medical personnel using our product candidates to understand the side effect profiles for our clinical trials and upon any commercialization of any of our product candidates. Inadequate training in recognizing or managing the potential side effects of our product candidates could result in patient injury or death. Any of these occurrences may harm our ability to identify and develop product candidates, which could harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. 
 
If any of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by any such product, including during any long-term follow-up observation period recommended or required for patients who receive treatment using our products, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including: 
  
• | regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | we may be required to recall a product or change the way such product is administered to patients;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | additional restrictions may be imposed on the marketing of the particular product or the manufacturing processes for the product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label, such as a “black box” warning or contraindication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if we successfully develop a product candidate and it receives marketing approval, the FDA could require us to implement a REMS, which may include a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients, a communication plan to health care practitioners, extensive patient monitoring or distribution systems and processes that are highly controlled, restrictive and more costly than what is typical for the industry;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the product could become less competitive;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | we could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our reputation may suffer.
--+---------------------------

 
Any of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the particular product candidate, if approved, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
We intend to identify and develop product candidates based on our novel GeneRide and sAAVy technology platforms, which makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of product candidate development. 
 
We have concentrated our research and development efforts on product candidates utilizing our GeneRide and sAAVy technology platforms. Our future success depends on the successful development of these novel therapeutic approaches. Any product candidates we may develop will act at the level of DNA, and, because non-human animal DNA differs from human DNA, results of tests of our product candidates in preclinical animal models for either safety or efficacy may not be predictive of results that may be observed in humans. Also, preclinical animal models may not exist for some of the diseases we expect to pursue. Our GeneRide genome editing technology harnesses HR a naturally occurring DNA repair process. The mechanism of action of this technology is still not completely understood. Therefore, it is and will be difficult for us to predict whether any of our product candidates will be able to successfully and consistently integrate corrective DNA in or deliver gene transfer constructs to enough tissue cells or otherwise result in sufficient expression of the target protein to reach therapeutic levels. We cannot be certain that any of our product candidates will be able to meet safety and efficacy levels needed to be therapeutic in humans or that they will not cause SAEs, such as the SAEs referenced in the prior risk factor, or toxicities. As a result of these factors, it is difficult for us to predict the time and cost of product candidate development, and we cannot predict whether the application of our GeneRide or sAAVy technology platforms, or any similar or competitive gene delivery platforms, will result in the identification, development and regulatory approval of any medicines, or that other 
 40


genetic medicine technologies will not be considered better or more attractive for the development of medicines. Any development problems we experience in the future related to our GeneRide or sAAVy technology platforms or any of our research programs may cause significant delays or unanticipated costs, or we may not be able to solve for the issue. We may also experience delays in developing a capable and scalable manufacturing process or transferring that process to collaboration partners. Any of these factors may prevent us from completing our preclinical studies or clinical trials that we may initiate or prevent us from commercializing any product candidates we may develop on a timely or profitable basis, if at all. 
 
Because gene delivery is novel and the regulatory landscape that governs any product candidates we may develop is uncertain and may change, we cannot predict the time and cost of obtaining regulatory approval, if we receive it at all, for any product candidates we may develop. 
 
Because gene delivery is novel, the regulatory requirements governing any gene delivery product candidates we develop are uncertain and subject to change. For example, in January 2020, the FDA issued guidance documents to reflect recent advances in the field, and to set forth the framework for the development, review and approval of gene therapies. These guidance documents pertain to the development of gene therapies for the treatment of specific disease categories, including rare diseases, and to manufacturing and long-term follow-up issues relevant to gene therapy, among other topics. The FDA also issued a guidance document in January 2021 addressing manufacturing considerations for licensed and investigational gene therapy products during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, there is substantial, and sometimes uncoordinated, overlap in those responsible for global regulation of existing gene therapy products and cell therapy products. For example, in the United States, the FDA has established the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapies within its Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, to consolidate the review of genome editing, gene therapy and related products, and the Cellular, Tissue and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee to advise CBER on its review. Genome editing and gene therapy clinical trials are also subject to review and oversight by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at the institution participating in the clinical trial. Although the FDA decides whether individual genome editing or gene therapy protocols may proceed, the review process and determinations of other reviewing bodies can impede or delay the initiation of a clinical trial, even if the FDA has reviewed the trial and approved its initiation. The same applies to regulatory bodies in other jurisdictions, including Saudi Arabia, where we may enroll patients in our Phase 1/2 SUNRISE clinical trial, and the European Union. The EMA’s Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT, is responsible for assessing the quality, safety and efficacy of advanced-therapy medicinal products. The role of the CAT is to prepare a draft opinion on an application for marketing authorization for a gene therapy medicinal candidate that is submitted to the EMA. In the European Union, the development and evaluation of a gene therapy medicinal product must be considered in the context of the relevant European Union guidelines. The EMA may issue new guidelines concerning the development and marketing authorization for gene therapy medicinal products and require that we comply with these new guidelines.
 
Adverse developments in preclinical studies or clinical trials conducted by others in the field of gene therapy products, cell therapy products or products developed through the application of gene editing technology may cause the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory bodies to revise the requirements for approval of any product candidates we may develop or limit the use of products utilizing genome editing technologies, either of which could materially harm our business. In addition, the clinical trial requirements of the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities and the criteria these regulators use to determine the safety and efficacy of a product candidate vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use and market of the potential products. 
 
The regulatory approval process for product candidates such as ours can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or more extensively studied pharmaceutical or other product candidates. Furthermore, during the regulatory review process, we will need to identify success criteria and endpoints such that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities will be able to determine the clinical efficacy and safety profile of any product candidates we may develop. As we are initially seeking to identify and develop product candidates to treat diseases in which there is little clinical experience using new technologies, there is heightened risk that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may not consider the clinical trial endpoints that we propose to provide clinically meaningful results (reflecting a tangible benefit to patients). In addition, the resulting clinical data and results may be difficult to analyze. Even if the FDA does find our success criteria to be sufficiently validated and clinically meaningful, we may not achieve the pre-specified endpoints to a degree of statistical significance. This may be a particularly significant risk for many of the genetically defined diseases for which we plan to develop product candidates because many of these diseases have small patient populations, and designing and executing a rigorous clinical trial with appropriate statistical power is more difficult than with diseases that have larger patient populations. Further, even if we do achieve the pre-specified criteria, we may produce results that are unpredictable or inconsistent with the results of the non-primary endpoints or other relevant data. The FDA also weighs the benefits of a product against its risks, and the FDA may view the efficacy results in the context of safety as not being supportive of 
 41


regulatory approval. Other regulatory authorities in the European Union and other countries, such as the CAT, may make similar comments with respect to these endpoints and data. Any product candidates we may develop will be based on a novel technology that makes it difficult to predict the time and cost of development and of subsequently obtaining regulatory approval. To date, no product that utilizes our GeneRide or sAAVy technology has been approved. There have been a limited number of clinical trials of gene editing and gene therapy technologies, however no genome editing product candidates have been approved and only a few gene therapy products have been approved in the United States and Europe. Our Phase 1/2 SUNRISE clinical trial is the first clinical trial of a product candidate that utilizes our technology. 
 
Regulatory agencies administering existing or future regulations or legislation may not allow production and marketing of products utilizing genome editing or gene therapy technology in a timely manner or under technically or commercially feasible conditions. In addition, regulatory action or private litigation could result in expenses, delays or other impediments to our research and development programs or the commercialization of resulting products. 
 
The regulatory review committees and advisory groups described above and the new guidelines they promulgate may lengthen the regulatory review process, increase the scope of process and analytical development, require us to perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, increase our development costs, lead to changes in regulatory positions and interpretations, delay or prevent approval and commercialization of these treatment candidates, or lead to significant post-approval limitations or restrictions. As we advance our research programs and develop future product candidates, we will be required to consult with these regulatory and advisory groups and to comply with applicable guidelines. If we fail to do so, we may be required to delay or discontinue development of any product candidates we identify and develop. 
 
We have limited experience conducting clinical trials and no history commercializing genetic medicine product candidates and we may encounter difficulties transitioning from a research-stage to clinical-stage company to ultimately a commercial-stage company, which may make it difficult to evaluate the prospects for our future viability. 
 
We were founded in 2014 and began operations in 2015. Our operations to date have been limited to financing and staffing our company, developing our technology such as our GeneRide and sAAVy technology platforms, identifying and developing LB-001 and other product candidates, undertaking preclinical studies, business planning and raising capital. Other than LB-001, all of our programs are still in the preclinical or research stage of development. As described above, our IND for LB-001 was placed on hold by the FDA. We will not be able to progress further with our clinical development of LB-001 in the United States and potentially other jurisdictions until the hold is lifted. For more information, please see the risk factor titled “Our business may be materially adversely affected if the clinical hold placed by the FDA on the LB-001 IND is not timely and favorably resolved or if such regulatory concerns lead to more burdensome preclinical studies or clinical trials that cause significant delays in or end development of LB-001.” 
 
The risk of failure in the biopharmaceutical industry for programs or product candidates at such stage of development is high. We have not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully complete any interventional clinical trials, including pivotal clinical trials, obtain marketing approval, manufacture a commercial scale product or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. Typically, it takes about six to ten years to develop a new drug from the time it enters Phase 1 clinical trials to when it is approved for treating patients, but in many cases it may take longer. Consequently, predictions about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing genetic medicine product candidates. 
 
In addition, as a business with a limited operating history, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors, such as the clinical hold that FDA has placed on our IND for LB-001. We will eventually need to plan to transition from a company with a research and development focus to a company capable of supporting commercial activities, if any of our product candidates is approved. We may not be successful in such a transition. 
 
Preclinical drug development is uncertain. Some or all of our preclinical programs may experience delays or may never advance to clinical trials, which would adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize these product candidates on a timely basis or at all, which would have an adverse effect on our business. 
 
In order to obtain FDA approval to market a new product, we must demonstrate proof of safety and efficacy in humans. To satisfy these requirements, we will have to conduct adequate and well-controlled clinical trials. Before we can commence clinical trials for a product candidate, we must complete extensive preclinical testing and studies that support our planned IND in the United States. We cannot be certain of the timely completion or outcome of our preclinical testing and studies, and we cannot predict if the FDA will accept our proposed clinical programs, if any, or if the outcome of our preclinical 
 42


testing and studies will ultimately support the further development of any of our product candidates. As a result, we cannot be sure that we will be able to submit INDs or similar applications for any preclinical programs on the timelines we expect, if at all, and we cannot be sure that submission of INDs or similar applications will result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities allowing clinical trials to begin. For example, our IND for LB-001 was placed on clinical hold by the FDA in February 2020 prior to the dosing of the first patient with LB-001, which was lifted in August 2020. More recently, in February 2022, we announced that the FDA had placed our IND for LB-001 on clinical hold after we reported an SAE in our Phase 1/2 SUNRISE clinical trial of LB-001 in pediatric MMA patients.  Even if the FDA lifts the current clinical hold with respect to our LB-001 IND, there can be no assurances that the FDA will not place this IND, or any IND relating to any other of our product candidates that we may file in the future, on clinical hold, requiring us to address any issues raised by the FDA in order to continue the applicable clinical trials. 
 
Conducting preclinical testing is a lengthy, time-consuming and expensive process. The length of time may vary substantially according to the type, complexity, novelty and intended use of the product candidate, and often can be several years or more per product candidate. Delays associated with product candidates for which we are conducting preclinical testing and studies ourselves may cause us to incur additional operating expenses. Moreover, we may be affected by delays associated with the preclinical testing and studies of certain product candidates conducted by our current and potential future partners over which we have no control. The commencement and rate of completion of preclinical studies and initiation of clinical trials for a product candidate may be delayed by many factors, including, for example: 
 
 
• | inability to generate sufficient preclinical data to support clinical development;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | delays in reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on preclinical and clinical study design;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | inability to obtain appropriate or sufficient test agents or preclinical animal models in connection with the indication the product candidate is meant to address;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recruiting and retaining the appropriate scientific and technical personnel; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the product candidate may not be safe or efficacious for the indication we intend to address.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Moreover, even if we obtain positive results from preclinical studies or clinical trials, including interim data from a clinical trial, we may not achieve the same success in ongoing or future trials. 
 
Clinical trials are expensive, difficult to design and implement, and involve an uncertain outcome. 
 
Before obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities for the sale of any product candidates we may identify and develop, we must complete preclinical development and then conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of any such product candidates. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process, and there is a high failure rate for product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, including interim data from a clinical trial, of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of ongoing or future clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. A number of companies in the biotechnology and genetic medicine industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or adverse safety profiles, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Even if our future clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support the safety and effectiveness of our product candidates for particular indications, including LB-001 for MMA or any other potential indication. 
 
Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses. Many companies that have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials have nonetheless failed to obtain marketing approval of their product candidates. 
 
A clinical trial may be suspended or terminated by us, either independently or based on a recommendation by the DSMB, for such trial, by IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, or by the FDA or other regulatory authorities. We or such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination due to a number of factors, including (1) failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols; (2) findings from inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA or other regulatory authorities; (3) safety issues or adverse side effects; (4) failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a drug; (5) changes in governmental regulations; (6) administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial; or (7) imposition of a clinical hold by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, such as the current clinical hold imposed by FDA on the LB-001 IND after we reported an SAE in our Phase 1/2 
 43


SUNRISE clinical trial of LB-001 in pediatric MMA patients. Furthermore, we may rely on CROs and clinical trial sites to ensure the proper and timely conduct of clinical trials and while we would have agreements governing their committed activities, we would have limited influence over their actual performance, as described in “—Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties.” 
 
In addition, LB-001 will require extensive additional clinical testing before we are prepared to submit a Biologic License Application, or BLA, for regulatory approval in the United States or submit a comparable application for regulatory approval in other jurisdictions. We cannot predict with any certainty if or when we might complete the development of LB-001 and submit a BLA for regulatory approval of LB-001 or whether any such BLA will be approved by the FDA or a comparable application for regulatory approval may be approved in other jurisdictions. We may also seek feedback from the FDA or other regulatory authorities on our clinical development program, and the FDA or such regulatory authorities may not provide such feedback on a timely basis, or such feedback may not be favorable, which could further delay our development programs. 
 
If we cannot favorably resolve the current clinical hold on our IND for LB-001, or our development program of LB-001 or any other product candidate is delayed, suspended or terminated for another reason, our progress in the development of LB-001 or such other product candidate may be significantly slowed or stopped and the associated costs may be significantly increased, which could materially adversely affect our business.
 
Clinical trials are time-consuming and subject to potential delays. 
 
To date, we have not completed any clinical trials for any of our product candidates, including LB-001. We may experience delays in conducting any clinical trials, and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned to address clinical holds imposed by regulatory authorities or for other reasons, recruit and enroll patients on time or be completed on schedule, or at all. For example, as discussed above, our Phase 1/2 SUNRISE clinical trial of LB-001 in pediatric MMA patients has been placed on hold by the FDA. Clinical trials can be delayed or terminated for a variety of reasons, including delays or failures related to: 
 
 
• | the FDA or other regulatory authorities disagreeing as to the design or implementation of our clinical trials, including alignment with regulatory authorities on registrational endpoints for indications where there are not generally accepted registrational endpoints;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | determining achievable endpoints in connection with our clinical trials that are accepted by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, including with respect to the number of patients and the length of time;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtaining regulatory approval to commence a trial or to restart a trial following a clinical hold, such as the clinical hold placed by FDA on the LB-001 IND after we reported an SAE in our Phase 1/2 SUNRISE clinical trial of LB-001 in pediatric MMA patients;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reaching an agreement on acceptable terms with contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for clinical supply, contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CMOs, CROs and trial sites;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtaining IRB approval at each site;
--+-------------------------------------


• | regulators, IRBs, DSMBs, safety committees, or ethics committees, may require that we suspend or terminate our clinical trials for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using our product candidate, or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risk;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | recruiting suitable patients to participate in a trial, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | availability of competing therapies and clinical studies, and clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product or product candidate being studied in relation to available therapies or other product candidates in development;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developing and validating the companion diagnostic to be used in a clinical trial, if applicable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | having patients complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up, which could be especially challenging in light of the COVID-19 pandemic;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | selection of clinical endpoints that require prolonged periods of clinical observation or analysis of the resulting data;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 44


 
• | clinical sites deviating from trial protocol or subjects dropping out of a trial;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | addressing patient safety concerns that arise during the course of a trial;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | occurrence of SAEs associated with any product candidates we may develop, such as the TMAs experienced by patients in our SUNRISE trial of LB-001 in pediatric MMA patients as further described above, including those that are viewed to outweigh their potential benefits;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | occurrence of SAEs in trials of the same class of agents conducted by other sponsors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | adding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | manufacturing sufficient quantities of product candidate for use in clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to receive marketing approval or commercialize our product candidates or significantly increase the cost of such trials, including: 
 
 
• | we may receive feedback from regulatory authorities that requires us to modify the design of our clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clinical trials of our product candidates may produce negative or inconclusive results, and we may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional clinical trials or abandon development programs;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | difficulty in designing well-controlled clinical trials due to ethical considerations which may render it inappropriate to conduct a trial with a control arm that can be effectively compared to a treatment arm;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | difficulty in designing clinical trials and selecting endpoints for diseases that have not been well-studied and for which the natural history and course of the disease is poorly understood;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the number of patients required for clinical trials of our product candidates may be larger than we anticipate, enrollment in these clinical trials may be slower than we anticipate and/or participants may drop out of these clinical trials at a higher rate than we anticipate;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our third-party contractors may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we or any sponsor investigators might have to suspend or terminate clinical trials of our product candidates for various reasons, including non-compliance with regulatory requirements, a finding that our product candidates have undesirable side effects or other unexpected characteristics, or a finding that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the cost of clinical trials of our product candidates may be greater than we anticipate, and we may not have funds to cover the costs;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct clinical trials or receive regulatory approval of our product candidates may be insufficient or inadequate;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulators may revise the requirements for approving our product candidates, or such requirements may not be as we anticipate;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in regulatory requirements and guidance that require amending or submitting new clinical protocols; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any of our collaborators that conduct clinical trials may face any of the above issues, and may conduct clinical trials in ways they view as advantageous to them but that are suboptimal for us.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If we are required to conduct additional clinical trials or other testing of our product candidates beyond those that we currently contemplate, if we are unable to successfully complete clinical trials of our product candidates or other testing, if the results of these trials or tests are not positive or are only modestly positive or if there are safety concerns, we may: 
 
 
• | incur unplanned costs;
--+-----------------------


• | be delayed in obtaining marketing approval for our product candidates or not obtain marketing approval at all;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain marketing approval in some countries and not in others;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 45



 
• | obtain marketing approval for indications or patient populations that are not as broad as intended or desired;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | obtain marketing approval with labeling that includes significant use or distribution restrictions or safety warnings, including boxed warnings;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | be subject to changes in the way the product is administered;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | be required to perform additional clinical trials to support approval or be subject to additional post-marketing testing requirements;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | be required to implement a REMS, or create a medication guide outlining the risks of such side effects for distribution to patients;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have the product removed from the market after obtaining marketing approval;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | have regulatory authorities withdraw or suspend their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in the form of a modified risk evaluation and mitigation strategy;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | be sued; or
--+------------


• | experience damage to our reputation.
--+-------------------------------------

 
If we experience delays in the commencement or completion of our clinical trials, if we cannot favorably resolve the current clinical hold on the LB-001 IND, or if we terminate a clinical trial prior to completion, the commercial prospects of LB-001 or any other product candidate we develop could be harmed. In addition, any delays in our clinical trials could increase our costs, slow down the development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials also ultimately may lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. 
 
Product development costs also will increase if we or our collaborators experience delays in testing or marketing approvals. We do not know whether any clinical trials will begin as planned, will need to be restructured, or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Significant clinical trial delays also could shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize any product candidates we may develop, could allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do and could impair our ability to successfully commercialize any product candidates we may develop, any of which may harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
If we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, particularly in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected. 
 
We or our collaborators may not be able to initiate or continue clinical trials for any product candidates we identify or develop if we are unable to locate and enroll a sufficient number of eligible patients to participate in these trials as required by the FDA or analogous regulatory authorities outside the United States, or as needed to provide appropriate statistical power for a given trial. The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until its conclusion. In addition, if patients are unwilling to participate in our clinical trials because of negative publicity from adverse events related to the biotechnology, gene therapy or genome editing fields, competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations, clinical trials in competing products or for other reasons, the timeline for recruiting patients, conducting trials and obtaining regulatory approval of any product candidates we may develop may be delayed. 
 
We may encounter delays in enrolling, or be unable to enroll, a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our clinical trials, and even once enrolled we may be unable to retain a sufficient number of patients to complete any of our trials. Our ability to enroll patients may be significantly delayed by the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, and we do not know the extent and scope of such delays at this point. The enrollment of patients depends on many factors, including: 
 
 
• | the patient inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in the protocol including exclusion criteria;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the size of the patient population required for analysis of the trial’s primary endpoints;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | severity of the disease under investigation;
--+---------------------------------------------

 46



 
• | the proximity of patients to trial sites and any barriers on patients' ability to travel (such as travel restrictions patients may encounter due to the COVID-19 pandemic or global conflict);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the design of the trial;
--+-------------------------


• | restrictions on our ability to conduct clinical trials, including full or partial clinical holds on ongoing or planned clinical trials, such as the current clinical hold placed by the FDA on our LB-001 IND;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | availability and efficacy of approved medications for the disease under investigation;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to recruit clinical trial investigators with the appropriate competencies and experience;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | clinicians’ and patients’ perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any potentially competitive product candidates being studied in clinical trials and new products that may be approved for the indications we are investigating;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | the risk that patients enrolled in clinical trials will drop out of the trials before completion;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the risk that the patients we screen may not be eligible to advance to the clinical trial and that the size of the qualifying patient population;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under investigation or the method by which such product candidate will be administered to patients, in particular from patients, their caregivers and physicians;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | perceived risks and benefits of genome editing as a therapeutic approach;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate based on any interim data or updates that we may announce;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | patient referral practices of physicians; and
--+----------------------------------------------


• | ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In February 2022, we announced that the FDA has placed our IND for LB-001 on clinical hold after we reported an SAE in our Phase 1/2 SUNRISE clinical trial of LB-001 in pediatric MMA patients. If we are unable to satisfy any requests from the FDA in a timely manner, or at all, or if the FDA does not lift the clinical hold in a timely manner, or at all, we would be further delayed in or prevented from enrolling patients in our SUNRISE clinical trial. Even if the FDA lifts the clinical hold, the announcement of the clinical hold may affect enrollment of patients. 
 
Our ability to successfully initiate, enroll, and complete a clinical trial in any foreign country is subject to numerous risks unique to conducting business in foreign countries, including: 
 
 
• | difficulty in establishing and managing relationships with CROs and other vendors, as well as clinical trial sites and investigators;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | different standards for the conduct of clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | different standard-of-care for patients with a particular disease;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | inability to locate qualified local consultants, physicians and partners;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws, medical standards and regulatory requirements, including the regulation of pharmaceutical and biotechnology products and treatment; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any heightened restrictions in foreign countries relating to the COVID-19 pandemic (such as travel restrictions).
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
47



In addition, our clinical trials will compete with other clinical trials for product candidates that are in the same therapeutic areas as our product candidates, and this competition will reduce the number and types of patients available to us, because some patients who might have opted to enroll in our trials may instead opt to enroll in a trial being conducted by one of our competitors. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial sites. 
 
Delays or failures in planned patient enrollment or retention may result in increased costs, program delays or both, which could have a harmful effect on our ability to develop LB-001 or any other product candidates, or could render further development impossible. 
 
Even if we complete the necessary clinical trials, we cannot predict when, or if, we will obtain regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate we may develop, and any such approval may be for a more narrow indication than we seek.
 
We cannot commercialize a product candidate until the appropriate regulatory authorities have reviewed and approved the product candidate. Even if any product candidates we may develop meet their safety and efficacy endpoints in clinical trials, the regulatory authorities may not complete their review processes in a timely manner, or we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval. Additional delays may result if an FDA advisory committee or other regulatory authority recommends non-approval or restrictions on approval. In addition, we may experience delays or rejections based upon additional government regulation from future legislation or administrative action, or changes in regulatory authority policy during the period of product development, clinical trials and the review process. 
 
Regulatory authorities also may approve a product candidate for more limited indications than requested or they may impose significant limitations in the form of narrow indications, warnings or a REMS. These regulatory authorities may require precautions or contra-indications with respect to conditions of use, or they may grant approval subject to the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, regulatory authorities may not approve the labeling claims that are necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of any product candidates we may develop. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for any product candidates we may develop and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
Adverse public perception of gene delivery technologies may negatively impact our potential products. 
 
We are developing therapies using genome editing and gene therapy technologies. The clinical and commercial success of our potential products will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of genome editing and gene therapy for the prevention or treatment of human diseases. Public attitudes may be influenced by claims that gene editing and gene therapy are unsafe, unethical or immoral, and, consequently, our products may not gain the acceptance of the public or the medical community. Public perception of the cost, durability and potential harm from over-expression of genome editing and gene therapy may also affect public acceptance of our product candidates. Adverse public attitudes may adversely impact our ability to enroll clinical trials. Moreover, our success will depend upon physicians prescribing, and their patients being willing to receive, treatments that involve the use of product candidates we may develop in lieu of, or in addition to, existing treatments with which they are already familiar and for which greater clinical data may be available. 
 
In addition, gene editing technology is subject to public debate and heightened regulatory scrutiny due to ethical concerns relating to the application of gene editing technology to human embryos or the human germline. The Alliance for Regenerative Medicine in Washington has issued principles setting forth a bioethical framework for the use of gene editing in therapeutic applications that states that the use of gene editing technologies in research that involved altering human embryos or human germline cells is currently not appropriate. Similarly, the NIH has announced that it would not fund any use of gene editing technologies in human embryos, noting that there are multiple existing legislative and regulatory prohibitions against such work, including the Dickey-Wicker Amendment, which prohibits the use of appropriated funds for the creation of human embryos for research purposes or for research in which human embryos are destroyed. Laws in the United Kingdom prohibit genetically modified embryos from being implanted into women, but embryos can be altered in research labs under license from the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. Research on embryos is more tightly controlled in many other European countries. 
 
Although we do not use our technologies to edit human embryos or the human germline, such public debate about the use of gene editing technologies in human embryos and heightened regulatory scrutiny could prevent or delay our development of product candidates. More restrictive government regulations or negative public opinion would have a negative effect on our

business or financial condition and may delay or impair our development and commercialization of product candidates or demand for any products we may develop. 
 
Serious adverse events in our clinical trials, such as the two cases of TMA experienced by two patients in our Phase 1/2 SUNRISE clinical trial described above, or other clinical trials involving gene delivery technology, particularly AAV genetic medicines, such as candidates based on the same capsid serotypes as our product candidates, or occurring during use of our competitors’ products, even if not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates, and the resulting publicity, could result in increased government regulation, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our product candidates, stricter labeling requirements for those product candidates that are approved and a decrease in demand for any such product candidates. For example, certain gene therapy trials led to several well-publicized adverse events, including cases of leukemia and death, some of which took years to present. Additionally, cases of TMA have been reported in association with other AAV genetic therapies. SAEs, such as these, whether in our clinical trials or other clinical trials involving gene therapy or genome editing products or our competitors’ products, even if not ultimately attributable to the relevant product candidates, and the resulting publicity could result in increased regulation and regulatory scrutiny, unfavorable public perception, potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our product candidates.
 
We may not be successful in our efforts to identify additional product candidates. 
 
Part of our strategy involves identifying novel product candidates. Other than LB-001, all of our product candidates are still in the preclinical or research stage of development. The process by which we identify product candidates may fail to yield product candidates for clinical development for a number of reasons, including: 
 
 
• | we may not be able to generate sufficient preclinical data to support the initiation of clinical trials;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we may not be able to assemble sufficient resources to acquire or discover additional product candidates;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | competitors may develop alternatives that render our potential product candidates obsolete or less attractive;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential product candidates we develop may nevertheless be covered by third parties’ patents or other exclusive rights;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential product candidates may, on further study, be shown to have harmful side effects, toxicities or other characteristics that indicate that they are unlikely to be products that will receive marketing approval and achieve market acceptance;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | negative results in the clinical trials for any of our product candidates could negatively impact other product candidates based on the same or similar technologies;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential product candidates may not be effective in or applicable to treating their targeted diseases;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the market for a potential product candidate may change so that the continued development of that product candidate is no longer reasonable;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a potential product candidate may not be commercially viable;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


• | we may experience difficulties reaching a consensus with regulatory agencies on preclinical study design;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a potential product candidate may not be capable of being produced in commercial quantities at an acceptable cost, or at all; and/or
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the regulatory pathway for a potential product candidate is too complex and difficult to navigate successfully or economically.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
In addition, we may choose to focus our efforts and resources on a potential product candidate that ultimately proves to be unsuccessful. As a result, we may fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities, be required to forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or other diseases that may later prove to have greater commercial potential or relinquish valuable rights to such product candidates through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights. If we are unable to identify additional suitable product candidates for clinical development, this could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.

We and our contract manufacturers are subject to significant regulation with respect to manufacturing our product candidates. The manufacturing facilities on which we rely may not continue to meet regulatory requirements and have limited capacity. 
 
We currently have relationships with a limited number of suppliers for the manufacturing of our product candidates. Each supplier may require licenses to manufacture such components if such processes are not owned by the supplier or in the public domain and we may be unable to transfer or sublicense the intellectual property rights we may have with respect to such activities. 
 
All entities involved in the preparation of therapeutics for clinical trials or commercial sale, including our existing contract manufacturers for our product candidates, are subject to extensive regulation. Components of a finished therapeutic product approved for commercial sale or used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with cGMP. These regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of investigational products and products approved for sale. Poor control of production processes can lead to the introduction of adventitious agents or other contaminants, or to inadvertent changes in the properties or stability of our product candidates that can impact safety, efficacy and quality. We or our contract manufacturers must supply all necessary documentation in support of a BLA, or an application for regulatory approval in another jurisdiction, on a timely basis and must adhere to the FDA’s, or the applicable regulatory authority's, GLP, and cGMP regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. None of our contract manufacturers has produced a commercially-approved gene editing product, and some of our contract manufacturers have not produced a commercially-approved gene therapy product and therefore have not yet obtained the requisite FDA approvals to do so. The facilities and quality systems of some or all of our third-party contractors, as well as any facilities and quality systems we may have in the future, must pass a pre-approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of regulatory approval of our product candidates or any of our other potential products. In addition, the regulatory authorities may, at any time, audit or inspect a manufacturing facility involved with the preparation of our product candidates or our other potential products or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted. If these facilities do not pass a pre-approval plant inspection, FDA approval, or approval by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, will not be granted. 
 The regulatory authorities also may, at any time following approval of a product for sale, audit our manufacturing facilities or those of our third-party contractors. If any such inspection or audit identifies a failure to comply with applicable regulations or if a violation of our product specifications or applicable regulations occurs independent of such an inspection or audit, we or the relevant regulatory authority may require remedial measures that may be costly and/or time-consuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or the temporary or permanent closure of a facility. Any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could materially harm our business. 
 
If we or any of our third-party manufacturers fail to maintain regulatory compliance, the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions can impose regulatory sanctions including, among other things, refusal to approve a pending application for a new drug product or biologic product, or revocation of a pre-existing approval. As a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially harmed. 
 
Additionally, if supply from one approved manufacturer is interrupted, there could be a significant disruption in commercial supply. In the United States, an alternative manufacturer would need to be qualified through a BLA supplement which could result in further delay, and there may be similar requirements in other jurisdictions. The regulatory agencies may also require additional studies if a new manufacturer is relied upon for commercial production. Switching manufacturers may involve substantial costs and is likely to result in a delay in our desired clinical and commercial timelines. 
 
These factors could cause the delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, required approvals or commercialization of our product candidates, cause us to incur higher costs and prevent us from commercializing our products successfully. Furthermore, if our suppliers fail to meet contractual requirements, and we are unable to secure one or more replacement suppliers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost, our clinical trials may be delayed or we could lose potential revenue. 
 
The regulatory approval processes of the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed. 
 
The time required to obtain approval by the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities is unpredictable, but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved and the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In 
 50


addition, approval policies, regulations or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate’s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any product candidate and it is possible that neither LB-001 nor any other product candidate will ever obtain regulatory approval. Neither we nor any future collaborator is permitted to market any of our product candidates in the United States, the EU or any other jurisdiction until we receive regulatory approval from the applicable regulatory authority. It is possible that the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may refuse to accept for substantive review any applications for marketing approval that we submit for our product candidates or may conclude after review of our data that our application is insufficient to obtain marketing approval of our product candidates. 
 
Prior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the United States or abroad, we or our collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. The FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to accept any application or may decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Even if we believe the preclinical or clinical data for our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities. The FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may also require us to conduct additional preclinical studies or clinical trials for our product candidates either prior to or post-approval, or it may object to elements of our clinical development program. Depending on the extent of these or any other studies required by regulatory authorities, approval of any marketing application that we submit may be delayed by several years, or may require us to expend significantly more resources than we have available. 
 
Of the large number of potential products in development, only a small percentage successfully completes the FDA, the EMA or regulatory approval processes in other jurisdictions and are commercialized. The lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects. 
 
We are heavily dependent on the success of LB-001, our lead product candidate, and if LB-001 does not receive regulatory approval in the United States or other jurisdictions, or is not successfully commercialized, our business will be harmed. 
 
To date, we have invested a significant portion of our efforts and financial resources in the development of LB-001. Our future success and ability to generate product revenue is substantially dependent on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize LB-001. As we announced in February 2022, the FDA placed our IND for LB-001 on clinical hold after we reported an SAE in our Phase 1/2 SUNRISE clinical trial of LB-001 for pediatric MMA patients. We currently have no products that are approved for commercial sale and may never be able to develop marketable products. 
 
Assuming favorable resolution of the clinical hold, we expect that a substantial portion of our efforts and expenditures over the next few years will be devoted to LB-001. Accordingly, our business currently depends heavily on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of LB-001, which may never occur. We cannot be certain that LB-001 will be successful in clinical trials, receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized even if we receive regulatory approval. Even if we receive approval to market LB-001 from the FDA or other regulatory authorities, we cannot be certain that our product candidate will be successfully commercialized, widely accepted in the marketplace or more effective than other commercially available alternatives. Additionally, the research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, sale, marketing and distribution of genetic medicine products are and will remain subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, the EMA and regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. We are not permitted to market LB-001 in the United States until it receives approval of a BLA from the FDA, or in any foreign jurisdictions until it receives the requisite approval from such jurisdictions. We have not submitted a BLA to the FDA or comparable applications to other regulatory authorities and do not expect to be in a position to do so for the foreseeable future.
 
LB-001 is our lead product candidate, and because other product candidate may be based on similar technology, if LB-001 shows unexpected adverse events or a lack of efficacy in the indications we intend to treat, or if we experience other regulatory or developmental issues, our development plans and business could be significantly harmed. Further, competitors may be developing products with similar technology and may experience problems with their products that could identify problems that would potentially harm our business. For example, as previously disclosed, two patients in our Phase 1/2 SUNRISE clinical trial of LB-001 in pediatric patients experienced cases of TMA. After reporting the second case of TMA to the FDA, the FDA placed our IND for LB-001 on clinical hold. We are working with the FDA and DSMB to determine the next steps for the SUNRISE clinical trial and the LB-001 program.

In order to market any products in any particular jurisdiction, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements on a country-by-country basis regarding safety and efficacy. Approval by the FDA in the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions. However, the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact our ability to obtain approval elsewhere. In addition, clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country does not guarantee regulatory approval in any other country. 
 
Approval processes vary among jurisdictions and can involve additional product testing and validation and additional administrative review periods. Seeking foreign regulatory approval could result in difficulties and increased costs for us and require additional preclinical studies or clinical trials which could be costly and time consuming. Regulatory requirements can vary widely from country to country and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in those countries. We do not have any product candidates approved for sale in any jurisdiction, including in international markets, and we do not have experience in obtaining regulatory approval in international markets. If we fail to comply with regulatory requirements in international markets or to obtain and maintain required approvals, or if regulatory approvals in international markets are delayed, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of any product we develop will be unrealized. 
 
We may expend our limited resources to pursue a particular product candidate or indication and fail to capitalize on product candidates or indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success. 
 
Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, we focus on research programs and product candidates that we identify for specific indications. As a result, we may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities with other product candidates or for other indications that later prove to have greater commercial potential. Our resource allocation decisions may cause us to fail to timely capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. Our spending on current and future research and development programs and product candidates for specific indications may not yield any commercially viable products. If we do not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a particular product candidate, we may relinquish valuable rights to that product candidate through collaboration, licensing or other royalty arrangements in cases in which it would have been more advantageous for us to retain sole development and commercialization rights to such product candidate. Any such event could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
Genomic medicines are novel, and any product candidates we develop may be complex and difficult to manufacture. We could experience production problems that result in delays in our development or commercialization programs, limit the supply of our products or otherwise harm our business. 
 
Due to the novel nature of our platform, any product candidates we may develop will likely require processing and manufacturing steps that are more complex than those required for most chemical pharmaceuticals. Moreover, unlike chemical pharmaceuticals, the physical and chemical properties of a biologic such as the product candidates we are developing generally cannot be fully characterized. As a result, assays of the finished product may not be sufficient to ensure that the product will perform in the intended manner.
 
Problems with the manufacturing process, even minor deviations from the normal process, could result in product defects or manufacturing failures that result in lot failures, product recalls, product liability claims or insufficient inventory. If we successfully develop product candidates, we may encounter problems achieving adequate quantities and quality of clinical-grade materials that meet FDA, EMA or other comparable applicable foreign standards or specifications with consistent and acceptable production yields and costs. 
 
In addition, the FDA, the EMA and other regulatory authorities may require us to submit samples of any lot of any approved product together with the protocols showing the results of applicable tests at any time. Under some circumstances, the FDA, the EMA or other regulatory authorities may require that we not distribute a lot until the agency authorizes its release. Slight unplanned deviations in the manufacturing process, including those affecting quality attributes and stability, may result in unacceptable changes in the product that could result in lot failures or product recalls. Lot failures or product recalls could cause us to delay clinical trials or product launches, which could be costly to us and otherwise harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
We or our third-party contractors also may encounter problems hiring and retaining the experienced scientific, quality control and manufacturing personnel needed to manage and/or provide the necessary oversight of our manufacturing process, which could result in delays in our production or difficulties in maintaining compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
 Given the nature of biologics manufacturing, there is a risk of contamination during manufacturing. Any contamination could materially harm our ability to produce product candidates on schedule and could harm our results of operations and cause 
 52


reputational damage. Some of the raw materials that we anticipate will be required in our manufacturing process are derived from biologic sources. Such raw materials are difficult to procure and may be subject to contamination or recall. A material shortage, contamination, recall or restriction on the use of biologically derived substances in the manufacture of any product candidates we may develop could adversely impact or disrupt the commercial manufacturing or the production of clinical material, which could materially harm our development timelines and our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
Any problems in our manufacturing process or the facilities with which we contract could make us a less attractive collaborator for potential partners, including larger pharmaceutical companies and academic research institutions, which could limit our access to additional attractive development programs. Problems in third-party manufacturing process or facilities also could restrict our ability to meet market demand for any products we develop and commercialize. 
 
The manufacturing processes for our product candidates are complex and changes in our manufacturing processes may cause delays in our clinical development and commercialization plans.
 
The manufacturing processes for our product candidates, including viral vector manufacturing, are complex. Some of the factors that contribute to the complexity of this process include: 
 
 
• | the use of complex biological raw materials, including plasmid DNA, and cell banks, that need to comply with stringent regulatory requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the use of complex manufacturing methods, such as transfection of suspension mammalian cell culture in large bioreactors (transfection is the process by which plasmid DNA enters the cells), and purification of intact viral particles;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the need to produce high-concentration, high purity drug product; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the challenges associated with scale-up, batch-to-batch consistency and product characterization, including measurement of potency and quality.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We explore improvements to the manufacturing process for our product candidates on a continual basis. Changes to the manufacturing process may occur in connection with efforts to optimize our process in preparation for the potential advancement of our clinical trial or commercialization of our product candidates. Changes to this process could induce a change in the purity or potency of a product candidate. In some circumstances, changes in the manufacturing process may require us to perform additional comparability studies or to collect additional data from patients prior to undertaking additional clinical studies, or to perform a bridging study.  The FDA could also require us to file a new IND with respect to such changes in our manufacturing process. These requirements may lead to delays in our clinical development and commercialization plans. 
 
53



Our employees and independent contractors, including investigators, CROs, CMOs, consultants, vendors and any third parties we may engage in connection with development and commercialization, may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements, which could harm our business. 
 
Misconduct by our employees and independent contractors, including investigators, CROs or CMOs, consultants, vendors, and any third parties we may engage in connection with development and commercialization, could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct or unauthorized activities that violate: (i) the laws and regulations of the FDA, EMA rules and regulations and other similar regulatory requirements, including those laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities; (ii) GXP; (iii) data privacy, security, fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations; or (iv) laws that require the reporting of true, complete and accurate financial information and data. Activities subject to these laws could also involve the improper use or misrepresentation of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, creation of fraudulent data in preclinical studies or clinical trials or illegal misappropriation of drug product, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with such laws or regulations. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person or government could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business and results of operations, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgements, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid, other U.S. federal healthcare programs or healthcare programs in other jurisdictions, individual imprisonment, additional integrity oversight and reporting obligations, other sanctions, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations. 
 
Our business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures. 
 
Our computer systems, as well as those of our CROs, CMOs, suppliers and other contractors and consultants, are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. If such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our product candidate development programs. For example, the loss of preclinical study or clinical trial data from completed, ongoing or planned trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of personal, confidential or proprietary information, we could incur liability and the further development of LB-001 or any other product candidate could be delayed. 
 
In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, clinical trial data, proprietary business information, personal data and personally identifiable information of our clinical trial subjects and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures and those of our third-party contractors, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or internal bad actors, or breached due to employee error, a technical vulnerability, malfeasance or other disruptions. Although, to our knowledge, we have not experienced any such material security breach to date, any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, significant regulatory penalties, and such an event could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in us and our ability to conduct clinical trials, which could adversely affect our reputation and delay our clinical development of our product candidates. 
 
Interim “top-line” and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data. 
 
From time to time, we may publish interim “top-line” or preliminary data from our clinical trials. Interim data from clinical trials that we may complete are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues and more patient data become available. Preliminary or “top-line” data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, interim and preliminary data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Adverse differences between preliminary or interim data and final data could significantly harm our business prospects. 
 54



Risks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties 
 
We currently contract with third parties for the manufacture and testing of materials. This reliance on third parties increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of such materials, product candidates or any medicines that we may develop and commercialize, or that such supply will not be available to us at an acceptable cost, which could delay, prevent or impair our development or commercialization efforts. 
 
We contract with third parties, including those with manufacturing facilities, to supply some of our discovery and preclinical research. We currently also rely on third-party manufacturers and other vendors for the manufacture and testing of our materials for clinical trials. We expect to continue to do so for commercial supply of any product candidates that we may develop and for which we or our collaborators obtain marketing approval. We do not have a long-term supply agreement with any of the third-party manufacturers, and we purchase our required supply on a purchase order basis. 
 We may be unable to establish any agreements with third-party manufacturers for clinical and commercial supply manufacturing, or to do so on acceptable terms. Even if we are able to establish agreements with third-party manufacturers, reliance on third-party manufacturers entails additional risks, including such any third-party manufacturer: 
 
 
• | experiencing staffing difficulties;
--+------------------------------------


• | undergoing changes in priorities or becoming financially distressed;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | forming relationships with other entities, some of which may be our competitors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | experiencing unanticipated events that cause negative consequences in such third party's ability to fulfill its obligations to us, including due to the COVID-19 pandemic or natural disasters requiring delay or cessation of operations;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | experiencing business interruptions resulting from geo-political events, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters, including floods and fires;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by CMOs, which may allow our potential competitors to access and exploit our proprietary technology and reduce our trade secret protection;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | having limited capacity for manufacturing slots;
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | the possible breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the possible termination or nonrenewal of the agreement by the third party at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance, quality assurance, compliance with specifications, maintaining proper chain of custody, safety, and pharmacovigilance and related reporting.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Third-party manufacturers may not be able to comply with cGMP regulations or similar regulatory requirements in or outside the United States. Our failure, or the failure of our third-party manufacturers, to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, delays, suspension or withdrawal of approvals, license revocations, seizures or recalls of product candidates or medicines, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecutions, any of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 Any medicines that we may develop may compete with other product candidates and products for access to manufacturing facilities. There are a limited number of manufacturers that operate under cGMP regulations and that might be capable of manufacturing for us. 
 
Any performance failure on the part of our existing or future manufacturers could delay clinical development or marketing approval. We do not currently have arrangements in place for redundant supply of complex biological raw materials, drug substance or drug product. If any one of our current contract manufacturers cannot perform as agreed, we may be required to replace that manufacturer. Although we believe that there are a few potential alternative manufacturers who could manufacture any product candidates we may develop, we may incur added costs and delays in identifying and qualifying any such replacement. 
 
Our current and anticipated future dependence upon others for the manufacture of any product candidates we may develop or medicines may adversely affect our future profit margins and our ability to commercialize any medicines that receive marketing approval on a timely and competitive basis. 
 55



We intend to rely on third parties to conduct, supervise and monitor our clinical trials. If those third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties, or if they perform in an unsatisfactory manner, it may harm our business.
 
We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to conduct some aspects of our research and preclinical testing. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on CROs and other vendors, as well as clinical trial sites and investigators to ensure the proper and timely conduct of our clinical trials, and we expect to have limited influence over their actual performance. Any of these third parties may terminate their engagements with us at any time. If we need to enter into alternative arrangements, it would delay our product development activities. 
 
We intend to rely upon CROs and other vendors to draw, distribute, store and test clinical samples, the data from which will be used to manage ongoing care of participants in our clinical studies and to monitor clinical safety and efficacy endpoints, and to store, manage and analyze clinical data for our programs. We also intend to rely on CROs and other vendors for the execution of future preclinical studies. Our reliance on CROs for clinical development activities limits our control over these activities, but we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our studies is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal, regulatory and scientific standards and our reliance on the CROs does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We also expect to rely on other third parties to store and distribute drug supplies for our clinical trials. Any performance failure on the part of our CROs, distributors and other vendors could delay clinical development or marketing approval of any product candidates we may develop or commercialization of our medicines, producing additional losses and depriving us of potential product revenue. 
 
We and our CROs and other vendors will be required to comply with the GLPs and GCPs, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and are also required by the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area, or the EEA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities in the form of International Conference on Harmonization guidelines for any of our product candidates that are in preclinical and clinical development. The regulatory authorities enforce GCPs through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or our CROs fail to comply with GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot be sure that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials comply with GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. Accordingly, if our CROs fail to comply with these regulations, we may be required to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process. We also are required to register ongoing clinical trials and post the results of completed clinical trials on a government-sponsored database, clinicaltrials.gov, within certain timeframes. Failure to do so can result in fines, adverse publicity, and civil and criminal sanctions. 
 
Our CROs and other vendors are not our employees, and we will not control whether or not they devote sufficient time and resources to our future clinical and preclinical programs. These CROs and other vendors may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting clinical trials, or other product development activities which could harm our competitive position. We face the risk of potential unauthorized disclosure or misappropriation of our intellectual property by CROs and other vendors, which may reduce our trade secret protection and allow our potential competitors to access and exploit our proprietary technology. If our CROs and other vendors do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations, fail to meet expected deadlines, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for any other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize any product candidate that we develop. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for any product candidate that we develop would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed. 
 
If our relationship with any CROs or other vendors terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or other vendors or do so on commercially reasonable terms. Switching or adding additional CROs or other vendors involves substantial cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we intend to carefully manage our relationships with our CROs and other vendors, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not harm on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
We have and may in the future enter into collaborations with third parties for the research, development and commercialization of certain of the product candidates we may develop. If any such collaborations are not successful, we may not be able to capitalize on the market potential of those product candidates. 
 56



We may seek collaborative relationships for the development and commercialization of any product candidate we may develop. For example, in January 2020, we announced a research collaboration with Takeda, in April 2021, we entered into an Exclusive Research Collaboration. License and Option Agreement with CANbridge, and in April 2021, we also entered into a research collaboration with Daiichi. Future collaborators could include large and mid-size pharmaceutical companies, regional and national pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies. Under any such arrangements with third parties, we will likely have limited control over the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators dedicate to the development or commercialization of any product candidates we may seek to develop with them. Our ability to generate revenues from these arrangements will depend partly on our collaborators’ abilities to successfully perform the functions assigned to them in these arrangements. We cannot predict the success of any collaboration that we enter into. 
 Failure to obtain such collaborative relationships could impair the potential for any product candidate we may develop. We also may enter into collaborative relationships to provide funding to support our other research and development programs. The process of establishing and maintaining collaborative relationships is difficult, time-consuming and involves significant uncertainty, such as: 
 
 
• | a collaboration partner may have significant discretion in determining the efforts and resources that they will apply to these collaborations;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a collaboration partner may shift its priorities and resources away from our product candidates due to a change in business strategies, or a merger, acquisition, sale or downsizing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a collaboration partner may delay preclinical studies or clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a nonclinical program or clinical trial, stop a clinical trial, nonclinical study or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new preclinical studies or clinical trials, or require a new formulation of a product candidate for testing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a collaboration partner may seek to renegotiate or terminate its relationship with us due to unsatisfactory clinical or nonclinical results, manufacturing issues, a change in business strategy, a change of control or other reasons;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a collaboration partner may cease development in therapeutic areas that are the subject of our strategic collaboration;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a collaboration partner may not devote sufficient capital or resources towards our product candidates;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a collaboration partner may change the success criteria for a product candidate thereby delaying or ceasing development of such candidate;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a collaboration partner may not properly obtain, maintain, enforce or defend our intellectual property or proprietary rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a significant delay in initiation of certain development activities by a collaboration partner will also delay payment of milestones tied to such activities, thereby impacting our ability to fund our own activities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a collaboration partner could develop a product that competes, either directly or indirectly, with our product candidate;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a collaboration partner with commercialization obligations may not commit sufficient financial or human resources to the marketing, distribution or sale of a product;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a collaboration partner with manufacturing responsibilities may encounter regulatory, resource or quality issues and be unable to meet demand requirements;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | collaborations involving a co-development relationship increases the risk to successful completion of a development program because it requires coordination between multiple sponsors on a number of topics, including regulatory and development strategy and safety reporting;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a collaboration partner may terminate a strategic alliance and, if terminated, may result in a need for additional capital to pursue further development or commercialization of the applicable product candidates;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a dispute may arise between us and a partner concerning the research, development or commercialization of a product candidate resulting in a delay in milestones, royalty payments or termination of an alliance and possibly resulting in costly litigation or arbitration which may divert management attention and resources;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | a partner may use our products or technology in such a way as to invite litigation from a third party;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 57



 
• | we may lose certain valuable rights under circumstances identified in our collaborations, including if we undergo a change of control;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | collaboration agreements may not lead to development or commercialization of product candidates in the most efficient manner, or at all; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | if a collaborator of ours were to be involved in a business combination, the continued pursuit and emphasis on our product development or commercialization program under such collaboration could be delayed, diminished or terminated.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If our collaborations do not result in the successful development and commercialization of products, or if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may not receive any future research funding or milestone or royalty payments under the collaboration. If we do not receive the funding we expect under these agreements, our development of product candidates could be delayed and we may need additional resources to develop product candidates. In addition, if one of our collaborators terminates its agreement with us, we may find it more difficult to find a suitable replacement collaborator or attract new collaborators, and our development programs may be delayed or the perception of us in the business and financial communities could be adversely affected. All of the risks relating to product development, regulatory approval, and commercialization described herein also apply to the activities of our collaborators. 
 
We may in the future decide to collaborate with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for the development and potential commercialization of any product candidates we may develop. These relationships, or those like them, may require us to incur non-recurring and other charges, increase our near- and long-term expenditures, issue securities that dilute our existing stockholders or disrupt our management and business. In addition, we could face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborators, and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex. Our ability to reach a definitive collaboration agreement will depend, among other things, upon our assessment of the collaborator’s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed collaboration and the proposed collaborator’s evaluation of several factors. If we license rights to any product candidates we or our collaborators may develop, we may not be able to realize the benefit of such transactions if we are unable to successfully integrate them with our existing operations and company culture. 
 If any collaborator fails to fulfill its responsibilities in a timely manner, or at all, our research, clinical development, manufacturing or commercialization efforts related to that collaboration could be delayed or terminated, or it may be necessary for us to assume responsibility for expenses or activities that would otherwise have been the responsibility of our collaborator. If we are unable to successfully transition terminated collaborative agreements, we may have to delay or discontinue further development of one or more of our product candidates, undertake development and commercialization activities at our own expense or find alternative sources of capital. Moreover, any collaborative partners we enter into agreements with in the future may shift their priorities and resources away from our product candidates or seek to renegotiate or terminate their relationships with us. 
 
If conflicts arise between us and our collaborators or strategic partners, these parties may act in a manner adverse to us and could limit our ability to implement our strategies. 
 
If conflicts arise between our collaborators or strategic partners, such as CANbridge, Daiichi, Stanford, NIH, CMRI, the University of Texas or Oregon Health & Science University, or OHSU, and us, the other party may act in a manner adverse to us and could limit our ability to implement our strategies. Some of our collaborators and strategic partners are conducting multiple product development efforts within each area that is the subject of the collaboration with us. Our collaborators or strategic partners, however, may develop, either alone or with others, products in related fields that are competitive with the products or potential products that are the subject of these collaborations. Competing products, either developed by the collaborators or strategic partners or to which the collaborators or strategic partners have rights, may result in the withdrawal of partner support for our product candidates. 
 
Some of our collaborators or strategic partners could also become our competitors in the future. Our collaborators or strategic partners could develop competing products, preclude us from entering into collaborations with their competitors, fail to obtain timely regulatory approvals, terminate their agreements with us prematurely, or fail to devote sufficient resources to the development and commercialization of products. Any of these developments could harm our product development efforts. 
 58


Our collaborators or strategic partners may decide to adopt alternative technologies or may be unable to develop commercially viable products with our technology, which would negatively impact our revenues and our strategy to develop these products. 
 
Our collaborators or strategic partners may adopt alternative technologies, which could decrease the marketability of our GeneRide or sAAVy technologies. Additionally, because our current or future collaborators or strategic partners are likely to be working on more than one development project, they could choose to shift their resources to projects other than those they are working on with us. If they do so, this would delay our ability to test our technology and would delay or terminate the development of potential products based on our GeneRide or sAAVy technologies. Further, our collaborators and strategic partners may elect not to develop products arising out of our collaborative and strategic partnering arrangements or to devote sufficient resources to the development, manufacturing, marketing or sale of these products. The failure to develop and commercialize a product candidate pursuant to our agreements with our current or future collaborators would prevent us from receiving future milestone and royalty payments which would negatively impact our revenues. 
 
If we fail to comply with obligations in agreements under which we in-license or acquire development or commercialization rights to products, technology or data from third parties, including our agreements with Stanford, the University of Texas and NIH, we could lose such rights that are important to our business, and we may be unable to continue our development or commercialization programs as a result, which would be harmful to our business. 
 
We are a party to agreements with Stanford and the University of Texas to license our core technology, and we are party to a license agreement with the NIH for development and commercialization rights to certain capsids including the transgene for LB-001. We are also party to an agreement with CMRI for development and commercialization rights to certain capsids including the first capsid produced from the sAAVy platform, sL65. We may enter into additional agreements with other parties in the future that impose diligence, development and commercialization timelines, milestone payments, royalties, insurance and other obligations on us. 
 
In exchange for the rights granted to us pursuant to our agreements with Stanford, the University of Texas, the NIH and CMRI, we are obligated to make payments upon the achievement of certain milestone events and to pay annual maintenance fees and specified royalties. If we fail to comply with our obligations under these agreements or any future license agreements, our counterparties may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we might not be able to develop, manufacture or market any product candidate that is covered by these agreements, which could materially adversely affect the value of the product candidate being developed under any such agreement. Termination of these agreements or reduction or elimination of our rights under these agreements may result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated agreements with less favorable terms, or cause us to lose our rights under these agreements, including our rights to important intellectual property or technology.
 
Our business has been adversely affected by the ongoing coronavirus pandemic, and we expect it to continue to have a negative impact on our business.
 
In March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized the COVID-19 outbreak a “pandemic.” The pandemic and government measures taken in response have since had a significant impact, both direct and indirect, on businesses and commerce, as worker shortages have occurred; supply chains have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services, such as medical services and supplies, has spiked, while demand for other goods and services, such as travel, has fallen. Although the FDA has approved certain therapies and vaccines, the logistics of implementing a national vaccine program, the willingness of individuals to get vaccinated and the overall efficacy of the vaccines once widely administered, especially as new strains of COVID-19 have been discovered, and the level of resistance these new strains have to the existing vaccines remains unknown.

The Company is following federal, state and local requirements and guidelines with respect to COVID-19 and has allowed its employees to return to working on-premises in accordance with those requirements and guidelines.
 
Our research, development and manufacturing activities are dependent on our ability to continue our work on premises at our laboratory. We also rely on third parties, such as CROs and CMOs, located in areas that are affected by the COVID-19 pandemic for certain research, development and manufacturing activities. Many of these third parties also limited their staff from working on premises as part of their response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic may have a significant negative effect on our business and future results due to a variety of factors, including the health of our employees, our ability to maintain operations, the ability of our third-party vendors, suppliers and collaborators to continue operations, any further government and/or public actions taken in response to the pandemic and ultimately the length of the pandemic.  The Company is aware that certain of its third-party vendors are being affected by import/export and other 
 59


restrictions due to COVID-19, which are currently having an impact on certain of the Company’s research, development and manufacturing activities. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, including the development of additional variants, will directly or indirectly impact the Company’s business, results of operations and financial position will depend on future developments that are uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted.
 
Infections and deaths related to COVID-19, including as a result of new and more resistant strains, have significantly disrupted the United States’ healthcare and healthcare regulatory systems. Such disruptions have diverted healthcare resources away from regular activities at a number of institutions where clinical trials are normally conducted. Depending on the duration and severity of the pandemic, our efforts to engage with potential trial sites in start-up and other activities for our planned clinical trials or other studies may be adversely affected. In addition, other known and unknown factors caused by COVID-19 could materially delay other aspects of our clinical trials, including our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff. 
 
The pandemic could also potentially affect the business of the FDA, the EMA or other governmental authorities, which could result in delays in meetings, reviews, inspections and approvals relating to LB-001. Any elongation or de-prioritization of our clinical trials or delay in regulatory review resulting from such disruptions could materially affect the development and study of our product candidates. Further, any decision by the FDA, EMA or other governmental authorities to delay meeting with us or scheduling inspections in light of COVID-19 could have a material adverse effect on our clinical trials, which could increase our operating expenses and have a material adverse effect on our financial results, including the timing and amount of future regulatory milestones we could receive from our partners.
 
On March 10, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to postpone most inspections of foreign manufacturing facilities and products in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. On March 18, 2020, the FDA announced its intention to temporarily postpone routine surveillance inspections of domestic manufacturing facilities and provided guidance regarding the conduct of clinical trials, which the FDA continues to update.  Since then, the FDA has continuously monitored the pandemic and adjusted its inspection policies in line with safety of its inspectors, travel restrictions, and public health needs. For example, as of July 2020, the FDA utilized a rating system to assist in determining when and where it is safest to conduct mission critical domestic and foreign inspections to ensure compliance of manufacturing facilities with FDA quality standards. In May 2021, the FDA issued a roadmap as to how it intended to restore normal inspection operations and reduce the backlog of inspections that had built up due to delays caused by the pandemic. While this roadmap is subject to pandemic developments, the FDA hoped to restore standard operations by September 2021. After a temporary pause of certain inspectional activities in December 2021 to ensure the safety of its employees due to the spread of the Omicron variant, the FDA announced the resumption of routine domestic surveillance inspections on February 7, 2022. Depending on the course of the pandemic in various geographic areas, the FDA may not be able to maintain its planned restoration of standard operations and delays or setbacks are possible in the future. Additionally, regulatory authorities outside the United States may adopt similar restrictions or other policy measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic and may experience delays in their regulatory activities.
 
Our activities will continue to require a significant expenditure of capital resources. The COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of new and more resistant strains, could lead to disruptions of global financial markets and, if so, could impact our ability to access capital. An extended period of disruption in the economy and capital markets could significantly affect our ability to raise additional capital on a timely basis, which would significantly disrupt our programs and also require us to reevaluate our corporate strategy.

Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property 
 
If we are unable to obtain and maintain sufficient patent protection for any product candidates and for our technologies, or if the scope of the patent protection obtained is not sufficiently broad, our competitors could develop and commercialize products and technology similar or identical to ours, and our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and our technologies may be adversely affected. 
 
Our success depends in large part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the United States and other countries with respect to our platform technologies and any proprietary product candidates and technologies we develop. We seek to protect our proprietary position by in-licensing intellectual property relating to our platform technologies and filing patent applications in the United States and abroad related to our technologies and product candidates that are important to our business. If we or our licensors are unable to obtain or maintain patent protection with respect to our AAV capsid technology and genome editing platform technology and any proprietary products and technologies we develop, our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be materially harmed. Additionally, if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitors may be able to erode or negate any competitive advantage we may have, which could harm our business and ability to achieve profitability. 
 
The scope of patent protection in the United States and in other countries is uncertain. Pending and future patent applications may not result in issued patents that protect our business, in whole or in part, or that effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive products. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions, obtain, maintain, and enforce our intellectual property rights and, more generally, could affect the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our owned and licensed patents. With respect to both in-licensed and owned intellectual property, we cannot predict whether the patent applications we and our licensors are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient protection from competitors. In addition, the laws of foreign countries may not protect our rights to the same extent or in the same manner as the laws of the United States. 
 
The patent prosecution process is expensive, time-consuming, and complex. We may not be able to file, prosecute, maintain, enforce, or license all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we, or any future partners, collaborators or licensees, may fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities in time to obtain patent protection. Therefore, we may miss potential opportunities to strengthen our patent position. Additionally, although we enter into agreements containing non-disclosure and confidentiality obligations with parties who have access to confidential or patentable aspects of our research and development output, such as our employees, collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, and other third parties, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose such output before a patent application is filed, thereby jeopardizing our ability to seek patent protection. 
 
It is possible that defects of form in the preparation or filing of our patents or patent applications may exist, or may arise in the future, for example with respect to proper priority claims, inventorship, claim scope or patent term adjustments. If we or our partners, collaborators, licensees, or licensors, whether current or future, fail to establish, maintain, or protect such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our partners, collaborators, licensees, or licensors are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance, or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised. If there are material defects in the form, preparation, prosecution, or enforcement of our patents or patent applications, such patents may be invalid and/or unenforceable, and such applications may never result in valid, enforceable patents. Any of these outcomes could impair our ability to prevent competition from third parties, which may have an adverse impact on our business. 
 
Pending patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications. Assuming the other requirements for patentability are met, currently, the first inventor to file a patent application is generally entitled to the patent. However, prior to March 16, 2013, in the United States, the first to invent was entitled to the patent. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing, or in some cases, not at all. Therefore, we cannot be certain that we were the first to make the inventions that will be claimed in our future patents or future patent applications, or that we will be the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. Similarly, we cannot be certain that parties from whom we do or may license or purchase patent rights were the first to make relevant claimed inventions, or were the first to file for patent protection for them. If third parties have filed patent applications on inventions claimed in our patents or applications on or before March 15, 2013, an interference proceeding in the United States can be initiated by such third parties to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. If third parties have filed such applications after 
 61


March 15, 2013, a derivation proceeding in the United States can be initiated by such third parties to determine whether our invention was derived from theirs. 
 
The patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is highly uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions, and has been the subject of much litigation in recent years. No consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology and pharmaceutical patents has emerged to date in the United States or in many foreign jurisdictions. As a result, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability, and commercial value of our patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our technology or product candidates or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and product candidates. 
 
Moreover, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued, and its scope can be reinterpreted after issuance. Even if patent applications we license or will file issue as patents, they may not issue in a form that will provide us with any meaningful protection, prevent competitors or other third parties from competing with us, or otherwise provide us with any competitive advantage. Any patents that we hold or in-license may be challenged by third parties, narrowed, circumvented invalidated, or held unenforceable, in whole or in part, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical product candidates, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our product candidates. Consequently, we do not know whether any of our platform advances and product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by valid and enforceable patents. Our competitors or other third parties may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative technologies or products in a non-infringing manner. Our competitors may also seek approval to market their own products similar to or otherwise competitive with our products. Alternatively, our competitors may seek to market biosimilar versions of any approved products by submitting abbreviated BLAs to the FDA in which they claim that patents owned or licensed by us are invalid, unenforceable, or not infringed. In these circumstances, we may need to defend or assert our patents, or both, including by filing lawsuits alleging patent infringement. In any of these types of proceedings, a court or other agency with jurisdiction may find our patents invalid or unenforceable, or that our competitors are competing in a non-infringing manner. Thus, even if we have valid and enforceable patents, these patents still may not provide protection against competing products or processes sufficient to achieve our business objectives. 
 
Agreements through which we license patent rights may not give us control over patent prosecution or maintenance, so that we may not be able to control which claims or arguments are presented and may not be able to secure, maintain, or successfully enforce necessary or desirable patent protection from those patent rights. We have not had and do not have primary control over patent prosecution and maintenance for certain of the patents and patent applications we license, and therefore cannot guarantee that these patents and applications will be prosecuted in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. We cannot be certain that patent prosecution and maintenance activities by our licensors have been or will be conducted in compliance with applicable laws and regulations or will result in valid and enforceable patents. 
 The issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its inventorship, scope, validity, or enforceability and our patents may be challenged in the courts or patent offices in the United States and abroad. There is no assurance that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found. If such prior art exists, it may be used to invalidate a patent, or may prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. We or our licensors may in the future become subject to a third-party pre-issuance submission of prior art to the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, or to other patent offices around the world. Alternately or additionally, we or our licensors may become involved in opposition, derivation, revocation, re-examination, post-grant and inter partes review, or interference proceedings and other similar proceedings in the United States or elsewhere, challenging our patent rights or the patent rights of others on which we rely to protect our business. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights; limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and products; allow third parties to commercialize our technology or products and compete directly with us, without payment to us; or result in our inability to manufacture or commercialize products without infringing third-party patent rights. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Moreover, we, or one of our licensors, may have to participate in interference proceedings declared by the USPTO to determine priority of invention or in post-grant challenge proceedings, such as oppositions in a foreign patent office, that challenge priority of invention or other features of patentability. Such challenges may result in loss of patent rights, loss of exclusivity, or in patent claims being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable, which could limit our ability to stop others from using or commercializing similar or identical technology and products, or limit the duration of the patent protection of our technology and product candidates. Such proceedings also may result in substantial cost and require significant time from our scientists and management, even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us. Pursuant to the terms of some of our license agreements with third parties, some of our third party licensors have the right, but not the obligation in certain circumstances to control enforcement of our licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the invalidity of these 
 62


patents. Even if we are permitted to pursue such enforcement or defense, we will require the cooperation of our licensors, and cannot guarantee that we would receive it and on what terms. We cannot be certain that our licensors will allocate sufficient resources or prioritize their or our enforcement of such patents or defense of such claims to protect our interests in the licensed patents. If we cannot obtain patent protection, or enforce existing or future patents against third parties, our competitive position and our financial condition could suffer. 
 
Moreover, some of our in-licensed patents and patent applications are, and may in the future be, co-owned with third parties. Additionally, some of our future patent filings may be co-owned with third parties. If we are unable to obtain an exclusive license to any such third-party co-owners’ interests in such patents or patent applications, such co-owners may be able to license their rights to other third parties, including our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. In addition, we or our licensors may need the cooperation of any such co-owners of our owned and in-licensed patents in order to enforce such patents against third parties, and such cooperation may not be provided to us or our licensors. Any of the foregoing could harm our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects. 
 
Furthermore, our owned and in-licensed patents may be subject to a reservation of rights by one or more third parties. For example, the research resulting in certain of our owned and in-licensed patent rights and technology was funded in part by the U.S. government. As a result, the U.S. government has certain rights, including march-in rights, to such patent rights and technology. When new technologies are developed with government funding, the government generally obtains certain rights in any resulting patents, including a non-exclusive license authorizing the government to use the invention. For example, our licensors, including Stanford, have granted the U.S. government a non-exclusive, non-transferable, irrevocable, paid-up license to practice or have practiced for or on behalf of the United States, the inventions described in certain of our in-licensed patents and patent applications, including certain aspects of our in-licensed nuclease-free genome editing technology. If the government decides to exercise these rights, it is not required to engage us as its contractor in connection with doing so. These rights may permit the U.S. government to disclose our confidential information to third parties and to exercise march-in rights to use or allow third parties to use our licensed technology. The U.S. government can exercise its march-in rights if it determines that action is necessary because we fail to achieve practical application of the government-funded technology, because action is necessary to alleviate health or safety needs, to meet requirements of federal regulations, or to give preference to U.S. industry. In addition, our rights in such inventions may be subject to certain requirements to manufacture products embodying such inventions in the United States. Any exercise by the government of any of the foregoing rights could harm our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 
Our rights to develop and commercialize our technology and product candidates are subject, in part, to the terms and conditions of licenses granted to us by others. 
 
We are heavily reliant upon licenses to certain patent rights and proprietary technology from third parties that are important or necessary to the development of our GeneRide platform technology and our sAAVy platform technology. These and other licenses may not provide exclusive rights to use such intellectual property and technology in all relevant fields of use and in all territories in which we may wish to develop or commercialize our technology and products in the future. As a result, we may not be able to prevent competitors from developing and commercializing competitive products in territories included in all of our licenses. For example, pursuant to our license agreements with Stanford and the NIH, the licensors may, under certain circumstances, grant a license to the patents that are the subject of such license agreements to a third party. Such third party would have full rights to the patent rights that are the subject of such licenses, which could impact our competitive position and enable a third party to commercialize products similar to our future product candidates and technology. In addition, our rights to our in-licensed patents and patent applications may be dependent, in part, on inter-institutional or other operating agreements between the joint owners of such in-licensed patents and patent applications. If one or more of such joint owners breaches such inter-institutional or operating agreements, our rights to such in-licensed patents and patent applications may be adversely affected, which could harm our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects. 
 
63



In addition, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, enforcement, and defense of patents and patent applications covering the technology that we license from third parties. For example, pursuant to our intellectual property licenses for certain patent families from Stanford, our licensors retain control of preparation, filing, prosecution, maintenance, and enforcement and defense of their patents and patent applications. Therefore, we cannot be certain that these patents and patent applications will be prepared, filed, prosecuted, maintained, enforced, and defended in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our licensors fail to prosecute, maintain, enforce, and defend such patents, or lose rights to those patents or patent applications, the rights we have licensed may be reduced or eliminated, and our right to develop and commercialize any of our products that are subject of such licensed rights could be adversely affected. 
 
Our licensors may have relied on third party consultants or collaborators or on funds from third parties such that our licensors are not the sole and exclusive owners of the patents we in-licensed. If other third parties have ownership rights to our in-licensed patents, they may be able to license such patents to our competitors, and our competitors could market competing products and technology. This could adversely affect our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects. 
 
If we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose license rights that are important to our business. 
 
We have entered into license agreements with third parties and may need to obtain additional licenses from our existing licensors and others to advance our research or allow commercialization of product candidates and technologies we may develop. 
 
In our license agreements, and we expect in our future agreements, we have the right under specified conditions to bring, or permit our licensor(s) to bring, any actions against any third party for infringing on the patents we have exclusively licensed. Certain of our license agreements also require us to meet development thresholds and other obligations to maintain the license, including establishing a set timeline for developing and commercializing products. Disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including: 
 
 
• | the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the extent to which our technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and us and our partners; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If we fail to comply with our obligations under our license agreements, our licensors may have the right to terminate these license agreements, in which event we might not be able to market any product or technology that is covered by these agreements, or our licensors may convert the license to a non-exclusive license, which could adversely affect the value of the product candidate being developed under the license agreement. Termination of these license agreements or reduction or elimination of our licensed rights may also result in our having to negotiate new or reinstated licenses with less favorable terms. 
 
In spite of our best efforts, our licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our license agreements and might therefore terminate the license agreements, thereby removing our ability to develop and commercialize products and technology covered by these license agreements. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products identical to ours. In addition, we may seek to obtain additional licenses from our licensors and, in connection with obtaining such licenses, we may agree to amend our existing licenses in a manner that may be more favorable to the licensors, including by agreeing to terms that could enable third parties (potentially including our competitors) to receive licenses to a portion of the intellectual property that is subject to our existing licenses. Any of these events could harm our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations and prospects.

Our intellectual property licenses with third parties may be subject to disagreements over contract interpretations, which could narrow the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase our financial or other obligations to our licensors. 
 
The agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology, or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, including the amount, if any, that may become due and payable to our licensors in connection with any sublicense income. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected product candidates. If these events were to occur, they could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
We may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights for current or future product candidates through acquisitions and in-licenses, which could delay or prevent us from commencing clinical trials and ultimately commercializing our current or future product candidates. 
 
Because our programs may require the use of proprietary rights by third parties, the growth of our business likely will depend, in part, on our ability to acquire, in-license, or use these proprietary rights. 
 
Many pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, and academic institutions are competing with us in the fields of gene editing and gene therapy and filing patent applications potentially relevant to our business. In order to avoid infringing these third-party patents, or patents that issue from these third party patent applications, we may find it necessary or prudent to obtain licenses from such third party intellectual property holders. In addition, with respect to any patents we may co-own with third parties, we may require licenses to such co-owners’ interests in such patents. 
 
We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes or other intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our technology and product candidates. The licensing or acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive or necessary. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to their size, capital resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities. In addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment or at all. 
 
We sometimes collaborate with non-profit and academic institutions to accelerate our preclinical research or development under written agreements with these institutions. Typically, these institutions provide us with an option to negotiate a license to any of the institution’s rights in technology resulting from the collaboration. Regardless of such option, we may be unable to negotiate a license within the specified timeframe or under terms that are acceptable to us or we may decide not to execute such option if we believe such license is not necessary to pursue our program. If we are unable or opt not to do so, the institution may offer the intellectual property rights to other parties, potentially blocking our ability to pursue our program. 
 It is possible that we may be unable to successfully obtain rights to required third-party intellectual property rights or maintain the existing intellectual property rights we have at a reasonable cost or on reasonable terms. In that event, we may be required to expend significant time and resources to redesign our technology, product candidates, or methods for manufacturing them or to develop or license replacement technology, all of which may not be feasible on a technical or commercial basis. If we are unable to do so, we may be unable to develop or commercialize the affected product candidate, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects significantly. 
 
We may not be able to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights throughout the world. 
 
65



Filing, prosecuting, and defending patents in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and the laws of foreign countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. In addition, our intellectual property license agreements may not always include worldwide rights. The requirements for patentability may differ in certain countries, particularly in developing countries; thus, even in countries where we do pursue patent protection, there can be no assurance that any patents will issue with claims that cover our products. Consequently, we may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop and market their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we have patent protection or licenses but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States or if our ability to enforce our patents to stop infringing activities is inadequate. These products may compete with our products, and our patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing. 
 
Many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in certain foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to biotechnology products, which could make it difficult for us to stop the infringement of our patents, misappropriation of our other intellectual property rights, or marketing of competing products in violation of our intellectual property and proprietary rights generally. 
 
Many countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patent. If we or any of our licensors is forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to our business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects may be adversely affected. 
 
Agreements through which we license patent rights may not give us sufficient rights to permit us to pursue enforcement of our licensed patents or defense of any claims asserting the invalidity of these patents (or control of enforcement or defense) of such patent rights in all relevant jurisdictions as requirements may vary. 
 
Proceedings to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights in foreign jurisdictions, whether or not successful, could result in substantial costs and divert our efforts, resources and attention from other aspects of our business. Moreover, such proceedings could put our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Furthermore, while we intend to protect our intellectual property rights in major markets for our products, we cannot ensure that we will be able to initiate or maintain similar efforts in all jurisdictions in which we may wish to market our products. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license. 
 
Obtaining and maintaining patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements. 
 
Periodic maintenance fees, renewal fees, annuity fees, and various other government fees on patents and applications will be due to be paid to the USPTO and various government patent agencies outside of the United States over the lifetime of our licensed or owned patents and applications. In certain circumstances, we rely on our licensing partners to pay these fees due to U.S. and non-U.S. patent agencies. The USPTO and various non-U.S. government agencies require compliance with several procedural, documentary, fee payment, and other similar provisions during the patent application process and after a patent has issued. We are also dependent on our licensors to take the necessary action to comply with these requirements with respect to some of our licensed intellectual property. In some cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. There are situations, however, in which non-compliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in a partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, potential competitors might be able to enter the market with similar or identical products or technology, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
66



Patent terms for our product candidates may be inadequate to protect our competitive position for an adequate amount of time. 
 
Patents have a limited lifespan. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive products, including generics or biosimilars. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our intellectual property may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. 
 We expect to seek extensions of patent terms in the United States and, if available, in other countries where we are prosecuting patents. Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of any FDA marketing approval of any product candidates we may develop, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Action of 1984, or the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent extension term of up to five years beyond the normal expiration of the patent, which is limited to the approved indication (or any additional indications approved during the period of extension) as compensation for patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, only one patent may be extended, and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it, or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. However, we may not be granted an extension because of, for example, failing to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, failing to apply within applicable deadlines, failing to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents, or otherwise failing to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the applicable time period or the scope of patent protection afforded could be less than we request. The applicable authorities, including the FDA and the USPTO in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or term of any such extension is less than we request, our competitors may obtain approval of competing products following our patent expiration, and our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects could be materially harmed. Additionally or alternatively, our competitors may be able to take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be the case. If we are not able to obtain and enforce market exclusivity for our technologies or product candidates, development and commercialization of our product candidates may be adversely affected.
 
In our industry, the majority of an innovative product’s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which it has market exclusivity. Market exclusivity is comprised of both patent and other intellectual property protection, as well as regulatory exclusivity.
 
In the United States and some other countries, when market exclusivity expires and generic/biosimilar versions of a product are approved and marketed, there usually are very substantial and rapid declines in the product’s sales. Accordingly, our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patents and other forms of intellectual property rights, including trademarks, trade secrets and in-licenses of intellectual property rights of others, for our product candidates and platform technologies, methods used to manufacture our product candidates, methods of patient stratification and methods for treating patients using our product candidates, as well as our ability to preserve our trade secrets, to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights and to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. Certain research and development activities involved in pharmaceutical and biologics development are exempt from patent infringement in the United States and other jurisdictions, for example, in the United States by the provisions of 35 U.S.C. § 271(e)(1), or the Safe Harbor. However, in the United States and certain other jurisdictions, the Safe Harbor exemption is more limited after the sponsor obtains approval for a BLA. Therefore, the risk that a third party might allege patent infringement may increase as our products approach commercialization. We may not be able to apply for patents or obtain patent protection on certain aspects of our product candidates or our platform in a timely fashion or at all. Our existing issued and granted patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from using our technology or from developing competing products and technology. There is no guarantee that any of our pending patent applications will result in issued or granted patents, that any of our issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid or unenforceable, or that any issued or granted patents will include claims that are sufficiently broad to cover our product candidates, our platform technologies, or any methods relating to them, or to provide meaningful protection from our competitors. 
 
Legal issues related to the patentability of biopharmaceuticals, and methods of their manufacture and use, are complex and uncertain in some countries. In some countries, applicants are not able to protect methods of treating human beings or medical treatment processes. Intellectual property protection varies throughout the world and is subject to change over time. Certain jurisdictions have enacted various rules and laws precluding issuance of patents encompassing any methods a doctor 
 67


may practice on a human being or any other animal to treat a disease or condition. Thus, in some countries and jurisdictions, it may not be possible to patent some of our product candidates at all. In some countries and jurisdictions, only composition claims may be obtained, and only when those compositions are or contain compounds that are new and/or novel. Also, patents issued with composition claims (i.e., covering product candidates) cannot always be enforced to protect methods of using those compositions to treat or diagnose diseases or medical conditions. In such countries or jurisdictions, enforcement of patents to protect our product candidates, or their uses, may be difficult or impossible. Lack of patent protection in such cases may have a materially adverse effect on our business and financial condition.
 
Additionally, we expect that the product candidates we develop will be regulated as biologics in the United States and therefore they may be subject to competition from biosimilars approved through an abbreviated regulatory pathway. The Affordable Care Act includes a subtitle called the BPCIA, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products that are biosimilar to or interchangeable with an FDA-approved reference biological product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years following the date that the reference product was first approved by the FDA. In addition, the approval of a biosimilar product may not be made effective by the FDA until 12 years after the date on which the reference product was first approved.
 
During this 12-year period of exclusivity, another company may still market a competing version of the reference product if the FDA approves a BLA for the competing product containing the sponsor’s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the other company’s product. The BPCIA also created certain exclusivity periods for biosimilars approved as interchangeable products. At this juncture, it is unclear whether products deemed “interchangeable” by the FDA will, in fact, be readily substituted by pharmacies, which are governed by state pharmacy law. Since the passage of the BPCIA, many states have passed laws or amendments to laws, including laws governing pharmacy practices, which are state-regulated, to regulate the use of biosimilars. 
 
We believe that any of our product candidates approved as a biological product under a BLA should qualify for a 12-year period of regulatory exclusivity under the BPCIA. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider our product candidates to be reference products for competing products, potentially creating the opportunity for generic competition sooner than anticipated. Other aspects of the BPCIA, some of which may impact the BPCIA exclusivity provisions, have also been the subject of recent litigation. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any one of our reference products in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.
 
Furthermore, given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates, their manufacture or their use might expire before or shortly after those candidates receive regulatory approval and are commercialized. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours. We expect to seek extensions of patent terms where these are available upon regulatory approval in those countries where we are prosecuting patents. This includes in the United States under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or the BPCIA, which permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. However, the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, and any equivalent regulatory authority in other countries, may not agree with our assessment of whether such extensions are available, and may refuse to grant extensions to our patents, or may grant more limited extensions than we request. If this occurs, our competitors may take advantage of our investment in development and clinical trials by referencing our clinical and preclinical data and launch their product earlier than might otherwise be possible.
 
Changes to the patent law in the United States and other jurisdictions could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products. 
 
As is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological and legal complexity and is therefore costly, time consuming and inherently uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or interpretation of the patent laws in the United States and other jurisdictions could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents. 
 
Patent reform legislation in the United States, including the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, could increase those uncertainties and costs. 
 
68



Assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, prior to March 2013, in the United States, the first to invent the claimed invention was entitled to the patent, while outside the United States, the first to file a patent application was entitled to the patent. After March 2013, under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the America Invents Act, enacted in September 2011, the United States transitioned to a first inventor to file system in which, assuming that other requirements for patentability are met, the first inventor to file a patent application will be entitled to the patent on an invention regardless of whether a third party was the first to invent the claimed invention. The America Invents Act also includes a number of significant changes that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and also may affect patent litigation. These include allowing third party submission of prior art to the USPTO during patent prosecution and additional procedures to challenge the validity of a patent by USPTO administered post-grant proceedings, including post-grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings. The America Invents Act, as well as any future patent reform, and implementation thereof could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents, all of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 
In addition, the patent positions of companies in the development and commercialization of biologics and pharmaceuticals are particularly uncertain. U.S. Supreme Court rulings have narrowed the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances and weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. This combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the validity and enforceability of patents, once obtained. Depending on future actions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts, the USPTO, and the relevant law-making bodies in other countries, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could adversely affect our existing patent portfolio and our ability to protect and enforce our intellectual property in the future. 
 
If we are unable to protect the confidentiality of our trade secrets, the value of our technology could be materially adversely affected, and our business and competitive position would be harmed. 
 
In addition to seeking patents for some of our technology and product candidates, we also rely on trade secrets and confidentiality agreements to protect our unpatented know-how, technology, and other proprietary information and to maintain our competitive position. With respect to our GeneRide and sAAVy platforms, we consider trade secrets and know-how to be an important component of our intellectual property. Trade secrets and know-how can be difficult to protect. In particular, we anticipate that with respect to our GeneRide technology platform, these trade secrets and know-how will over time be disseminated within the industry through independent development, the publication of journal articles describing the methodology, and the movement of personnel from academic to industry scientific positions. 
 
We seek to protect these trade secrets and other proprietary technology, in part, by entering into non-disclosure and confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, such as our employees, collaborators, contract manufacturers, consultants, and other third parties. We also enter into agreements containing confidentiality and invention or patent assignment obligations with our employees and certain consultants. We cannot guarantee that we have entered into such agreements with each party that may have or have had access to our trade secrets or proprietary technology and processes. Despite these efforts, any of these parties may breach the agreements and disclose our proprietary information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for such breaches. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive, and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret. In addition, some courts inside and outside the United States are less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If any of our trade secrets were to be lawfully obtained or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, we would have no right to prevent such third party, or those to whom they communicate such technology or information, from using that technology or information to compete with us. If any of our trade secrets were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor or other third party, our business and competitive position could be materially and adversely harmed. 
 
69



We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive, time consuming, and unsuccessful. 
 
Competitors may infringe our intellectual property, such as our patents or trademarks, or the patents of our licensing partners. To counter infringement or unauthorized use, we may be required to file infringement claims. Additionally or alternatively, we may be required to defend against claims of infringement filed by third parties against us. In addition, our patents or the patents of our licensing partners may in the future become involved in inventorship, priority, or validity disputes. Filing infringement claims and countering and defending against claims regarding infringement or disputes of inventorship, priority, or validity can be expensive and time consuming and divert the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel. 
 
If we or one of our licensors were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge could be an alleged failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness, or non-enablement. Grounds for an unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may in the future raise challenges to the validity of our patent claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, interference proceedings, derivation proceedings, and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions (e.g., opposition proceedings). 
 
The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we or our licensing partners and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a third party were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on our technology or platform, or any product candidates that we may develop. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 
In any patent infringement proceeding, there is a risk that a court may decide that a patent owned or in-licensed by us is invalid or unenforceable, in whole or in part, or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our owned and in-licensed patents do not cover the technology in question. There is also a risk that, even if the validity of such patents is upheld, the court will construe the patent’s claims narrowly or decide that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention at issue on the grounds that our patent claims do not cover the invention. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could put one or more of our owned or in-licensed patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and may curtail or preclude our ability to assert those patents against third parties and exclude third parties from making and selling similar or competitive products. Even if we establish infringement, the court may decide not to grant an injunction against further infringing activity and instead award only monetary damages, which may or may not be an adequate remedy. 
 
Similarly, if we assert trademark infringement claims, a court may determine that the marks we have asserted are invalid or unenforceable, or that the party against whom we have asserted trademark infringement has superior rights to the marks in question. In this case, we could ultimately be forced to cease use of such trademarks. 
 
Even if resolved in our favor, litigation or other legal proceedings relating to intellectual property claims may cause us to incur significant expenses and could distract our personnel from their normal responsibilities. The monetary cost of such litigation and the diversion of the attention of our management and scientific personnel could outweigh any benefit we receive as a result of the proceedings. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of shares of our common stock. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce the resources available for development activities or any future sales, marketing, or distribution activities. Moreover, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient financial or other resources to conduct such litigation or proceedings adequately, which can last for years before they are concluded. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their greater financial resources and more mature and developed intellectual property portfolios. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could adversely affect our ability to compete in the marketplace.

The intellectual property landscape around genetic medicines is highly dynamic, and third parties may initiate legal proceedings alleging that we are infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights, the outcome of which would be uncertain and could adversely affect the success of our business. 
 
Our commercial success depends, in part, upon our ability and the ability of our collaborators to develop, manufacture, market, and sell our product candidates and use our proprietary technologies without infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating the intellectual property and proprietary rights of third parties. However, the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and our research, development and commercialization activities may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate patents or other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by third parties. Moreover, due to the intense research and development that is taking place by several companies, including us and our competitors, in the fields of gene editing and gene therapy, the intellectual property landscape is in flux, and it may remain uncertain for the coming years. There may be significant intellectual property related litigation and proceedings relating to our owned and in-licensed, and other third party, intellectual property, and proprietary rights in the future. We may in the future become party to, or threatened with, adversarial proceedings or litigation regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our technology and any product candidates we may develop, including interference proceedings, post-grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings before the USPTO and similar proceedings in foreign jurisdictions such as oppositions before the European Patent Office. We cannot provide any assurances that third party patents do not exist which might be enforced against our current technology, manufacturing methods, product candidates, or future methods or products resulting in either an injunction prohibiting our manufacture or sales, or, with respect to our sales, an obligation on our part to pay royalties and/or other forms of compensation to third parties, which could be significant. 
 
Third parties may have U.S. and non-U.S. issued patents and pending patent applications relating to products and methods of use for the treatment of the disease indications for which we are developing our product candidates. There may be third-party patents or patent applications with claims to materials, methods of manufacture, or methods for treatment related to the use or manufacture of our technologies and product candidates. If we are not able to obtain or maintain a license on commercially reasonable terms to any third-party patents that cover our product candidates or activities, such third parties could potentially assert infringement claims against us, which could harm our business. 
 
Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending patent applications which may later result in issued patents that our product candidates may be accused of infringing. In addition, third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes upon these patents. Accordingly, third parties may assert infringement claims against us based on existing or future intellectual property rights. Defense of these claims, regardless of their merit, would involve substantial litigation expense and would be a substantial diversion of employee resources from our business. Parties making claims against us may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or administrative proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have material adverse effect on our ability to raise additional funds or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. If any third-party patents or patent applications are found to cover our product candidates or their methods of use, we may not be free to manufacture or market our product candidates as planned without obtaining a license. 
 
Even if we believe third-party intellectual property claims are without merit, there is no assurance that a court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, validity, enforceability, or priority. A court of competent jurisdiction could hold that these third-party patents are valid, enforceable, and infringed, which could materially and adversely affect our ability to commercialize any product candidates we may develop and any other product candidates or technologies covered by the asserted third party patents. 
 
The outcome of intellectual property litigation is subject to uncertainties that cannot be adequately quantified in advance. The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have produced a significant number of patents, and it may not always be clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. 
 
If we were sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our product candidates, products or methods either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent or that the asserted patent claims are invalid or unenforceable, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity is difficult. For example, in the United States, proving invalidity requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of any such U.S. patent claim to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents. There is no assurance that a court of competent jurisdiction would 
 71


invalidate the claims of any such U.S. patent. Even if we are successful in these proceedings, we may incur substantial costs and the time and attention of our management and scientific personnel could be diverted in pursuing these proceedings, which could significantly harm our business and operating results. In addition, we may not have sufficient resources to bring these actions to a successful conclusion. 
 
If we are found to infringe a third party’s intellectual property rights, and we are unsuccessful in demonstrating that such patents are invalid or unenforceable, we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to continue developing, manufacturing, and marketing any product candidates we may develop and our technology. However, we may not be able to obtain any required license on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we were able to obtain a license, it could be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors and other third parties access to the same technologies licensed to us, and it could require us to make substantial licensing and royalty payments. Alternatively or additionally, it could include terms that impede or destroy our ability to compete successfully in the commercial marketplace. We also could be forced, including by court order, to cease developing, manufacturing, and commercializing the infringing technology or product candidates. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys’ fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent or other intellectual property right. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could harm our business. Claims that we have misappropriated the confidential information or trade secrets of third parties could have a similar adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 
We may be subject to claims that we, our employees, consultants, or advisors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their current or former employers or claims asserting ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property. 
 
Many of our employees and our licensors’ employees, consultants, and advisors are currently or were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, some of which may be our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these individuals executed agreements containing proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition obligations, or similar agreements, in connection with such current or previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees, consultants, and advisors do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these individuals have used or disclosed intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such third party. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. 
 
In addition, while it is our policy to require our employees and consultants who may be involved in the conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own. The assignment of intellectual property rights may not be self-executing, or the assignment agreements may be breached, and we may be forced to bring claims against third parties, or defend claims that they may bring against us, to determine the ownership of what we regard as our intellectual property. 
 
If we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims listed above, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we are successful in prosecuting or defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management and scientific personnel. 
 
72



We may be subject to claims challenging the inventorship of our patents and other intellectual property. 
 
We or our licensors may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets, or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor. For example, we or our licensors may have inventorship disputes arise from conflicting obligations of employees, consultants or others who are involved in developing our product candidates. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these and other claims challenging inventorship or our or our licensors’ ownership of our owned or in-licensed patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property. If we or our licensors fail in defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, intellectual property that is important to our product candidates. Even if we are successful in defending against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
Intellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats. 
 
The degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations and may not adequately protect our business or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. For example: 
 
 
• | others may be able to make genetic medicine products that are similar to any product candidates we may develop or utilize similar genetic medicine technology but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we license or may own in the future;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | others may be able to make or utilize genetic medicine technology that functions as a viable alternative to technology we may develop or technology covered by the claims of the patents that we license or may own in the future;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we, or our license partners or current or future collaborators, might not have been the first to make the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we license or may own in the future;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we, or our license partners or current or future collaborators, might not have been the first to file patent applications covering certain of our or their inventions;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our owned or licensed intellectual property rights;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | it is possible that our pending licensed patent applications or those that we may own in the future will not lead to issued patents;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | issued patents that we hold rights to may be held invalid or unenforceable, including as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the patents of others may harm our business; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


• | we may choose not to file a patent in order to maintain certain trade secrets or know-how, and a third party may subsequently file a patent covering such intellectual property.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Should any of these events occur, they could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 
Risks Related to Healthcare Laws and Other Legal Compliance Matters 
 
Healthcare legislative reform measures and constraints on government budgets may harm our business and results of operations. 
 
Third-party payors, whether domestic or foreign, or governmental or private, are developing increasingly sophisticated methods of controlling healthcare costs. In both the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number 
 73


of legislative and regulatory changes to the health care system that could impact our ability to sell any products profitably. Within the United States, for example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the Affordable Care Act, significantly revised coverage and payment for health care services. The Affordable Care Act expanded healthcare coverage through Medicaid expansion and the implementation of the individual health insurance mandate and included a number of provisions relevant to coverage and payment of prescription drugs, such as subjecting biologic products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars; increasing minimum rebates under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extending the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to prescription drugs covered by Medicaid managed care organizations; requiring manufacturers to provide discounts on Medicare Part D brand name prescription drugs sold to Medicare beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so-called “donut hole”); and subjecting manufacturers to new annual fees for certain branded prescription drugs. 
 
We face uncertainties because there have been, and may be additional, federal legislative and administrative efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the Affordable Care Act. For example, tax reform legislation was enacted at the end of 2017 that eliminated the tax penalty for individuals who do not maintain sufficient health insurance coverage beginning in 2019. As another example, legislation enacted in 2018 increased the discount on Medicare Part D drugs purchased by Medicare beneficiaries in the coverage gap in 2019. The Affordable Care Act has also been subject to judicial challenge. For example, in June 2021, the Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act on the grounds that the states and individuals that brought the challenge did not have standing. 
 
Beyond the Affordable Care Act, there have been ongoing reform efforts that affect pricing or payment for drug products or the healthcare industry more generally. For example, President Biden continues to push for reforms that would address the high cost of drugs. In response to an Executive Order from President Biden, the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services recently issued a comprehensive plan for addressing high drug prices that describes a number of legislative approaches and identifies administrative tools to address the high cost of drugs, and Democrats recently included drug pricing reform provisions reflecting elements of the plan in a broader spending package in late 2021, such as capping Medicare Part D patients out-of-pocket costs; establishing penalties for drug prices that increase faster than inflation in Medicare; and authorizing the federal government to negotiate prices on certain, select high cost drugs under Medicare Parts B and D. Additional healthcare reform efforts have sought to address certain issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including an expansion of telehealth coverage under Medicare and accelerated or advanced Medicare payments to healthcare providers. Some of these changes have been and may continue to be subject to legal challenge. For example, revisions to regulations under the federal anti-kickback statute would remove protection for traditional Medicare Part D discounts offered by pharmaceutical manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and health plans. Pursuant to court order, the removal was delayed and recent legislation imposed a moratorium on implementation of the rule until January 1, 2026. Adoption of new healthcare reform legislation at the federal or state level could affect demand for, or pricing of, our products or product candidates if approved for sale. We cannot predict, however, the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or action, or its impact on us, and healthcare reform could increase compliance costs and may adversely affect our future business and financial results. 
 
There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. We cannot predict the initiatives that may be adopted in the future. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of healthcare services to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls may adversely affect: 
 
 
• | the demand for our drug product candidates, if we obtain regulatory approval;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to set a price that we believe is fair for our products;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | our ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the level of taxes that we are required to pay; and
--+----------------------------------------------------


• | the availability of capital.
--+-----------------------------

 In addition, other legislative changes have been adopted that could have an adverse effect upon, and could prevent, our products’ or product candidates’ commercial success. More broadly, the Budget Control Act of 2011, as amended, or the Budget Control Act, includes provisions intended to reduce the federal deficit, including reductions in Medicare payments to providers through 2030 (except May 1, 2020 to March 31, 2022). Any significant spending reductions affecting Medicare, Medicaid or other publicly funded or subsidized health programs, or any significant taxes or fees imposed as part of any 
 74


broader deficit reduction effort or legislative replacement to the Budget Control Act, or otherwise, could have an adverse impact on our anticipated product revenues.
 While we have received orphan drug designation for LB-001 for the treatment of MMA, we may not be able to obtain orphan drug marketing exclusivity for LB-001 or enjoy the benefits associated with orphan drug designation.
 
In April 2019, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for LB-001 for the treatment of MMA, and in June 2021, the European Commission granted orphan drug designation to LB-001 for the treatment of MMA.
 
Under the U.S. Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the United States, orphan drug designation may entitle a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user‑fee waivers. 
 
In the European Union, orphan drug designation is intended to promote the development of drugs that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life‑threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). In addition, designation is granted for drugs intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life‑threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug. In the European Union, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers.
 
Generally, if a drug with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the drug may be entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA or the EMA from approving another marketing application for the same drug and indication for that time period, except in limited circumstances. 
 
Even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate, that exclusivity may not effectively protect the product candidate from competition because different drugs can be approved for the same condition. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve a product candidate for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, a designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Moreover, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition. Orphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. 
 
There is no guarantee that we will be able to enjoy the benefits associated with orphan drug designation. Further, we may seek orphan drug designation for our other product candidates in the future, however, there is no guarantee that we will obtain any such designation or be able to enjoy the benefits thereof.  
 
Although we have received rare pediatric disease designation for LB-001 for the treatment of MMA, we may not be able to obtain such designation for other product candidates or enjoy the benefits associated with this designation.
 Under the Rare Pediatric Disease Priority Review Voucher program, the FDA may award a rare pediatric disease priority voucher to a sponsor upon the approval of a BLA or NDA for a product intended to treat or prevent a rare pediatric disease and that also satisfies other criteria. The voucher can then be used to obtain priority review for a subsequent BLA or NDA for a drug or biologic intended to treat any disease or condition, even if the drug or biologic would not otherwise quality for priority review. The voucher recipient also has the option of selling or transferring the voucher to another sponsor On December 27, 2020, Congress passed the Creating Hope Reauthorization Act, which extended the rare pediatric disease priority review voucher program, and after September 30, 2024, the FDA may only award a voucher for an approved rare pediatric disease product application if the sponsor has rare pediatric disease designation for the drug, and that designation was granted by September 30, 2024. After September 30, 2026, the FDA may not award any rare pediatric disease priority review vouchers.
 75


Although rare pediatric disease designation has been granted for LB-001, there is no guarantee that the FDA will grant any future requests for rare pediatric disease designation for any of our product candidates. Moreover, even if we obtain rare pediatric disease designation, there is no guarantee that we will qualify for a rare pediatric disease priority review voucher upon FDA approval of the IND or BLA for a rare pediatric disease. Rare pediatric disease designation does not lead to faster development or regulatory review of the product or increase the likelihood that it will receive marketing approval.
 
Our current and future business operations will be subject to applicable healthcare regulatory laws, which could expose us to penalties and other sanctions. 
 
We are or may become subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by various government authorities.  These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute our product candidates, if approved. In the United States, biopharmaceutical companies and their products are subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state level, including laws intended to prevent fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws, some of which will apply only if and when we have an approved product, include:  
 
 
• | the federal anti-kickback statute makes it illegal for any person or entity to knowingly and willfully, directly or indirectly, solicit, receive, offer, or pay any remuneration that is in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase, order, lease of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal false claims and false statement laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to, or approval by, federal programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, claims for items or services, including drugs, that are false or fraudulent;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | HIPAA, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements related to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information on certain types of entities, which include many healthcare providers and health plans with which we interact;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the FDCA, which among other things, strictly regulates drug product and medical device marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing such products prior to approval or for unapproved indications and regulates the distribution of samples;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | federal laws, including the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, that require pharmaceutical manufacturers to report certain calculated product prices to the government or provide certain discounts or rebates to government authorities or private entities, often as a condition of reimbursement under government healthcare programs; federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the so-called “federal sunshine” law, which requires pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report certain financial interactions with physicians, non-physician practitioners and teaching hospitals to the federal government for re-disclosure to the public.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Also, many state have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply to claims reimbursed by private payors as well as government programs regardless of reimbursement. Additionally, we may be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the federal government’s and/or pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines, impose specific restrictions on interactions between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare providers or require pharmaceutical companies to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures. Other state laws may require pharmaceutical companies to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information and state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives. Finally, there are state laws governing the privacy and security of health information, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA. Many of these laws and regulations also contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation.  
 
Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. Given the breadth of the laws and regulations, limited guidance for certain laws and 
 76


regulations and evolving government interpretations of the laws and regulations, governmental authorities may possibly conclude that our business practices may not comply with such laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Further, defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired. 
 
There are also similar healthcare laws and regulations in the European Union and other jurisdictions, including reporting requirements detailing interactions with and payments to healthcare providers. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order, or use of medicinal products is prohibited in the European Union. Infringement of these laws could result in substantial fines and imprisonment. Payments made to physicians in certain European Union Member States must be publicly disclosed. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct applicable in the European Union Member States. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment. 
 
We are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and we may become exposed to liability and substantial expenses in connection with environmental compliance or remediation activities. 
 
We and any CMOs and other third party vendors we engage are subject to numerous federal, state, and local environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, and permitting requirements, including those governing laboratory procedures; the generation, handling, use, storage, treatment, and disposal of hazardous and regulated materials and wastes; the emission and discharge of hazardous materials into the ground, air, and water; and employee health and safety. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological and radioactive materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. Under certain environmental laws, we could be held responsible for costs relating to any contamination at our current or past facilities and at third-party facilities. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties. 
 
Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental laws and regulations may impair our research and product development efforts. In addition, we cannot entirely eliminate the risk of accidental injury or contamination from these materials or wastes. Although we maintain workers’ compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not carry specific biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage, and our property, casualty, and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination. Accordingly, in the event of contamination or injury, we could be held liable for damages or be penalized with fines in an amount exceeding our resources, and our clinical trials or regulatory approvals could be suspended, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 
In addition, we may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future environmental, health, and safety laws, regulations, and permitting requirements. These current or future laws, regulations, and permitting requirements may impair our research, development, or production efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations, and permitting requirements also may result in substantial fines, penalties, or other sanctions or business disruption, which could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 
Any third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers we engage will also be subject to these and other environmental, health, and safety laws and regulations. Liabilities they incur pursuant to these laws and regulations could result in significant costs or an interruption in operations, which could harm our reputation, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. 
 
77



We are subject to stringent privacy laws, information security laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations related to data privacy and security and changes in such laws, regulations, policies and contractual obligations could adversely affect our business.
 
We are subject to data privacy and protection laws and regulations that apply to the collection, transmission, storage and use of personally-identifying information, which among other things, impose certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of personal information, including comprehensive regulatory systems in the United States and the EU. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve in jurisdictions worldwide, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. Failure to comply with any of these laws and regulations could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for damages by affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
 
There are numerous U.S. federal and state laws and regulations related to the privacy and security of personal information. For example, the HIPAA and its implementing regulations establish privacy and security standards that limit the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information, or protected health information, and require the implementation of administrative, physical and technological safeguards to protect the privacy of protected health information and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of electronic protected health information. While we have determined that we are neither a “covered entity” nor a “business associate” directly subject to HIPAA, many of the U.S. health care providers, including U.S. clinical trial sites, with which we interact are subject to HIPAA, and we have assumed contractual obligations related to protecting the privacy of personal information. Determining whether protected health information has been handled in compliance with applicable privacy standards and our contractual obligations can be complex and may be subject to changing interpretation. If we are unable to properly protect the privacy and security of protected health information, we could be found to have breached our contracts and we could face civil and criminal penalties. In addition, our operations have been affected by the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which took effect on January 1, 2020. The CCPA gives California consumers (defined to include all California residents) certain rights, including the right to ask covered companies to disclose the types of personal information collected, the categories of sources from which such information was collected, the business purpose for collecting or selling the consumer’s personal information, the categories of third parties with whom a covered company shares personal information, and specific pieces of information collected by a covered company. The CCPA imposes several obligations on covered companies to provide notice to California consumers regarding their data processing activities. The CCPA also gives California consumers the right to ask covered companies to delete a consumer’s personal information and it places limitations on a covered company’s ability to sell personal information, including providing consumers a right to opt out of sales of their personal information. On November 3, 2020, California voters passed a ballot initiative approving the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which will significantly expand the CCPA to incorporate additional provisions, including a requirement that the use, retention, and sharing of personal information of California residents be reasonably necessary and proportionate to the purposes of collection or processing, granting additional protections for sensitive personal information, and requiring greater disclosures related to notice to residents regarding retention of information.  The CPRA will also expand personal information rights of California residents, including creating a right to opt out of sharing of personal information with third parties for advertising, expanding the lookback period for the right to know about personal information held by businesses, and expanding the right to erasure for information held by third parties.  Most CPRA provisions will take effect on January 1, 2023, though the obligations will apply to any personal information collected after January 1, 2022.  Other states are also enacting comprehensive privacy legislation, including Virginia and Colorado, both of which passed expansive privacy laws in 2021 that take effect in 2023.
 
In addition, we may be subject to privacy and security laws in the various jurisdictions outside of the United States in which we operate, obtain or store personally identifiable information. The legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve, and there has been an increasing focus on privacy and data protection issues with the potential to affect our business. For example, the processing of personal data in the EEA is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, which took effect in May 2018. The GDPR increases obligations with respect to clinical trials conducted in the EEA, such as in relation to the provision of fair processing notices, responding to data subjects who exercise their rights and reporting certain data breaches to regulators and affected individuals. The GDPR also requires us to enter certain contractual arrangements with third parties that process GDPR-covered personal data on our behalf. The GDPR also increases the scrutiny applied to transfers of personal data from the EEA (including from clinical trial sites in the EEA) to countries that are considered by the European Commission to lack an adequate level of data protection, such as the United States. The July 2020 invalidation by the Court of Justice of the European Union of the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield framework, one of the mechanisms used to legitimize the transfer of personal data from the EEA to the United States, has led to increased scrutiny on data transfers from the EEA to the United States generally and may increase our costs of compliance with data privacy legislation. If our or our partners’ or service providers’ privacy or data security measures fail to comply with the 
 78


GDPR requirements, we may be subject to litigation, regulatory investigations, enforcement notices requiring us to change the way we use personal data and/or fines of up to 20 million Euros or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, as well as claims by affected individuals, negative publicity, reputational harm and a potential loss of business and goodwill.
 
Data privacy remains an evolving landscape at both the domestic and international level, with new regulations coming into effect and continued legal challenges, and our ongoing efforts to comply with evolving laws and regulations may be costly and require ongoing modifications to our policies, procedures and systems. Our efforts to comply may also be unsuccessful. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our practices. Failure to comply with laws regarding data protection would expose us to risk of enforcement actions taken by data protection authorities in the EU and elsewhere and carries with it the potential for significant penalties if we are found to be non-compliant as well as private lawsuits by affected data subjects. Similarly, failure to comply with federal and state laws in the United States regarding privacy and security of personal information could expose us to penalties under such laws and private lawsuits brought by data subjects. Any such failure to comply with data protection and privacy laws could result in government-imposed fines or orders requiring that we change our practices, claims for damages by data subjects, regulatory investigations and enforcement action, litigation and significant costs for remediation, any of which could adversely affect our business. Even if we are not determined to have violated these laws, government investigations into these issues typically require the expenditure of significant resources and generate negative publicity, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.
 
Risks Related to Employee Matters and Managing Growth 
 
Our future success depends on our ability to retain our key personnel and to attract, retain and motivate qualified personnel. 
 
Our industry has experienced a high rate of turnover of management personnel in recent years. We are highly dependent on the development, regulatory, commercialization and business development expertise of Frederic Chereau, our President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as the other members of our management, scientific, clinical, technical and regulatory teams. Although we have formal employment agreements with our executive officers, these agreements do not prevent them from terminating their employment with us at any time. We do not maintain “key person” insurance for any of our executives or other employees. The loss of the services of one or more of our executive officers or key employees could impede the achievement of our research, development and commercialization objectives, impact our ability to coordinate responsibilities and tasks, impact our corporate culture, and impact the retention of historical knowledge. Further, our Board of Directors and management succession planning efforts may not be effective, which could adversely impact our business. 
 
If we lose one or more of our executive officers or key employees, our ability to implement our business strategy successfully could be seriously harmed. Furthermore, replacing executive officers and key employees may be difficult and may take an extended period of time because of the limited number of individuals in our industry with the breadth of skills and experience required to develop, gain regulatory approval of and commercialize product candidates successfully. Competition to hire from this limited pool is intense, and we may be unable to hire, train, retain or motivate these additional key personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for similar personnel, as well as from universities and research institutions. In addition, we rely on consultants and advisors, including scientific, technical, clinical and regulatory advisors, to assist us in formulating our research and development and commercialization strategy. Our consultants and advisors may be engaged by entities other than us and may have commitments under consulting or advisory contracts with other entities that may limit their availability to us. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates will be limited. 
 
79



We may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations. 
 
We have experienced significant growth in the past year. Our management has diverted, and may need to divert, a disproportionate amount of its attention away from our day-to-day activities to devote time to managing our growth. To manage any growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources, we may not be able to effectively manage any expansion of our operations or train the additional qualified personnel. Our inability to effectively manage the expansion of our operations may result in weaknesses in our infrastructure, give rise to operational mistakes, loss of business opportunities, loss of employees and reduced productivity among remaining employees. Managing our growth could require significant capital expenditures and may divert financial resources from other projects, such as the development of additional product candidates. If our management is unable to effectively manage our growth, our expenses may increase more than expected, our potential ability to generate revenue could be reduced and we may not be able to implement our business strategy. 
 
We may engage in mergers or acquisitions that could disrupt our business, cause dilution to our stockholders or reduce our financial resources. 
 
In the future, we may enter into mergers or acquisition transactions with respect to other businesses, products or technologies. If we do identify suitable candidates, we may not be able to complete such transactions on favorable terms, or at all. Any transactions we execute may not strengthen our competitive position, and these transactions may be viewed negatively by customers or investors. We may decide to incur debt in connection with a transaction or issue our common stock or other equity securities in connection with a transaction, which would reduce the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders. We could incur losses resulting from undiscovered liabilities of any business, product or technology that is the subject of a transaction that are not covered by any indemnification we may obtain. In addition, we may not be able to successfully integrate personnel, technologies and operations into our existing business in an effective, timely and nondisruptive manner following the execution of a transaction. Merger and acquisition transactions may also divert management attention from day-to-day responsibilities, increase our expenses and reduce our cash available for operations and other uses. We cannot predict the number, timing or size of future mergers or acquisitions or the effect that any such transactions might have on our operating results. 
 Product liability lawsuits against us could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and could limit commercialization of any product candidates that we may develop. 
 
We face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in clinical trials and may face an even greater risk if we commercialize any products that we may develop. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in: 
 
 
• | decreased demand for any product candidates that we may develop;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | loss of revenue;
--+-----------------


• | substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | significant time and costs to defend the related litigation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | withdrawal of clinical trial participants;
--+-------------------------------------------


• | the inability to commercialize any product candidates that we may develop; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injury to our reputation and significant negative media attention.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all liabilities that we may incur. We anticipate that we will need to increase our insurance coverage each time we commence a clinical trial and if we successfully commercialize any product candidate. Insurance coverage is increasingly expensive. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise.

We or the third parties upon whom we depend may be adversely affected by natural disasters or geo-political events and our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from a serious disaster. 
 
Natural disasters and geo-political events (such as war or terrorism) could severely disrupt our operations or the operations of third parties upon whom we depend. If any such event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as our manufacturing facilities, or that otherwise disrupted operations, or similarly affected third parties whom we rely on, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may prove inadequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of the limited nature of our disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which could harm our business. 
 
Risks Related to Commercialization 
 
We face significant competition in an environment of rapid technological change, and there is a possibility that our competitors may achieve regulatory approval before us or develop therapies that are safer or more advanced or effective than ours, which may harm our financial condition and our ability to successfully market or commercialize any product candidates we may develop. 
 
The development and commercialization of new genetic medicine products is highly competitive. Moreover, the gene editing field is characterized by rapidly changing technologies, significant competition and a strong emphasis on intellectual property. We will face competition with respect to any product candidates that we may seek to develop or commercialize in the future from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies worldwide. Potential competitors also include academic institutions, government agencies, and other public and private research organizations that conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for research, development, manufacturing and commercialization. 
 
Our focus is on the development of genetic medicines using our GeneRide and sAAVy technologies. If our current programs are approved for the indications we are pursuing or contemplate we may pursue, they may compete with other products currently under development, including gene editing and gene therapy products. There are a number of companies developing nuclease-based gene editing technologies using CRISPR/Cas9, TALENs, meganucleases, Mega-TALs and ZFNs, including bluebird bio, Caribou Biosciences, CRISPR Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, Intellia Therapeutics, Sangamo Therapeutics, Precision BioSciences and Graphite Bio. We may also compete with companies developing gene therapy products, including Homology Medicines, Astellas Pharma, Pfizer, bluebird bio, uniQure and Generation Bio. There are also companies pursuing base editing technologies, including Beam Therapeutics. Any products we may develop could also face competition from other products approved to treat the same disease based on other types of therapies, such as small molecule, antibody or protein therapies. There are several companies developing competing products that target MMA, the indication for which we are developing LB-001. These companies include Moderna Therapeutics with an mRNA-based approach, Selecta Biosciences using an AAV gene therapy, and HemoShear Therapeutics using a small molecule. If any of our competitors obtains regulatory approval for a treatment for MMA, it could negatively affect our ability to successfully commercialize LB-001, if approved.
 
There are several companies developing competing products that target CN, the indication for which we conducted research activities for LB-301, including Genethon, Selecta Biosciences and the Institute for Life Changing Medicines. If any of our competitors obtain regulatory approval for a treatment for CN, it could negatively affect our ability to successfully commercialize LB-301.
 
Additionally, other companies may have or be developing competing products that target HT1, the indication for which we are developing LB-401. If any of our competitors obtain regulatory approval for a treatment for HT1, it could negatively affect our ability to successfully commercialize LB-401. Many of our current or potential competitors, either alone or with their collaboration partners, have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and gene therapy industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer or more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient, or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products 
 81


more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential product candidates uneconomic or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing any product candidates we may develop against competitors. 
 
In addition, as a result of the expiration or successful challenge of our patent rights, we could face more litigation with respect to the validity and/or scope of patents relating to our competitors’ products. The availability of our competitors’ products could limit the demand, and the price we are able to charge, for any products that we may develop and commercialize. 
 
The successful commercialization of our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which third-party payors, including government healthcare programs as well as private health insurance, establish favorable coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved. 
 
The availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors, including governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, as well as private health insurance, will likely be essential for most patients to be able to afford our product candidates, assuming regulatory approval. Our initial target patient populations are relatively small and costs associated with the development and commercialization of our genomic medicine product candidates are substantial. We therefore expect the cost of a single administration of our products to be significant if and when approved. Our ability to achieve acceptable levels of coverage and reimbursement for such products and services required to administer such products by third-party payors will likely have a significant impact on our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere will be available for our product candidates or any product that we may develop, and any reimbursement that may become available may be decreased or eliminated in the future. 
 
There is significant uncertainty related to third party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly-approved products. The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, and reimbursement for new medicines vary widely from country to country. Obtaining coverage and reimbursement for a product from third-party payors is a time-consuming and costly process that could require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our product candidates to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. We may not be able to provide data sufficient to gain acceptance with respect to coverage and reimbursement. We therefore cannot predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates. Even if we obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement for our product candidates with respect to a particular third party payor, there is no certainty that coverage will be maintained or reimbursement rates will not change.
 Within the United States, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for products exists among third-party payors. Coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor and coverage and reimbursement by one payor does not guarantee coverage and reimbursement by another payor. Third-party payors increasingly are limiting coverage and utilization of pharmaceutical products and challenging prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services. Assuming we obtain coverage for a product by a third-party payor, the third-party payor may implement utilization management controls, such as requiring pre-approval before our product will be covered for a particular patient, which may limit access to our product. In addition, the reimbursement rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Net prices for our products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates that we are required to provide to certain government healthcare programs or private payors or by discounts we negotiate with third party payors. In addition, given the novel nature of our product candidates, we may need to develop new reimbursement models in order to realize adequate value. Even if we are able to develop such models, third-party payors may not be able or willing to adopt such new models, and patients may be unable to afford that portion of the cost that such models may require them to bear. If coverage is limited, access to our products is subject to utilization management controls or reimbursement is inadequate, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates, and may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on our product candidates. 
 
Outside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe and other countries have and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medical products, but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our product candidates may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially-reasonable revenue and profits. Furthermore, some countries require approval of the sale price of a medicine before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review 
 82


period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, we might obtain marketing approval for a medicine in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the medicine, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the medicine in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if any product candidates we may develop obtain marketing approval. 
 
If the market opportunities for any product candidates we may develop are smaller than we believe they are, our revenues, if any, may be adversely affected, and our business may suffer. Because the target patient populations for many of the product candidates we may develop are small, we must be able to successfully identify patients and achieve a significant market share to achieve and maintain profitability and growth. 
 
We currently focus our research and product development on treatments for rare pediatric diseases. Our projections of both the number of people who have these diseases, as well as the subset of people with these diseases who have the potential to benefit from treatment with product candidates we may develop, are based on estimates. These estimates may prove to be incorrect and new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients in the United States, Europe and elsewhere may turn out to be lower than expected, and patients may not be amenable to treatment with our products, or may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, all of which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. 
 
If we obtain approval to commercialize any products outside of the United States, a variety of risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect our business. 
 
If LB-001 or any other product candidate we develop is approved for commercialization, it may be marketed in certain jurisdictions outside the United States. We expect that we will be subject to additional risks related to international pharmaceutical operations, including: 
 
 
• | economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular non-U.S. economies and markets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | different regulatory requirements for drug and biologic approvals and rules governing drug and biologic commercialization in foreign countries;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduced protection for intellectual property rights;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | difficulties in compliance with non-U.S. laws and regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in non-U.S. regulations and customs, tariffs and trade barriers;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates and currency controls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in a specific country’s or region’s political or economic environment;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive actions by U.S. or non-U.S. governments;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | negative consequences from changes in tax laws;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | foreign reimbursement, pricing and insurance regimes;
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations, including differing labor relations;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential noncompliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, or the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 and similar anti-bribery and anticorruption laws in other jurisdictions;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | business interruptions resulting from geo-political events, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including floods and fires.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
83



We have no prior experience in these areas. In addition, there are complex regulatory, tax, labor and other legal requirements imposed by both the European Union, many of the individual countries in Europe and other countries outside of Europe with which we will need to comply. Many U.S.-based biotechnology companies have found the process of marketing their own products outside the United States to be very challenging. 
 
We are subject to U.S. and certain foreign export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal standards could impair our ability to compete in domestic and international markets. We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations, which can harm our business. 
 
We are subject to export control and import laws and regulations, including the U.S. Export Administration Regulations, U.S. Customs regulations, various economic and trade sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls, the FCPA, the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. §201, the U.S. Travel Act, the USA PATRIOT Act, and other state and national anti-bribery and anti-money laundering laws in the countries in which we conduct activities. Anti-corruption laws are interpreted broadly and prohibit companies and their employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to recipients in the public or private sector. We may engage third parties to sell our products sell our products outside the United States, to conduct clinical trials, and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated hospitals, universities, and other organizations. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors, and other collaborators, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. Any violations of the laws and regulations described above may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences. 
 
Risks Related to Our Common Stock and Indebtedness
 
The market price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock. 
 
Our stock price may be volatile. The stock market in general, and the market for pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to changes in the operating performance of companies whose stock is experiencing those price and volume limitations. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual performance. As a result of this volatility, our stockholders may not be able to sell their shares of common stock at or above the price at which they purchased them. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including: 

• | results of or developments with respect to our preclinical studies,clinical trials or regulatory approvals or those with respect to product candidates of our competitors, or announcements about new research programs or product candidates of ours or our competitors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the success of competitive products or technologies;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | actual or expected changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developments related to our collaborations;
--+--------------------------------------------


• | regulatory actions with respect to any product candidate we may develop or our competitors’ products and product candidates;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | regulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | development of new product candidates that may address our markets and make our product candidates less attractive;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | failure or discontinuation of any of our product development and research programs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | changes in physician, hospital or healthcare provider practices that may make our product candidates less useful;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | announcements by us, our partners or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 84


 
• | developments or disputes concerning patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the recruitment or departure of key personnel;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | the level of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | failure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community or that we provide to the public;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the results of our efforts to discover, develop, acquire or in-license additional product candidates or products;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | results from preclinical studies, clinical trials or regulatory approvals of product candidates of our competitors, or announcements about new research programs or product candidates of our competitors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | actual or expected changes in estimates as to financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts; variations in our financial results, development timelines, or recommendations by securities analysts, or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | announcement or expectation of additional financing efforts;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | sales of our common stock by us, our insiders, or other stockholders;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | limited public float;
--+----------------------


• | expiration of market stand-off or lock-up agreement;
--+-----------------------------------------------------


• | changes in the structure of healthcare payment systems;
--+--------------------------------------------------------


• | market conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


• | developments or changing views regarding the use of genomic medicines, including those that involve genome editing;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | general economic, industry and market conditions; and
--+------------------------------------------------------


• | the other factors described in this “Risk Factors” section and others beyond our control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If we cannot comply with Nasdaq’s continued listing standards, our common stock could be delisted, which would harm our business, the trading price of our common stock, our ability to raise additional capital and the liquidity of the market for our common stock.
 
Our common stock is currently listed on The Nasdaq Global Market. To maintain the listing of our common stock on The Nasdaq Global Market, we are required to meet certain listing requirements, including related to the price of our common stock. Our common stock is currently closing below the minimum $1.00 bid price. If the bid price for our common stock continues to close below the minimum $1.00 bid price per share, we may risk not being in compliance with Nasdaq’s requirements for continued listing.  In such circumstances, to regain compliance, the bid price for our common stock would need to close at $1.00 per share or more for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days, among other requirements. If we are unable to continue to meet Nasdaq’s listing maintenance standards for any reason, our common stock could be delisted from The Nasdaq Global Market. To regain compliance, we would need to consider alternatives to resolve any listing deficiency, such as, subject to approval of our Board of Directors and stockholders, implementing a reverse stock split. However, there can be no assurance that a reverse stock split would be approved or would result in a sustained higher stock price that would allow us to meet the Nasdaq stock price listing requirements. If our common stock were delisted, we could seek to list our common stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market or trade our common stock on the OTC Markets. Listing on such other market or exchange could reduce the liquidity of our common stock and impede our ability to raise capital.
 
The terms of our Loan and Security Agreement place restrictions on our operating and financial flexibility.
 
In July 2019, we entered into the Loan Agreement, under which term loans in an aggregate principal amount of $20.0 million were made available to us in two tranches, subject to certain terms and conditions. As of December 31, 2021, we had drawn down the $10.0 million first tranche. In the second quarter of 2021, we met the conditions to initiate drawdown of the $10.0 million second tranche but did not exercise our right to do so and the option to draw down the second tranche of the Term Loans expired. See Note 6 to our financial statements found elsewhere in this annual report on Form 10-K. The Loan Agreement contains representations and warranties, affirmative and negative covenants applicable to us and our subsidiaries and events of default, as more fully described in the Loan Agreement. The affirmative covenants include, among others, 
 85


covenants requiring us and our subsidiaries to maintain our legal existence and material governmental approvals, deliver certain financial reports, maintain insurance coverage and maintain certain cash balances in controlled accounts. The negative covenants include, among others, restrictions on dispositions, changes in business, management, ownership or business locations, mergers or acquisitions, indebtedness, encumbrances, maintenance of collateral accounts, distributions, investments, transactions with affiliates and subordinated debt.
 
The Loan Agreement also includes events of default, the occurrence and continuation of which provide Oxford Finance LLC, as collateral agent, with the right to exercise remedies against us and the collateral securing the loans under the Loan Agreement, including foreclosure against our properties securing the Loan Agreement, including our cash, potentially requiring us to renegotiate our agreement on terms less favorable to us or to immediately cease operations. These events of default include, among other things, the nonpayment of principal or interest, violations of covenants, material adverse changes, attachment, levy, restraint on business, cross-defaults on material indebtedness, bankruptcy, material judgments, misrepresentations, subordinated debt, governmental approvals, lien priority and delisting.
 
Further, if we are liquidated, the Lenders’ right to repayment would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock to receive any proceeds from the liquidation. The lenders could declare a default upon the occurrence of any event that they interpret as a material adverse change as defined under the Loan Agreement, thereby requiring us to repay the loan immediately or to attempt to reverse the declaration of default through negotiation or litigation. Any declaration by the lenders of an event of default could significantly harm our business and prospects and could cause the price of our common stock to decline.
 
Our principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and are able to exercise significant influence over matters subject to stockholder approval. 
 
As of December 31, 2021, we believe our executive officers and directors, combined with our stockholders who owned more than 5% of our common stock, together with their respective affiliates, beneficially owned a significant percentage of our outstanding common stock, including shares subject to outstanding options that are exercisable within 60 days after such date. Accordingly, these stockholders are able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of our Board of Directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could have the effect of entrenching our management or Board of Directors, delaying or preventing a change in control or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have a material and adverse effect on the fair market value of our common stock. 
 
We are an “emerging growth company” and a “smaller reporting company,” and the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies and smaller reporting companies may make our common stock less attractive to investors. 
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and may remain an emerging growth company until December 31, 2023. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and plan to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. However, if certain events occur prior to December 31, 2023, including if we become a “large accelerated filer,” our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion or we issue more than $1.0 billion of non-convertible debt in any three-year period, we will cease to be an emerging growth company prior to December 31, 2023. For so long as we remain an emerging growth company, we are permitted and intend to rely on exemptions from certain disclosure requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. These exemptions include: 
 
 
• | not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or SOX Section 404, in the assessment of our internal control over financial reporting;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | not being required to comply with any requirement that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board regarding mandatory audit firm rotation or a supplement to the auditor’s report providing additional information about the audit and the financial statements;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


• | exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and golden parachute payments.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
86



We cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive if we rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be reduced or more volatile. Under the JOBS Act, emerging growth companies can also delay adopting new or revised accounting standards until such time as those standards apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected to “opt out” of this exemption from new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies. As a result, changes in rules of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles or their interpretation, the adoption of new guidance, or the application of existing guidance to changes in our business could significantly affect our financial position and results of operations. 
 
Further, even after we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still qualify as a “smaller reporting company,” which would allow us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements. In addition, if we are a smaller reporting company, we would not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or Section 404. These exemptions and reduced disclosures in our SEC filings due to our status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze our results of operations and financial prospects. Investors may find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock prices may be more volatile.
 
Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and restated by-laws and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. 
 
Provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated by-laws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock, thereby depressing the market price of our common stock. In addition, because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board of Directors. Among other things, our restated certificate of incorporation and our restated by-laws include provisions that: 
 
 
• | authorize “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by our Board of Directors without stockholder approval and may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | create a classified Board of Directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | specify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our Board of Directors;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | prohibit stockholder action by written consent;
--+------------------------------------------------


• | establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder approvals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our Board of Directors;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide that vacancies on our Board of Directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide that our directors may be removed only for cause;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


• | specify that no stockholder is permitted to cumulate votes at any election of directors;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | expressly authorized our Board of Directors to modify, alter or repeal our amended and restated by-laws; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | require supermajority votes of the holders of our common stock to amend specified provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated by-laws.

Moreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.

The existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that our stockholders could receive a premium for their common stock in an acquisition. 
 
Our ability to use net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be subject to certain limitations.
 
We have incurred substantial losses during our history and anticipate that we will continue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future; thus, we do not know whether or when we will generate the U.S. taxable income necessary to utilize our NOLs. To the extent that we continue to generate taxable losses, unused losses will carry forward to offset a portion of future taxable income, if any, until such unused losses expire, if ever. Under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an “ownership change”, generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point change (by value) in its equity ownership by certain stockholders over a three-year period, the corporation’s ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research and development tax credits) to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of subsequent shifts in our stock ownership (some of which shifts are outside our control). As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs to offset such taxable income could be subject to limitations. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply. As a result, even if we achieve profitability, we may be unable to use a material portion of our NOLs and other tax attributes.
 
Because we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, capital appreciation, if any, would be the sole source of gain for our stockholders. 
 
We have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, any future credit facility may contain terms prohibiting or limiting the amount of dividends that may be declared or paid on our common stock. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock would be the sole source of gain on an investment in our common stock for the foreseeable future. 
 
Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws designate the state or federal courts in the State of Delaware and the federal district courts of the United States, respectively, as the exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders’ ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees. 
 
Our certificate of incorporation provides that, unless our Board of Directors otherwise determines, the state courts in the State of Delaware or, if no state court located within the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal court for the District of Delaware, will be the sole and exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors or officers to our company or our stockholders, any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or our certificate of incorporation or by-laws, or any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors or officers governed by the internal affairs doctrine. Additionally, our bylaws provide that the federal district courts of the United States will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. These exclusive forum provisions may limit the ability of our stockholders to bring a claim in a judicial forum that such stockholders find favorable for disputes with us or our directors or officers, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors and officers. 
 
We could be subject to securities class action litigation. 
 
In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biopharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we face such litigation, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management’s attention and resources, which could harm our business.
