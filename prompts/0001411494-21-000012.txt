ITEM 1.    BUSINESS 
Overview
Founded in 1990, Apollo is a leading global alternative investment manager. We are a contrarian, value-oriented investment manager in credit, private equity and real assets, with significant distressed investment expertise. We have a flexible mandate in many of the funds we manage which enables our funds to invest opportunistically across a company’s capital structure. We raise, invest and manage funds on behalf of some of the world’s most prominent pension, endowment and sovereign wealth funds, as well as other institutional and individual investors. As of December 31, 2020, we had total AUM of $455.5 billion, including $328.6 billion in credit, $80.7 billion in private equity and $46.2 billion in real assets. We have consistently produced attractive long-term investment returns in our traditional private equity funds, generating a 39% gross IRR and a 24% net IRR on a compound annual basis from inception through December 31, 2020.
Apollo is led by our Managing Partners, Leon Black, Joshua Harris and Marc Rowan, who have worked together for more than 34 years and lead a team of 1,729 employees, including 557 investment professionals, as of December 31, 2020. This team possesses a broad range of transaction, financial, managerial and investment skills. We have offices in New York, Los Angeles, San Diego, Houston, Bethesda, London, Frankfurt, Madrid, Luxembourg, Mumbai, Delhi, Singapore, Hong Kong, Shanghai and Tokyo, among other locations throughout the world. We operate our credit, private equity and real assets investment management businesses in a highly integrated manner, which we believe distinguishes us from other alternative investment managers. Our investment professionals frequently collaborate across disciplines. We believe that this collaboration, including market insight, management, banking and consultant contacts, and investment opportunities, enables the funds we manage to more successfully invest across a company’s capital structure. This platform and the depth and experience of our investment team have enabled us to deliver strong long-term investment performance for our funds throughout a range of economic cycles.
Our objective is to achieve superior long-term risk-adjusted returns for our fund investors. The majority of the investment funds we manage are designed to invest capital over periods of seven or more years from inception, thereby allowing us to generate attractive long-term returns throughout economic cycles. Our investment approach is value-oriented, focusing on nine core industries in which we have considerable knowledge and experience, and emphasizing downside protection and the preservation of capital. Our core industry sectors include chemicals, manufacturing and industrial, natural resources, consumer and retail, consumer services, business services, financial services, leisure, and media and telecom and technology. Our contrarian investment management approach is reflected in a number of ways, including:
•our willingness to pursue investments in industries that our competitors typically avoid;
•the often complex structures employed in some of the investments of our funds, including our willingness to pursue difficult corporate carve-out transactions;
•our experience investing during periods of uncertainty or distress in the economy or financial markets when many of our competitors simply reduce their investment activity;
•our orientation towards sole sponsored transactions when other firms have opted to partner with others; and
•our willingness to undertake transactions that have substantial business, regulatory or legal complexity.
We have applied this investment philosophy to identify what we believe are attractive investment opportunities, deploy capital across the balance sheet of industry leading, or “franchise,” businesses and create value throughout economic cycles.
We rely on our deep industry, credit and financial structuring experience, coupled with our strengths as a value-oriented, distressed investment manager, to deploy significant amounts of new capital within challenging economic environments. Our approach towards investing in distressed situations often requires our funds to purchase particular debt securities as prices are declining, since this allows us both to reduce our funds’ average cost and accumulate sizable positions which may enhance our ability to influence any restructuring plans and maximize the value of our funds’ distressed investments. As a result, our investment approach may produce negative short-term unrealized returns in certain of the funds we manage. However, we concentrate on generating attractive, long-term, risk-adjusted realized returns for our fund investors, and we therefore do not overly depend on short-term results and quarterly fluctuations in the unrealized fair value of the holdings in our funds.
In addition to deploying capital in new investments, we seek to enhance value in the investment portfolios of the funds we manage. We have relied on our transaction, restructuring and credit experience to work proactively with our private equity funds’ portfolio company management teams to identify and execute strategic acquisitions, joint ventures, and other

transactions, generate cost and working capital savings, reduce capital expenditures, and optimize capital structures through several means such as debt exchange offers and the purchase of portfolio company debt at discounts to par value.
We have grown our total AUM at a 21% compound annual growth rate from December 31, 2009 to December 31, 2020. In addition, we benefit from mandates with long-term capital commitments in our credit, private equity and real assets businesses. Our long-lived capital base allows us to invest our funds' assets with a long-term focus, which is an important component in generating attractive returns for our fund investors. We believe the long-term capital we manage also leaves us well-positioned during economic downturns, when the fundraising environment for alternative assets has historically been more challenging than during periods of economic expansion. As of December 31, 2020, more than 90% of our AUM was in funds with a contractual life at inception of five years or more, and 60% of our AUM was in permanent capital vehicles.
We expect our growth in AUM to continue over time by seeking to create value in our funds’ existing credit, private equity and real assets investments, continuing to deploy our funds’ available capital in what we believe are attractive investment opportunities, and raising new funds and investment vehicles as market opportunities present themselves. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Businesses—We may not be successful in raising new funds or in raising more capital for certain of our existing funds and may face pressure on performance fees and fee arrangements of our future funds.”
Our financial results are highly variable, since performance fees (which generally constitute a large portion of the income that we receive from the funds we manage), and the transaction and advisory fees that we receive, can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year. We manage our business and monitor our performance with a focus on long-term performance, an approach that is generally consistent with the investment horizons of the funds we manage and is driven by the investment returns of our funds.

Credit
Since Apollo’s founding in 1990, we believe our expertise in credit has served as an integral component of our company’s growth and success. Our credit-oriented approach to investing commenced in 1990 with the management of a high-yield bond and leveraged loan portfolio. Since that time, our credit activities have grown significantly, through both organic growth and strategic acquisitions. As of December 31, 2020, Apollo’s credit segment had total AUM and Fee-Generating AUM of $328.6 billion and $269.7 billion, respectively, across a diverse range of credit-oriented investments that utilize the same disciplined, value-oriented investment philosophy that we employ with respect to our private equity funds. Apollo’s broad

credit platform, which we believe is adaptable to evolving market conditions and different risk tolerances, is categorized as follows:
Credit AUM of $328.6 billion as of December 31, 2020(1)
(in billions)
(1) AUM components may not sum due to rounding. Corporate Credit, Structured Credit and Direct Origination include AUM in accounts owned by or related to Athene (the “Athene Accounts”).
Corporate Credit
Our corporate credit category is comprised of corporate fixed income and corporate credit investments. Corporate fixed income generally includes investment grade corporate bonds, emerging markets and investment grade private placement investments. Corporate credit generally includes credit investment strategies that are less liquid in nature. Corporate credit investments includes performing credit, opportunistic credit, CLOs and other strategic investment accounts. Performing credit strategies focus on income-oriented, senior loan and bond investment strategies that target issuers primarily domiciled in the U.S. and in Europe. Liquid opportunistic strategies primarily focus on credit investments that are generally liquid in nature and utilize a value-oriented investment philosophy that is similar to the philosophy utilized by our private equity business. This includes investments by our credit funds in a broad array of primary and secondary opportunities encompassing stressed and distressed public and private securities primarily within corporate credit, including senior loans (secured and unsecured), large corporate investment grade loan origination and structured capital solutions, high yield, mezzanine, derivative securities, debtor in possession financings, rescue or bridge financings, and other debt investments. Our AUM and Fee-Generating AUM within corporate credit totaled $163.6 billion and $126.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. Corporate credit includes $96.1 billion of AUM in the Athene Accounts as of December 31, 2020, all of which is fee-generating.
CLOs
In aggregate, our AUM and Fee-Generating AUM in CLOs totaled $22.6 billion and $11.8 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. Through their lifecycle, CLOs employ structured credit and performing credit strategies with the goal of providing investors with competitive yields achieved through highly diversified pools of historically low defaulting assets. Included within total AUM of CLOs is $10.3 billion of AUM related to Redding Ridge, from which Apollo earns fees based on net asset value. Redding Ridge’s primary business consists of acting as collateral manager for CLO transactions and related warehouse facilities and as holder of CLO retention interests in both U.S. and Europe. Redding Ridge is strategically positioned with access to significant CLO management and structuring expertise, industry contacts and investor relationships. Furthermore, Redding Ridge is supported by top tier credit research, credit risk management, credit trading platform and other corporate and administrative services through various service contracts.
Structured Credit
Our structured credit category includes corporate structured and asset-backed securities, consumer and residential and financial credit investments. Corporate structured and asset-backed securities is focused on structured credit investment strategies that seek to obtain favorable and protective lending terms, predictable payment schedules, well diversified portfolios and low historical defaults. Consumer and residential is focused on consumer and residential real estate credit investment

strategies, which include investments in residential mortgage-backed securities, whole residential real estate loans, consumer loans and other asset-backed securities. Financial credit investments is focused on life insurance policies issued by insurance companies that insure the lives of natural persons, as well as other insurance linked securities. Our AUM and Fee-Generating AUM within structured credit totaled $64.2 billion and $54.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. Structured credit includes $43.7 billion of AUM in the Athene Accounts as of December 31, 2020, all of which is fee-generating.
    Structured Credit Funds - FCI and SCRF
Our structured credit funds include the financial credit investment fund series (“FCI”) and the structured credit recovery fund series (“SCRF”). Collectively, these structured credit funds employ our structured credit investing strategy, which targets multiple tranches of less liquid structured securities with favorable and protective lending terms, predictable payment schedules, well-diversified portfolios and low default rates. Our AUM and Fee-Generating AUM within Structured Credit Funds totaled $9.3 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.
Direct Origination
The direct origination category advises clients investing in loans, including, but not limited to, first-lien senior secured and unsecured loans, second lien term loans, mezzanine loans, private high-yield debt, private investment grade debt, asset-backed loans, leveraged loans, real estate loans, rediscount loans, venture loans and bridge loans, particularly in the context of transactions that require certainty of financing. This strategy focuses on originating private debt both directly with sponsors and through banks in the United States (“U.S.”), but also targets Europe and other markets. This category includes direct origination activities related to Midcap and AINV. Our AUM and Fee-Generating AUM within Direct Origination totaled $23.9 billion and $21.1 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. Direct origination includes $3.0 billion of AUM in the Athene Accounts as of December 31, 2020, all of which is fee-generating.

Private Equity
Private Equity AUM of $80.7 billion as of December 31, 2020
(in billions)
As a result of our long history of private equity investing across market cycles, we believe we have developed a unique set of skills on which we rely to make new investments and to maximize the value of our existing investments. As an example, through our experience with traditional private equity buyouts, which we also refer to herein as buyout equity, we apply a highly disciplined approach towards structuring and executing transactions, the key tenets of which include seeking to acquire companies at below industry average purchase price multiples, and establishing flexible capital structures with long-term debt maturities and few, if any, financial maintenance covenants.
We believe we have a demonstrated ability to adapt quickly to changing market environments and capitalize on market dislocations through our traditional, distressed and corporate buyout approach. In prior periods of strained financial liquidity and economic recession, our private equity funds have made attractive investments by buying the debt of quality businesses (which we refer to as “classic” distressed debt), converting that debt to equity, seeking to create value through active participation with management and ultimately monetizing the investment. This combination of traditional and corporate buyout investing with a “distressed option” has been deployed through prior economic cycles and has allowed our funds to achieve attractive long-term rates of return in different economic and market environments. In addition, during prior economic downturns we have relied on our restructuring experience and worked closely with our funds’ portfolio companies to seek to maximize the value of our funds’ investments.
We seek to focus on investment opportunities where competition is limited or non-existent. We believe we are often sought out early in the investment process because of our industry expertise, sizable amounts of available long-term capital, willingness to pursue investments in complicated situations and ability to provide value-added advice to portfolio companies regarding operational improvements, acquisitions and strategic direction. We generally prefer sole sponsored transactions and since inception through December 31, 2020, approximately 68% of the investments made by our private equity funds have been proprietary in nature. We believe that by emphasizing our proprietary sources of deal flow, our private equity funds will be able to acquire businesses at more compelling valuations which will ultimately create a more attractive risk/reward proposition. As of December 31, 2020, our private equity segment had total and Fee-Generating AUM of approximately $80.7 billion and $41.8 billion, respectively.
Distressed Buyouts, Debt and Other Investments
During periods of market dislocation and volatility, we rely on our credit and capital markets expertise to build positions in distressed debt. We target assets with what we believe are high-quality operating businesses but low-quality balance sheets, consistent with our traditional buyout strategies. The distressed securities our funds purchase include bank debt, public high-yield debt and privately held instruments, often with significant downside protection in the form of a senior position in the capital structure, and in certain situations our funds also provide debtor-in-possession financing to companies in bankruptcy. Our investment professionals generate these distressed buyout and debt investment opportunities based on their many years of experience in the debt markets, and as such they are generally proprietary in nature.

We believe distressed buyouts and debt investments represent a highly attractive risk/reward profile. Our funds’ investments in debt securities have generally resulted in two outcomes. The first and preferred potential outcome, which we refer to as a distressed for control investment, is when our funds are successful in taking control of a company through its investment in the distressed debt. By working proactively through the restructuring process, we are often able to equitize the debt position of our funds to create a well-financed buyout which would then typically be held by the fund for a three-to-five year period, similar to other traditional leveraged buyout transactions. The second potential outcome, which we refer to as a non-control distressed investment is when our funds do not gain control of the company. This typically occurs as a result of an increase in the price of the debt investments to levels which are higher than what we consider to be an attractive acquisition valuation. In these instances, we may forgo seeking control, and instead our funds may seek to sell the debt investments over time, typically generating a higher short-term IRR with a lower multiple of invested capital than in the case of a typical distressed for control transaction. We believe that we are a market leader in distressed investing and that this is one of the key areas that differentiates us from our peers.
We also maintain the flexibility to deploy capital of our private equity funds in other types of investments such as the creation of new companies, which allows us to leverage our deep industry and distressed expertise and collaborate with experienced management teams to seek to capitalize on market opportunities that we have identified, particularly in asset-intensive industries that are in distress. In these types of situations, we have the ability to establish new entities that can acquire distressed assets at what we believe are attractive valuations without the burden of managing an existing portfolio of legacy assets. Other investments, such as the creation of new companies, historically have not represented a large portion of our overall investment activities, although our private equity funds do make these types of investments selectively.
Corporate Carve-outs
Corporate carve-outs are less market-dependent than distressed investing, but are equally complicated. In these transactions, our funds seek to extract a business that is highly integrated within a larger corporate parent to create a stand-alone business. These are labor-intensive transactions, which we believe require deep industry knowledge, patience and creativity, to unlock value that has largely been overlooked or undermanaged. Importantly, because of the highly negotiated nature of many of these transactions, Apollo believes it is often difficult for the seller to run a competitive process, which ultimately allows our funds to achieve compelling purchase prices.
Opportunistic Buyouts
We have extensive experience completing leveraged buyouts across various market cycles. We take an opportunistic and disciplined approach to these transactions, generally avoiding highly competitive situations in favor of proprietary transactions where there may be opportunities to purchase a company at a discount to prevailing market averages. Oftentimes, we will focus on complex situations such as out-of-favor industries or “broken” (or discontinued) sales processes where the inherent value may be less obvious to potential acquirers. In the case of more conventional buyouts, we seek investment opportunities where we believe our focus on complexity and sector expertise will provide us with a significant competitive advantage, whereby we can leverage our knowledge and experience from the nine core industries in which our investment professionals have historically invested private equity capital. We believe such knowledge and experience can result in our ability to find attractive opportunities for our funds to acquire portfolio company investments at lower purchase price multiples.
To further alter the risk/reward profile in our funds’ favor, we often focus on certain types of buyouts such as physical asset acquisitions and investments in non-correlated assets where underlying values tend to change in a manner that is independent of broader market movements In the case of physical asset acquisitions, our private equity funds seek to acquire physical assets at discounts to where those assets trade in the financial markets, and to lock in that value arbitrage through comprehensive hedging and structural enhancements.
We believe buyouts of non-correlated assets or businesses also represent attractive investments since they are generally less correlated to the broader economy and provide an element of diversification to our funds' overall portfolio of private equity investments.
Hybrid Capital
In 2018, we launched our hybrid value strategy which pursues the provision to companies of, among other things, rescue financing or customized capital solutions, including senior secured and unsecured debt or preferred equity securities, often with equity-linked or equity-like upside. The strategy also focuses on structured equity investments, which are non-control or control equity opportunities with enhanced protection through structural components or a fundamental characteristic of the business, such as long-term supply agreements. Typically, in these scenarios, companies are looking for an equity partner to fund initiatives such as organic growth, acquisitions, deleveraging or build-ups. We believe Apollo’s strategic relationships 
-14-

with industry executives and experience in business repositioning, platform build-ups and complex integration provide a benefit to companies seeking a capital partner, especially in situations that have an element of complexity.
Natural Resources
In addition to our traditional private equity funds which pursue opportunities in nine core industries, one of which is natural resources, we have three dedicated private equity natural resources funds. In 2011, we launched our dedicated private equity natural resources strategy to capitalize on private equity investment opportunities in the natural resources industry, principally in the metals and mining, energy, renewables and select other natural resources sectors. We believe the flexible investment approach and multi-sector expertise will underpin the funds’ ability to invest successfully across market cycles, including periods of dislocation and distress, to create a complementary portfolio of assets, and source and execute compelling, value-oriented investment opportunities for our funds.
Building Value in Portfolio Companies
We are a “hands-on” investor organized around nine core industries where we believe we have significant knowledge and expertise, and we remain actively engaged with the management teams of the portfolio companies of our private equity funds. We have established relationships with operating executives that assist in the diligence review of new opportunities and provide strategic and operational oversight for portfolio investments. We actively work with the management of each of the portfolio companies of the funds we manage to maximize the underlying value of the business. To achieve this, we take a holistic approach to value-creation, concentrating on both the asset side and liability side of the balance sheet of a company. On the asset side of the balance sheet, Apollo works with management of the portfolio companies to enhance the operations of such companies. Our investment professionals assist portfolio companies in rationalizing non-core and underperforming assets, generating cost and working capital savings, and maximizing liquidity. On the liability side of the balance sheet, Apollo relies on its deep credit structuring experience and works with management of the portfolio companies to help optimize the capital structure of such companies through proactive restructuring of the balance sheet to address near-term debt maturities. The companies in which our private equity funds invest also seek to capture discounts on publicly traded debt securities through exchange offers and potential debt buybacks. In addition, we have established a group purchasing program to help our funds' portfolio companies leverage the combined corporate spending among Apollo and portfolio companies of the funds it manages in order to seek to reduce costs, optimize payment terms and improve service levels for all program participants.
Exiting Investments
The value of the investments that have been made by our funds are typically realized through either an initial public offering of common stock on a nationally recognized exchange or through the private sale of the companies in which our funds have invested. We believe the advantage of having long-lived funds and investment discretion is that we are able to time our funds’ exit to maximize value.

Real Assets AUM of $46.2 billion as of December 31, 2020
(in billions)
Real Estate
    With respect to our real estate funds' equity investments, we take a value-oriented approach and our funds will invest in assets located in primary, secondary and tertiary markets across North America and Asia. The U.S. real estate equity funds we manage pursue opportunistic investments in various real estate asset classes, which historically have included hospitality, office, industrial, retail, healthcare, residential and non-performing loans. The Asia real estate equity funds we manage have a primary focus on investing in China, India and Southeast Asia, while executing Apollo’s strategy of opportunistic value investing in real estate related assets, portfolios, companies, operating platforms, and structured finance.
    With respect to our real estate debt activities, our real assets funds and accounts offer financing across a broad spectrum of property types and at various points within a property’s capital structure, including first mortgage and mezzanine financing and preferred equity. In addition to ARI, we also manage strategic accounts focused on investing in commercial mortgage-backed securities and other commercial real estate loans. Our AUM and Fee-Generating AUM within the Real Estate Funds totaled $34.2 billion and $27.9 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.
Principal Finance Funds
The European Principal Finance (“EPF”) fund series primarily employs our principal finance investment strategy, which is utilized to invest in European commercial and residential real estate, performing loans, non-performing loans, and unsecured consumer loans, as well as acquiring assets as a result of distressed market situations. Certain of the EPF investment vehicles we manage own captive pan-European financial institutions, loan servicing and property management platforms. These entities perform banking and lending activities and manage and service consumer credit receivables and loans secured by commercial and residential properties. In aggregate, these financial institutions, loan servicing, and property management platforms operate in six European countries and employed approximately 156 individuals as of December 31, 2020. We believe the post-investment loan servicing and real estate asset management requirements, combined with the illiquid nature of these investments, limits participation by traditional long-only investors, hedge funds, and private equity funds, resulting in what we believe to be an opportunity for our real assets business. Our AUM and Fee-Generating AUM within the European Principal Finance fund series totaled $6.9 billion and $5.1 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.
Infrastructure
    We established our first vehicles that invest primarily in infrastructure assets during 2018. The infrastructure funds target a broad range of asset types, including communications, midstream energy, power and renewables, and transportation. We seek to target long-lived assets with stable, contracted cash flows and structural downside protection. Our infrastructure debt vehicles target similar asset types as the infrastructure equity strategy with a heightened focus on the investment’s position in the capital structure and current yield. Our AUM and Fee-Generating AUM within the Infrastructure Funds totaled $5.1 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.

On September 20, 2018, Athene and Apollo agreed to revise the existing fee arrangements (the “amended fee agreement”) between Athene and Apollo. The amended fee agreement was approved by Athene’s shareholders on June 10, 2019 and took effect retroactive to the month beginning January 1, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, Apollo managed or advised $184.3 billion of AUM, all of which was Fee-Generating AUM, in the Athene Accounts. 
On February 28, 2020, pursuant to a transaction agreement (the “Transaction Agreement”) between Athene Holding, AGM Inc. and the entities that form the Apollo Operating Group, Athene Holding issued 35,534,942 Class A common shares of Athene Holding to certain subsidiaries of the Apollo Operating Group in exchange for issuance by the Apollo Operating Group of 29,154,519 non-voting equity interests of the Apollo Operating Group to Athene Holding and $350 million in cash.
    See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for details regarding the fee arrangements between the Company and Athene.
Athora
The Company, through its consolidated subsidiary, ISGI, provides investment advisory services to certain portfolio companies of Apollo funds and Athora, an insurance and reinsurance group focused on the European insurance market (collectively, the “Athora Accounts”). As of December 31, 2020, Apollo, through its subsidiaries, managed or advised $68.6 billion of AUM and $62.4 billion of Fee-Generating AUM in accounts owned by or related to Athora. See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for details regarding the fee arrangements between the Company and Athora.
Athora Non-Sub-Advised Assets
This category includes the Athora assets which are managed by Apollo but not sub-advised by Apollo nor invested in Apollo funds or investment vehicles. We refer to these assets collectively as “Athora Non-Sub-Advised Assets”. Our AUM within the Athora Non-Sub-Advised category totaled $60.8 billion as of December 31, 2020, of which $54.6 billion was Fee-Generating AUM.
Strategic Investment Accounts
    We manage SIAs established to facilitate investments by third-party investors directly in Apollo funds and other securities. Institutional investors are expressing increasing levels of interest in SIAs since these accounts can provide investors with greater levels of transparency, liquidity and control over their investments as compared to more traditional investment funds. Based on the trends we are currently witnessing among a select group of large institutional investors, we expect our AUM that is managed through SIAs to continue to grow over time. As of December 31, 2020, approximately $30 billion of our total AUM was managed through SIAs.

Fundraising and Investor Relations
We believe our performance track record across our funds and our focus on client service have resulted in strong relationships with our fund investors. Our fund investors include many of the world’s most prominent pension and sovereign wealth funds, university endowments and financial institutions, as well as individuals. We maintain an internal team dedicated to investor relations across our credit, private equity and real assets businesses.
In our credit business, we have raised private capital from prominent institutional investors and have also raised capital from public market investors, as in the case of AINV, AFT and AIF. AINV is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market and complies with the reporting requirements of that exchange. ATH, AFT and AIF are listed on the NYSE and comply with the reporting requirements of that exchange.
In our private equity business, fundraising activities for new funds begin once the investor capital commitments for the current fund are largely invested or committed to be invested. The investor base of our private equity funds includes both investors from prior funds and new investors. In many instances, investors in our private equity funds have increased their commitments to subsequent funds as our private equity funds have increased in size. During the fundraising effort for Fund IX, investors representing over 85% of Fund VIII’s third party capital committed to Fund IX. The single largest unaffiliated investor in Fund IX represents 4% of Fund IX’s total fund size. In addition, many of our investment professionals commit their own capital to each private equity fund.
During the management of a private equity fund, we maintain an active dialogue with the fund's investors. We host quarterly webcasts that are led by members of our senior management team and we provide quarterly reports to the investors detailing recent performance by investment. We also organize an annual meeting for our private equity funds' investors that consists of detailed presentations by the senior management teams of many of our funds' current investments. From time to time, we also hold meetings for the advisory board members of our private equity funds.
In our real assets business, we have raised capital from prominent institutional investors and we have also raised capital from public market investors, as in the case of ARI. ARI is currently listed on the NYSE under the symbol “ARI.”
Investment Process
We maintain a rigorous investment process and a comprehensive due diligence approach across all of our funds. We have developed policies and procedures that govern the investment practices of our funds. Moreover, each fund is subject to certain investment criteria set forth in its governing documents that generally contain requirements and limitations for investments, such as limitations relating to the amount that will be invested in any one company and the geographic regions in which the fund will invest. Our investment professionals are familiar with our investment policies and procedures and the investment criteria applicable to the funds that they manage. Our investment professionals interact frequently across our businesses on a formal and informal basis.
We have in place certain procedures to allocate investment opportunities among our funds. These procedures are meant to ensure that each fund is treated fairly and that transactions are allocated in a way that is equitable, fair and in the best interests of each fund, subject to the terms of the governing agreements of such funds.
Private Equity Investment Process
Our private equity investment professionals are responsible for selecting, evaluating, structuring, due diligence, negotiating, executing, monitoring and exiting investments for our traditional private equity funds, as well as pursuing operational improvements in our funds’ portfolio companies through management consulting arrangements. These investment professionals perform significant research into each prospective investment, including a review of the company’s financial statements, comparisons with other public and private companies and relevant industry data. The due diligence effort will also typically include:
•on-site visits;
•interviews with management, employees, customers and vendors of the potential portfolio company;
•research relating to the company’s management, industry, markets, products and services, and competitors; and
•background checks.
After an initial selection, evaluation and diligence process, the relevant team of investment professionals will prepare a detailed analysis of the investment opportunity for our private equity investment committee. Our private equity investment committee generally meets weekly to review the investment activity and performance of our private equity funds.
-19-


Table of Contents

After discussing the proposed transaction with the deal team, the investment committee will decide whether to give its preliminary approval to the deal team to continue the selection, evaluation, diligence and negotiation process. The investment committee will typically conduct several meetings to consider a particular investment before finally approving that investment and its terms. Both at such meetings and in other discussions with the deal team, our Managing Partners and other investment professionals will provide guidance to the deal team on strategy, process and other pertinent considerations.
Our private equity investment professionals are responsible for monitoring an investment once it is made and for making recommendations with respect to exiting an investment. Disposition decisions made on behalf of our private equity funds are subject to review and approval by the private equity investment committee, including our Managing Partners.
Credit and Real Assets Investment Process
Our credit and real assets investment professionals are responsible for selecting, evaluating, structuring, due diligence, negotiating, executing, monitoring and exiting investments for our credit funds and real assets funds, respectively. The investment professionals perform significant research into and due diligence of each prospective investment, and prepare analyses of recommended investments for the investment committee of the relevant fund.
Investment decisions are scrutinized by the investment committees where applicable, who review potential transactions, provide input regarding the scope of due diligence and approve recommended investments and dispositions. Close attention is given to how well a proposed investment is aligned with the distinct investment objectives of the fund in question, which in many cases have specific geographic or other focuses. The investment committee of each of our credit funds and real assets funds generally is provided with a summary of the investment activity and performance of the relevant funds on at least a monthly basis.
Overview of Fund Operations
Investors in our private equity funds and certain of our credit and real assets funds make commitments to provide capital at the outset of a fund and deliver capital when called by us as investment opportunities become available. We determine the amount of initial capital commitments for such funds by taking into account current market opportunities and conditions, as well as investor expectations. The general partner’s capital commitment is determined through negotiation with the fund’s underlying investor base. The commitments are generally available for approximately six years during what we call the investment period. We have typically invested the capital committed to such funds over a three to four year period. Generally, as each investment is realized, these funds first return the capital and expenses related to that investment and any previously realized investments to fund investors and then distribute any profits. These profits are typically shared 80% to the investors in our private equity funds and 20% to us so long as the investors receive at least an 8% compounded annual return on their investment, which we refer to as a “preferred return” or “hurdle.” Allocation of profits between fund investors and us, as well as the amount of the preferred return, among other provisions, varies for our real estate equity and many of our credit funds. Our private equity funds typically terminate ten years after the final closing, subject to the potential for two one-year extensions. Dissolution of those funds can be accelerated upon a majority vote of investors not affiliated with us and, in any case, all of our funds also may be terminated upon the occurrence of certain other events. Ownership interests in our private equity funds and certain of our credit and real assets funds are not, however, subject to redemption prior to termination of the funds.
The processes by which our credit and real assets funds receive and invest capital vary by type of fund. As noted above, certain of our credit and real assets funds have drawdown structures where investors made a commitment to provide capital at the formation of such funds and deliver capital when called by us as investment opportunities become available. In addition, we have several permanent capital vehicles with unlimited duration. Each of these publicly traded vehicles raises capital by selling shares in the public markets and these vehicles can also issue debt. We also have several credit funds which continuously offer and sell shares or limited partner interests via private placements through monthly subscriptions, which are payable in full upon a fund’s acceptance of an investor’s subscription. These hedge fund style credit funds have customary redemption rights (in many cases subject to the expiration of an initial lock-up period), and are generally structured as limited partnerships, the terms of which are determined through negotiation with the funds' underlying investor base. Management fees and performance fees that we earn for management of these credit funds and from their performance as well as the terms governing their operation vary across our credit funds. 
We conduct the management of our credit, private equity and real assets funds primarily through a partnership structure, in which partnerships organized by us accept commitments and/or funds for investment from investors. Funds are generally organized as limited partnerships with respect to private equity funds and other U.S. domiciled vehicles and limited partnership and limited liability (and other similar) companies with respect to non-U.S. domiciled vehicles. Typically, each fund has an investment adviser registered, or as relying advisers, deemed to be registered, under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Advisers Act”). Responsibility for the day-to-day operations of the funds is typically 
-20-


Table of Contents

delegated to the funds’ respective investment managers pursuant to an investment management (or similar) agreement. Generally, the material terms of our investment management agreements relate to the scope of services to be rendered by the investment manager to the applicable funds, certain rights of termination in respect of our investment management agreements and, generally, with respect to certain of our credit and real assets funds (as these matters are covered in the limited partnership agreements of the private equity funds), the calculation of management fees to be borne by investors in such funds, as well as the calculation of the manner and extent to which other fees received by the investment manager from fund portfolio companies serve to offset or reduce the management fees payable by investors in our funds. The funds themselves generally do not register as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), generally in reliance on Section 3(c)(7) or Section 7(d) thereof or, typically in the case of funds formed prior to 1997, Section 3(c)(1) thereof. Section 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act excepts from its registration requirements funds privately placed in the United States whose securities are owned exclusively by persons who, at the time of acquisition of such securities, are “qualified purchasers” or “knowledgeable employees” for purposes of the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act exempts from its registration requirements privately placed funds whose securities are beneficially owned by not more than 100 persons. In addition, under current interpretations of the SEC, Section 7(d) of the Investment Company Act exempts from registration any non-U.S. fund all of whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned either by non-U.S. residents or by U.S. residents that are qualified purchasers.
In addition to having an investment manager, each fund that is a limited partnership also has a general partner that makes all policy and investment decisions relating to the conduct of the fund’s business. The general partner is responsible for all decisions concerning the making, monitoring and disposing of investments, but such responsibilities are typically delegated to the fund’s investment manager pursuant to an investment management (or similar) agreement. The limited partners of the funds take no part in the conduct or control of the business of the funds, have no right or authority to act for or bind the funds and have no influence over the voting or disposition of the securities or other assets held by the funds. These decisions are made by the fund’s general partner in its sole discretion, subject to the investment limitations set forth in the agreements governing each fund. The limited partners often have the right to remove the general partner or investment manager for cause or cause an early dissolution by a simple majority vote. In connection with the private offering transactions that occurred in 2007 pursuant to which we sold shares of Apollo Global Management, Inc. to certain initial purchasers and accredited investors in transactions exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act (“Private Offering Transactions”) and the reorganization of the Company’s predecessor business (the “2007 Reorganization”), we deconsolidated certain of our credit and private equity funds that had historically been consolidated in our financial statements and amended the governing agreements of those funds to provide that a simple majority of a fund’s investors have the right to accelerate the dissolution date of the fund. 
In addition, the governing agreements of our private equity funds and certain of our credit and real assets funds enable the limited partners holding a specified percentage of the interests entitled to vote, to elect not to continue the limited partners’ capital commitments for new portfolio investments in the event two or more of our Managing Partners or certain other investment professionals do not devote the requisite time to managing the fund or in connection with certain triggering events (as defined in the applicable governing agreements). In addition to having a significant, immeasurable negative impact on our revenue, net income and cash flow, the occurrence of such an event with respect to any of our funds would likely result in significant reputational damage to us. The loss of the services of our key personnel would have a material adverse effect on us, including our ability to retain and attract investors and raise new funds, and the performance of our funds. We do not carry any “key man” insurance that would provide us with proceeds in the event of the death or disability of any of our key personnel.
Fees and Performance Fees
Our revenues and other income consist principally of (i) management fees, which may be based upon a percentage of the committed or invested capital, adjusted assets, gross invested capital, fund net asset value, stockholders' equity or the capital accounts of the limited partners of the funds, and may be subject to offset as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, (ii) advisory and transaction fees, net relating to certain actual and potential credit, private equity and real assets investments as more fully discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, (iii) income based on the performance of our funds, which consists of allocations, distributions or fees from our credit, private equity and real assets funds, and (iv) investment income from our investments as general partner in the form of principal investment income and income from other direct investments primarily in the form of net gains from investment activities as well as interest and dividend income. 
The composition of our revenues will vary based on market conditions and the cyclicality of the different businesses in which we operate. Our funds’ returns are driven by investment opportunities and general market conditions, including the availability of debt capital on attractive terms and the availability of distressed debt opportunities. Our funds initially record fund investments at cost and then such investments are subsequently recorded at fair value. Fair values are affected by changes

in the fundamentals of the underlying portfolio company investments of the funds, the industries in which the portfolio companies operate, the overall economy as well as other market conditions. 
General Partner and Professionals Investments and Co-Investments
General Partner Investments
Certain of our management companies, general partners and co-invest vehicles are committed to contribute to our funds and affiliates. As a limited partner, general partner and manager of the Apollo funds, Apollo had unfunded capital commitments as of December 31, 2020 of $1.0 billion.
Managing Partners and Other Professionals Investments
To further align our interests with those of investors in our funds, our Managing Partners and other professionals have invested their own capital in our funds. Our Managing Partners and other professionals will either re-invest their performance fees to fund these investments or use cash on hand or funds borrowed from third parties. We generally have not historically charged management fees or performance fees on capital invested by our Managing Partners and other professionals directly in our credit, private equity and real assets funds.
Co-Investments
Investors in many of our funds, as well as certain other investors, may have the opportunity to make co-investments with the funds. Co-investments are investments in portfolio companies or other fund assets generally on the same terms and conditions as those to which the applicable fund is subject.
Competition
The investment management industry is intensely competitive, and we expect it to remain so. We compete globally and on a regional, industry and niche basis.
We face competition both in the pursuit of outside investors for our funds and in our funds acquiring investments in attractive portfolio companies and making other fund investments. We compete for outside investors for our funds based on a variety of factors, including:
•investment performance;
•investor perception of investment managers’ drive, focus and alignment of interest;
•quality of service provided to and duration of relationship with investors;
•business reputation; and
•the level of fees and expenses charged for services.
Competition is also intense for the attraction and retention of qualified employees. Our ability to continue to compete effectively in our businesses will depend upon our ability to attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees.
For additional information concerning the competitive risks that we face, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Businesses—The investment management business is intensely competitive, which could have a material adverse impact on us.”
Human Capital
We believe that investing in opportunities, communities and our people helps us to achieve exceptional outcomes for our shareholders and fund investors and a positive social impact. Apollo’s talent is instrumental to our success as a global alternative investment manager, and investing in and fostering a high-performing, diverse and inclusive workforce is a key pillar of operating our business. We believe this commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion is central to the Apollo business model, an integrated platform which fosters strong collaboration across businesses and functions. Rooted in our core values, we strive to build a culture where our talent can excel and grow in their careers. As of December 31, 2020, we employed 1,729 employees including 557 investment professionals.
Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
At Apollo, we feel strongly that building a diverse and inclusive workforce is an important priority. We also understand that the key to building a more diverse Apollo is to focus on an inclusive mindset, so that all our people feel they

belong, are highly engaged and are well supported in doing their best work. Apollo sponsors multiple firmwide initiatives to support workforce engagement, development and advancement, including employee affinity networks, and partnerships with external diversity-focused organizations. Apollo is also a signatory to the Institutional Limited Partners Association’s Diversity in Action initiative, which brings together limited partners and general partners who share a commitment to advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in the private equity industry. 
Talent Development
We believe that ongoing professional development is a critical part of our culture at Apollo and an important enabler of our investment process. Because of our entrepreneurial culture, the breadth of our integrated platform, and our reputation for strong investment performance, we have been able to attract, develop and retain top talent. We have development programs in place at the associate, principal, managing director and partner levels which demonstrate our commitment to developing, engaging and retaining our employees. In addition to our training and annual review programs, we have instituted annual employee surveys that measure employee satisfaction and engagement, and help evaluate and guide human capital decision-making.
Compensation and Benefits
We offer competitive compensation and benefits to support our employees’ wellbeing and reward strong performance. Our pay for performance compensation philosophy is designed to reward employees for performance and to align employee interests with the firm’s long-term growth. Our benefits program includes healthcare, wellness initiatives, retirement offerings, paid time off and family leave. We also offer all employees access to our Employee Assistance Program and specific resources for parents and caregivers.
Citizenship 
Apollo is committed to investing in our communities and engaging our employees and other stakeholders in meaningful and impactful Citizenship Programs. These initiatives enable Apollo to join our employees in supporting the communities in which they live and the institutions and organizations of greatest importance to them. Apollo is proud to support our employees in giving back to local communities, whether through charitable donations or volunteer time, and Apollo hosts volunteer opportunities and matches employee efforts to amplify the collective impact. 
Environmental, Social and Governance
At Apollo, we believe that ESG engagement drives value creation. With one of the most sophisticated and longest-running ESG programs in the alternative investments industry, we recognize the unique opportunity to do well by doing good through investments.
We understand the social, operational and financial benefits of implementing ESG factors into our investment process and have invested across industries historically aligned with the United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals, including healthcare, education and renewable energy. 
Formalized in 2008, Apollo’s ESG program has committed extensive resources, time and capital to incorporate environmental, social, and governance factors into our investment analysis and investment decision-making. Apollo’s mission is to ensure we engage on ESG issues throughout our funds’ investment portfolios, seek appropriate and applicable disclosure on ESG issues, report on our ESG activities and progress, and the ESG activities and progress of our funds’ portfolio companies, to fund investors, shareholders, and stakeholders alike, and support the implementation of ESG best practices across the investment management industry.
Regulatory and Compliance Matters
Our businesses, as well as the financial services industry generally, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and elsewhere.
Regulation under the Investment Advisers Act. We conduct our advisory business through our investment adviser subsidiaries, including Apollo Capital Management, L.P., Apollo Management, L.P., Apollo Global Real Estate Management, L.P., Apollo Investment Management, L.P., and Apollo Credit Management, LLC, each of which is registered as an investment adviser with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act. Certain of our investment advisers have a number of relying advisers that operate a single advisory business and rely on umbrella registration to be deemed registered as an investment adviser with the SEC. All of our SEC-registered investment advisers are subject to the requirements and regulations of the Investment Advisers Act that include, but are not limited to, anti-fraud provisions, upholding fiduciary duties to advisory clients, 
-23-


Table of Contents

maintaining an effective compliance program, managing conflicts of interest, record-keeping and reporting requirements, and disclosure requirements.
Regulation under the Investment Company Act. Each of AFT and AIF is a registered management investment company under the Investment Company Act. AINV is an investment company that has elected to be treated as a business development company under the Investment Company Act. Each of AFT, AIF and AINV has elected for U.S. federal tax purposes to be treated as a regulated investment company under Subchapter M of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Internal Revenue Code”). As such, each of AFT, AIF and AINV is required to distribute during each taxable year at least 90% of its ordinary income and realized, net short-term capital gains in excess of realized net long-term capital losses, if any, to its shareholders. In addition, in order to avoid excise tax, each needs to distribute during each calendar year at least 98% of its ordinary income and 98.2% of its capital gains net income for the one-year period ended on October 31st of such calendar year, plus any shortfalls from any prior year's distribution, which would take into account short-term and long-term capital gains and losses. In addition, as a business development company, AINV must not acquire any assets other than “qualifying assets” specified in the Investment Company Act unless, at the time the acquisition is made, at least 70% of AINV’s total assets are qualifying assets (with certain limited exceptions).
Real Estate Investment Trust. ARI has elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust, or REIT, under the Internal Revenue Code. To maintain its qualification as a REIT, ARI must distribute at least 90% of its taxable income to its shareholders and meet, on a continuing basis, certain other complex requirements under the Internal Revenue Code.
Regulation as a Broker-Dealer. Apollo Global Securities, LLC (“AGS”), one of our subsidiaries, is registered as a broker-dealer with the SEC and in 53 states and U.S. territories and is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”). FINRA is a self-regulatory organization subject to oversight by the SEC which adopts and enforces rules governing the conduct, and examines the activities, of its member firms, including AGS. State securities regulators also have regulatory oversight authority over AGS. From time to time, AGS is involved in certain capital markets, financial advisory, and fund marketing and distribution activities with affiliates of Apollo, including portfolio companies of the funds we manage, and with third parties, whereby AGS will earn fees for its services.
Broker-dealers are subject to regulations that cover all aspects of the securities business, including, among other things, the implementation of a supervisory control system and effective compliance program, advertising and sales practices, conduct of and compensation in connection with public securities offerings, maintenance of adequate net capital, financial reporting, record keeping, and the conduct and qualifications of directors, officers, employees and other associated persons. These requirements include the SEC’s “uniform net capital rule,” Rule 15c3-1, which specifies the minimum level of net capital a broker-dealer must maintain, requires a significant part of a broker-dealer’s assets be kept in relatively liquid form, imposes certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing its capital, and subjects any distributions or withdrawals of capital by a broker-dealer to notice requirements. These and other requirements also include rules that limit a broker-dealer's ratio of subordinated debt to equity in its regulatory capital composition, constrain a broker-dealer's ability to expand its business under certain circumstances and impose additional requirements when the broker-dealer participates in securities offerings of affiliated entities. Violations of these requirements may result in censures, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders, revocation of licenses or registrations, the suspension or expulsion from the securities industry of the broker-dealer or its officers or employees or other similar consequences by regulatory bodies. 
Regulation as a Commodity Pool Operator and Commodity Trading Advisor. Certain investment activities entered into by Apollo managers may subject those managers to provisions of the Commodities Exchange Act and oversight by the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (the “CFTC”), including registration as a commodity pool operator or commodity trading advisor. Apollo intends to rely on exemptions from registration when available. 
Regulation by the Federal Communications Commission. We are deemed by the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) to control certain radio and television broadcast stations that are owned by a company in which one of our funds has a majority investment. As a result, we are subject to FCC ownership restrictions that could limit our ability and the ability of our funds to make investments in other radio or television broadcast stations or in daily newspapers in some U.S. markets. We are also subject to FCC restrictions on the ownership of our stock by non-U.S. persons or entities. We must report to the FCC if we or any of our officers or directors or controlling stockholders are convicted of a felony or of violating certain laws.
United States Insurance Regulation. We are subject to insurance holding company system laws and regulations in the states of domicile of certain insurance companies for which we are (or, with respect to certain pending transactions, will be) deemed to be a control person for purposes of such laws. Specifically, under state insurance laws, we are deemed to be the ultimate parent of (i) Athene Holding’s insurance company subsidiaries, which are domiciled in Delaware, Iowa and New York, (ii) Catalina Holdings (Bermuda) Ltd.’s (“Catalina’s”) insurance company subsidiaries, which are domiciled in California, 
-24-


Table of Contents

Colorado, Connecticut, the District of Columbia and New York, (iii) OneMain Holdings, Inc.’s (“OneMain’s”) insurance company subsidiaries, which are domiciled in Texas, (iv) Venerable Holdings, Inc.’s (“Venerable’s”) insurance company subsidiary, which is domiciled in Iowa and (v) LifePoint Health, Inc.’s (f/k/a RegionalCare Hospital Partners Holdings, Inc.) (“LifePoint’s”), health maintenance organization subsidiary, which is domiciled in Michigan and (vi) Aspen Insurance Holdings Limited’s (“Aspen’s”) insurance company subsidiaries, which are domiciled in North Dakota and Texas. Each of California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Iowa, Michigan, New York, North Dakota and Texas is a “Domiciliary State”.
The insurance holding company system laws and regulations in the Domiciliary States generally require each insurance company subsidiary to register with the insurance department in its Domiciliary State and to furnish financial and other information about the operations of companies within its holding company system. These regulations also impose restrictions and limitations on the ability of an insurance company subsidiary to pay dividends and make other distributions to its parent company. In addition, transactions between an insurance company and other companies within its holding company system, including sales, loans, investments, reinsurance agreements, management agreements and service agreements, must be on terms that are fair and reasonable and, if material or within a specified category, require prior notice and approval or non-disapproval by the applicable Domiciliary State insurance department.
The insurance laws of each of the Domiciliary States prohibit any person from acquiring direct or indirect control of a domestic insurance company or its parent company unless that person has filed a notification with specified information with that state’s Commissioner or Superintendent of Insurance (the “Commissioner”) and has obtained the Commissioner’s prior approval. Under applicable statutes in each of the Domiciliary States, the acquisition of 10% or more of the voting securities of an insurance company or its parent company is presumptively considered an acquisition of control of the insurance company, although such presumption may be rebutted. Accordingly, any person or entity that acquires, directly or indirectly, 10% or more of the voting securities of Apollo without the requisite prior approvals will be in violation of these laws and may be subject to injunctive action requiring the disposition or seizure of those securities or prohibiting the voting of those securities, or to other actions that may be taken by the applicable state insurance regulators.
The New York State Department of Financial Services (the “NYSDFS”) adopted an amendment to its holding company system regulations which requires prospective acquirers of New York domiciled insurers to provide greater disclosure with respect to intended changes to the business operations of the insurer, and which expressly authorizes the NYSDFS to impose additional conditions on such an acquisition and limit changes that the acquirer may make to the insurer’s business operations for a specified period of time following the acquisition without the NYSDFS’ prior approval. In particular, the amendment provides the NYSDFS with the specific authority to require acquirers of New York domiciled life insurers to post assets in a trust account for the benefit of the target company’s policyholders. In making such determination, the NYSDFS may consider whether the acquirer is, or is controlled by or under common control with, an investment manager such as Apollo. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (the “NAIC”) has also published in its Financial Analysis Handbook specific narrative guidance for state insurance examiners to consider in reviewing applications for an acquisition of an insurer by a private equity firm.
In addition, many U.S. state insurance laws require prior notification to state insurance departments of an acquisition of control of a non-domiciliary insurance company doing business in that state if the acquisition would result in specified levels of market concentration. While these pre-acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state insurance departments to disapprove the acquisition of control, they authorize regulatory action in the affected state, including requiring the insurance company to cease and desist from doing certain types of business in the affected state or denying a license to do business in the affected state, if particular conditions exist, such as substantially lessening competition in any line of business in such state. Any transactions that would constitute an acquisition of control of Apollo may require prior notification in those states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification laws. These laws may discourage potential acquisition proposals and may delay, deter or prevent an acquisition of control of Apollo (in particular through an unsolicited transaction), even if Apollo might consider such transaction to be desirable for its shareholders.
The scope of regulation of insurance holding companies has increased in both the United States and internationally. The NAIC has adopted amendments to the insurance holding company system model law that introduced the concept of “enterprise risk” within an insurance holding company system and imposed more extensive informational reporting regarding parents and other affiliates of insurance companies, with the purpose of protecting domestic insurers from enterprise risk, including requiring an annual enterprise risk report by the ultimate controlling person identifying the material risks within the insurance holding company system that could pose enterprise risk to domestic insurers. Changes to existing NAIC model laws or regulations must be adopted by individual states or foreign jurisdictions before they will become effective. To date, each of the Domiciliary States has enacted laws to adopt such amendments. In December 2020, the NAIC adopted a group capital calculation tool (“GCC”) that uses a Risk-Based Capital aggregation methodology to provide U.S. regulators with a method to 
-25-


Table of Contents

aggregate the available capital of each entity in a group in a way that applies to all groups regardless of their structure. The NAIC has also adopted changes to the insurance holding company system model law to require, subject to certain exceptions, the ultimate controlling person of every insurer subject to the holding company registration requirement to file an annual group capital calculation with its lead state. The NAIC has stated that the group capital calculation will be a regulatory tool and will not constitute a requirement or standard. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens these requirements may impose on us and our insurance company affiliates.
Internationally, in November 2019, the International Association of Insurance Supervisors (the “IAIS”) adopted the Common Framework for the Supervision of Internationally Active Insurance Groups (“ComFrame”). ComFrame will be applicable to entities that meet the IAIS’ criteria for internationally active insurance groups (or “IAIGs”) and are designated as such. Under ComFrame, an IAIG is defined as an insurance group which has (i) premiums written in three or more jurisdictions, with the percentage of gross premiums written outside the home jurisdiction comprising at least 10% of the group's total gross written premiums, and (ii) based on a rolling three-year average, total assets of at least $50 billion, or gross written premiums of at least $10 billion. ComFrame includes measures such as group supervision, group capital requirements, uniform standards for insurer corporate governance, enterprise risk management and other control functions and resolution planning. In November 2019, the IAIS adopted a revised version of the risk-based global insurance capital standard (“ICS”) which is the group capital component of ComFrame. The ICS will be implemented in the following two phases: in the first phase, which will last for five years and which is referred to as the “monitoring period,” the ICS will be used for confidential reporting to group-wide supervisors and discussion in supervisory colleges, and the ICS will not be used as a prescribed capital requirement. After the monitoring period, the ICS will be implemented as a group-wide prescribed capital standard. In addition, in the United States, the NAIC and the Federal Reserve Board are developing a group capital calculation tool using a risk-based capital aggregation method, similar to the GCC, for all entities within the insurance holding company, including non-U.S. entities and are seeking effective equivalency of such tool to the ICS for U.S.-based IAIGs. In the United States, the NAIC has also promulgated additional amendments to the insurance holding company system model law that address “group wide” supervision of internationally active insurance groups to allow state insurance regulators in the U.S. to be designated as group-wide supervisors for U.S.-based IAIGs and acknowledge another regulatory official acting as the group-wide supervisor of an IAIG. To date, each of the Domiciliary States has adopted a form of these provisions. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens these requirements may impose on us and our insurance company affiliates.
In addition, state insurance departments also have broad administrative powers over the insurance business of our insurance company affiliates, including insurance company licensing and examination, agent licensing, establishment of reserve requirements and solvency standards, premium rate regulation, admissibility of assets, policy form approval, unfair trade and claims practices and other matters. State regulators regularly review and update these and other requirements.
Although the federal government does not directly regulate the insurance business, federal legislation and administrative policies in several areas, including pension regulation, age and sex discrimination, financial services regulation, securities regulation and federal taxation, can significantly affect the insurance business. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”) established the Federal Insurance Office (the “FIO”) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury headed by a Director appointed by the Treasury Secretary. While currently not having a general supervisory or regulatory authority over the business of insurance, the Director of the FIO performs various functions with respect to insurance, including serving as a non-voting member of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) and making recommendations to the FSOC regarding non-bank financial companies to be designated as systemically important financial institutions (“SIFIs”). The Director of the FIO has also submitted reports to the U.S. Congress on (i) modernization of U.S. insurance regulation (provided in December 2013) and (ii) the U.S. and global reinsurance market (provided in November 2013 and January 2015, respectively). Such reports could ultimately lead to changes in the regulation of insurers and reinsurers in the U.S.
In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act authorized the Treasury Secretary and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to negotiate covered agreements. A covered agreement is an agreement between the United States and one or more foreign governments, authorities or regulatory entities, regarding prudential measures with respect to insurance or reinsurance. Pursuant to this authority, in September 2017, the U.S. and the EU signed a covered agreement to address, among other things, group supervision and reinsurance collateral requirements (the “EU Covered Agreement”) and the U.S. released a “Statement of the United States on the Covered Agreement with the European Union” (the “Policy Statement”) providing the U.S.’s interpretation of certain provisions in the EU Covered Agreement. The Policy Statement provides that the U.S. expects that the GCC developed by the NAIC, will satisfy the EU Covered Agreement’s group capital assessment requirement. In addition, on December 18, 2018, the Bilateral Agreement between the U.S. and the United Kingdom on Prudential Measures Regarding Insurance and Reinsurance (the “U.K. Covered Agreement”) was signed in anticipation of the United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union. U.S. state regulators have until September 22, 2022 to adopt reinsurance reforms removing reinsurance

collateral requirements for EU and U.K. reinsurers that meet the prescribed minimum conditions set forth in the EU Covered Agreement and U.K. Covered Agreement or else state laws imposing such reinsurance collateral requirements may be subject to federal preemption. In 2019, the NAIC adopted revisions to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation that would, if adopted into law by state regulators, implement the reinsurance collateral provisions of the EU Covered Agreement and U.K. Covered Agreement. California and Iowa have adopted the 2019 amendments to the Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation and Connecticut and Michigan currently have pending legislation to adopt such amendments. In addition, in December 2020, the NYSDFS announced proposed changes to the New York regulations on credit for reinsurance for New York-domiciled insurers to implement the changes set forth in the amended Credit for Reinsurance Model Law and Regulation. The NAIC has recently adopted a new accreditation standard that requires states to adopt the revisions no later than September 1, 2022, which is likely to motivate the remaining Domiciliary States to adopt the amendments. The reinsurance collateral provisions of the EU Covered Agreement or U.K. Covered Agreement may increase competition, in particular with respect to pricing for reinsurance transactions, by lowering the cost at which competitors of the reinsurance subsidiaries of our insurance company affiliates, such as Athene Holding’s direct, wholly owned subsidiary, Athene Life Re Ltd. (“ALRe”), are able to provide reinsurance to U.S. insurers.
Bermuda Insurance Regulation. As the ultimate parent of the general partner or manager of certain shareholders of Athene Holding, we are subject to certain insurance laws and regulations in Bermuda, where Apollo is considered a “shareholder controller” of (a) ALRe, a Bermuda Class E insurance company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Athene Holding, a company listed on the NYSE as well as its direct and indirect Bermuda domiciled insurance and reinsurance subsidiaries, (b) Athene Life Re International Ltd. (“ALREI”), a Bermuda Class C insurer and wholly-owned subsidiary of Athene Holding, (c) Athora Life Re Ltd. (“Athora Life Re”), a Bermuda Class E insurance company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Athora Holding Ltd. (“Athora”), a Bermuda private company, (d) Catalina General Insurance Ltd (“Catalina General”), a Bermuda Class 3A and Class C insurer and a wholly owned subsidiary of Catalina, and (E) Aspen Bermuda Limited (“Aspen Bermuda”), a Class 4 insurer and wholly owned subsidiary of Aspen. Each of ALRe, ALREI, Athora, Catalina General and Aspen Bermuda is subject to regulation and supervision by the Bermuda Monetary Authority (“BMA”) and compliance with all applicable Bermuda law and Bermuda insurance statutes and regulations, including but not limited to the Insurance Act of 1978 (Bermuda) and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the “Bermuda Insurance Act”).
Under the Bermuda Insurance Act, the BMA maintains supervision over the “controllers” of all registered insurers in Bermuda. For these purposes, a “controller” includes a “shareholder controller.” The definition of shareholder controller is set out in the Bermuda Insurance Act but generally refers to (a) a person who holds 10% or more of the shares carrying rights to vote at a shareholders’ meeting of the registered insurer or its parent company, (b) a person who is entitled to exercise 10% or more of the voting power at any shareholders’ meeting of such registered insurer or its parent company or (c) a person who is able to exercise significant influence over the management of the registered insurer or its parent company by virtue of its shareholding or its entitlement to exercise, or control the exercise of, the voting power at any shareholders’ meeting.
The Bermuda Insurance Act imposes certain notice requirements upon any person that has become, or as a result of a disposition ceased to be, a shareholder controller, and failure to comply with such requirements is an offense punishable by a fine, imprisonment, or both. Where the shares of a registered insurer, or the shares of its parent company, are traded on a recognized stock exchange, the required notices must be given to the BMA within 45 days after such person becomes, or as a result of a disposition ceases to be, a shareholder controller. Where neither the shares of a registered insurer nor the shares of its parent company are traded on a recognized stock exchange (i.e., private companies), the required notices must be given to the BMA (1) without objection from the BMA, at least 45 days before such person becomes a shareholder controller and (2) before such person, as a result of a disposition, ceases to be a shareholder controller.
In addition, the BMA may file a notice of objection to any person or entity who has become a controller of any description where it appears that such person or entity is not, or is no longer, fit and proper to be a controller of the registered insurer. Any person or entity who continues to be a controller of any description after having received a notice of objection is guilty of an offense and liable on summary conviction to a fine, imprisonment, or both.
The BMA may, in accordance with the Bermuda Insurance Act and in respect of an insurance group, determine whether it is appropriate for it to act as its group supervisor. The BMA currently acts as the group supervisor for each of the Aspen Holdings insurance group, Catalina insurance group, and the Athora insurance group. The BMA may exercise its authority to act as group supervisor for other of our insurance company affiliates in the future. We cannot predict with any degree of certainty the additional capital requirements, compliance costs or other burdens that such a determination may impose on us and our insurance company affiliates.
European Insurance Regulation. Apollo is considered the parent and/or indirect qualifying shareholder of certain European insurance companies and insurance intermediaries for purposes of certain European insurance laws. A European solvency framework and prudential regime for insurers and reinsurers, under the Solvency II Directive 2009/138/EC 
-27-


Table of Contents

(“Solvency II”), took effect in full on January 1, 2016. Solvency II is a regulatory regime which imposes economic risk-based solvency requirements across all EU Member States and consists of three pillars: Pillar I-quantitative capital requirements, based on a valuation of the entire balance sheet; Pillar II-qualitative regulatory review, which includes governance, internal controls, enterprise risk management and supervisory review process; and Pillar III-market discipline, which is accomplished through reporting of the insurer’s financial condition to regulators and the public. Solvency II is supplemented by European Commission Delegated Regulation (E.U.) 2015/35 (as amended) (the “Delegated Regulation”), other European Commission “delegated acts” and binding technical standards, and guidelines issued by the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority (“EIOPA”). The Delegated Regulation sets out detailed requirements for individual insurance and reinsurance undertakings, as well as for groups, based on the overarching provisions of Solvency II, which together make up the core of the single prudential rulebook for insurance and reinsurance undertakings in the EU. Currently, the European Commission is undertaking a review of Solvency II to ensure that the regime remains fit for purpose, calling upon EIOPA to provide technical advice with EIOPA publishing its Opinion on December 17, 2020. The Commission’s proposal on the review is expected for Q3 2021.
The Insurance Distribution Directive 2016/97 (“IDD”) came into force on October 1, 2018 and replaced the Insurance Mediation Directive 2002/92/EC. It aims to enhance consumer protection when buying insurance and to support competition between insurance distributors by creating a level playing field. In addition, the IDD aims to ensure consistent prudential standards for insurance intermediaries, through enhanced conduct standards, thereby improving consumer protection and effective competition.
Following the implementation of Solvency II and the IDD, regulators may continue to issue guidance and other interpretations of applicable requirements, which could ultimately require our EU insurance company affiliates or our EU insurance intermediary affiliates (respectively) to make adjustments, which could impact their businesses. As noted above, the EU Commission is undertaking a review of Solvency II. This is occurring within the context of an increasing focus on environmental, social and governance considerations. 
Insurers and reinsurers established in a Member State of the EU have the freedom to establish branches in, and provide services to, all European Economic Area (“EEA”) states through “passporting” rights. The U.K. Regulated Entities (defined below) no longer have this right following the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU (“Brexit”) on January 31, 2020 and the end of the transitional period which expired on December 31, 2020. The U.K. government established a Temporary Permissions Regime (“TPR”) which came into force with effect from January 1, 2021, which allows EEA firms covered by a passport prior to that date, who wish to continue carrying out business in the U.K. in the longer term, to operate in the U.K. for a limited period while they seek authorization or recognition from the U.K. regulators. However, at present, no TPR-equivalent regime is in place for U.K. firms who wish to continue carrying out business in the EEA. In the absence of a TPR-equivalent regime for U.K. firms, the ability of U.K. firms to continue doing business in the EEA depends on applicable EEA state local law and regulation. Similarly, there has been no decision yet made by the European Commission on whether or not the U.K.’s financial services regulatory regime will be granted third-country equivalence for the purposes of reinsurance, solvency calculation and/or group supervision under Solvency II. In the absence of such declarations, EEA firms (and their respective groups) carrying out business with U.K. firms will be subject to a stricter, more complex, set of regulatory and supervisory requirements. U.K. firms will also be subject to more stringent requirements in carrying out reinsurance business with EEA firms. Therefore, there remains uncertainty as to the ultimate structure of the U.K.’s future relationship in the EU in certain areas, including, for example, financial services, creating continuing uncertainty as to the full extent to which the businesses of the U.K. Regulated Entities could be adversely affected by Brexit. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Businesses—Difficult market or economic conditions may adversely affect our businesses in many ways, including by reducing the value or hampering the performance of the investments made by our funds or reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could materially reduce our revenue, net income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial prospects and condition” and “—The withdrawal of the U.K. from the EU could have a range of adverse consequences for us, our funds and the portfolio companies of our funds.”
United Kingdom Insurance Regulation. Apollo is considered the parent of certain insurance company subsidiaries of Catalina and Aspen, including Catalina London Limited, Catalina Worthing Insurance Limited and AGF Insurance Limited (the “Catalina Insurance Entities”), Aspen Insurance U.K. Limited (“Aspen U.K.”), which is domiciled in the United Kingdom and operates a branch in Switzerland, and Aspen Managing Agency Limited (“AMAL” and together with the Catalina Insurance Entities and Aspen U.K., the “U.K. Insurance Entities”). In addition, Aspen UK Syndicate Services Limited (“AUSSL”) is also domiciled in the United Kingdom and provides insurance distribution services (AUSSL, together with the U.K. Insurance Entities, the “U.K. Regulated Entities”) for purposes of certain U.K. insurance regulations. The U.K. Insurance Entities are each authorized by the Prudential Regulation Authority (“PRA”) and regulated by both the PRA and the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”). AUSSL is only authorized and regulated by the FCA. In addition, AMAL is a Lloyd’s managing agent of 
-28-


Table of Contents

Aspen's Lloyd's Syndicate 4711 and is therefore also regulated by Lloyd’s, as is Aspen Underwriting Limited (“AUL”), which is a Lloyd’s corporate member and member of Lloyd’s Syndicate 4711.
The objectives of the PRA are to promote the safety and soundness of all firms it supervises and to secure an appropriate degree of protection for policyholders. The objectives of the FCA are to ensure customers receive financial services and products that meet their needs, to promote sound financial systems and markets and to ensure that firms are stable and resilient with transparent pricing information, compete effectively, have the interests of their customers and the integrity of the market at the heart of how they run their business. The PRA has responsibility for the prudential regulation of banks and insurers, while the FCA has responsibility for the conduct of business regulation in the wholesale and retail markets. The PRA and the FCA adopt separate methods of assessing regulated firms on a periodic basis. Each of the PRA and FCA apply rules to support their statutory and operational objectives. PRA rules are maintained in a PRA Rulebook, which includes rules for Solvency II insurance firms (and, also, for insurers that do not fall within Solvency II) that closely reflect the provisions of Solvency II, including requirements for Solvency II insurance firms to meet economic risk-based solvency requirements and to adhere to governance and risk management requirements and reporting and disclosure requirements. In addition to Solvency II requirements, the PRA Rulebook contains Fundamental Rules (high-level principles), relating to individuals in senior management and general provisions relating to the supervision of U.K. insurance firms. The FCA Handbook contains rules that concern the conduct of firms including the scope of systems and controls and conduct of business requirements. Despite the Brexit transitional period coming to an end, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, as amended, has transposed all applicable direct EU legislation into domestic U.K. law, thus ensuring the continuing application of Solvency II under the U.K.’s financial services regulatory regime. Further, the U.K. government has granted temporary transitional powers (through the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019) to the U.K.’s financial services regulators (including the PRA and FCA) in order to grant transitional relief for a period of up to two years from the end of the transitional period, therefore giving U.K. firms longer time to implement changes in U.K. law that took effect at the end of the transitional period.
Further, as AMAL is regulated by Lloyd’s as a Lloyd’s Managing Agent, it is also subject to the Lloyd’s Minimum Standards, which contain requirements representing the minimum level of performance required by Lloyd’s entities, the Lloyd’s By-Laws and other Lloyd’s rules and requirements (together the “Lloyd’s Rules”). AUL, as a Lloyd’s corporate member, is also subject to the Lloyd’s Rules.
In addition, in certain situations, subject to the required application of, as appropriate, the U.K. Covered Agreement, Solvency II and other applicable law and regulation, there may also be scope for elements of group supervision to be exercised by the PRA (or other relevant EEA Member State or non-EEA regulator, such as the BMA). However, the continuing ability of the PRA to act as a group supervisor for Solvency II purposes is subject to whether or not the U.K.’s financial services regulatory regime will be granted third-country equivalence by the European Commission, with such decision yet to be determined.
Moreover, in June 2020, the U.K. government revealed plans to review Solvency II to ensure that it is properly tailored to take account of the structural features of the U.K. insurance sector, with HM Treasury publishing a “Call for Evidence” in October 2020, outlining the motives behind the review and inviting feedback on various areas, including, amongst others, the standard formula for capital requirements, the risk margin, the matching adjustment and reporting requirements. The results of the review are not expected to be published until later in 2021.
Under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (the “FSMA”), the prior consent of the PRA and/or FCA, as applicable (depending on the regulated entity), is required, before any person can be become a “controller” or increase its control over any regulated company, including the U.K. Regulated Entities, or over the parent undertaking of any regulated company. No prior approval for reducing control below one of the thresholds referred to below is needed, though notification must still be given to the appropriate regulator of the relevant transaction. In addition, the authorized firm itself is expected to discuss any prospective changes of which it is aware with the appropriate regulator, regardless of whether the controller or the proposed controller proposes to submit a change in control application. A proposed “controller” for the purposes of the PRA controller regime, which is applicable to the U.K. Insurance Entities, is any natural or legal person who holds (either alone or in concert with others) 10% or more of the shares or voting power in the relevant company or its parent undertaking or is able to exercise “significant influence” over the management of the relevant company. In respect of increases and decreases, the relevant thresholds are 20%, 30% and 50% or an acquired insurance company becoming (or ceasing to be) a subsidiary undertaking of the acquirer. However, a proposed “controller” for the purposes of the FCA controller regime, which is applicable to AUSSL, is any natural or legal person who holds (either alone or in concert with others) 20% or more of the shares or voting power in the relevant company or its parent undertaking or is able to exercise “significant influence” over the management of the relevant company. This 20% threshold is the only threshold that is applicable to the Insurance Intermediary Entities. In both cases, the appropriate regulator has 60 working days from the day on which it acknowledges the receipt of a complete notice of control to determine whether to approve the new controller or object to the transaction, although if the 
-29-

regulator requires further information to be provided in order to complete its review this period will be interrupted for up to 30 working days while the regulator is awaiting the provision of that further information. If the approval is given, it may be given unconditionally or subject to conditions. Breach of the requirement to notify the regulator of a decision to acquire or increase control, or of the requirement to obtain approval before completing the relevant control transaction is a criminal offense attracting potentially unlimited fines. The relevant regulator can also seek other remedies, including suspension of voting rights or a forced disposition of shares acquired without prior approval. As a result of the above requirements, direct controllers, and holding companies who indirectly acquire control of the U.K. Regulated Entities are required to apply for PRA and/or FCA approval prior to acquiring such entities. In addition, a similar process also applies for Lloyd’s Managing Agents and Lloyd’s Corporate Members, therefore the acquisition of control of these types of entities will also require separate Lloyd’s approval. The “controller” thresholds for such entities are the same as the thresholds that are applicable to the U.K. Insurance Entities.
Under English law, all companies are restricted from declaring a dividend to their shareholders unless they have “profits available for distribution”. The calculation as to whether a company has sufficient profits is based on its accumulated realized profits minus its accumulated realized losses. U.K. insurance regulatory rules do not prohibit the payment of dividends, but the PRA requires that insurance companies maintain certain solvency margins and may restrict the payment of a dividend by any of the U.K. Insurance Entities.
Irish Insurance Regulation. Apollo is deemed to hold an indirect qualifying holding in (i) Catalina Insurance Ireland DAC, which is Catalina’s wholly-owned Irish subsidiary insurance undertaking, and (ii) Athora Ireland plc, which is a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of ALRe, each of which are authorized and regulated by the Central Bank of Ireland (the “CBI”).
Pursuant to Solvency II, and related law and regulation of Ireland, in regard to an Irish authorized and regulated insurance undertaking, such as Catalina Insurance Ireland DAC or Athora Ireland plc, the CBI has broad supervisory and administrative powers. The CBI has power over such matters as scope of authorized activity, standards of solvency, investments, reporting requirements relating to capital structure, ownership, financial condition and general business operations, special reporting and prior approval requirements with respect to certain transactions, reserves for unpaid losses and related matters, reinsurance, minimum capital and surplus requirements, dividends and other distributions to shareholders, periodic examinations and annual and other report filings. In relevant prescribed scenarios, subject to the required application of, as appropriate, the EU Covered Agreement, Solvency II and other applicable law and regulation, there may also be scope for elements of group supervision to be exercised by the CBI (or other EEA Member State or non-EEA regulator, such as the BMA). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CBI and EIOPA have recommended that insurance firms should consider postponing the payment of dividend distributions or similar transactions until they can forecast their costs and future revenues with a greater degree of certainty. Thus, Catalina Insurance Ireland DAC and Athora Ireland plc must discuss any payment of dividend distributions or similar transactions with the CBI in advance of such payments. 
For the purposes of Solvency II, as implemented in Ireland, a “qualifying holding” means a direct or indirect holding in an insurance company which represents 10% or more of the capital or of the voting rights or which makes it possible to exercise a significant influence over the management of the company. With respect to each of Catalina Insurance Ireland DAC and Athora Ireland plc, Solvency II, as implemented in Ireland, prohibits any person from acquiring, directly or indirectly, such a qualifying holding unless: (a) the proposed acquirer has notified the CBI of the acquisition; (b) the CBI has acknowledged receipt of that notification and; (c) either the statutory assessment period in relation to the acquisition has ended and the CBI has not notified the proposed acquirer that it opposes the acquisition, or the CBI has notified the proposed acquirer that it does not oppose the acquisition. If a proposed acquirer purports to complete a proposed acquisition in contravention of the aforementioned, as matter of Irish law: (i) the purported acquisition is not effective to pass title to any share or any other interest; and (ii) any exercise of powers based on the purported acquisition of the holding concerned is void.
Athora Ireland Services Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of Athora, is a registered (re)insurance intermediary with the CBI pursuant to the IDD. An indirect qualifying holding in Athora Ireland Services Limited is attributed to Apollo via its indirect interest in Athora. A (re)insurance intermediary does not have regulatory capital or solvency requirements akin to a (re)insurance undertaking but the CBI does have supervisory and administrative powers for matters such as scope of authorized activity, financial condition and general business operations.
Italian Insurance Regulation. Apollo is deemed to be the holder of an indirect qualifying holding in (i) Amissima Assicurazioni S.p.A. and (ii) Amissima Vita S.p.A., which are Italian insurance undertakings, duly authorized and regulated by the Italian insurance regulator (“Istituto per la vigilanza sulle Assicurazioni” or “IVASS”). The two Italian insurance companies belong to the Amissima Italian insurance group, whose parent undertaking is Amissima Holdings S.r.l. Apollo also holds an indirect qualifying holding in Bene Assicurazioni S.p.A., an Italian non-life insurance undertaking.
Pursuant to Solvency II, as implemented within the Italian legal framework, Italian insurance undertakings (such as Amissima Assicurazioni S.p.A., Amissima Vita S.p.A., and Bene Assicurazioni S.p.A.) and insurance parent companies such as Amissima Holdings S.r.l., are subject to extensive supervisory powers of IVASS on a broad array of matters including 
-30-


Table of Contents

calculation of technical provisions, own funds requirements, solvency capital requirements, ownership structure, internal governance and organizational requirements, reporting obligations and extraordinary transactions. Moreover, in accordance with the provisions set forth under the EU Covered Agreement, Solvency II and other relevant provisions of law and regulation, supervision at a group level may be exercised by IVASS or by regulator of a EEA or non-EEA State.
With particular regard to the ownership structure of Italian insurance undertakings, in accordance with Solvency II regime, IVASS must authorize in advance (i) any acquisition of participations in an insurance undertaking amounting to a controlling interest or the acquisition of a qualifying holding; for such purpose, a “qualifying holding” means a direct or indirect holding in an insurance undertaking which represents 10% or more of the capital or of the voting rights or which makes it possible to exercise a significant influence over the management of that undertaking, and (ii) any increase of an existing qualifying holding above the applicable thresholds (i.e., 20%, 30% and 50%) and, in any case, when the increase results in obtaining the control of the insurance undertaking.
IVASS must issue the authorization for acquiring qualifying holdings and increase of existing qualifying holdings in Italian insurance companies when the conditions for the sound and prudent management and other requirements (e.g., Fit & Proper requirements, financial soundness of the undertaking and of the controller, and AML compliance) of the undertaking are met. The voting rights and the other rights which make it possible to exercise an influence over the insurance undertaking may not be exercised when they pertain to participations for which the IVASS authorization has not been obtained, or has been suspended or withdrawn, and the participation shall be transferred within the deadline established by IVASS.
IVASS may ask insurance undertakings as well as companies and bodies of any nature which own participations in said undertakings to indicate the names of the holders of participations as they are recorded in the share register. To verify all financial interrelationships between insurance undertakings and their parent companies, subsidiaries and affiliated companies, IVASS may require that such companies produce information and records and make checks.
Swiss Insurance Regulation. Apollo is considered an indirect qualified participant of Glacier Reinsurance Ltd. (“Glacier Re”) in the meaning of Swiss insurance supervisory laws. As a qualified indirect participant of Glacier Re, a reinsurance company domiciled in Switzerland holding a license by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority FINMA (“FINMA”) for the operation of a reinsurance business in the insurance class C1 “Reinsurance by insurance companies that conduct solely reinsurance business,” Apollo is subject to certain provisions of Swiss insurance supervisory laws and regulations. Glacier Re is subject to regulation and supervision by FINMA and must comply with all applicable laws and regulations of Switzerland, including but not limited to the Swiss Federal Act of 17 December 2004 on the Supervision of Insurance Companies (“ISA”), its implementing ordinances as well as circulars and guidelines of FINMA.
Any person who intends to directly or indirectly participate in a Swiss domiciled insurance or reinsurance undertaking is required to notify FINMA of such intent if the participation reaches or exceeds the thresholds of 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% of the capital or voting rights of the insurance or reinsurance undertaking. Similarly, any person who intends to decrease its direct or indirect participation in an insurance or reinsurance undertaking domiciled in Switzerland below the thresholds of 10%, 20%, 33% or 50% of the capital or voting rights or to change the participation in a way that the insurance or reinsurance undertaking is no longer a subsidiary must notify FINMA. Consequently, although direct and indirect participants of Glacier Re as such are not supervised by FINMA, an intended change of the qualified direct or indirect participation in Glacier Re may require a notification to FINMA. FINMA may disapprove such change in the qualified participation or subject the change to certain conditions, if the nature or scope of the participation potentially jeopardizes the interests of Glacier Re as Swiss domiciled reinsurance company or the reinsured. Failure to comply with such notification is punishable by a fine of up to CHF 500,000 in case of intent and up to CHF 150,000 in case of negligence. In addition, if a change of persons who directly or indirectly hold a participation of 10% of the capital or voting rights or who may otherwise materially influence the business conduct of Glacier Re has occurred, Glacier Re is required to file a submission to seek for FINMA’s approval of the relevant change of its regulatory business plan (form f) within 14 days upon the occurrence of the event.
Furthermore, a substantial dividend distribution or other form of profit repatriation from Glacier Re to its shareholders may potentially qualify as a change of the regulatory business plan of Glacier Re under art. 4 para. 2 lit. d ISA, if such substantial dividend distribution would be considered as a relevant change of the financial resources and reserves of Glacier Re. Such change of the business plan (form d) must be notified to FINMA no later than 14 days after the occurrence of the event and is subject to FINMA’s approval. To this extent, future dividend distributions or other forms of profit repatriation might be subject to FINMA’s approval. Apollo is also considered a qualified participant of Aspen U.K. Aspen U.K. holds a FINMA license for a Swiss branch of a foreign insurance undertaking for its Swiss insurance branch Aspen Insurance UK Limited, London, Zurich Insurance Branch. Furthermore, Aspen U.K. holds a reinsurance branch in Switzerland, Aspen Insurance UK Limited, London, Zurich Branch and Aspen Bermuda Limited holds a reinsurance branch in Switzerland, Aspen Bermuda Limited, Hamilton, Zurich Branch. A change of a direct or indirect participation in a foreign insurance undertaking (in the present case Aspen U.K.) that holds a Swiss insurance branch license does not, in principle, trigger any Swiss insurance regulatory notification or approval requirements. However, Aspen U.K. might notify FINMA out of courtesy of such changes.

German Insurance Regulation. Apollo is deemed to hold an indirect qualifying holding in (i) Athora Deutschland Verwaltungs GmbH, (ii) Athora Deutschland Holding GmbH & Co. KG, (iii) Athora Deutschland GmbH, (iv) Athora Lebensversicherung AG and (v) Athora Pensionskasse AG, which are either German regulated insurance undertakings or German insurance holding companies (together the “Regulated German Entities”). The indirect qualifying holding in the Regulated German Entities is attributed to Apollo via its indirect interest in Athora, which is the 100% parent company of the Regulated German Entities. The Regulated German Entities are subject to the relevant laws and regulations applicable to insurance undertakings or insurance holding companies in Germany which regulate and mandate, among other things, eligibility criteria for investments, policyholder participation in income, accounting principles, corporate governance requirements, regulatory capital, reporting, insurance contracts, insurance distribution requirements, consumer protection laws, data protection requirements (including GDPR) and anti-money-laundering requirements. The Regulated German Entities are subject to supervision by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority, Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht (“BaFin”). BaFin is the central financial regulatory authority for Germany and has wide powers to interpret and execute the insurance supervisory law in Germany, in particular via issuing regulatory ordinances and guidelines as well as orders and decisions with a view to individual insurance undertakings or insurance holding companies.
Pursuant to German regulatory law, the direct or indirect acquisition of a qualified participating interest in the Regulated German Entities or the increase of a qualified participating interest in the Regulated German Entities exceeding certain thresholds is subject to BaFin approval or the expiration of a statutory non-objection period. Generally, indirectly or directly acquiring a 10% or greater capital or voting interest in a relevant entity or otherwise obtaining the ability to significantly influence the management of a relevant entity is considered a qualified participating interest under German insurance regulatory laws. Laws such as these prevent any person from directly or indirectly acquiring qualified participating interests in any of the Regulated German Entities unless that person has filed a notification requiring specified information with BaFin and has obtained BaFin’s prior approval or waited for the expiration of a statutory non-objection period after having filed a formally complete notification. Since Apollo is holding indirectly a significant interest in the Regulated German Entities the acquisition of an interest in Apollo could qualify as an acquisition of an indirect qualified participating interest in the Regulated German Entities on a look through basis. In case of a breach of the requirement to notify BaFin of the intention to acquire or increase a qualified participating interest, or in case of circumstances that would entitle BaFin to object to the acquisition or increase of a qualified participating interest. BaFin may seek remedies, including the suspension of voting rights, restrictions on disposals of the relevant interest or a forced disposition of the relevant interest. A breach of the notification requirement may also entail administrative sanctions.
Belgian Insurance Regulation. Apollo is deemed to hold an indirect qualifying holding in Athora Belgium SA/NV (“Athora Belgium”), which is a Belgian licensed insurance and reinsurance undertaking that is authorized and regulated by the National Bank of Belgium (the “NBB”) and the Belgian Financial Services and Markets Authority (Autoriteit voor Financiële Diensten en Markten/ Autorité des Services et Marchés Financiers) (the “Belgian FSMA”). In addition, some of Athora Belgium’s subsidiaries are registered with the Belgian FSMA as insurance brokers and are subject to supervision by the Belgian FSMA as regards their insurance distribution activities. 
Pursuant to the “Twin peaks” supervision model introduced in the Belgian supervisory system on April 1, 2011, the supervision of financial institutions (including insurance and reinsurance undertaking) is now generally organized on the basis of the following two pillars: (i) the prudential supervision of banking, insurance and other financial institutions is entrusted to the NBB and (ii) the Belgian FSMA is competent for the supervision of financial markets and consumer protection (including in the insurance and reinsurance (distribution) sector).
Pursuant to Solvency II, and related laws and regulations of Belgium, in regard to an authorized and regulated insurance and reinsurance undertaking such as Athora Belgium, the NBB has broad supervisory and administrative powers on a broad range of prudential matters, including, without limitation, the authorization to carry out insurance and reinsurance business in Belgium or abroad (including on the basis of an EEA passport), internal governance, valuation of assets, risk and solvency assessment, technical provisions, capital requirements, own funds, reporting and accounting rules. As an insurance and reinsurance undertaking, Athora Belgium is subject to the specific supervision of the NBB for all its “strategic decisions.” Strategic decisions are “decisions that are important and therefore may have a global impact on the undertaking, to the extent that (in de mate dat/ dans la mesure où) it may have consequences for several functions within the insurance or reinsurance company, and that relate to any investment, divestment, participation or strategic cooperation, including (without limitation) a decision to acquire or establish another company, to establish a joint venture, to establish in another country, to enter into a cooperation agreement, to contribute or acquire a branch, to enter into a merger or demerger). The NBB has the right to oppose intended strategic decisions if they are deemed to be in breach of the sound and prudent management of the company or if they create a material risk for the stability of the financial sector. The NBB can also impose additional specific measures upon the company, including in relation to liquidity, solvency, risk concentration and risk positions, if the NBB determines that the company has an inadequate risk profile or if its policy can have a negative impact on the stability of the financial system.

For the purposes of Solvency II, as implemented in Belgium, a “qualifying holding” means a direct or indirect holding in an insurance or reinsurance company which represents 10% or more of the capital or of the voting rights or which makes it possible to exercise a significant influence over the management of the company. With respect to Athora Belgium, Solvency II, as implemented in Belgium, prohibits any person from acquiring, directly or indirectly, such a qualifying holding or from increasing an existing qualifying holding above the applicable thresholds (i.e. 20%, 30% and 50%) unless: (a) the proposed acquirer has notified the NBB of the acquisition; (b) the NBB has acknowledged receipt of that notification and; (c) either the statutory assessment period in relation to the acquisition has ended and the NBB has not notified the proposed acquirer that it opposes the acquisition, or the NBB has notified the proposed acquirer that it does not oppose the acquisition. If a proposed acquirer purports to complete a proposed acquisition in contravention of the aforementioned, as matter of Belgian law: (i) the competent business court can suspend the rights attached to the relevant shares, suspend a general meeting of shareholders that has already been convened or order the sale of the relevant shares to a third party that is not related to the proposed acquirer; and (ii) administrative and/or criminal sanctions may be imposed on the proposed acquirer or the company (as applicable).
Dutch Insurance Regulation. Apollo is deemed to hold an indirect qualifying holding in (i) Athora Netherlands N.V. (formerly known as: VIVAT N.V.), (ii) Proteq Levensverzekeringen N.V, and (iii) SRLEV N.V., which are either Dutch regulated insurance undertakings or a Dutch insurance holding company (together the “Regulated Dutch Entities”).
The indirect qualifying holding in the Regulated Dutch Entities is attributed to Apollo via its indirect interest in Athora, which is the 100% indirect parent company of the Regulated Dutch Entities. The Regulated Dutch Entities are subject to the relevant laws and regulations applicable to insurers or insurance holding companies in the Netherlands which regulate and mandate, among other things, eligibility criteria for investments, policy holder profit sharing arrangements, accounting principles, corporate governance requirements, regulatory capital, reporting, insurance contracts, insurance distribution requirements, consumer protection laws, data protection requirements (including GDPR), anti-money-laundering requirements, and sanction law requirements. The Regulated Dutch Entities are subject to supervision by the Dutch Central Bank (De Nederlandsche Bank, “DNB”) and the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (Autoriteit Financiële Markten, the “AFM”). DNB is responsible for the prudential supervision of the Regulated Dutch Entities and the AFM is responsible for business conduct supervision of the Regulated Dutch Entities. Both DNB and the AFM have wide powers to interpret and sanction financial regulatory laws in the Netherlands, in particular via issuing regulatory ordinances and guidelines as well as orders and decisions with a view to individual insurance undertakings or insurance holding companies.
For the purposes of Dutch financial regulatory law, a “qualifying holding” means a direct or indirect holding which represents 10% or more of the issued share capital in an insurance company or of the voting rights in an insurance company, or a comparable degree of control. With respect to the Dutch Regulated Entities, Dutch financial regulatory laws prohibit any person from acquiring, directly or indirectly, such qualifying holding or from increasing an existing qualifying holding above the applicable thresholds (i.e., 20%, 33% and 50%) unless: (a) the proposed acquirer has notified DNB of the acquisition; (b) DNB has acknowledged receipt of that notification; and (c) either the statutory assessment period in relation to the acquisition has ended and DNB has not notified the proposed acquirer that it opposes the acquisition, or DNB has notified the proposed acquirer that it does not oppose the acquisition. If a proposed acquirer purports to complete a proposed acquisition in contravention of the aforementioned, as a matter of Dutch law: (i) administrative and/or criminal sanctions may be imposed on the proposed acquirer or the company; and (ii) any exercise of powers based on the purported acquisition of the holding concerned can be annulled at the request of DNB.
Additional Insurance Regulated Jurisdictions. Aspen also carries on insurance business in jurisdictions located outside of the EU, U.K., Switzerland and the U.S. through its Jersey-domiciled insurance company subsidiary and its Singapore Lloyd’s service company, the branch locations of Aspen U.K., which operate in Australia, Canada, Singapore, in addition to its European branch located in Switzerland and the branch location of AUSSL, which operates in Dubai. Additionally, Catalina carries on insurance business in jurisdictions located outside of the EU, U.K., Switzerland and the U.S. through its Singapore-domiciled subsidiary Asia Capital Reinsurance Group Pte. Ltd., which in turn operates through its subsidiaries in Malaysia and through its branch office in South Korea. The operations of these subsidiaries and branches are subject to the local regulatory and supervisory schemes in the jurisdictions in which they operate, which vary widely from country to country; however, regulators typically grant licenses to operate and control an insurance business in that jurisdiction. In general, insurance regulators in these jurisdictions have the administrative power to supervise the registration of agents, regulation of product features and product approvals, asset allocation, minimum capital requirements, solvency and reserves, policyholder liabilities, and investments. Regulatory authorities may also regulate affiliations with other financial institutions, shareholder structures and may impose restrictions on declaring dividends and the ability to effect certain capital transactions, and many jurisdictions require insurance companies to participate in policyholder protection schemes.
German Banking Regulation. Apollo is deemed to be the holder an indirect qualifying (but not controlling) interest in the German bank Oldenburgische Landesbank AG (“OLB”).

Table of Contents

While the holder of a qualifying interest in a bank is not subject to the full scope of European and German financial regulatory supervision, certain limited requirements set out in, among others, the German Banking Act (Kreditwesengesetz) apply. Compliance with these rules is supervised by the German Federal Financial Services Authority (Bundesanstalt für Finanzdienstleistungsaufsicht), the German Central Bank (Deutsche Bundesbank) and the European Central Bank (the “ECB”). Under these requirements, holders of qualifying interest must, among others, (i) make certain notifications to the competent authorities (e.g., of the intention to reduce or increase the interest below or above certain thresholds, of the appointment of new authorized representatives or general partners, and in case control is obtained over certain other EEA regulated entities such as credit institutions or insurance companies), and (ii) maintain certain standards of reliability, transparency (enabling effective supervision), and financial stability.
Noncompliance with the aforementioned requirements may result in, among others, administrative fines or administrative measures such as a prohibition of the intended increase of a qualifying holding, a prohibition to exercise the voting rights in the bank, or mandatory divestment of the qualifying interest.
Slovenian Banking Regulation. Funds managed by Apollo hold a controlling stake in NOVA KREDITNA BANKA MARIBOR d.d. (“NKBM”), a Slovenian banking institution. As such, Apollo is considered to be a holder of an indirect qualifying interest in NKBM. NKBM is a significant supervised entity subject to direct supervision of the ECB. Under Regulation (EU) No 575/ 2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on prudential requirements for credit institutions and investment firms (“CRR”) and Regulation (EU) 2019/876 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 May 2019 amending Regulation (EU) No 575/2013 and Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 (“CRR2”), insofar it already entered into force, NKBM is also required to disclose relevant information and data on the consolidated situation at the level of Biser Topco S.a r.l., the indirect sole owner of NKBM (as the EU financial parent holding company).
While Apollo, as a holder of a qualifying interest in NKBM, is not subject to the full scope of the European and the Slovenian financial regulatory supervision, certain limited requirements set out in, among others, the Slovenian Banking Act (Zakon o bančništvu - “ZBan-2”) apply to Apollo. Compliance with these rules is supervised by the Bank of Slovenia (“BSI”) and the ECB. Under these requirements, holders of qualifying interest must make certain notifications to the competent authorities (i) of the intention to reduce the interest such that they would no longer hold a qualifying holding or their holding would fall below the lower limit (or above the higher limit) of the range for which authorization applies, (ii) on any merger or demerger in which they participate, (iii) on any material corporate change, and (iv) on any change which could affect the fulfilment of the requirements with respect to suitability of the qualifying holder.
Qualifying holders must obtain a new authorization to acquire a qualifying holding prior to any further acquisition of shares, directly or indirectly, based on which they would exceed the range to which a previously issued authorization to acquire a qualifying holding relates.
Noncompliance with the aforementioned requirements may result in, among others, administrative fines or administrative measures such as withdrawal of the authorization for the qualifying holding, rejection of a request to obtain or increase a qualifying holding, a prohibition to exercise the voting rights in the bank, a prohibition to exercise any rights from the shares in the bank, or mandatory disposal of the qualifying interest.

(“SPMP”), a regulated financial institution, incorporated in Spain and authorized as a consumer finance institution.

As such, SPMP is subject to prudential and conduct rules generally in line with banking regulations elsewhere in the EU and is under the supervision of the Bank of Spain.

(“AIME Lux”), a Luxembourg regulated entity, was incorporated by Apollo in Luxembourg on January 2, 2019 and received approval from the Luxembourg Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (“CSSF”) to carry out certain activities regulated by the CSSF (including managing and marketing AIFs and, subsequently, certain investment business licenses under MiFID (defined below)), with registration effective from such date. AIME Lux is subject to the regulatory requirements imposed, inter alia, by the AIFMD and MiFID, including with respect to conduct of business, regulatory capital, valuations, disclosures and marketing and rules on the structure of remuneration for certain personnel.
Failure to comply with the Luxembourg law having implemented the AIFMD, MiFID and associated rules such as relevant regulations, CSSF circulars and CSSF regulations (relating inter alia to the conduct of business, corporate governance, regulatory capital, valuations, disclosures and marketing) may result in criminal and administrative sanctions, fines and, in the case of significant breaches, in limitations on AIME Lux’s activities or in the loss of AIME Lux’s authorization, resulting in an inability to perform a significant portion of its business in Luxembourg and/or its liquidation.
Luxembourg regulated entities such as AIME Lux are also required to comply with the professional obligations set out in the Law of 12 November 2004 on the fight against money laundering and terrorist financing, as amended, including, inter alia, the obligations to: (i) conduct client due diligence (for both new and existing clients, as appropriate) and keep all the documents relating to this due diligence for at least five years after the end of the business relationship, (ii) possess an adequate and appropriate internal organization; and (iii) co-operate with the authorities.
When a natural or legal person who has taken a decision to acquire, directly or indirectly, any holding in a Luxembourg regulated entity for which a notification to the CSSF is required by law, such as AIME Lux, that represents 10% or more of the capital or of the voting rights of such entity (“Luxembourg Qualifying Holding”), a written notification must be submitted to the CSSF, indicating, inter alia, the size of the acquirer’s intended holding.
When a natural or legal person who has taken a decision to further increase, directly or indirectly, its holding as a result of which the proportion of the voting rights or of the capital held would reach or exceed 20%, 33⅓%, or 50%, or so that the entity would become their subsidiary (i.e., when the holder of the Luxembourg Qualifying Holding possesses, among others (without any limitation), a majority of the shareholder’s or member’s voting rights, rights to appoint the majority of the management board or other means of providing significant influence over the management of the regulated entity), a written notification must be submitted to the CSSF prior to such acquisition and is required to indicate, inter alia, the size of the intended holding and relevant information. After receiving the notification, the CSSF may, within the assessment period provided by the law applicable to the acquisition, confirm that it does not oppose the acquisition, apply certain conditions to the acquisition or oppose the proposed acquisition. In addition, Apollo agreed to inform the CSSF once it becomes aware of any natural or legal person acquiring shares in AGM Inc., representing an indirect holding of 10% or more of the capital or of the voting rights of an Apollo Luxembourg regulated entity for which a notification to the CSSF is required by law, including Luxembourg regulated entities that Apollo acquires in the future. For that purpose, the name of the relevant holder and the size of the holding will be disclosed to the CSSF. Such information does not replace the written notification to be submitted in the context of the acquisition of a Luxembourg Qualifying Holding or an increase thereof. Similar provisions apply to disposals or decreases in holdings.

Other Regulatory Considerations. Certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations of U.S. federal and state governments, non-U.S. governments, their respective agencies and/or various self-regulatory organizations or exchanges relating to, among other things, the privacy of client information, and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability and/or reputational damage. Our businesses have operated for many years within a legal framework that requires our being able to monitor and comply with a broad range of legal and regulatory developments that affect our activities.
However, additional legislation, changes in rules promulgated by self-regulatory organizations or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules, either in the United States or elsewhere, may directly affect our mode of operation and profitability. For additional information concerning the regulatory environment in which we operate, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Businesses—Extensive regulation of our businesses affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties. The possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens on our businesses.”
Rigorous legal and compliance analysis of our businesses and investments is important to our culture. We strive to maintain a culture of compliance through the use of policies and procedures, such as our code of ethics, compliance systems, communication of compliance guidance and employee education and training. We have a compliance group that monitors our compliance with the regulatory requirements to which we are subject and manages our compliance policies and procedures. Our Chief Compliance Officer supervises our compliance group, which is responsible for addressing all regulatory and compliance matters that affect our activities. Our compliance policies and procedures address a variety of regulatory and compliance risks such as the handling of material non-public information, personal securities trading, anti-bribery, anti-money laundering (including know-your-customer controls), valuation of investments on a fund-specific basis, document retention, potential conflicts of interest and the allocation of investment opportunities.
We generally operate without information barriers between our businesses. In an effort to manage possible risks resulting from our decision not to implement these barriers, our compliance personnel maintain a list of issuers for which we have access to material, non-public information and whose securities our funds and investment professionals are not permitted to trade. We could in the future decide that it is advisable to establish information barriers, particularly as our business expands and diversifies. In such event our ability to operate as an integrated platform will be restricted. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Businesses—Our failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest could damage our reputation and adversely affect our businesses.”
