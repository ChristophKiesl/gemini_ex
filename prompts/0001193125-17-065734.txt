ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

General 
 ACI Worldwide, Inc. (ACI, ACI Worldwide, the Company, we, us, or our) is a Delaware corporation incorporated in November 1993 under the name ACI Holding, Inc. ACI is largely the successor to Applied Communications, Inc. and Applied Communications Inc. Limited, which we acquired from Tandem Computers Incorporated on December 31, 1993. On July 24, 2007, we changed our corporate name from Transaction Systems Architects, Inc. to ACI Worldwide, Inc. We have been marketing our products and services under the ACI Worldwide brand since 1993 and have gained significant market recognition under this brand name. 
 We develop, market, install, and support a broad line of software products and solutions primarily focused on facilitating real-time electronic payments. Our payment capabilities, technologies, and solutions are marketed under the brand name Universal Payments, or UP, which describes the breadth and depth of ACIs product offerings. UP defines ACIs enterprise or universal payments capabilities targeting any channel, any network, and any payment type. ACI UP solutions empower customers to regain control, choice, and flexibility in todays complex payments environment, get to market more quickly, and reduce operational costs. 
 These products and services are used globally by financial institutions, merchants, billers and intermediaries, such as third-party electronic payment processors, payment associations, switch interchanges, and a wide range of transaction-generating endpoints, including automated teller machines (ATM), retail merchant point-of-sale (POS) terminals, bank branches, mobile phones, tablets, corporations, and internet commerce sites. The authentication, authorization, switching, settlement, fraud-checking, and reconciliation of electronic payments is a complex activity due to the large number of locations and variety of sources from which transactions can be generated, the large number of participants in the market, high transaction volumes, geographically dispersed networks, differing types of authorization, and varied reporting requirements. These activities are typically performed online and are conducted 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 
 ACI combines a global perspective with local presence to tailor electronic payment solutions for our customers. We believe that we have one of the most diverse and robust electronic payment product portfolios in the industry with application software spanning the entire payments value chain. We also believe that our strong financial performance has been attributable to our ability to design and deliver quality products and solutions coupled with our ability to identify and successfully consummate and integrate strategic acquisitions. 
 Fiscal 2016 Divestiture 
 On March 3, 2016, we completed the sale of our CFS assets and liabilities to Fiserv. The transaction included employee agreements and customer contracts as well as technology assets and intellectual property. The sale of CFS assets and liabilities enabled us to focus resources on our strategic products and new high-growth initiatives in support of large financial institutions and enablers, retailers, and billers worldwide. 
Recent Acquisitions 
 Fiscal 2015 Acquisition 
 PAY.ON 
 On November 4, 2015, we completed the acquisition of PAY.ON AG and its subsidiaries (PAY.ON). PAY.ON was a leader in eCommerce payments gateway solutions to payment service providers globally. Their advanced platform-based solution complements and strengthens the Companys UP Merchant Payments and UP eCommerce Payments. The combined entities provide customers the ability to deliver a seamless omni-channel customer payment experience in store, mobile, and online. 
Fiscal 2014 Acquisition 
 Retail Decisions 
 On August 12, 2014, we completed our acquisition of Retail Decisions Europe Limited and Retail Decisions, Inc. (collectively ReD) and all their subsidiaries. As a leader in fraud prevention solutions, the acquisition of ReD enhanced our UP strategy and further strengthened our leadership position in the fast-growing payments risk management space.

Target Markets 
 ACIs comprehensive electronic payment solutions serve three key markets: 
 Financial institutions 
 ACI provides payment solutions to large financial institutions globally for both retail banking and transaction banking services. Our solutions transform financial institutions complex payment environments to speed time to market, reduce costs, and deliver a consistent experience to customers across channels while enabling them to prevent and rapidly react to fraudulent activity. In addition, we enable financial institutions to meet the requirements of different real-time payment schemes and to quickly create differentiated products to meet consumer, business, and merchant demands. 
 Financial intermediaries 
 ACIs payment solutions support financial intermediaries, such as processors, networks, payment service providers (PSPs), and new financial technology (FinTech) entrants. We offer these customers scalable solutions that strategically position them to innovate and achieve growth and cost efficiency, while protecting them against fraud. Our solutions also allow new entrants in the digital marketplace to access innovative payment schemes, such as the U.K. Faster Payments New Access Model. 
 Merchants and Billers 
 ACIs support of merchants globally includes Tier 1 and Tier 2 merchants, online-only merchants and the PSPs, independent selling organizations (ISOs), value added resellers (VARs), and acquirers who service them. These customers operate in a variety of verticals, including general merchandise, grocery, hospitality, dining, transportation, and others. Our solutions provide merchants with a secure, omni-channel payments platform that gives them independence from third-party payment providers. We also offer secure solutions to online-only merchants that provide consumers with a convenient and seamless way to shop. Within the biller segment, ACI provides electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) services to billers operating in the consumer finance, insurance, healthcare, higher education, tax, and utility categories. Our solutions enable these customers to support a wide range of payment options and provide a painless consumer payments experience that drives consumer loyalty and increases revenue. 
Solutions 
 ACIs UP solutions span the payments ecosystem to support the electronic payment needs of financial institutions, financial intermediaries, merchants, and billers. Our strategic solutions include the following: 
 UP Retail Payments solution integrates ACIs UP BASE24-eps and UP Framework products, enabling financial institutions to accept and effectively and securely switch payment transactions at scale. 
 UP BASE24-eps is an enterprise-class payments platform that facilitates acquisition, authentication, switching, and authorization of financial transactions across multiple channels. The products modular, open architecture gives customers the freedom to select the application and system components required to operate their networks. UP BASE24-eps operates on International Business Machines (IBM) System z, IBM System p, Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) NonStop, Oracle Solaris, and x86/Linux servers, providing flexible integration points to other applications and data within enterprises to support 24-hour per day access to money, services, and information. 
 UP Framework is the bridge between ACIs legacy and next-generation UP BASE24-eps products, allowing customers to combine the features and functionalities of both in a coexistent environment. UP Framework is built on an open, service-oriented architecture, and is designed to help customers orchestrate the transformation of their own legacy payment environments. With UP Framework and UP BASE24-eps, customers can route payments to non-card identifiers such as account numbers, email addresses, or phone numbers to support person-to-person (P2P) payments, mobile payments, etc. The combined solution is also highly flexible, with development and configuration tools that simplify implementation and make it easy for customers to support new business opportunities. 
 UP Immediate Payments solution integrates ACIs UP BASE24-eps and UP Framework products configured for immediate payments, enabling financial institutions to connect to country-level, real-time payment schemes and to create differentiated products for consumers, businesses, and merchants. Through our aggregator services, the UP Immediate Payments solution also allows banks, FinTechs, and other payment intermediaries of all sizes to connect to the U.K. Faster Payments Scheme. 
 UP BASE24-eps, configured for the UP Immediate Payments solution, manages real-time payments as an extension of a financial institutions existing processing. Processing and clearing to the central infrastructure occur in real-time. Any payments message format can be mapped and processed, regardless of the format utilized by a particular country scheme.

UP Framework, combined with UP BASE24-eps, enables immediate payments customers to insulate their existing systems as they implement real-time processing. The combined solution is also highly flexible, with development and configuration tools that simplify implementation and make it easy for customers to support new business opportunities. 
 The UP Transaction Banking solution is an end-to-end platform that meets the complete channel and payment needs of a financial institutions business customers, including digital banking, wire transfer processing, supply chain finance, Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA) processing, Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) MX or MT, and fraud detection needs. ACI Universal Online Banker and ACI Money Transfer System are key components of the UP Transaction Banking solution. 
 Universal Online Banker is a comprehensive online payments portal financial institutions can flexibly package for small, medium, and large business customers as well as individual customers. The product allows these customers to use online tools to easily manage daily collections, disbursements, information reporting, and numerous other corporate cash management services. 
 Money Transfer System is a global payments engine that offers multi-bank, multi-currency, and 24x7 payment processing capabilities. Seamlessly integrated with multiple clearing and settlement mechanisms, Money Transfer System can connect to all recognized banking schemes. The product also facilitates SWIFT messaging. 
 UP Merchant Payments is ACIs direct-to-merchant solution designed to support omni-channel or online-only payment environments. The solution is an integration of ACIs Postilion, PAY.ON Payments Gateway, and ReD Shield strategic products for merchants and is deployed in the cloud. 
 Postilion is a payments platform that facilitates transactions generated at the point of purchase as well as related back-office functions. Configured for merchants, the products capabilities include prepaid, debit and credit card processing, ACH processing, electronic benefits transfer, card issuance and management, check authorization, customer loyalty programs, and returned check collection. Postilion operates on open system technologies such as Microsoft Windows and AIX, utilizing a modern, service-oriented architecture that gives customers the flexibility to evolve their business independent of third-party providers. 
 The PAY.ON Payments Gateway delivers global payments connectivity. Configured for merchants, the PAY.ON Payments Gateway connects Postilion to eCommerce and mCommerce channels and a payments network of more than 300 alternative payment methods and card acquirers in more than 160 countries. The product is based on open application programming interface (API) architecture which allows it to be integrated and configured with unprecedented speed and simplicity. 
 ReD Shield is a real-time fraud prevention solution that provides instant decisions (accept/challenge/deny) on eCommerce and mCommerce transactions. As part of the UP Merchant Payments solution, ReD Shield detects and manages domestic and cross-border payments fraud across all payment types. The product is managed by experienced, expert risk analysts and is tailored to meet the needs of individual merchants. Merchants can elect to combine ReD Shield with ACIs ReDi, an interactive, self-service business intelligence portal that gives them deep insight into their fraud activity, fraud prevention performance, and online customer activity. 
 UP eCommerce Payments solution is designed for PSPs, ISOs, VARs, acquirers, and others that offer payment services to their merchant customer base. The solution is an integration of the PAY.ON Payments Gateway and ReD Shield strategic products for merchants, is deployed in ACIs cloud, and is available as a white-label product. 
 The PAY.ON Payments Gateway delivers global payments connectivity, enabling PSPs, ISOs, VARs, and acquirers to fully outsource payments transaction processing and integrate a gateway-to-gateway solution. As describe above, the PAY.ON Payments Gateway is based on open API architecture, which allows it to be integrated and configured with unprecedented speed and simplicity. The product is modular, allowing PSPs and other customers to conveniently adapt it to any business need in any market or industry. 
 As described above, ReD Shield detects and manages domestic and cross-border payments fraud across all payment types. The product is managed by experienced, expert risk analysts and can be combined with ReDi. 
 UP Payments Risk Management is a comprehensive fraud prevention and detection solution designed for both financial institutions and merchants. At the core of our solution is ACIs Proactive Risk Manager, a comprehensive crime management solution that uses predictive analytics and expertly defined rules to help customers successfully identify and mitigate fraud. Our solution for merchants uses Proactive Risk Manager in conjunction with ReD Shield to help customers minimize risk across multiple channels in real time. 
 Proactive Risk Manager gives customers real-time visibility into threats across their enterprise, including issuer card fraud, check/deposit fraud, merchant acquirer fraud, internal fraud, and money laundering schemes. Proactive Risk Manager accepts transactions from any bank channel and is scalable, making it able to meet customers needs as they grow and pursue new opportunities.

UP Bill Payment solutions enable direct billers to present bills and collect payments from consumers electronically through a single, integrated platform that powers the entire bill payments operation. The solution overcomes internal application silos, providing a seamless consumer experience across all payment channels, payment types, and methods. Customers can use UP Bill Payment solutions to power one-time payments, recurring payments, service fee payments, disbursement services, remittance services, and eBilling. The solution also simplifies treasury management operations through a broad array of reconciliation, reporting, and payment servicing tools. UP Bill Payment solutions include industry-leading security, full payment card industry (PCI) compliance, and privacy practices. 
Delivery Options 
 Our software solutions are offered to our customers through either a traditional term software license arrangement where the software is installed and operated on the customer premises or through a hosting arrangement where the solution is maintained and delivered through the cloud via our global data centers. Some are available through both options. Solutions delivered through the cloud are available in either a single-tenant environment, known as a Software as a Service (SaaS) offering, or in a multi-tenant environment, known as a Platform offering. Pricing and payment terms depend on which solutions the customer requires and their transaction volumes. Generally, customers are required to commit to a minimum contract of three to five years. 
Partnerships and Industry Participation 
 We have two major types of third-party product partners: technology partners, with whom we work closely along with industry leaders who drive key industry trends and mandates, and business partners, with whom we either embed technology in ACI products, host third-party software in ACIs cloud as a part of our ACI on Demand (AOD) offering, or jointly market solutions that include the products of other companies. 
 Technology partners help us add value to our solutions, stay abreast of current market conditions and industry developments such as standards. Technology partner organizations include Diebold, Inc. (Diebold), NCR Corporation (NCR), Wincor-Nixdorf, VISA, MasterCard, and SWIFT. In addition, ACI has membership in or participates in the relevant committees of a number of industry associations, such as the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Interactive Financial eXchange Forum (IFX), International Payments Framework Association (IPFA), Banking Industry Architecture Network (BIAN), U.K. Cards Association, and the PCI Security Standards Council. These partnerships provide direction as it relates to the specifications that are used by the card schemes, and in some cases, manufacturers. These organizations typically look to ACI as a source of knowledge and experience to be shared in conjunction with creating and enhancing their standards. The benefit to ACI is in having the opportunity to influence these standards with concepts and ideas that will benefit ACI and ultimately our customers. 
 Business partner relationships extend our product portfolio, improve our ability to get our solutions to market and enhance our ability to deliver market-leading solutions. We share revenues with these business partners based on a number of factors related to overall value contribution in the delivery of the joint solution or payment type. The agreements with business partners include referral, resale, traditional original equipment manufacturer (OEM) relationships, and transaction fee based payment-enablement partnerships. These agreements generally grant ACI the right to create an integrated solution that we host or distribute, or provide ACI access to established payment networks or capabilities. The agreements are generally worldwide in scope and have a term of several years. 
 We have alliances with our technology partners HP, IBM, Microsoft Corporation, Red Hat, Inc., and Oracle USA, Inc. (Oracle), whose industry-leading hardware and software are utilized by ACIs products. These partnerships allow us to understand developments in the partners technology and to utilize their expertise in topics like scalability and performance testing.

 We distribute the products of other vendors where they complement our existing product lines. We are typically responsible for the sales and marketing of the vendors products, and agreements with these vendors generally provide for revenue sharing based on relative responsibilities. 
 Proprietary Rights and Licenses 
 We rely on a combination of trade secret and copyright laws, license agreements, contractual provisions, and confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We distribute our software products under software license agreements that typically grant customers nonexclusive licenses to use our products. Use of our software products is usually restricted to designated computers, specified locations and/or specified capacity, and is subject to terms and conditions prohibiting unauthorized reproduction or transfer of our software products. We also seek to protect the source code of our software as a trade secret and as a copyrighted work. Despite these precautions, there can be no assurance that misappropriation of our software products and technology will not occur. 
 In addition to our own products, we distribute, or act as a sales agent for, software developed by third parties. However, we typically are not involved in the development process used by these third parties. Our rights to those third-party products and the associated intellectual property rights are limited by the terms of the contractual agreement between us and the respective third party. 
 Although we believe that our owned and licensed intellectual property rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties, there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims against us. Further, there can be no assurance that intellectual property protection will be available for our products in all foreign countries. 
 Like many companies in the electronic commerce and other high-tech industries, third parties have in the past and may in the future assert claims or initiate litigation related to patent, copyright, trademark, or other intellectual property rights to business processes, technologies, and related standards that are relevant to us and our customers. These assertions have increased over time as a result of the general increase in patent claims assertions, particularly in the United States. Third parties may also claim that the third-partys intellectual property rights are being infringed by our customers use of a business process method that utilizes products in conjunction with other products, which could result in indemnification claims against us by our customers. Any claim against us, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, result in costly litigation, cause product delivery delays, require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements or pay amounts in settlement, or require us to develop alternative non-infringing technology. We could also be required to defend or indemnify our customers against such claims. A successful claim by a third party of intellectual property infringement or one of our customers could compel us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements, pay significant damages or even stop selling certain products and incur additional costs to develop alternative non-infringing technology. 
 Government Regulation 
 Certain of our solutions are subject to federal, state, and foreign regulations and requirements. 
 Oversight by Banking Regulators. As a provider of payment services to financial institutions, we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC), an interagency body of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the National Credit Union Administration and various state regulatory authorities as part of the Multi-Region Data Processing Servicer Program (MDPS). The MDPS program includes technology suppliers who provide mission critical applications for a large number of financial institutions that are regulated by multiple regulatory agencies. Periodic information technology examination assessments are performed using FFIEC Interagency guidelines to identify potential risks that could adversely affect serviced financial institutions, determine compliance with applicable laws and regulations that affect the services provided to financial institutions and ensure the services we provide to financial institutions do not create systemic risk to the banking system or impact the safe and sound operation of the financial institutions we process. In addition, independent auditors annually review several of our operations to provide reports on internal controls for our clients auditors and regulators. We are also subject to review under state and foreign laws and rules that regulate many of the same activities that are described above, including electronic data processing and back-office services for financial institutions and the use of consumer information.

Money Transfer. Our EBPP affiliate is registered as a Money Services Business. Accordingly, we are subject to the USA Patriot Act and reporting requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act and U.S. Treasury Regulations. These businesses may also be subject to certain state and local licensing requirements. The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, state attorneys general, and other agencies have enforcement responsibility over laws relating to money laundering, currency transmission, and licensing. In addition, most states have enacted statutes that require entities engaged in money transmission to register as a money transmitter with that jurisdictions banking department. We have implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with all applicable anti-money laundering laws and regulations. ACI has also implemented policies, procedures, and internal controls that are designed to comply with the regulations and economic sanctions programs administered by the U.S. Treasurys Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC), which enforces economic and trade sanctions against targeted foreign countries, entities and individuals based on external threats to the U.S. foreign policy, national security, or economy; by other governments; or by global or regional multilateral organizations, such as the United Nations Security Council and the European Union as applicable. 
Segment Information and Foreign Operations 
 We derive a significant portion of our revenues from foreign operations. For detail of revenue by geographic region see Note 11, Segment Information, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 
 Employees 
 As of December 31, 2016, we had a total of approximately 4,111 employees of whom 2,047 were in the Americas, 1,213 were in EMEA, and 851 were in Asia/Pacific. 
 None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. We believe that relations with our employees are good. 
 Available Information 
 Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the Exchange Act), are available free of charge on our website at www.aciworldwide.com as soon as reasonably practicable after we file such information electronically with the SEC. The information found on our website is not part of this or any other report we file with or furnish to the SEC. The public may read and copy any materials that we file with the SEC at the SECs Public Reference Room at 100 F Street, Room 1580, NW, Washington DC 20549. The public may obtain information on the operation of the Public Reference Room by calling the SEC at 1-800-SEC-0330. The SEC maintains an Internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at www.sec.gov.
