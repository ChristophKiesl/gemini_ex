Item 1. Business 
Background
Revlon, Inc. ("Revlon" and together with its subsidiaries, the "Company") conducts its business exclusively through its direct wholly-owned operating subsidiary, Revlon Consumer Products Corporation ("Products Corporation") and its subsidiaries. Revlon is an indirect majority-owned subsidiary of MacAndrews & Forbes Incorporated (together with certain of its affiliates other than the Company, "MacAndrews & Forbes"), a corporation beneficially owned by Ronald O. Perelman. Mr. Perelman is Chairman of Revlon's and Products Corporation's Board of Directors. 
The Company was founded over 90 years ago by Charles Revson, who revolutionized the cosmetics industry by introducing nail enamels matched to lipsticks in fashion colors. Today, the Company continues Revson's legacy by producing and marketing innovative products that address consumers' wants and needs for beauty and personal care products.
The Company is a leading global beauty company with an iconic portfolio of brands. The Company develops, manufactures, markets, distributes and sells worldwide an extensive array of beauty and personal care products, including color cosmetics, hair color, hair care and hair treatments, fragrances, skin care, beauty tools, men’s grooming products, anti-perspirant deodorants and other beauty care products across a variety of distribution channels. The Company is entrepreneurial, agile and boldly creative, with a passion for beauty. The Company has a diverse portfolio of iconic brands that it continues to evolve and transform, with the goal of inspiring and attracting consumers around the world wherever and however they shop for beauty. The Company is committed to operating as an ethical business and driving sustainable and responsible growth. 
Business Strategy
The Company remains focused on its 3 key strategic pillars to drive its future success and growth. First, strengthening its iconic brands through innovation and relevant product portfolios; second, building its capabilities to better communicate and connect with its consumers through media channels where they spend the most time; and third, ensuring availability of its products where consumers shop, both in-store and increasingly online. The Company has continued to deliver against the objectives of the Revlon 2020 Restructuring Program (subsequently renamed during 2021 the Revlon Global Growth Accelerator, “RGGA”, as herein after defined), which includes rightsizing our organization with the objectives of driving improved profitability, cash flow and liquidity. The Company is also managing the business to conserve cash and liquidity, as well as continuing to focus on stabilizing the business, growing e-commerce and preparing the foundation for achieving future growth.
Strategic Review 
MacAndrews & Forbes and the Company continue to explore strategic transactions involving the Company and third parties. This review is ongoing and remains focused on exploring potential options for the Company's portfolio and regional brands (the “Strategic Review”).

Marketing 
The Company uses various marketing techniques depending on the brand, type of product or target customer, among other variables. For its mass retail products, the Company markets its extensive product lines covering a broad range of price points within large volume retailers and e-commerce sites in the U.S. and within large volume retailers and other retailers internationally. The Company uses social media and other digital marketing, television, outdoor and print advertising and public relations and influencer marketing, as well as point-of-sale merchandising, including displays and samples, coupons and other trial incentives. The Company coordinates its marketing and advertising campaigns for new product launches and innovation with an omni-channel approach. The Company develops, jointly with retailers, customized, tailored point-of-purchase and other focused marketing programs.
The Company also uses cooperative advertising programs, Company-paid or Company-subsidized demonstrators and coordinates in-store promotions and displays. Other marketing strategies, including trial-size products and couponing, are designed to introduce the Company's newest products to consumers and encourage trial and purchase in-store.
For Elizabeth Arden products, the Company’s approach is focused on generating strong retailer and consumer demand across its key brands. The Company emphasizes a competitive marketing mix for each brand and implements plans that are designed to ensure that each brand's positioning is carried through consistently across all consumer touch points. The Company is increasingly leveraging new media, such as social networking and mobile and digital applications, along with traditional consumer reach vehicles, such as television and magazine print advertising, to engage with its consumers through their personally-preferred technologies. Marketing programs for the Company's Elizabeth Arden brands are also integrated with significant cooperative advertising programs that the Company plans and executes with its retailers, often linked with new product innovation and promotions.
For products primarily sold to professional salons and distributors, the Company markets products through educational seminars on such products' application methods and consumer benefits. In addition, the Company uses professional trade advertising, social media and other digital marketing, displays and samples to communicate to professionals and consumers the quality and performance characteristics of its products. In some countries, the Company's direct sales force provides customers with point of sale communication and merchandising for its professional products.
The Company believes that its presence in professional salons benefits the marketing and sale of its products sold through other channels, such as mass retailers or specialty stores, as it enables the Company to improve many of its other product categories, such as hair color, hair care, nail color, nail care and skin care. The presence of regional brands internationally provides the Company with broader brand, geographic coverage and retail diversification beyond large volume retailers, among others.
