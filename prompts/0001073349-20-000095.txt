Our Products and Services 
        The following is a summary of our major product offerings, however, we continue to innovate and adapt our solutions as standards, customer needs and technology evolve.
Payment Platforms 
        Paymode-X is a SaaS solution that helps over 425,000 businesses pay and get paid. Our Paymode-X solution allows businesses to easily transition from legacy invoice-to-pay processes, maximizing cost-savings, efficiency and security. Businesses can streamline invoice receipt, automate workflows, accelerate approvals, and make virtual card, automated clearing house (ACH), and check payments using a single integrated solution. Paymode-X customers gain immediate benefits because many of their vendors are already part of the Paymode-X network and can begin to be paid electronically on day one. Our vendor enrollment process leverages our proprietary Intelligent Engagement Model which includes predictive analytics, tailored digital campaign processes and tools designed to maximize vendor adoption. Our solution leverages known payment type preferences across member businesses in order for customers to settle vendor payments utilizing a mix of virtual card, automated clearing house (ACH), check and wire payments that will yield the greatest financial and efficiency gains. AP departments can improve payment processing security and compliance with comprehensive payment risk scoring and integrated vendor authentication and fraud prevention services. Their vendors benefit from convenient invoice submission, payment, and remittance options which streamline their receivables processes. A number of leading financial institutions partner with us to resell Paymode-X capabilities to their corporate clients and we license Paymode-X through our internal sales team directly to corporate customers. We have commercial relationships with both Visa and Mastercard and are able to offer both options to financial institutions as part of an overall Paymode-X solution while also having the ability to offer Visa capabilities directly to corporate customers. 
        Our financial messaging solutions leverage multiple payment networks and schemes, including SWIFT global messaging, Faster Payments, Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), BACS and others to allow banks and corporations to exchange financial information, including payment instructions, cash reporting and other messages to facilitate transaction settlement with banks and counterparties around the world. Our financial messaging solutions allow banks and corporations to achieve lower costs, rapid implementation, greater security and improved risk management, while avoiding the costly internal infrastructure typical of legacy, on-premise solutions.
Our PTX solutions offer organizations of any size simple, secure and efficient ways to pay and get paid. These solutions enable businesses to efficiently manage key business processes such as payments, accounts payable and accounts receivable. PTX is designed to incorporate regulatory changes such as the UK New Payments Architecture as well as innovation driven changes such as Open Banking, leveraging these changes to facilitate consolidated views of bank accounts across the world. With new ways to pay including payment initiation service provider and request to pay, PTX enables companies to establish new payment relationships with customers.
Banking Solutions
        Our digital banking solutions are designed to engage intelligently with customers, deliver a unified digital experience as well as acquire, deepen and grow profitable relationships.
Digital Banking IQ is our complete solution for digital banking transformation. From actionable insights to faster onboarding, Digital Banking IQ is a leading intelligent engagement platform for banking and payments. It is a customer-centric, cloud platform based on the pillars of cash management, payments innovation, digital banking, relationship management, rich customer insights and experiences, data connectivity, and risk mitigation.

        We enable banks of all sizes to offer their customers a host of capabilities including ACH and BACS payments, wires, international payments, check production, fraud prevention, customer acquisition, balance and information reporting and other features that facilitate enterprise-wide cash management and interaction with their customers. Digital Banking IQ allows our bank customers to attract and service a full range of client segments from small businesses to multi-nationals. These solutions feature an intuitive user 
interface designed to simplify all aspects of payments and cash management for customers of all sizes and sophistication, through both browser-based and mobile channels.
Legal Spend Management
        Our legal spend management solutions integrate with claims management and time and billing systems to automate legal invoice management processes and to provide insight into all areas of a company’s outside legal spend. Insurance carriers, third-party administrators and self insureds use these solutions to better manage legal costs, determine which costs are accurate and where errors or overcharges exist. The combination of automated invoice routing and a sophisticated rules engine allows corporate legal and insurance claims departments to create more efficient processes for managing invoices generated by law firms and other service providers, while offering insight into important legal spend factors including expense monitoring and outside counsel performance. We continue to expand the capabilities of these offerings to leverage predictive analytics to facilitate the selection and retention of counsel, forecast claim settlement and litigation expense and augment the management and budgeting of litigation matters.
Fraud Solutions
        Our fraud solutions non-invasively monitor, replay and analyze user behavior and payment transactions to flag and even stop suspicious activity in real time. These solutions are highly configurable and create accountability by recording and analyzing each application interaction and screen view, reducing the risk of theft, information leakage, internal and external fraud, as well as decreasing the cost of regulatory compliance. Case management capabilities centralize risk management, speed investigations, and facilitate compliance with regulations pertaining to Anti Money Laundering (AML), SWIFT CSP, PSD2, FATF16/WTR2, Basel II, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and Know Your Customer (KYC).
Payment and Document Automation
        Our payment and document automation solutions generate a wide variety of domestic and international payment instructions along with consolidated bank reporting of cash activity. These solutions reduce administrative expenses and strengthen compliance and anti-fraud controls. Users are able to gather and access data via the web related to payment and bank account information, including account totals and detailed transaction data, providing improved workflow, financial reporting and bank communications.
To augment financial workflow, we also offer a number of solutions designed to automate a wide variety of business documents and supply chain processes as well as a related web-based delivery and document archive. Our products offer advanced design, output formatting and delivery capabilities to replace paper-based forms, as well as automating the labor-intensive accounts payable processing of invoices.

Our Competition 
        The markets in which we participate are highly competitive. We believe our ability to compete depends on factors within and beyond our control, including:
•our ability to develop new, innovative and feature-rich technology solutions that meet the evolving needs of our customers and the shifting dynamics of the markets we participate in;
•our ability to attract and retain employees with the requisite domain knowledge and technical skill set necessary to develop and support our products;
•the capabilities, performance, reliability, features, ease-of-use and price of our offerings as compared to competitor alternatives;
•our industry knowledge and expertise;
•the execution of our sales and customer success organizations; and
•the timing and market acceptance of new products as well as enhancements to existing products, by us and by our current and future competitors.
        For our payment platforms, our principal competitors include AvidXchange, Bill.com, C2FO, Commerce Bank, CSI Enterprises, Eastnets, Finastra, Form 3, GHX, JPMorgan Chase, MineralTree, SWIFT, Swisscom, Tipalti, US Bank Payments Plus, and Wells Fargo. 
 For our banking solutions we primarily compete with companies such as ACI Worldwide, Backbase, Finastra, FIS, Fiserv, Jack Henry, MeridianLink, NCR, Polaris, and Q2. 
        For our legal spend management solutions, we compete with a number of companies, including Wolters Kluwer ELM Solutions, LexisNexis, Mitratech, Quovant, DXC Legal Solutions and Caseglide.
        For our fraud solutions, we primarily compete with NICE Actimize, Norkom, SAS, Guardian Analytics and FairWarning.

We also compete with providers of ERP solutions and providers of traditional payment products.
        We believe that we compete favorably in each of the markets in which we participate, however the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change and a number of factors could adversely affect our ability to compete in the future, including those discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Our Segments
        Operating segments are the components of our business for which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. Our chief operating decision maker is our chief executive officer. Our operating segments are generally organized by the type of product or service offered and by geography.
During the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020, we realigned our internal financial reporting and changed the manner in which financial information related to our PTX solutions is presented to our chief executive officer. This resulted in PTX solutions operating activity being reclassified into our Cloud Solutions segment rather than our Payments and Documents segment. To ensure a consistent presentation of the measurement of segment revenues and profit or loss, this change is reflected for all financial periods presented.
        Similar operating segments have been aggregated into four reportable segments as follows: 
        Cloud Solutions. Our Cloud Solutions segment provides customers with SaaS technology offerings that facilitate electronic payments, electronic invoicing, and spend management. Our payment platforms (Paymode-X, PTX and financial messaging) are included in this segment. These solutions are highly scalable, secure and cost effective and facilitate cash payment and transaction settlement between businesses, their vendors and banks. Our legal spend management solutions, which enable customers to create more efficient processes for managing invoices generated by outside law firms while offering insight into important legal spend factors such as expense monitoring and outside counsel performance, are also included within this segment. Revenue within this segment is generally recognized on a subscription or transaction basis.
Banking Solutions. Our Banking Solutions segment provides solutions that are specifically designed for banking and financial institution customers. Our Banking Solutions products are sold predominantly on a hosted basis, with revenue recognized on a subscription or transaction basis. 
Payments and Documents. Our Payments and Documents segment supplies financial business process management software solutions, including making and collecting payments, sending and receiving invoices, and generating and storing business documents. This segment also provides a range of standard professional services that complement and enhance our core software products. When licensed for on-premise deployment, software license revenue is typically recorded upon delivery of the software and commencement 
of the license term, professional services revenue is normally recorded as we perform the work and software support and maintenance revenue is recorded ratably over the support period. If the solution is hosted by us, we typically record revenue over time.
        Other. Our Other segment consists of our fraud solutions and our healthcare solutions. The fraud solutions results reported in this segment reflect the revenue contribution from the legacy sales channel we acquired and the burden of certain other centralized costs; however these solutions are sold as part of all of our operating segments. Our healthcare solutions focus on eliminating paper intensive processes and providing electronic signature and mobile document capabilities to allow healthcare organizations to improve efficiency and reduce costs. Software revenue for perpetual licenses of our fraud and healthcare products is typically recorded upon delivery of the software and commencement of the license term. Professional services revenue is recorded as we perform the work and software support and maintenance revenue is recorded ratably over the support period, which is normally twelve months.
Sales and Marketing 
        We market and sell our products directly through our sales force and indirectly through a variety of channel partners and reseller relationships. We market and sell our products domestically and internationally, with an international focus on the United Kingdom and continental Europe. As of June 30, 2020, we employed 453 sales and marketing employees worldwide, of whom 245 were focused on North American markets, 180 were focused on the United Kingdom and continental Europe markets and 28 were focused on Asia-Pacific and Middle East markets. 
Product Development and Engineering
        Our product development and engineering organization includes employees as well as strategic development partners who provide a flexible supplement to our internal resources. We have three primary development groups: product design and user experience, software engineering and quality assurance. Our teams work collaboratively, integrating design thinking approaches with development operations and scaled agile practices, to deliver validated solutions to our customers. We expensed $73.0 million, $67.4 million and $57.5 million in product development and engineering costs in fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In fiscal year 2021 we expect product development and engineering costs to increase as we continue to enhance our products and develop new, innovative, feature-rich solutions.
        Our product design and user experience team is extensively involved in the design of all of our products, driving the user-centered design process to ensure elegant, engaging and intuitive, easy-to-use products. Part of this process is user experience testing that is conducted to provide additional productivity gains for the end user.
        Our software engineers have substantial experience in advanced software development techniques as well as extensive knowledge of the complex processes involved in business document workflow, cash management, payment and invoicing applications. They maintain extensive knowledge of software development trends and best practices, including management of iterative development cycles and lean UX approaches to obtain customer feedback as early as possible. Our technologies focus on providing business solutions utilizing industry standards, providing a path for extendibility and scalability of our products. The team focused on applying relevant technologies to uniquely make our customers more successful. Security, control and fraud prevention, as well as performance, data management and resource efficiencies are priorities in the solutions we develop and deploy.
        Our quality assurance engineers have extensive knowledge of our products and expertise in software quality assurance techniques. The quality assurance team participates in all phases of our product development processes. Members of the quality assurance group make use of both manual and automated software testing techniques to ensure high-quality software is being delivered to our customers. The quality assurance group members participate in alpha and beta releases, testing of new product releases and performance and security testing for our products. Our process promotes an end-to-end design to delivery pipeline view that connects these critical product development and engineering functions to our product management, delivery, operations and support organizations so that all share a common vision of customer-focused success.
Proprietary Rights 
        We use a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to help establish and protect our proprietary rights in our technology and products. During fiscal year 2020, we added 2 patents to our portfolio. In total, we currently hold 37 U.S. patents as well as 8 foreign equivalent patents in Europe, Israel and India. We expect to receive other patents and we have 43 applications pending before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. The earliest year of expiration of any of our remaining patents is 2021.
        We intend to continue to file patent applications as we identify patentable technology. There can be no assurance, however, that our existing patent applications, or others that we may file in the future, will issue or will be of sufficient scope and strength to provide meaningful protection to our technology or any commercial advantage to us, or that the issued patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. In addition, we rely upon a combination of copyright and trademark laws and non-disclosure and other intellectual property contractual arrangements to help protect our proprietary rights. Given the rapidly changing nature of the industry’s technology, the creative abilities of our development, marketing and service personnel may be as or more important to our competitive position as are the legal protections and rights afforded by patents. We enter into agreements with our employees and clients that seek to limit and protect our intellectual property and the distribution of proprietary information. However, there can be no 
assurance that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to deter misappropriation of proprietary information and we may not be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our proprietary rights.
Government Regulation 
        Our U.S. chartered financial institution customers are federally regulated by either the Federal Reserve (FED), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), the National Credit Union Association (NCUA) or the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Our non U.S. based financial institution customers are normally subject to a similar regulatory oversight within their respective country of domicile. We are subject to periodic examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) interagency in our capacity as a technical financial service provider, during which our operating practices are risk-assessed and compared against applicable laws and regulations. If as part of such an examination we were to receive a material unfavorable regulatory rating, our customers may be advised by their direct federal regulators to reassess their commercial relationships with us, including the continued use of our products.
        Each of our operating segments provides services and/or products that may be subject to various federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, particularly in the area of data security and privacy. These laws and regulations govern the collection, processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal information as well as notification requirements in the event of security breaches. For example, we are subject to periodic General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance examinations by the Information Commissioner Office (ICO) and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in our capacity as a technical financial service provider processing and/or storing financial data within a European Union (EU) and/or European Economic Area (EEA) country. The legal and regulatory framework in these areas is complex and continually evolving, particularly with respect to data security, payment technology and payment methodologies. We are also subject to regulatory obligations such as Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) in Switzerland and Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) in Canada. We may become subject to new or increased regulation in the future, and the cost of complying with current or future regulatory requirements could be significant. Our products and services must be designed to work effectively within this legal framework and the regulatory framework that our customers operate within.
Employees 
        As of June 30, 2020, we had approximately 2,000 full-time employees. None of our employees are represented by a labor union. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we believe that employee relationships are good. Our future success will depend in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly-qualified technical and managerial personnel in a very competitive market.
