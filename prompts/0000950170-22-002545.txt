Item 1. Business
Overview
 We are a bi-coastal contract development and manufacturing organization, or CDMO, with capabilities spanning pre-Investigational New Drug, or IND, development to commercial manufacturing and packaging for a wide range of therapeutic dosage forms with a primary focus in the area of small molecules. With an expertise in solving complex manufacturing problems, we are a leading CDMO providing development, end-to-end regulatory support, clinical and commercial manufacturing, aseptic fill/finish, lyophilization, packaging and logistics services to the global pharmaceutical market. In addition to our experience in handling DEA-controlled substances and developing and manufacturing advanced dosage forms, we have the expertise to deliver on our clients’ pharmaceutical development and manufacturing projects, regardless of complexity level. We do all of this in our best-in-class facilities that, in the aggregate, total 145,000 square feet, in Gainesville, Georgia and San Diego, California.
 We currently manufacture the following key products with our key commercial partners: Ritalin LA®, Focalin XR®, Verelan PM®, Verelan SR®, Verapamil PM, Verapamil SR, Donnatal liquids and tablets and Scot-Tussin cough and cold liquids, as well as supporting numerous development stage products.
 During the third quarter of 2021, we acquired IriSys, LLC, or IriSys, an independent San Diego-based CDMO, with significant capabilities beyond oral solid dose, including sterile and non-sterile injectables, liquid and powder filled capsules, tablets, oral liquids, liposomes and nano/micro-particles, topical formulations and ophthalmic droppers. In 2020, we launched our clinical trials support services capabilities, which includes preparation of clinical trial supplies, as well as specialized services dedicated to the development and current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, of high-potency products.
 Our manufacturing and development capabilities include formulation, product development from formulation through clinical trial and commercial manufacturing, and specialized capabilities for solid oral dosage forms, extended release and controlled substance manufacturing, as well as high potency development and manufacturing. With the acquisition of IriSys, our capabilities have been expanded beyond oral solid dose to include sterile injectables oral liquids, tablets, topicals, liquid/powder filled capsules, ophthalmic droppers, liposomes and nano/microparticles. In addition, the acquisition adds new capabilities in the areas of aseptic fill/finish and lyophilization and established bi-coastal footprint from which to better serve clients within the U.S., as well as globally. In a typical collaboration between us and our commercial partners, we work with our partners to
   develop product candidates or new formulations of existing product candidates. We also typically exclusively manufacture and supply clinical and commercial supplies of these proprietary products and product candidates.
 
Our Strategy
 The CDMO market is large and growing and is expected to continue to expand as outsourced penetration is seen due to biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies outsourcing more of their operations. We believe companies, which include our customers and prospective customers, generally prefer fewer, higher quality suppliers with expertise in addressing their formulation and manufacturing challenges early in the development cycle. Our strategy for growth in this market includes executing segment-specific sales and marketing strategies; building stronger visibility and an updated identity for the organization; enhancing both our customers’ and employees’ experience working with and for the company; and continuing to achieve growth and strengthen our financial position. This strategic mission is comprised of five key objectives:
 •Market Segmentation & Corporate Identity. We are re-aligning our sales strategy to be more successful in each of the specific market segments that we serve. There are three discrete market segments that we currently support: (i) commercial oral solid dose products; (ii) our legacy profit-sharing products such as Verapamil; and (iii) early-stage development clients for whom we provide development services. Our strategy calls for the development and execution of specific, targeted sales strategies for each segment. The decision making processes, key drivers and ways we are measured by our customers are different enough for each of these three segments that we believe using this differentiated and focused approach will be most effective for our customer base and our ability to optimize our operational and resource prioritization. Additionally, we are working towards improving our identity and brand in the biopharma market to more effectively communicate our evolution as a partner to our clients as well as to our people, both present and future.
 •Capabilities Optimization and Expansion. Building on the groundwork laid in 2021, we are working to optimize our organizational structure and expand our capabilities. We have created and expect to continue to expand strong synergies and efficiencies in our sales and marketing, quality and regulatory systems, human resources and people engagement practices, environmental health and safety policies, business systems and operational excellence processes. We will also continue to enhance our current capabilities and expand our operations to accommodate our growing customer base and attract new customers. We are structuring our organization to ensure execution and delivery of success including identifying opportunities for automation and digitalization of processes and ways of working. We also plan to expand our capabilities by identifying additional acquisition or expansion opportunities to broaden our offerings and grow our base of business. 
 •Client Experience and Trust. We intend to further improve our customer experience. While we have long enjoyed our reputation as a high-quality partner, we believe that there is always room to improve. It is our goal to strengthen our client interactions, create unparalleled trust and establish valuable partnerships from process development through commercialization. It is also important that, where it makes sense, we harmonize the experience our clients have at each of our sites. We have effective approaches to client communications and project management and want to deploy those approaches consistently across our organization.
 •Employee Experience and Culture. We aspire to establish an industry-leading employee experience and corporate culture. As our employees drive our success, it is our goal to create an inspiring, flexible and rewarding experience for everyone at our company. In doing so, we believe we will strengthen both recruitment, employee engagement and retention, leading to a better workplace, better performance and better outcomes for our clients and for our company’s financial performance.
 •Financial Strength. We will continue to take steps to improve our financial strength. We will continue to carefully manage our cash, work to reduce our debt, and engage in a consistent and transparent fashion with the investment community.
Our Competitive Strengths
 We believe that the strong relationships we have with our commercial partners result from of our competitive strengths. In particular:
 •Our Operational Excellence. We maintain a commitment to continually improve productivity and customer service levels and maintain excellent quality and regulatory compliance systems. We measure our operational excellence 

   using industry-standard performance indicators such as our on time, in full delivery rate. We believe that our strong historical track record for operational excellence differentiates us from our competitors.
 •Focus on Specialized Markets. We participate in specialized markets where significant technical expertise provides a competitive advantage. This includes differentiated drug delivery, controlled substance and complex formulation. One of our core areas of expertise is modified release oral solid dosage form development and manufacturing and custom release profile development, including for DEA controlled substance products. We developed extended, controlled and sustained release mechanisms and other intellectual property for several current commercial products. 
 •Our Longstanding Relationships with Our Partners. We continue to maintain longstanding, collaborative relationships with our customers. We believe this allows us to leverage our extensive experience and deep knowledge of their business to better address our commercial partners’ business and developmental goals.
 •Our Integrated Full-Service Development and Manufacturing Facilities. We believe pharmaceutical companies generally prefer to engage with CDMOs that are able to work with a product throughout its lifecycle and have experienced a reliable track record of regulatory compliance and quality control first-hand. Our early-stage development and high-potency business feeds clinical and commercial manufacturing opportunities to our manufacturing business. We believe that by providing customers with a broad range of services from benchtop through commercial launch and supply, we can best support the needs of our customers throughout the lifecycle of their products. We provide fully-integrated and customized biomanufacturing services that support our customers from the early preclinical stage through commercial launch and supply. Our services are all supported by modern facilities designed to meet customer needs from early stage development to commercial supply.
 •Our Customer-Centric, Consultative Approach. We are highly collaborative throughout the product lifecycle, guiding our commercial partners through the development process towards commercialization, including support and guidance on regulatory matters and chemistry, manufacturing and controls, or CMC, regulatory document preparation. In particular, we provide differentiated capabilities across a broad array of services that support the ability to serve our commercial partners through the entire development spectrum.

(collectively "Advanz"), pursuant to which we continued our multi-year relationship as the exclusive supplier of Donnatal to Advanz for sale in the United States. Under the agreement, we are Advanz's exclusive manufacturer of Donnatal and its authorized generic version until February 3, 2025. Both we and Advanz may terminate this Agreement for any reason at any time by giving the other party not less than twenty-four months prior written notice.
Backlog
 Our backlog represents, as of a point in time, future revenue from work not yet completed under clinical and pre-clinical signed contracts. As of December 31, 2021, our backlog was approximately $24 million. While we anticipate the majority of our backlog will be recognized during fiscal year 2022, our backlog is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to: the risk that a customer timely cancels its commitments prior to our initiation of manufacturing services, in which case we may be required to refund some or all of the amounts paid to us in advance under those canceled commitments; and the risk that a customer may experience delays in its program(s) or otherwise, which could result in the postponement of anticipated manufacturing services; the risk that we may not successfully execute on all customer projects; and the risk of a potential negative impact from the COVID-19 global pandemic, any of which could have a negative impact on our liquidity, reported backlog and future revenue and profitability.
Permits and Regulatory Approvals
 We are required to comply with the regulatory requirements of various local, state, national and international regulatory bodies having jurisdiction in the countries or localities where we manufacture products or where our customers’ products are distributed. In particular, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning research and development, testing, manufacturing processes, equipment and facilities, including compliance with cGMPs, labeling and distribution, import and export, and product registration and listing. As a result, our facilities are subject to regulation by the FDA, as well as regulatory bodies of other jurisdictions in which we operate.
 We hold various licenses and registrations for our manufacturing activities. The primary licenses and registrations held are FDA Registrations of Drug Establishments and DEA Controlled Substance Registration. Due to certain U.S. state law requirements, we also hold certain state licenses for distribution activities throughout certain states. We also hold cGMP certifications for EU importation of products made in Gainesville for sale in the EU and an ANVISA certification for sale in Brazil. Compliance with these licensing and regulatory requirements is a key aspect of our business and, if there are changes in the regulations applicable to our business in the United States or other jurisdictions, we may be required to obtain additional approvals or operate according to different manufacturing or operating standards or pay additional fees. This may require a change in our manufacturing techniques or additional capital investments in our facilities.
 In certain of our commercial partnerships, our commercial partner is the product authorization holder for products that have been developed on behalf of the commercial partner. In other commercial partnerships, we are the authorization holder. When our commercial partner holds the relevant authorization from the FDA or other national regulator, we support this authorization by furnishing a letter of reference to the Drug Master File, or the chemistry, manufacturing and related data to the relevant regulator or sponsor to provide adequate manufacturing support in respect of the product. We generally update this information annually with the relevant regulator.

   We hold the approved NDAs for Verelan SR and Verelan PM, which we license to Lannett and Teva, respectively. Verapamil SR and Verapamil PM are authorized generics.
 Environmental and Safety Matters
 Certain products manufactured by us involve the use, storage and transportation of toxic or hazardous material. Our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the storage, handling, emissions, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment and the maintenance of safe working conditions. We maintain environmental and industrial safety and health compliance programs and training at our facilities.
 Prevailing legislation tends to hold companies primarily responsible for the proper disposal of their waste even after transfer to third party waste disposal facilities. Other future developments, such as increasingly strict environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and enforcement policies, could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us and could subject the handling, manufacture, use, reuse or disposal of substances or pollutants at our facilities to more rigorous scrutiny than at present.
 Intellectual Property
 We own several issued patents in the United States and several foreign patent applications. The products we produce for our commercial partners are also typically covered by patents and patent applications owned by them. Although certain patents may have expired or may expire in the future, we believe there are other barriers to entry for our commercial partners and competition, including ownership of regulatory filings, NDAs, abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs, and drug master files, or DMFs, manufacturing trade secrets, proprietary dosage strengths, pricing limitations in various geographies, costs to revalidate with another supplier, maturity and life-cycle stage of products. We have acquired and developed and continue to acquire and develop knowledge and expertise and trade secrets in the provision of formulation, process development and manufacturing services. We intend to rely on a combination of patents and trade secrets, as well as confidentiality agreements and license agreements, to protect our proprietary know-how.
Competition
 The contract development and manufacturing industry for pharmaceuticals is intensely competitive and highly regulated. Our current and future competitors include other CDMOs as well as segments of larger pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we have, such as more commercial resources, larger staff and more extensive marketing and manufacturing organizations.
We compete with other CDMOs such as Adare Pharma Solutions, Avara Pharmaceutical Services, BioDuro-Sundia, Bioserv, CoreRx, Frontage Laboratories, Metrics Contract Services, Pharmaceutics International and Quotient Sciences, segments of larger companies such as Patheon (a segment of ThermoFisher Scientific) and Catalent, as well as other development and manufacturing service providers.
   Government Regulation
 Governmental authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level, and the equivalent regulatory authorities in other countries, extensively regulate the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, distribution, marketing, export and import of prescription drugs, such as those we are developing and manufacturing. Any drug products developed or manufactured by us are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, which impose procedural and documentation requirements. The FDA or other regulatory agencies can delay approval of a drug if our manufacturing facilities are not able to demonstrate compliance with cGMPs, pass other aspects of pre-approval inspections (i.e., compliance with filed submissions) or properly scale up to produce commercial supplies. Drug manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic announced and unannounced inspections by the FDA and state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other regulations. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMPs and other aspects of regulatory compliance. Failure to comply with applicable requirements may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer or holder of an approved NDA, including withdrawal of product approval, recall or seizure of the product or other voluntary, FDA‑initiated or judicial action that could delay or prohibit further operations.
The Drug Supply Chain Security Act, or DSCSA, added new sections to the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, that require manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, dispensers, and third-party logistics providers to take steps to identify and trace certain prescription drugs to protect against the threats of counterfeit, stolen, contaminated, or otherwise harmful drugs in the supply chain. Among other mandates, the DSCSA requires manufacturers and repackagers to affix or imprint a unique product identifier (comprised of a standardized numerical identifier, lot number, and expiration date of the product) on certain prescription drug packages in both a human-readable and on a machine-readable data carrier. The standardized numerical identifier is comprised of the product’s corresponding National Drug Code combined with a unique alphanumeric serial number. A drug product is misbranded if it does not bear the product identifier as required by Section 582 of the FD&C Act. Section 582 also established several requirements relating to the verification of product identifiers.
Certain products that we manufacture are regulated as “controlled substances” as defined in the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA, which establishes registration, security, recordkeeping, reporting, storage, distribution and other requirements administered and enforced by the United States Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA. The DEA is concerned with the control and handling of controlled substances, and with the equipment and raw materials used in their manufacture and packaging, in order to prevent loss and diversion into illicit channels of commerce. Annual registration is required for any facility that manufactures, distributes, dispenses, imports or exports any controlled substance. The registration is specific to the particular location, activity and controlled substance schedule.

   The DEA regulates controlled substances by controlling them in five schedules. Schedule I and II controlled substances have a high potential for abuse, whereas Schedule III-V controlled substances have relatively decreasing potential for abuse. Therefore, the DEA imposes more stringent controls on Schedule I and II substances than Schedule III-V substances, including stricter security controls, quotas, and increased recordkeeping and reporting requirements. Certain of the products we manufacture and/or develop are regulated as Schedule II controlled substances. The DEA establishes annually an aggregate quota for how much certain controlled substances that we manufacture may be produced in total in the United States, based on the DEA’s estimate of the quantity needed to meet legitimate scientific and medicinal needs. This limited aggregate amount that the DEA allows to be produced in the United States each year is allocated among individual companies, who must submit applications annually to the DEA for individual production and procurement quotas. We must receive an annual quota from the DEA in order to produce any Schedule II substance. The DEA may adjust aggregate production quotas and individual production and procurement quotas from time to time during the year, although the DEA has substantial discretion in whether or not to make such adjustments. In April 2018, the DEA proposed new guidelines aimed at strengthening the process for setting controls over diversion of controlled substances and making other improvements in the quota managements regulatory system for the production, manufacturing and procurement of controlled substances. Following a public comment period, the DEA published the final guidelines, which were substantially similar to the proposed guidelines, in July 2018. For 2019, the DEA proposed decreased manufacturing quotas for the six most frequently misused opioids, including hydrocodone, which we use in the manufacture of certain products, by an average of 10% as compared to the 2018 quotas. The DEA proposed further decreasing manufacturing quotas in 2020 for five of the six opioids, including hydrocodone, by an average of 28%. Together with reductions in morphine, this is a 53% decrease since 2016. In October 2019, the DEA proposed additional regulations to amend the manner in which the agency grants quotas to manufacturers. The proposed regulations will establish use-specific quotas, including commercial sales, product development, transfer, replacement, and packaging. To decrease the risk of diversion and increase accountability, inventory allowances will be reduced, and procurement quota certifications will be required. In April 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the DEA adjusted the established 2020 aggregate production quotas and assessment of annual needs for select Schedule II substances. The DEA took this action to ensure that the country has an adequate and uninterrupted supply of these substances during the public health emergency. In November 2020, the DEA finalized further decreases to the quota for hydrocodone by 11.5%, which it had proposed in September 2020. In October 2021, the DEA proposed further decreases of 4 percent to the quota for hydrocodone for 2022. The DEA finalized the 2022 quotas in December 2021.
 The DEA requires facilities that manufacture controlled substances to adhere to certain security requirements. Security requirements vary by controlled substance schedule, with the most stringent requirements applying to Schedule I and Schedule II substances. Required security measures include background checks on employees and physical control of inventory through measures such as cages, surveillance cameras and inventory reconciliations. Records must be maintained for the handling of all controlled substances and periodic reports must be made to the DEA, for example, distribution, acquisition, and inventory reports for Schedule I and II controlled substances, Schedule III substances that are narcotics and other designated substances. Reports must also be made for thefts or losses of any controlled substance and suspicious orders. In addition, special authorization and notification requirements apply to imports and exports.
 The DEA requires drug manufacturers to design and implement a system that identifies suspicious orders of controlled substances, such as those of unusual size, those that deviate substantially from a normal pattern and those of unusual frequency, prior to completion of the sale. A compliant suspicious order monitoring, or SOM, system includes well-defined due diligence, “know your customer” efforts and order monitoring.
 To enforce these requirements, the DEA conducts periodic inspections of registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Individual states also independently regulate controlled substances. We are subject to state regulation of distribution for these products. Failure to maintain compliance with applicable requirements, particularly where noncompliance results in loss or diversion, can result in enforcement action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations or initiate proceedings to revoke those registrations, or take other enforcement action. In certain circumstances, violations could result in criminal prosecution.

   In addition to DEA regulations, the U.S. government and state legislatures have enacted legislation and regulations intended to fight the opioid epidemic. In February 2016, the FDA released an action plan to address the opioid epidemic, which is part of a broader initiative led by the Department of Health and Human Services, which includes the release of a new Guideline for Prescribing Opioids for Chronic Pain, FDA’s requirement of enhanced warnings and safety labeling, and institution of a class-wide REMs as a condition of approval. Further, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, or CARA, was passed in 2016. CARA provides resources to improve state monitoring of controlled substances, including opioids. A Senate bill introduced in February 2018, known as CARA 2.0, would further limit initial prescriptions for opioids to three days, while exempting initial prescriptions for chronic care, cancer care, hospice or end of life care, and palliative care. CARA 2.0 would also increase civil and criminal penalties for opioid manufacturers that fail to report suspicious orders for opioids or fail to maintain effective controls against diversion of opioids. More recently, the Substance Use-Disorder Prevention that Promotes Opioid Recovery and Treatment for Patients and Communities Act, or Support Act, has been enacted. It provides for further regulation as well as funding for research and development of non-addictive painkillers. State legislatures have followed in the footsteps of the federal government in passing similar laws intended to limit prescription sales and quantities as well as increase the ability to monitor and regulate the manufacture and sale of opioids.
