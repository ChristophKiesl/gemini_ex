ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
AntriaBio, Inc. (“AntriaBio”, the “Company”, “we” or “us”) is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company specializing in the development of innovative drug therapies to improve the lives of patients with diabetes and metabolic diseases. We apply our proprietary formulation and manufacturing capabilities to known, well-characterized molecules to create differentiated, patent-protected therapies that have the potential to significantly improve existing standards of care.
 
Our Pipeline
 
(1) AB101
 
Our first product candidate (“AB101”), a microsphere formulation of PEGylated human recombinant insulin, is being developed as an extended acting basal insulin intended for once-weekly subcutaneous injection, for use alone and in combination with bolus prandial insulin or oral glucose lowering therapies, to improve glycemic control in patients with Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. We believe AB101 has the potential to provide a near peak-less, slow and uniform release of basal insulin. The current standard of care in the $11 billion basal insulin market is daily or twice-a-day injections.
 
In the first and second quarters of calendar year end 2017, we successfully manufactured and filled vials of AB101 in our facilities in Louisville, Colorado. In June of 2017 we filed an Investigational New Drug (“IND”) application for AB101 with the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”).
 
In July of 2017, we dosed our first patient in our Phase 1 first-in-human clinical trial of AB101. The Phase 1 clinical trial is a first-in-human single ascending dose study to assess the safety and tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of AB101 in patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. The first study part will be sequential cohort dose ranging of AB101, while an optional second study part will compare one or more tested doses of AB101 from part 1 to active comparator Lantus® (insulin glargine).  In addition to safety and pharmacokinetic assessments, the time-action pharmacology of AB101 (onset, peak, and end of action) will be evaluated using several measures of glycemic response, including the hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp technique, continuous glucose monitoring, and background insulin use.
 
Following the completion of the first part of the study, the Company expects to review data and announce high-level results as early as the fourth quarter of calendar year 2017.
 
In addition, the Company plans to conduct a Phase 2 program to assess and confirm the intended dosing profile, specifically of the once-weekly dosing frequency, and for dose-ranging.  The Phase 3 registration program will comprise multiple studies to compare efficacy and safety to currently available basal insulins, in various combinations with bolus insulin and/or oral glucose lowering agents.  It will be of adequate size to meet recommended guidance for assessing chronic safety when used for Diabetes Mellitus.
 
(2) AB301
 
As a potential treatment for patients with Type 2 diabetes, AB301 is a once-weekly injectable combination of a PEGylated human glucagon-like peptide-1 (“GLP-1”) agonist and AB101, our basal insulin lead product candidate. We believe that there is a potential advantage of combining a GLP-1 agonist with basal insulin to complement glycemic control while attenuating weight gain and hypoglycemic risk. As a once-weekly injectable therapy, AB301 would be differentiated from potential competing combination therapies that require daily injections. In vitro and in vivo studies completed to date indicate that AB301 has the potential to be a well-tolerated, effective therapy for Type 2 diabetes and we are engaged in ongoing preclinical studies of AB301.

Licensing Agreement: Plasma Kallikrein Inhibitors
 
On August 4, 2017, we licensed from ActiveSite Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“ActiveSite”) their oral plasma kallikrein inhibitor portfolio (“Portfolio”) targeting the treatment of diabetic macular edema (“DME”) and other plasma kallikrein-medicated diseases such as hereditary angioedema.
 
ActiveSite has generated proof-of-concept data for their orally-administered plasma kallikrein inhibitors in clinically-relevant animal models of macular edema, and we will leverage that data to complete IND-enabling toxicology studies and prepare for human clinical trials.
 
Diabetic macular edema is the main cause of vision loss in working-age adults in the U.S. and worldwide.  It results from a breakdown of the blood-retinal barrier and an increase in ‘retinal vascular permeability’ (RVP), caused by a diverse group of conditions, including diabetes.  An estimated 750,000 individuals in the U.S. and another 6 to 9 million worldwide have diabetic macular edema, and these numbers are expected to grow as the incidence of diabetes increases globally.  In the United States, current treatment approaches directly target the VEGF pathway, and are dominated by anti-VEGF agents such as ranibizumab, bevacizumab and aflibercept, which must be injected by retinal specialists on a monthly or bimonthly basis, into the eye.  The extent of therapeutic benefit received from these agents directly correlates with adherence to this administration route and regimen, which is a significant burden for both patients and their healthcare providers, leading to high rates of non-adherence to treatment regimens, and therefore sub-optimal therapeutic outcomes.
 
Competition
 
We face competition from pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies, and private research organizations in recruiting and retaining highly qualified scientific personnel and consultants and in the development and acquisition of technologies.
 
If successfully commercialized, AB101 would compete directly against Sanofi’s Lantus and Toujeo, Novo Nordisk’s Levemir and Tresiba, Eli Lilly’s Basaglar as well as any other branded or biosimilar basal insulin therapies that obtain regulatory approval in advance of AB101.
 
Sanofi’s Soliqua and Novo Nordisk’s Xultophy are daily injectable GLP-1 agonist and basal insulin combination therapies that have been approved by the FDA. Adocia recently announced plans to develop BioChaperone Glargine Dulaglutide and BioChaperone Liraglutide, which are GLP-1 agonist and basal insulin combination therapies consisting of insulin glargine (Lantus®) and either Eli Lilly’s Trulicty (dulaglutide) or Novo Nordisk’s Victoza (liraglutide). If we successfully develop and commercialize AB301, it would compete directly against Soliqua, Xultophy, BioChaperone Glargine Dulaglutide, BioChaperone Liraglutide and any other GLP-1 agonist and basal insulin combination therapies that obtain regulatory approval. Sanofi and Novo Nordisk are large pharmaceutical companies with substantially greater financial, marketing and development resources than AntriaBio. Further, the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are very competitive and are characterized by rapid and continuous technological innovation.
 
There are a handful of companies developing therapies for diabetic macular edema that could pose as potential competitors to the plasma kallikrein inhibitor therapy we recently acquired from ActiveSite Pharmaceuticals. KalVista Pharmaceuticals, Ampio Pharmaceuticals and Thrombogenics are two such companies. KalVista is developing KVD001, an intravitreal plasma kallikrein inhibitor that is currently in Phase 1 development. Ampio is developing Optina, a low dose of danazol as an oral therapy for DME that is currently in Phase 2-3 development. Thrombogenics is developing THR-149, a bicyclic peptide from Bicycle Therapeutics for DME that is currently in preclinical development. If we successfully commercialize our plasma kallikrein inhibitor, the aforementioned therapies would serve as direct competitors.

We believe there are a number of additional therapies in preclinical and clinical development to treat diabetes and DME that may result in effective, commercially successful treatments, including drugs that may be in development by Sanofi, Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly and other organizations. Each of these therapies and others may compete with AB101, AB301 and the plasma kallikrein inhibitor therapy we recently acquired from ActiveSite.
 
Intellectual Property
 
As an innovator in the development of extended release drug therapies, we are executing a patent strategy to protect technologies and inventions that are essential to our business. As part of this strategy, we will continue to build on our existing patent portfolio by filing patent applications for additional product candidates, and novel technologies, through ongoing research and development. Our patent strategy also involves relying upon trade secrets and know-how – particularly in formulation and manufacturing – in order to develop and maintain our competitive position.
 
Our first patent involves a single-step method for rapidly and efficiently preparing conjugates of insulin and its analogs with hydrophilic polymers, such as PEG. This method includes reacting a protein and a hydrophilic polymer in the presence of at least one organic solvent and at least one metal chelator, under near-neutral conditions. More specifically, this invention is directed to the site-specific modification of the proteins with PEG. It also provides a pharmaceutical formulation for the uniform mixture of the protein-PEG conjugate in a biodegradable polymer. This patent, which expires in April 2024, is issued in the US, Australia, India, Japan and Europe, and is pending in Canada, Brazil, China and Hong Kong.
 
As it relates to this invention, our lead product candidate, AB101, is comprised of a PEG molecule linked to human recombinant insulin specifically at the phenylalanine amino acid at position B1. We formulate a biodegradable microsphere that is a homogenous solid solution of PLGA and the insulin-PEG conjugate is formulated. We plan to apply this method of preparing protein-polymer conjugates, and formulating them with biodegradable polymers to future product candidates as well.
 
Our second patent portfolio was filed in July 2014 as a nonprovisional patent application covering novel methods and systems used to create biodegradable microparticles with superior syringeability, injectability, flowability, and uniformity. This patent is issued in the US and is pending in other jurisdictions, which expires in 2034. The methods claimed in the patent are directed towards the microsphere manufacturing technology platform that is broadly applicable to current and future products under development.
 
For our third patent portfolio, we filed a provisional patent application in December 2014 around novel compositions and systems used to create formulations for sustained release products that are used by themselves or in combination with other molecules. This Patent application was converted to a nonprovisional patent application in December 2015. When issued, this patent will expire in 2034.
 
For our fourth patent portfolio, we filed a provisional patent application in June 2015 around improved methods for site-specific amine pegylation. This patent application was converted to a nonprovisional patent application in June 2016. When issued, this patent will expire in 2035.
 
For our fifth patent portfolio, we filed a nonprovisional patent application in September 2017 for a new propriety emulisifier (“Emulisifier”) to be used in our manufacturing process. When issued, this patent will expire in 2037.
 
We continue to work towards filing additional patent applications that are directed towards both technology enhancements and product candidates.
