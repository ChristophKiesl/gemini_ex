Item 1. Business.
Introduction
 
We are a blank check company incorporated on May 10, 2019 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
 
Prior to our Public Offering, on May 16, 2019, our Sponsor purchased an aggregate of 8,625,000 shares of our Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the “Founder Shares”), for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.003 per share. Our Sponsor agreed to forfeit up to 1,125,000 Founder Shares to the extent that the overallotment option for the Public Offering was not exercised in full by the underwriters. In July 2019, our Sponsor transferred 40,000 Founder Shares to each of our independent director nominees at their original purchase price. In September 2019, the underwriters purchased 1,411,763 of the Over-allotment Units (as defined below), and the remaining overallotment option subsequently expired. As a result, our Sponsor forfeited an aggregate of 772,059 Founder Shares. The holders of our Founder Shares (including our Sponsor and our independent directors) are referred to herein as our “initial stockholders.”
 
On the IPO Closing Date, we consummated our Public Offering of 30,000,000 units at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to us of $300.0 million. Each unit (“Unit”) consists of one share of our Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and one-third of one warrant (“Warrant”). Each whole Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment. Simultaneously with the consummation of the Public Offering, we completed the private sale of 5,333,333 private placement warrants (the “Private Placement Warrants”) at a purchase price of $1.50 per warrant to our Sponsor, generating gross proceeds to us of approximately $8.0 million. Each Private Placement Warrant entitles the holder thereof to purchase one share of our Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share, subject to adjustment.
 
In connection with the Public Offering, the underwriters of the Public Offering were granted an option to purchase up to an additional 4,500,000 units (the “Over-allotment Units”). On September 4, 2019, the underwriters partially exercised their overallotment option and, on September 6, 2019, the underwriters purchased 1,411,763 of the Over-allotment Units at an offering price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds to us of approximately $14.1 million. Simultaneously with the sale of these Over-allotment Units, we completed a private placement with our Sponsor for an additional 188,235 Private Placement Warrants at a purchase price of $1.50 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of approximately $282,000.
 
We received gross proceeds from the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants of approximately $314.1 million and $8.3 million, respectively, for an aggregate of approximately $322.4 million. Approximately $314.1 million of the gross proceeds were deposited into a U.S. based trust account (the “Trust Account”), with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The approximately $314.1 million of net proceeds held in the Trust Account includes approximately $10.9 million of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions that will be released to the underwriters of the Public Offering upon completion of our initial business combination. Of the gross proceeds from the Public Offering and the sale of the Private Placement Warrants that were not deposited in the Trust Account, approximately $6.2 million was used to pay underwriting discounts and commissions in the Public Offering, $251,000 was used to repay loans and advances from our Sponsor, and the balance was reserved to pay accrued offering and formation costs, business, legal and accounting due diligence expenses on prospective acquisitions and continuing general and administrative expenses. 
 
The shares of our Class B common stock will automatically convert into shares of our Class A common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a one-for-one basis, subject to adjustment for stock splits, stock dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like. In the case that additional shares of Class A common stock, or equity-linked securities, are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts sold in our Public Offering and related to the closing of the initial business combination, the ratio at which the shares of our Class B common stock will convert into shares of our Class A common stock will be adjusted (unless the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock agree to waive such adjustment with respect to any such issuance or deemed issuance) so that the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of all issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock will equal, in the aggregate, on an as-converted basis, 20% of the sum of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon the completion of our Public Offering plus all shares of Class A common stock and equity-linked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination (excluding any securities issued or issuable to any seller in the initial business combination).

The Units began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the Symbol “SBE.U” on July 26, 2019. Commencing on September 16, 2019, we announced that holders of the Units sold in our Public Offering may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A common stock and Warrants included in the Units. The shares of Class A common stock and Warrants that are separated trade on the NYSE under the symbols “SBE” and “SBE WS,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol “SBE.U.”
 
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the “JOBS Act”). As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the “Sarbanes-Oxley Act”), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
 
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
 
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (a) the last day of the fiscal year (i) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our Public Offering, (ii) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to time), or (iii) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last day of our most recently completed fiscal quarter, and (b) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
 
Proposed Business Combination 
 
On September 23, 2020, Lightning Merger Sub Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (“Merger Sub”), ChargePoint, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“ChargePoint”), and Switchback entered into a business combination agreement and plan of reorganization (the “Business Combination Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, Merger Sub will be merged with and into ChargePoint (the “Merger,” together with the other transactions related thereto, the “Business Combination”), with ChargePoint surviving the Merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of Switchback.
 
ChargePoint has delivered to us a Stockholder Support Agreement (the “Support Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, certain ChargePoint stockholders (the “Written Consent Parties”), whose ownership interests collectively represent outstanding shares of ChargePoint’s common stock (“ChargePoint Common Stock”) and ChargePoint’s preferred stock (voting on an as-converted basis) sufficient to approve the Merger on behalf of ChargePoint, will agree to support the approval and adoption of the transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement, including agreeing to execute a written consent approving the Business Combination Agreement, the Merger and all other transactions contemplated by the Business Combination Agreement within 48 hours of a registration statement on Form S-4 becoming effective. The Support Agreement will terminate upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), (ii) the date of the termination of the Business Combination Agreement in accordance with its terms and (iii) the effective date of a written agreement of Switchback and the Written Consent Parties terminating the Support Agreement.

In connection with the closing of the Merger (the “Closing”), that certain Registration Rights Agreement (as defined below) dated July 25, 2019 (the “IPO Registration Rights Agreement”) will be amended and restated and Switchback, certain persons and entities holding securities of the Company prior to the Closing (the “Initial Holders”) and certain persons and entities receiving our Class A common stock or instruments exercisable for the our Class A common stock in connection with the Merger (the “New Holders” and together with the Initial Holders, the “Registration Rights Holders”) will enter into that amended and restated IPO Registration Rights Agreement attached as an exhibit to the Business Combination Agreement (the “A&R Registration Rights Agreement”). Pursuant to the A&R Registration Rights Agreement, we will agree that, within 15 business days after the Closing, Switchback will file with the SEC (at the Company’s sole cost and expense) a registration statement registering the resale of certain securities held by or issuable to the Initial Holders and the New Holders (the “Resale Registration Statement”), and Switchback will use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the Resale Registration Statement become effective as soon as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof. In certain circumstances, the Registration Rights Holders can demand up to four underwritten offerings and will be entitled to customary piggyback registration rights.
 
Concurrently with ChargePoint entering into the Business Combination Agreement, certain stockholders of ChargePoint, whose ownership interests represent 92.2% of the outstanding ChargePoint Common Stock (voting on an as-converted basis) in the aggregate, have agreed, subject to certain customary exceptions, not to effect any (a) direct or indirect sale, assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation, disposition, loan or other transfer, or entry into any agreement with respect to any sale, assignment, encumbrance, pledge, hypothecation, disposition, loan or other transfer, with respect to any shares of our Class A common stock held by them immediately after the Effective Time, including any shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants to purchase shares of the Company’s Class A common stock held by them immediately following the Closing or (b) publicly announce any intention to effect any transaction specified in clause (a), in each case, for six months after the Closing.
 
In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, the initial stockholders entered into a letter agreement (the “Founders Stock Letter”) with Switchback pursuant to which, among other things, the initial stockholders will, (i) subject to the satisfaction of the conditions to Closing set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, immediately prior to the Closing, surrender to us, for no consideration and as a capital contribution to Switchback, 984,706 Founder Shares held by them (on a pro rata basis), whereupon such Founder Shares will be immediately canceled and (ii) upon and subject to the Closing, subject 900,000 Founder Shares (including any shares of our Class A common stock issued in exchange therefor in the Merger, the “Founder Earn Back Shares”) held by them (on a pro rata basis) to potential forfeiture, if the volume-weighted average closing sale price (the “Closing VWAP”) of one share of our Class A common stock quoted on the NYSE (or the exchange on which the shares of our Class A common stock are then listed) is greater than or equal to $12.00 for any ten trading days within any twenty consecutive trading day period within the five-year period following the Closing. The Founders Stock Letter also provides that the Sponsor will bear any transaction costs in excess of $20,000,000 that are allocable to Switchback in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement, excluding any costs associated with the PIPE Financing (as defined below).
 
In connection with the execution of the Business Combination Agreement, on September 23, 2020, the Company entered into separate subscription agreements (collectively, the “Subscription Agreements”) with a number of investors (collectively, the “Subscribers”), pursuant to which the Subscribers agreed to purchase, and the Company agreed to sell to the Subscribers, an aggregate of 22,500,000 shares of the Company’s Class A common stock for a purchase price of $10.00 per share and an aggregate purchase price of $225,000,000, in a private placement (the “PIPE Financing”).
 
On October 19, 2020, we filed a registration statement on Form S-4 (File No: 333-249549) (as amended, the “Registration Statement”) relating to the Business Combination. On January 8, 2021, the SEC declared the Registration Statement effective. We have mailed the definitive proxy statement/prospectus/consent solicitation statement relating to the special meeting of the Company’s stockholders in connection with the Business Combination. The proxy statement/prospectus/consent solicitation statement was mailed to the Company’s stockholders of record as of the close of business on December 16, 2020. The Business Combination is expected to close in February 2021, subject to approval by the Company’s stockholders and other customary closing conditions.

As noted above, our Class A common stock is currently traded on the NYSE under the symbol “SBE.” Upon closing of the Business Combination, the post-combination company (“New ChargePoint”) is expected to be renamed “ChargePoint Holdings, Inc.,” and the Class A common stock is expected to continue trading on the NYSE under the new symbol “CHPT.”
 
Employees
 
We currently have three officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in.
