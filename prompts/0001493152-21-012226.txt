Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Unless otherwise provided in this Annual Report, references to the “Company,” “we,” “us”, and “our” refer to Vitality Biopharma, Inc., a Nevada corporation formed on June 29, 2007 as Legend Mining Inc., and its consolidated subsidiaries. On October 10, 2011, we completed a merger with our wholly-owned subsidiary, Stevia First Corp., whereby we changed our name from “Legend Mining Inc.” to “Stevia First Corp.” On July 15, 2016, our Board of Directors and shareholders approved a name change to “Vitality Biopharma, Inc.”
 
Vitality Biopharma is a company focused on the advancement of pharmaceuticals and innovative technologies that improve the lives of patients. We seek to achieve this objective through the development of novel cannabinoid pharmaceutical prodrugs known as cannabosides. We conduct our operations using our own personnel and facilities with the support of third-party resources to advance our drug development programs.
 
Our cannabosides are cannabinoid-glycoside prodrugs, which were discovered through application of the Company’s proprietary enzymatic bioprocessing technologies, that are converted within the body after administration from an inactive molecule into a pharmacologically active drug. Currently, the Company has produced more than 25 novel cannabosides, including glycosylated tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), cannabidiol (CBD), cannabidivarin (CBDV) and cannabinol (CBN), that are covered by worldwide patent applications for composition of matter, method of production and method of use.
 
Additionally, the Company is evaluating the expansion of its corporate strategy to create long-term sustainable value for its shareholders by building a more diversified portfolio of assets through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Specifically, the Company is considering special situation opportunities in a variety of industries, including without limitation, businesses that utilize innovative technologies to address the unfavorable environmental impacts of climate change.
 
Our corporate headquarters is located in Los Angeles, California. As of May 18, 2021, we employed three full-time employees, including one research professional working in our office and laboratory space in Rocklin, California. We also have, in the past, engaged the services of scientific and regulatory consultants to assist in our research and development activities, which is an approach that provides us with flexible and highly-experienced resources to advance our clinical efforts while maintaining a relatively lower overhead cost structure.
 
Cannaboside Prodrugs
 
A prodrug is a compound that, after administration, is metabolized into a pharmacologically active drug. Prodrugs are often designed to improve drug properties and reduce known or expected toxicities and adverse side effects. By using our proprietary enzymatic bioprocessing technologies, our clinical research team has developed a novel family of prodrugs by combining cannabinoid and glucose molecules. The resulting compounds, known as cannabosides, have unique commercial applications and patentable compositions of matter, which are separate and distinct from ordinary cannabinoids. The advantages of cannabosides may include: (i) administration in a convenient oral formulation, (ii) targeted delivery with release in the colon or large intestine, (iii) improved stability with limited degradation or drug metabolism, and (iv) delayed release enabling longer-lasting effects and fewer administrations by patients.
 
Our proprietary glycosylation process, which results in adding one or more glucose molecules to compounds, may enable our new cannabosides to act as prodrugs that achieve targeted delivery of the bioactive compounds of cannabinoids to the gastrointestinal tract. Glycosylated compounds are generally more stable and water soluble, so upon ingestion, we believe they will remain intact and transit through the esophagus, stomach and upper intestine with limited absorption or degradation from stomach acids. However, once the glycosylated compounds reach the large intestine, we expect them to encounter glycoside hydrolase enzymes secreted by the human intestinal microbiota that will cleave the polar glucose residues and release the active cannabinoid compound primarily in the large intestine or colon.

We have focused our research and development activities on the glycosylation of cannabinoids given their well-known positive effects on the human endocannabinoid system. Our research and development activities originally focused on the glycosylation of CBD and then later expanded into the glycosylation of THC. The use of the cannabinoid THC has been shown to provide substantial anti-inflammatory benefits on the human body, among other benefits, but is limited as a pharmaceutical option given its psychoactive and intoxicating properties. However, by glycosylating THC, we have learned through initial animal studies that the binding of glucose and THC molecules restricts the release of THC into the body’s digestive system until the prodrug reaches the large intestine, at which point the glycoside hydrolase enzymes cleave the glucose from the prodrug and the THC is released in a targeted and restricted manner. Further, we have learned through our initial animal studies that this targeted release of THC, which could be provided in very low doses to achieve physiologically beneficial results, serves as an anti-inflammatory agent in the lower gastrointestinal tract and minimizes the amount of THC absorbed into the blood stream, therefore avoiding the psychoactive and intoxicating properties that hinder the broader pharmaceutical use of THC.
 
We are developing our THC-glycoside prodrugs for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) because of the targeted release described previously. IBD is a frequently chronic inflammatory condition where parts of the digestive system become inflamed from an overactive immune response. The disease can lead to irreversible damage to the gastrointestinal tract and may require surgery to remove affected areas of the intestine. Two major forms of the disease are Crohn’s disease, which can affect any part of the digestive system, and ulcerative colitis, which often affects the colon or large intestine. The disease is often unpredictable with periods of painful and debilitating symptoms followed by periods of remission with limited symptoms. IBS has similar symptoms to IBD, including abdominal pain, but the underlying disease process is quite different. IBS is a functional gastrointestinal disorder that commonly affects the large intestine and is characterized by abdominal cramping, diarrhea, constipation, and pain. Currently, patients suffering from IBD are frequently prescribed anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids, biologics and immunosuppressants, and patients suffering from IBS are prescribed antibiotics, antidepressants and gastrointestinal motility compounds, all of which often result in unwanted side effects.
 
Our most promising THC-glycoside (VBX-100) is being developed as an oral prodrug for the treatment of IBD and IBS. VBX-100 was selected from our THC-glycoside portfolio for compatibility with commercial production techniques and the optimal prodrug delivery profile that maximizes intestinal anti-inflammatory properties while minimizing psychoactive or intoxicating effects. Initial pre-clinical studies on the efficacy of VBX-100 in animal models have shown favorable outcomes, including reduced inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and no measurable systemic THC found in tissue examined using highly-sensitive testing equipment. Our pre-clinical development plan, which includes dose range finding studies, GLP toxicology studies, pharmacokinetic studies and other pre-clinical research, is anticipated to be completed during the 2nd half of calendar year 2022, subject to the Company securing sufficient additional funding or entering into a strategic partnership. After our satisfactory completion of all of the prerequisite pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo studies, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application would be filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and, upon receiving FDA approval, we would initiate our Phase 1 clinical trial, subject to the Company securing sufficient additional funding or entering into a strategic partnership.
 
In addition to our research and development activities related to our THC-glycoside compounds, we are expanding and diversifying our research and development activities to include the potential safety, efficacy and commercialization of our patented CBD-glycoside compounds. CBD has well-known anti-anxiety, anti-inflammatory and anti-microbial properties, but unlike THC, CBD is non-psychoactive and non-intoxicating. By glycosylating CBD, we can create CBD-glucose compounds that may enable a targeted and concentrated delivery of CBD in the gastrointestinal tract. Currently we are evaluating the optimal CBD-glycoside delivery mechanism, which may include an aqueous drink formulation since our glycosylation process significantly improves the water solubility of the CBD molecule.
 
Enzymatic Processing Methods
 
The Company originally developed its proprietary enzymatic bioprocessing technologies to attach glucose molecules to the molecules of stevia as part of our activities in the stevia processing industry. We then expanded the application of this proprietary technology to attach glucose molecules to cannabinoids, including THC and CBD. We may pursue additional opportunities to develop new products utilizing this proprietary technology.

Government Regulation
 
Due to our development of pharmaceutical products, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other federal, state, and local agencies. Also, since we are researching and developing cannabinoid-based products, we are subject to regulation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). If we expand our clinical research, product development or commercialization activities outside of the United States in the future, we anticipate that we would then be subject to additional regulation by the applicable foreign jurisdictions and governing bodies, which may have different requirements.
 
The FDA is the main regulatory body that controls pharmaceutical and biologic drugs in the United States, with additional layers of regulation from other federal, state and local agencies. The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act governs most of the requirements for the development and marketing of our pharmaceutical products. The FDA’s drug approval process is extensive, generally including: pre-clinical animal studies of drug safety, efficacy and dosing, submission and approval of an IND application, clinical studies in humans to determine safety, efficacy and dosing (Phase 1 – 3 studies), submission and approval of a New Drug Application (NDA), and additional post-approval requirements. Failure to comply with any FDA-requirements may result in the FDA refusing to approve our application.
 
The DEA establishes procedures and monitors research and development activities of “controlled substances” subject to the Controlled Substances Act. Our research and development activities focus on cannabinoids, particularly THC and CBD derived from the cannabis plant, which the DEA has classified as Schedule I substances. Schedule I substances are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse. In May 2019, the DEA informed us that it had determined that they consider our VBX-100 prodrug a Schedule I substance. As a result, any developing, testing, manufacturing, or clinical studies involving our VBX-100 prodrug, and by inference potentially all of our THC-glycoside molecules, are required to be properly licensed by the DEA and adhere to strict diversion control standards. Our current research and development efforts involving our THC-glycoside molecules are conducted at our Rocklin laboratory, which holds a DEA-issued Controlled Substance Registration Certificate for “Research” that expires on May 31, 2022 and is renewable on an annual basis. Our research and development activities are also approved by and operated in compliance with the State of California’s Research Advisory Panel, which is a division of the California Department of Justice that oversees research performed within the state using DEA Schedule I and II substances.
 
Orphan Drug Designation
 
In January 2018, we filed a request with the FDA’s Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD) for an Orphan Drug Designation of our VBX-100 prodrug for the treatment of pediatric ulcerative colitis. In March 2018, the OOPD denied our request based, in part, on the FDA’s decision to no longer grant Orphan Drug Designation status to drugs for pediatric subpopulations of common diseases (i.e., diseases or conditions with an overall prevalence of over 200,000), unless the use of the drug in the pediatric subpopulation meets the regulatory criteria for an orphan subset, or the disease in the pediatric subpopulation is considered a different disease from the disease in the adult population.
 
However, in December 2019, we received a letter from the OOPD informing us that the FDA determined that the Company may be eligible for pediatric-subpopulation designation because we submitted our original request for an Orphan Drug Designation before the guidance Clarification of Orphan Designation of Drugs and Biologics for Pediatric Subpopulations of Common Diseases was finalized in July 2018.
 
As a result, in May 2020, we filed a response letter with the OOPD addressing the other deficiencies noted in the Company’s original submission in January 2018, which included, among other things (1) support for the prevalence of pediatric ulcerative colitis; (2) our scientific rationale for the specific animal models used in our pre-clinical animal studies; and (3) more comprehensive supporting documentation for the use of VBX-100 in pediatric patients with ulcerative colitis. In August 2020, we received a letter from the OOPD informing us that it was unable to grant our request for an Orphan Drug Designation status because our VBX-100 prodrug was administered before and after colitis was induced in our in vivo mouse studies, which resulted in the need for more scientific data to support the efficacy of our VBX-100 prodrug in a treatment-only setting. As a result, we were advised to perform a second in vivo mouse study in which our VBX-100 prodrug would be administered only after colitis was induced in order to provide a clear indication that the active drug was released only after ulcerative colitis was present. In May 2021, we completed the treatment-only in vivo mouse study and filed a supplemental response letter with the OOPD providing the requested in vivo treatment-only mouse study results in support of our position that VBX-100 may be effective as a treatment for pediatric ulcerative colitis.

Intellectual Property
 
In September 2015, we filed our first provisional U.S. patent application entitled “Cannabinoid Glycoside Prodrugs and Methods of Synthesis”, which described novel CBD-glycosides and THC-glycosides along with methods of production through enzymatic biosynthesis. In October 2015, we filed our second provisional U.S. patent application that added CBDV-glycosides as additional cannabosides, plus added numerous methods of use claims for our cannabinoid-glycosides. In July 2016, we filed our third provisional U.S. patent application that greatly expanded on the cannabinoid substrates for glycosylation by adding (i) the phytocannabinoid cannabinol (CBN), (ii) the endocannabinoids anandamide, 2-AG, 1-AG, and synaptamide, and (iii) the vanilloids capsaicin, vanillin, and curcumin. In September 2016, one year after the filing of our first provisional patent, our non-provisional cannabinoid glycoside patent was filed, which included all prior material plus additional data derived from our ongoing research and laboratory studies. Also, in September 2016, we filed an expanded international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty system, which included 79 patent claims covering nearly 200 individual compounds, including our THC and CBD prodrugs. In March and April 2018, this application was filed for national and regional prosecution in major pharmaceutical markets worldwide, including the United States, Canada, Mexico, Europe, China, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Brazil.
 
In May 2017, we filed a U.S. patent application entitled “Antimicrobial Compositions Comprising Cannabinoids and Methods of Using the Same”, which described compositions and methods of use involving cannabinoid-glycosides that provide antimicrobial activity to treat microbial infections in the intestines, including Clostridioides difficile (C. diff) infections. In May 2018, one year after the filing of the provisional U.S. patent, we filed a non-provisional U.S. patent for the use of cannabinoid-glycosides to deliver cannabinoids to the gastrointestinal tract to treat C. diff infections.
 
In January 2020, the USPTO granted our first patent entitled “Kaurenoic Acid Glycoside Precursors and Methods of Synthesis”, which demonstrates the validity of our glycosylation platform to produce novel and patentable glycoside molecules and serves as a foundational building block for the Company’s subsequent research of glycosylated cannabinoids.
 
In March 2020, we filed an international patent application under the Patent Cooperation Treaty system entitled “Novel Cannabinoid Glycosides and Uses Thereof” that expands upon our 2016 patent filings covering glycosylated cannabinoids. Our new 2020 patent filings cover additional novel CBD and THC-glycosides and include research data supporting the improved characteristics and commercial production strategies for these new molecules. 
 
In December 2020, we filed a provisional U.S. patent application entitled “Continuous Enzymatic Perfusion Reactor System”, which described our improved reactor system for the efficient enzymatic glycosylation of hydrophobic small molecules, including cannabinoids.
 
We believe our intellectual property portfolio of cannabinoid-glycosides possess significant value and, as a result, we have allocated substantial resources to ensure that our U.S. and international patents are properly filed and successfully prosecuted. As our research efforts involving cannabinoid-glycosides continue to progress, we plan to develop and file additional patents to cover compositions of matter, methods of production and methods of use to further expand our growing family of intellectual property assets and create long-term value for our shareholders.
 
Competition
 
The Company operates in a highly competitive and dynamic market environment, frequently against much larger and better capitalized competitors. Currently, the Company’s cannabinoid prodrug development program competes against many well-capitalized, multinational pharmaceutical drug manufacturers that are developing, producing and marketing pharmaceutical drugs for the treatment of IBD and IBS. Additionally, an increasing number of cannabinoid drug manufacturers are entering the market with cannabinoid-based drug development programs to treat a wide range of diseases, which could include IBD and IBS. Our expectation is that competition from traditional pharmaceutical drug developers and non-traditional cannabinoid-based drug developers will continue to increase over the next 12 months.

Stock Relisting and Going Concern
 
On November 7, 2018, the SEC temporarily suspended the trading of the Company’s common stock on the OTC marketplace. The Company’s common stock resumed trading with limited liquidity on the grey market on November 21, 2018. Grey market stocks are not traded or quoted on an exchange or inter-dealer quotation system, but are reported by broker-dealers to their self-regulatory organization who, in turn, distribute the trade data to market data vendors and financial websites. On March 9, 2021, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) processed a Form 211 application relating to the initiation of priced quotations of the Company’s common stock, and commencing on March 10, 2021, the Company’s common stock was quoted on the OTC Link ATS. The Company is currently seeking approval to obtain Depository Trust Company eligibility for the Company’s common stock.
 
Since inception, the Company has funded its operations primarily through equity and debt financings. During the year ended March 31, 2021, the Company incurred a net loss of $880,851 and used $1,605,076 of cash in our operating activities. These factors raise substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern for the next twelve months from the date that the financial statements are issued which are a part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, in their report on the Company’s March 31, 2021 audited financial statements, raised substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. No assurance can be given that any future financing or capital, if needed, will be available or, if available, that it will be on terms that are satisfactory to the Company. If we cannot raise the capital or financing we need to continue our operations, our business could fail.
 
Employees
 
As of May 18, 2021, we employed three full-time employees, including one research professional working in our office and laboratory space in Rocklin, California. We also have engaged the services of scientific and regulatory consultants to assist with our research and development activities, which is an approach that provides us with flexible and highly-experienced resources to advance our clinical efforts while maintaining a relatively lower and variable overhead cost structure.
