Item 1.  Business
Overview
American Campus Communities, Inc. (“ACC”) is a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) that commenced operations effective with the completion of an initial public offering (“IPO”) on August 17, 2004. Through ACC’s controlling interest in American Campus Communities Operating Partnership LP (“ACCOP”), ACC is one of the largest owners, managers, and developers of high quality student housing properties in the United States in terms of beds owned and under management. ACC is a fully integrated, self-managed, and self-administered equity REIT with expertise in the acquisition, design, financing, development, construction management, leasing, and management of student housing properties. 
The general partner of ACCOP is American Campus Communities Holdings, LLC (“ACC Holdings”), an entity that is wholly-owned by ACC. As of December 31, 2020, ACC Holdings held an ownership interest in ACCOP of less than 1%. The limited partners of ACCOP are ACC and other limited partners consisting of current and former members of management and nonaffiliated third parties.  As of December 31, 2020, ACC owned an approximate 99.6% limited partnership interest in ACCOP.  As the sole member of the general partner of ACCOP, ACC has exclusive control of ACCOP’s day-to-day management.  Management operates ACC and ACCOP as one business.  The management of ACC consists of the same members as the management of ACCOP.  ACC consolidates ACCOP for financial reporting purposes, and ACC does not have significant assets other than its investment in ACCOP.  Therefore, the assets and liabilities of ACC and ACCOP are the same on their respective financial statements. References to the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our” mean collectively ACC, ACCOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by ACC and/or ACCOP.  References to the “Operating Partnership” mean collectively ACCOP and those entities/subsidiaries owned or controlled by ACCOP.

As of December 31, 2020, our total owned and third-party managed portfolio included 206 properties with approximately 141,100 beds.

Business Objectives, Investment Strategies, and Operating Segments
Business Objectives
Our primary business objectives are to create long-term stockholder value by deploying capital to develop, redevelop, acquire and operate student housing communities, and to sell communities when they no longer meet our long-term investment strategy and when market conditions are favorable.  We believe we can achieve these objectives by continuing to implement our investment strategies and successfully manage our operating segments, which are described in more detail below. Our business objectives align with our commitment to corporate responsibility, in which we focus on creating healthy, sustainable environments with a sense of community and connection, giving back to the communities we serve, and investing in our employees. 
Investment Strategies
We seek to own high quality, well designed and well located student housing properties. We seek to acquire or develop properties in markets that have stable or increasing student populations, are in submarkets with barriers to entry and provide opportunities for economic growth as a result of their product position and/or differentiated design and close proximity to campuses, or through our superior operational capabilities. We believe that our reputation and established relationships with universities give us an advantage in sourcing acquisitions and developments and obtaining municipal approvals and community support for our development projects.
Our experienced development staff intends to continue to identify and acquire land parcels in close proximity to colleges and universities that offer location advantages or that allow for the development of unique products that offer a competitive advantage.  We expect to continue to benefit from opportunities derived from our extensive network with colleges and universities as well as our relationship with certain developers with whom we have previously developed student housing properties.
Operating Segments
We define business segments by their distinct customer base and service provided. We have identified four reportable segments: Owned Properties, On-Campus Participating Properties, Development Services and Property Management Services. 
For a detailed financial analysis of our segments’ results of operations and financial position, please refer to Note 16 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8.
Property Operations

Unique Leasing Characteristics: Student housing properties are typically leased by the bed on an individual lease liability basis, unlike multifamily housing where leasing is by the unit.  Individual lease liability limits each resident’s liability to his or her own rent without liability for a roommate’s rent.  A parent or guardian is generally required to execute each lease as a guarantor unless the resident provides adequate proof of income or financial aid.  The number of lease contracts that we administer is therefore approximately equivalent to the number of beds occupied and not the number of units. Leases at our off-campus properties typically require 12 monthly rental installments, whereas leases for our residence hall properties typically correspond to the university’s academic year and require ten monthly rental installments.  Please refer to the property table contained in Item 2 – Properties for a listing of the typical rent payment terms at our properties.  As an example, in the case of our typical off-campus leases, the commencement date coincides with the commencement of the respective university’s Fall academic term and the termination date is the last day of the subsequent summer school session.  As such, we must re-lease each property in its entirety each year.

Management Philosophy: Our management philosophy is based upon meeting the following objectives:
•Satisfying the specialized needs of residents by providing the highest levels of customer service;
•Developing and maintaining an academically oriented environment via a premier residence life/student development program;
•Maintaining each project’s physical plant in top condition;
•Maximizing revenue through the development and implementation of a strategic annual marketing plan and leasing administration program; and
•Maximizing cash flow through maximizing revenue coupled with prudent control of expenses.

Owned Properties: Our off-campus properties are generally located in close proximity to the school campus, generally with pedestrian, bicycle, or university shuttle access.  Off-campus housing tends to offer more relaxed rules and regulations than on-campus housing, resulting in off-campus housing being generally more appealing to upper-classmen.  We believe that the support of colleges and universities can be beneficial to the success of our owned properties.  We actively seek to have these institutions recommend our facilities to their students or to provide us with mailing lists so that we may directly market to students and parents.  In some cases, the institutions actually promote our off-campus facilities in their recruiting and admissions literature.  In cases where the educational institutions do not provide mailing lists or recommendations for off-campus housing, most provide comprehensive lists of suitable properties to their students, and we continually work to ensure that our properties are on these lists in each of the markets that we serve.

Off-campus housing is subject to competition for tenants with on-campus housing owned by colleges and universities, and vice versa.  Colleges and universities can generally avoid real estate taxes and borrow funds at lower interest rates than us (and other private sector operators), thereby decreasing their operating costs.  Residence halls owned and operated by the primary colleges and universities in the markets of our off-campus properties may charge lower rental rates, but typically offer fewer amenities than we offer at our properties.  Additionally, most universities are only able to house a small percentage of their overall enrollment and are therefore highly dependent upon the off-campus market to provide housing for their students.  High-quality, well run off-campus student housing can be a critical component to an institution’s ability to attract and retain students.  Therefore, developing and maintaining good relationships with educational institutions can result in a privately owned off-campus facility becoming, in effect, an extension of the institution’s housing program, with the institution providing highly valued references and recommendations to students and parents.

This segment also competes with national and regional owner-operators of off-campus student housing in a number of markets as well as with smaller local owner-operators.  Therefore, the performance of this segment could be affected by the construction of new on-campus or off-campus residences, increases or decreases in the general levels of rents for housing in competing communities, increases or decreases in the number of students enrolled at one or more of the colleges or universities in the market of a property, and other general economic conditions.

American Campus Equity ("ACE®"): Included in our owned properties segment and branded and marketed to colleges and universities as the ACE program, this transaction structure provides us with what we believe is a lower-risk opportunity compared to other off-campus projects, as our ACE projects have premier on-campus locations with marketing and operational assistance from the university.  The subject university substantially benefits by increasing its housing capacity with modern, 
well-amenitized student housing with no or minimal impacts to its own credit ratios, preserving the university’s credit capacity to fund academic and research facilities.
In 2018, we expanded our ACE program and executed an agreement to develop a ten-phase purpose-built housing project serving student interns participating in the highly competitive Disney College Program (“Disney College Program”). This project offers natural synergies with our other ACE projects and exploits our core competency of housing college students.  The $614.6 million living-learning community will include ACC-designed units offering a variety of configurations and price points providing privacy and individuality for college student participants. The development will also include a centralized 25,000-square-foot Disney Education Center located on site, offering college accredited coursework allowing participants to earn credit hours transferable to their respective universities.  The first and second phases of the of the project were delivered in May and August 2020, respectively, and the remaining phases are anticipated to be delivered from 2021-2023. Due to the disruption associated with COVID-19, the Disney College Program is temporarily suspended, and although we are marketing the community to a broader rental market, we are experiencing diminished financial performance for this project as compared to original expectations. The project’s future financial results will be affected by the duration of the suspension of the Disney College Program, with potential offsets by any success we experience in leasing the community to a broader rental market until such time as the Disney College Program is reinstated and the project achieves normalized occupancy levels.  
On-Campus Participating Properties: Our On-Campus Participating Properties segment includes six on-campus properties that are operated under long-term ground/facility leases with three university systems. Under our ground/facility leases, we receive an annual distribution representing 50% of these properties’ net cash flows, as defined in the ground/facility lease agreements.  We also manage these properties under long-term management agreements and are paid management fees equal to a percentage of defined gross receipts. 
Our on-campus participating properties are susceptible to some of the same risks as our owned properties, including: (i) seasonality in rents; (ii) annual re-leasing that is highly dependent on marketing and university admission policies; and (iii) competition for tenants from other on-campus housing operated by educational institutions or other off-campus properties.
Third-Party Services
Our third-party services consist of development services and management services and are typically provided to university and college clients.  Fee revenue earned from this business segment allows us to develop strong and key relationships with colleges and universities. We believe these services continue to provide synergies with respect to our ability to identify, close, and successfully operate student housing properties. While management evaluates the operational performance of our third-party services based on the distinct segments identified below, at times we also evaluate these segments on a combined basis.

Development Services: Our Development Services segment consists of development and construction management services that we provide through one of our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”) for student housing properties owned by universities, 501(c)3 foundations, and others. Our clients have included some of the nation's most prominent systems of higher education.  These services range from short-term consulting projects to long-term full-scale development and construction projects.  We typically provide these services to colleges and universities seeking to modernize their on-campus student housing properties, and we are sometimes retained to manage these properties following their opening.  They look to us to bring our student housing experience and expertise to ensure they develop marketable, functional and financially sustainable facilities.  Educational institutions usually seek to build housing that will enhance their recruitment and retention of students while facilitating their academic objectives.  Most of these development service contracts are awarded via a competitive request for proposal (“RFP”) process that qualifies developers based on their overall capability to provide specialized student housing design, development, construction management, financial structuring and property management services.  Our development services typically include pre-development, design and financial structuring services.  Our pre-development services typically include feasibility studies for third-party owners and design services.  Feasibility studies include an initial feasibility analysis, review of conceptual design and assistance with master planning.  Some of the documents produced in this process include the conceptual design documents, preliminary development and operating budgets, cash flow projections and a preliminary market assessment.  Our design services include coordination with the architect and other members of the design team, review of construction plans and assistance with project due diligence and project budgets.

Construction management services typically consist of hiring project professionals and a general contractor, coordinating and supervising the construction, equipping and furnishing the property, site visits, and full coordination and administration of all activities necessary for project completion in accordance with plans and specifications and with verification of adequate insurance.

Our Development Services activities benefit our primary goal of owning and operating student housing properties in a number of ways.  By providing these services to others, we are able to expand and refine our unit plan and community design, the operational efficiency of our material specifications and our ability to determine market acceptance of unit and community amenities.  Our development and construction management personnel enable us to establish relationships with general contractors, architects and project professionals throughout the nation.  Through these services, we gain experience and expertise in residential and commercial construction methodologies under various labor conditions, including right-to-work labor markets, markets subject to prevailing wage requirements and fully unionized environments.  This segment is subject to competition from other specialized student housing development companies as well as from national real estate development companies.

Property Management Services: Our Property Management Services segment includes revenues generated from third-party management contracts in which we are typically responsible for all aspects of operations, including marketing, leasing administration, facilities maintenance, business administration, accounts payable, accounts receivable, financial reporting, capital projects, and residence life student development.  We provide these services pursuant to management agreements that have initial terms that range from one to five years.

There are several housing options that compete with our third-party managed properties including, but not limited to, multifamily housing, for-rent single family dwellings, other off-campus specialized student housing and the aforementioned on-campus participating properties. We also compete with other regional and national providers of third-party management services.

Americans with Disabilities Act and Federal Fair Housing Act
Many laws and governmental regulations are applicable to our properties and changes in the laws and regulations, or their interpretation by agencies and the courts, occur frequently.  Our properties must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, or ADA, to the extent that such properties are “public accommodations” as defined by the ADA.  The ADA may require removal of structural barriers to access by persons with disabilities in certain public areas of our properties where such removal is readily achievable.  We believe that the existing properties are in substantial compliance with the ADA and that we will not be required to make substantial capital expenditures to address the requirements of the ADA.  However, noncompliance with the ADA could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants.  The obligation to make readily achievable accommodations is an ongoing one, and we intend to continue to assess our properties and to make alterations as appropriate in this respect.
Under the federal and state fair housing laws, discrimination on the basis of certain protected classes is prohibited.  Violation of these laws can result in significant damage awards to victims.
Our Commitment to Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Factors
Corporate responsibility is fundamental to the Company’s mission to consistently provide every resident and team member with an environment conducive to healthy living, personal growth, academic achievement, and professional success. This mission drives our ESG vision of creating healthy, sustainable environments with a sense of community and connection by giving back, investing in our employees, and driving long-term value for all stakeholders. 
To further our ESG vision, the Company created an ESG Committee comprised of employees of the Company, including our president, and engaged a third-party ESG consultant to assist in our efforts. Additional information regarding the Company’s ESG initiatives, including a Letter of Commitment to ESG, may be found online at www.ESG.AmericanCampus.com. The information contained on our website, including the Letter of Commitment to ESG, is not a part of or incorporated into this report.
Environmental Matters

Under various laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, an owner of real estate may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in its property.  These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner was responsible for, or even knew of, the presence of such substances.  The presence of such substances may adversely affect the owner’s ability to rent or sell the property or use the property as collateral.  Independent environmental consultants conducted environmental site assessments on all acquired or developed owned properties and on-campus participating properties in our existing portfolio.  We are not aware of any environmental conditions that management believes would have a material adverse effect on the Company.  There is no assurance, however, that environmental site assessments or other investigations would reveal all environmental conditions or 
that environmental conditions not known to us may exist now or in the future which would result in liability to the Company for remediation or fines, either under existing laws and regulations or future changes to such requirements.

From time to time, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, or EPA, designates certain sites affected by hazardous substances as “Superfund” sites pursuant to CERCLA.  Superfund sites can cover large areas, affecting many different parcels of land.  Although CERCLA imposes joint and several liability for contamination on property owners and operators regardless of fault, the EPA may choose to pursue potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) based on their actual contribution to the contamination.  PRPs are liable for the costs of responding to the hazardous substances.  Each of Villas on Apache (disposed of in April 2011), The Village on University (disposed of in December 2006) and University Village at San Bernardino (disposed of in January 2005) are located within federal Superfund sites.  The EPA designated these areas as Superfund sites because groundwater underneath these areas is contaminated.  We have not been named, and do not expect to be named, as a PRP with respect to these sites.  However, there can be no assurance regarding potential future developments concerning such sites.

Insurance
Our primary lines of insurance coverage are property, liability and workers’ compensation.  We believe that our insurance coverages are of the type and amount customarily obtained on real property assets.  We intend to obtain similar coverage for properties we acquire in the future.  However, there are certain types of losses, generally of a catastrophic nature, such as losses from floods or earthquakes, which may be subject to limitations in certain areas.  When not otherwise contractually stipulated, we exercise our judgment in determining amounts, coverage limits and deductibles, in an effort to maintain appropriate levels of insurance on our investments.  If we suffer a substantial loss, our insurance coverage may not be sufficient due to market conditions at the time or other unforeseen factors.  Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace a property after it has been damaged or destroyed. 
Human Capital Resources

As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 2,988 employees, consisting of 399 corporate employees and 2,589 employees at our owned, managed, and on-campus participating properties.
Purpose and Culture: Our company values are centered around people. We care deeply about our residents. Serving students well requires engaged, passionate, and diverse team members, so we’ve created an award-winning culture that fosters growth and rewards achievement. Service is also deeply embedded into our culture: we give back to the communities in which we live and work.
In 2020, we earned a Great Places to Work™ certification with a total of 97% of the employees surveyed saying ACC is a great place to work. Our employee compensation and benefits packages are designed to competitively compensate all employees for their contributions, and our Culture Committee conducts regular internal communications, volunteer events, and activities that help to ensure we are attracting and retaining employees that share our passion. Our employees are not currently represented by a labor union.
Diversity and Inclusion: We are proud that our ACC team represents the diversity of the residents and communities we serve, as roughly half of our team members are minorities and half are female. In addition, we are overseen by a Board of Directors a third of whose members are diverse by race or gender. We strive to have an inclusive culture where all know their unique voices will be valued. We have recently formed a diversity and inclusion taskforce to oversee the execution of our goals over the long term.
Our Diversity and Inclusion Statement
ACC’s founding vision states, “Our people are our strength, achieving success through a dedication to excellence and integrity.” Our people are devoted to a culture of inclusion, diversity, and equality in the workplace and our communities.
Our company and our student communities are defined and strengthened by the belief that every individual and their experience adds value and enhances our position as an industry leader and university partner.
We take responsibility to intentionally execute an evolving set of goals specific to inclusion, diversity, and accountability, driven by empathetic leadership and embraced by all.
We have a Code of Conduct for employees and residents that includes policies on diversity, equity and inclusion, and antidiscrimination. Additionally, ACC is a signatory for the CEO Impact Pledge to further diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. 
Training and Professional Development: Our management team supports a culture of developing future leaders from our existing workforce, enabling us to promote from within for many leadership positions.
We’ve built a comprehensive employee development program with opportunities at every career stage. We connect employees with plans tailored to their goals, and offer a range of trainings, mentoring, and conferences through ACC University and other programs. Employees are auto-enrolled for the appropriate courses when they are hired for or promoted into new positions.
Our Inside Track program provides top-performing student workers and community-level team members with the development needed to become general managers. Inside Track consists of intensive training and a six-month mentoring program emphasizing residence life, human resource management, business operations, marketing and leasing, facilities, and career development.
COVID-19 Response: ACC executed a coordinated response to the COVID-19 pandemic that ensured our teams were supported. There were no furloughs or layoffs at any of our owned properties or at our corporate headquarters. We maintained our benefits and provided five additional days of paid time-off for those who came in contact or were infected with COVID-19, in addition to sick time and paid time-off provided under our regular policy. We also implemented enhanced safety protocols in the workspace, provided remote working options and conducted virtual move-in / move-out and leasing processes for residents and staff to minimize personal contact onsite at our communities. Finally, our senior management team reallocated additional cash incentive compensation to our field-level staff who tirelessly supported our residents during the pandemic.

COVID-19, which was characterized on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization as a pandemic, has currently resulted in a widespread health crisis, which has adversely affected international, national and local economies and financial markets generally, and continues to have an unprecedented effect on many businesses, including the student housing industry. The discussions below, including without limitation statements with respect to outlooks of future operating performance and liquidity, are subject to the future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the global responses to curb its spread, which continue to evolve daily. As such, the full magnitude of the pandemic and its ultimate effect on our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity for future years is uncertain at this time.
