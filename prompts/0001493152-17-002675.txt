Item 1. Description of Business.
Organization
 
We were incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on February 27, 2014, with fiscal year end in December 31, under the original name Tech Foundry Ventures, Inc. On April 28, 2014, we filed a Certificate of Correction to our Articles of Incorporation to correct a typographical error in our Articles of Incorporation to state that the total number of authorized shares were 110,000,000, $0.0001 par value rather than 100,000,000, $0.001 par value. On March 3, 2016, our Board and majority shareholders approved an amendment to our Articles of Incorporation by adding Articles Twelve through Fourteen, which, in summary: (i) grants the board the right to amend, alter, change or repeal any provision in the Articles; (ii) authorizes the Board, without the consent of the shareholders, to adopt any recapitalization affecting the outstanding securities by effecting a forward or reverse splits of all of the outstanding securities, provided the recapitalization does not require any amendment to the Articles; and (iii) authorizes the Board to change our name without shareholder approval. On July 6, 2016, we changed our name to Nevada Canyon Gold Corp. 
 
We have never been party to any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding, nor have we undergone any material reclassification, merger, consolidation, purchase or sale of a significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business.
 
We were a consulting service company, which provided management and consulting services to early and middle stage start-ups. We were engaged by our first client in June 2015. In December 2015, we changed our business to mineral exploration, when we acquired all of Nevada Canyon Gold Corporation’s - a privately held Nevada corporation (“NCG”) - rights, titles and interests in and to an exploration agreement, dated for reference September 15, 2015, with an option to form a joint venture (the “Agreement”) with Walker River Resources Corp., a Canadian public company (TSX.V:WRR) on its wholly-owned Lapon Canyon Gold Project (“Lapon Canyon Project”, or “the Property”).
 
To acquire full consideration for all rights in and to the Agreement we paid NCG $65,000, which consisted of an initial cash deposit payment of $25,000, and a second cash payment of $30,000; the balance of $10,000 was paid through the issuance of 1,000,000 of our restricted common shares at a price of $0.01 per common share.
 
The Agreement does not grant us an interest in or to the Property, or any equity interest in WRR, but rather, grants us the right to earn up to an undivided 50% interest in the Property by incurring eligible expenditures of $500,000 (over a two-year period) in exploration and other expenses required to carry out a work program established and operated by WRR on the Property (the “Eligible Expenses”). Thereafter, the Agreement grants us an option to enter into a joint venture with WRR for further exploration and development of the Property.
 
We have had limited operations and have limited financial resources having raised $85,000 in our initial public offering and further $375,000 through our private placement offering completed on June 21, 2016. Our auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As of December 31, 2016, we had accumulated losses in the amount of $436,503, and incurred $278,834 in Eligible Expenses associated with the exploration program as required under the Agreement. In order to maintain our interest, we are required to invest an additional $221,166 over the next year. We had $51,789 in cash with working capital deficit of $39,403, therefore we believe that our present capital is not sufficient to cover our budgeted expenditures for the next 12 months. As such, we plan to support our operations including the exploration program through additional equity or debt financing; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to raise additional capital.
 
On February 28, 2014, we issued 210,000,000 shares (70,000,000 common shares each) of our $0.0001 par value common stock, valued at $0.0001 per share, to our three founders, Jeffrey Cocks, our Chief Executive Officer, Michael Levine, our director, and BCIM Management, LP, in exchange for their services associated with our formation, organization, and development of our business model and website. Our board of directors valued these services at $0.0001 per share, or $700, respectively. On April 4, 2016, our founders tendered 180,000,000 shares of common stock for cancellation (60,000,000 shares each). These shares were cancelled and returned to the Company’s treasury to a status of authorized but unissued.

On April 28, 2016, we split our common stock on a 10:1 basis without affecting the par value. All shares and per share amounts have been retroactively restated to account for the split.

Business
 
We are an exploration stage Company and only recently begun our exploration operations.
 
We are a party to an Agreement with option to form a joint venture with Walker River Resources Corp. on its wholly-owned Lapon Canyon Gold Project located approximately 40 miles southeast of Yerington, Nevada. The Agreement does not grant us an interest in or to the Property, or any equity interest in WRR, but rather, grants us the right to earn up to an undivided 50% interest in the Property by incurring eligible expenditures of $500,000 (over a two-year period) in exploration and other expenses required to carry out a work program established and operated by WRR on the Property (the “Eligible Expenses”). Thereafter, the Agreement grants us an option to enter into a joint venture with WRR for further exploration and development of the Property.
 
Even if we complete our current exploration programs and are successful in identifying a mineralized deposit, we will have to spend substantial funds on further drilling and engineering studies before we will know if we have a commercially viable mineral deposit, called a reserve.
 
We commenced exploration of the Property in early 2016 with what we anticipated is sufficient funding for approximately one year of operations. In order to continue our exploration activities we will be required to source additional cash through equity or debt financing, or by borrowing the funds from our management. We did not buy or sell any significant equipment during the past twelve months and do not anticipate buying or selling any significant equipment in the following 12 months either. If we find mineralized materials in the Property, we have no intention to develop the reserves ourselves, but rather, we will attempt to find a mining operations company to whom we can sell the property or with whom we can enter into a business arrangement to put the ore deposit into operation.
 
We do not intend to hire employees at this time. All of the work on the Property is being conducted by WRR, who is responsible for surveying, geology, engineering, exploration, and excavation, and we are responsible for paying all of the expenses incurred in such activities. As of October 15, 2016, we have incurred required $250,000 in Eligible Expenses, and earned the 25% interest to the Property. Once we have paid an additional $250,000, we will have earned an additional 25% interest, for a total 50% in the Property.
 
One of our directors is present on the Property as a representative for the Company during most exploration operations. If we hire an independent geologist, he/she will evaluate the information derived from the exploration and excavation and the engineers will advise us on the economic feasibility of removing the mineralized material.
 
Mineral property exploration is typically conducted in phases. We began our exploratory drilling campaign to determine if there is sufficient mineralization on the property to warrant continued exploration and development activities. We estimate the cost of the drilling, shipping samples, as well as geological mapping, rock chip sampling, grid establishment, hiring geologists, and soil sampling, to be approximately $500,000, which is the amount we expect to pay in order to acquire a 50% interest in the Property.
 
After the completion of the first phase of the exploration program, we will review the results and conclusions and evaluate the advisability of additional exploration work on the Property.

If we are unable to complete any phase of exploration because we don’t have enough funds, we will cease activities until we raise more money. At the present time, we have made arrangements to raise the additional funds required to do advanced exploration but not to place our Property into production. If we need additional cash and cannot raise it, we will either have to suspend activities until we do raise the cash, or cease activities entirely. Other than as described in this paragraph, we have no financing plans.
 
Lapon Canyon Gold Project 
 
Location and means of access
 
The Lapon Canyon Gold Project (the “Lapon Project”, or the “Property”) consists of 36 claims (720 acres) situated in the Wassuk Range, easily accessible by secondary state roads from the main highway (40 miles) south of Yerington, Nevada. A state grid power transmission line passes within 2 miles of the Property.
Geology and Mineralization
 
The Lapon Project is located within the Walker Lane shear zone, a 60 mile wide structural corridor extending in a southeast direction from Reno, Nevada. Within this trend, numerous gold, silver, and copper mines are located, notably the historic Comstock Lode mines in Virginia City, the past producing Esmeralda/Aurora gold mine, with reported production of some one million ounces, as well as the Anaconda open pit copper mine in Yerington. Nevada Copper’s new mine, Pumpkin Hollow, is also located within the Wassuk Range about 15 miles north of Lapon.
 
The Lapon project is cut by a series of steeply dipping cross fault structures cutting across the Walker trend, analogous to other cross fault structures responsible for many gold and base metal deposits in the world. These faults are heavily sheared and altered (sericite, iron oxides) with abundant silica. They vary in width from 200 to 1000 feet. Four of these structures have been discovered at Lapon, and at least two can be traced for over three miles. Gold mineralization is located within echelon structures within these faults. At least one of these shear zones, the Lapon Rose zone was the site of underground development, and shows a minimum strike length of 3 miles, has a width of over 200 feet and has a vertical extent of at least 2000 feet.
 
Exploration history
 
Small scale high grade mining began on the project in 1914. Approximately 2000 feet of drifts and raises were developed from two adits and a two-stamp mill was built. Further limited underground work was carried out, returning numerous assay values in the range of one ounce per ton, with a sample at the end of an adit returning 20.6 ounces per ton. (National Instrument 43-101, Montgomery and Barr, 2004).
 
2015 Exploration program
 
Walker River Resources Corp. began its initial exploration work in April 2015 with significant exploration progress made during 2015. Within the upper Lapon Rose Zone, gold mineralization in the form of Visible Gold was noted in two different locations within the upper adit. Due to intense alteration and shearing the on-site identification was found to be rather difficult; the samples were cut and studied using a microscope. The assays confirmed that the in situ rock is Porphyry, in all probabilities, a quart monzonite intrusive. Copper mineralization, in the form of malachite and chalcopyrite, has also been identified within the Lapon Rose Zone.
 
During the same exploration program a newly discovered shear/altered zone was discovered some 2000 feet east of the Lapon Rose Zone. Evidence of mining activities within this previously unknown zone were discovered with evidence of a collapsed mine portal.
 
Finally, another shear zone, some 3300 feet west of the Lapon Rose Zone, shows intense iron oxide mineralization and silicification, with the presence of a previously unknown adit into the center of this zone.

In the end of 2015, Walker River Resources Corp. completed an initial 5-hole reverse circulation (“RC”) drill program totalling 2500 feet on the Lapon Canyon Gold Project. The drill program was designed to test and confirm mineralization in an around the historical workings and mining on the Lapon Gold Project. The initial drill results confirmed the potential for the emplacement of significant gold mineralization on the Lapon Project.
 
2016 Exploration Program
 
During 2016, we completed a 9-hole RC drill program totaling 3400 feet on the Lapon Project. The drill program was designed to build on the results received from the 2015 drill program carried out by Walker River Resources Corp. continuing to test and confirm mineralization in and around the historical workings and mining on the Lapon Project.
 
RC drill hole LC 16-10 was designed to verify the position of previously reported, presently inaccessible mined out area. The drill hole successfully intersected the mined-out stope at the reported location and verified the width at some 26 feet at a depth of 223 feet. It is significant that the gold mineralization encountered in LC 16-10 was encountered from 180.12 to 220.14 feet, only 2.62 feet from the stope.
 
The additional drill results from the 2016 drill program continue to confirm the potential for the emplacement of significant gold mineralization on the Lapon Project.
 
Sampling Methodology, Chain of Custody, Quality Control and Quality Assurance
 
All sampling was conducted under the supervision of our project geologists and the chain of custody, from the drill to the sample preparation facility, was continuously monitored. A blank or certified reference material was inserted approximately every tenth sample. The Lapon samples were delivered to ALS Minerals certified laboratory facility in Reno, NV. The samples were crushed, pulverized and the sample pulps digested and analyzed for gold using fire assay fusion and a 50g gravimetric finish. Higher grade samples used a 1kg screen fire assay with screen to 100 microns and 50g gravimetric finish.
Competition
 
The mineral exploration business is an extremely competitive industry. We are competing with many other exploration companies looking for minerals. We are one of the smallest exploration companies and a very small participant in the mineral exploration business. Being a junior mineral exploration company, we compete with other similar companies for financing and joint venture partners, and for resources such as professional geologists, camp staff, helicopters and mineral exploration contractors and supplies. We do not represent a competitive presence in the industry.
 
Raw materials
 
The raw materials for our exploration programs include camp equipment, hand exploration tools, sample bags, first aid supplies, groceries and propane. All of these types of materials are readily available from a variety of local suppliers.
 
Dependence on Customers
 
As a junior exploration company, we have no customers.
 
Trademarks and Patents
 
We have no intellectual property such as patents or trademarks, and, other than the obligation under our option to acquire an interest in the Lapon Canyon Project that we discussed under the “Business” section, no royalty agreements or labor contracts.

Need For Any Government Approval of Principal Products or Services
 
We are not required to obtain permits or submit operational plans in order to conduct exploration on the Lapon Project. The mining business, however, is subject to various levels of government controls and regulations, which are supplemented and revised from time to time. We cannot predict what additional legislation or revisions might be proposed that could affect our business or when any proposals, if enacted, might become effective. Such changes, however, could require more operating capital and expenditures and could prevent or delay some of our operations.
 
The various levels of government controls and regulations address, among other things, the environmental impact of mining and mineral processing operations. For mining and processing, legislation and regulations in various jurisdictions establish performance standards, air and water quality emission standards and other design or operational requirements for various components of operations, including health and safety standards. Legislation and regulations also establish requirements for decommissioning, reclaiming and rehabilitating mining properties following the cessation of operations, and may require that some former mining properties be managed for long periods of time. As we are not mining or processing, and are unlikely to do so for some years, we have not investigated these regulations.
 
None of the exploration work that we have completed to date requires an environmental permit, however, we must ensure timely repair of any damage done to the land during exploration.
 
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with all material government controls and regulations on the Lapon Project.
 
Research and Development
 
We have not spent any money on research and development activities.
 
Employees
 
At the present time, we do not have any employees other than our sole officer who devotes his time as needed to our business and expects to devote 10 hours per week in 2017.
Legal Proceedings
 
We are not involved in any legal proceedings nor are we aware of any pending or threatened litigation against us. Neither our sole officer nor our directors are party to any legal proceeding or litigation. None of our directors or our sole officer have been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor relating to securities or performance in corporate office.
