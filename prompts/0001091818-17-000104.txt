Item 1.A Risk Factors
 Risk Factors Related to Our Gaming Equipment Operations. We are affected by the risks faced by foreign casino owners who we expect will be our future customers. Our prospective gaming machine customers are engaged in economically sensitive and competitive businesses. As a result, we will be indirectly affected by all the risks facing foreign casino owners, which are beyond our control. Our results of operations will depend, in part, on the financial strength of our customers and our customers' ability to compete effectively in the marketplace and manage their risks. Many of these risks are discussed below.
 Reductions in Consumer and Corporate Spending.  Consumer demand for hotel/casino resorts, trade shows and conventions, and for luxury amenities is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or corporate spending on conventions and business travel could be driven by many factors, such as perceived or actual general economic conditions; any further weaknesses in the job or housing market; additional credit market disruptions; high energy, fuel and food costs; the increased cost of travel; the potential for bank failures; perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth; fears of recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy; or fears of war and future acts of terrorism. These factors could reduce consumer and corporate demand for the luxury amenities and leisure activities of our customers, thus imposing additional limits on pricing and harming our operations.
 Regulations Affecting Casinos.  Casinos are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may have an adverse affect on their business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Casinos are required to obtain and maintain licenses from the jurisdictions in which they operate, and are subject to extensive background investigations and suitability standards. In some cases, a casino license may be subject to revocation at any time by government officials. There can be no assurance that our prospective casino customers will be able to obtain new licenses or renew any of their existing licenses, or that if such licenses are obtained, that such licenses will not be conditioned, suspended or revoked. The loss, denial or non-renewal of any of their licenses could have a material adverse effect on their and our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 
3

Casinos are Subject to Anti-Money Laundering Laws.  Our prospective casino customers will deal with significant amounts of cash in their operations and will be subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Any violation of anti-money laundering laws or regulations, or any accusations of money laundering or regulatory investigations into possible money laundering activities, by any of the properties, employees, or customers of our prospective casino customers could have a material adverse effect on their financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 Travel Concerns.  Casinos are sensitive to the willingness of customers to travel. Only a small amount of our potential casino customers' business will be generated by local residents. Most of their customers travel to reach their properties. Acts of terrorism may severely disrupt domestic and international travel, which would result in a decrease in customer visits to our potential customers' properties. Regional conflicts could have a similar effect on domestic and international travel. We cannot predict the extent to which disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any further terrorist act, outbreak of hostilities or escalation of war would have on our potential casino customers' financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
 Win Rates.  Win rates for casinos gaming operations depend on a variety of factors, some beyond their control. Consequently, the winnings of a casino's gaming customers could exceed the casino's winnings. The gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. In addition to the element of chance, win rates are also affected by other factors, including the players' skill and experience, the mix of games played, the financial resources of the players, the spread of table limits, the volume of bets placed and the amount of time played. Our potential casino customers' gaming profits are expected to mainly derive from the difference between their casino winnings and the casino winnings of their gaming customers. Since there is an inherent element of chance in the gaming industry, our potential casino customers will not have full control over their winnings or the winnings of their gaming customers. If the winnings of their gaming customers exceed their winnings, they may record a loss from gaming operations, which could have a material adverse effect on their (and our) business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 Fraud and Cheating Issues.  Casinos face the risk of fraud and cheating. Our potential casino customers' will most likely face attempts by some of their customers to commit fraud or cheat in order to increase winnings. Acts of fraud or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or other tactics, possibly in collusion with a casino's employees. Internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees through collusion with dealers, surveillance staff, floor managers or other casino or gaming area staff. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses to our potential casino customers gaming operations. In addition, negative publicity related to such schemes could have an adverse effect on our potential casino customers' reputations, likely causing a material adverse effect on their (and our) business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
 Limited Markets.  Because we expect to be dependent primarily upon gaming operations in two markets, Central and South America, initially in Columbia, for all of our cash flow, we will be subject to greater risks than competitors with more casino customers or which operate in more markets. We do not currently have any casino equipment leasing operations. As a result, we do not have any current cash flow from operations.
 Given that our operations are initially expected to be conducted only in Columbia, we will be subject to greater degrees of risk than competitors with more operating properties or that operate in more markets. The risks to which we will have a greater degree of exposure will include the following:
 · Local economic and competitive conditions;

· Inaccessibility due to inclement weather, road construction or closure of primary access routes;
 
· Decline in air passenger traffic due to higher ticket costs or fears concerning air travel;
 
· Changes in local and state governmental laws and regulations, including gaming laws and regulations;
 
· Natural or man-made disasters, or outbreaks of infectious diseases;
 
· A decline in the number of visitors to San Andres Isla, Columbia, where we expect to commence operations.
 
Tax Laws and Regulations.  Changes in tax laws and regulations could impact our financial condition and results of operations. We will be subject to taxation and regulation by various governmental agencies, primarily in Columbia, and other Central and South American countries, and the United States (federal, state and local levels). From time to time, U.S. federal, state, local and foreign governments make substantive changes to tax rules and the application of these rules, which could result in higher taxes than would be incurred under existing tax law or interpretation. In particular, governmental agencies may make changes that could reduce the profits that we can effectively realize from our non-U.S. operations. Like most U.S. companies, our effective income tax rate will reflect the fact that income earned and reinvested outside the U.S. is taxed at local rates, which are often lower than U.S. tax rates. If changes in tax laws and regulations were to significantly increase the tax rates on non-U.S. income, these changes could increase our income tax expense and liability, and therefore, could have an adverse effect on our effective income tax rate, financial condition and results of operations.

Financial Markets Financing Concerns.  Disruptions in the financial markets could have an adverse effect on our ability to raise additional financing. To expand our casino equipment leasing business, we will need to finance the purchase of new casino equipment. We currently do not have any arrangements to obtain debt or equity capital to finance new equipment purchases, and if we do not obtain such capital we may be unable to expand our anticipated operations. Severe disruptions in the commercial credit markets in the recent past have resulted in a tightening of credit markets worldwide. Liquidity in the global credit markets was severely contracted by these market disruptions, making it difficult and costly to obtain new lines of credit or to refinance existing debt. The effect of these disruptions was widespread and difficult to quantify. While economic conditions have recently improved, that trend may not continue and the extent of the current economic improvement is unknown. Any future disruptions in the commercial credit markets may impact liquidity in the global credit market as greatly, or even more, than in recent years.
 Our business and financing plan may be dependent upon completion of future financings. If the credit environment worsens, it may be difficult to obtain any additional financing on acceptable terms, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to complete our planned projects, and as a consequence, our results of operations and business plans. Should general economic conditions not improve, if we are unable to obtain sufficient funding or applicable government approvals such that completion of planned projects is not probable, or should management decide to abandon certain projects, all or a portion of our investment to date in our planned projects could be lost and would result in an impairment charge. 
 Currency Risks.  Our potential casino customers will be subject to currency risks. Our gaming equipment lease provides for lease payments in U.S. dollars, while our lessees will conduct business in the currency of the country where the lessee is located. Accordingly, our lessees' ability to make lease payments will be subject to our lessees' ability to convert the foreign currency into U.S. dollars. As a result, our lessee's ability to make lease payments will be subject to fluctuations in the exchange rate of the applicable foreign currency against the U.S. dollar, as well as local laws and regulations which may limit or impair a foreign person or entity's ability to convert the subject foreign currency to U.S. dollars.
 Our Legal Rights and Remedies are Uncertain in the Event of a Default by a Lessee.  In the event we are required to take any legal action under a lease of our casino equipment, such as to repossess our equipment, we would be required to do so in the courts, and under the laws, of the country where the equipment is located. The legal systems of foreign countries may not allow for the repossession of equipment as quickly and as cost-effectively as in the U.S., with the result that we may face greater delays and expenses in exercising any rights under our leases. Consequently, losses due to a default by a lessee may be greater than otherwise would be the case.
 Conflict of Interest.  Paul Parliament, our chairman, president, chief executive officer, and director, has an indirect conflict of interest inasmuch as he has a private business relationship with GameTouch, LLC., a company controlled by one of our consultants and current major stockholder, Julios Kosta, from whom Mr. Parliament purchased gaming equipment.
Competition
 To the extent we expand leasing our casino equipment to more than one operator we will face competition from casino equipment suppliers, leasing affiliates of casino equipment suppliers, and independent leasing companies. Most of our potential competitors have far greater resources than we have and have far greater experience in the casino industry than we possess.
Markets and Major Customers
 While all casinos need casino equipment, we define our market as casinos in Central and South America, which we believe is an underserved market. Currently, we do not have any customers.
Seasonality of Business
 Because we intend to lease our gaming equipment pursuant to master leases, we do not expect that our revenues and earnings from our casino equipment line of business will be affected by seasonal factors. However, casino lessees may be located in resort or vacation locations, which make their operations subject to seasonal fluctuations, which may affect our cash flows.
Regulations
 The gaming industry is subject to extensive governmental regulation by federal, state and local governments, as well as tribal officials or organizations and foreign governments. While the regulatory requirements vary by jurisdiction, most require:
 · Licenses and/or permits;
 · Findings of suitability for the operator, as well as individual officers, directors, major shareholders, and key employees;
 · Documentation of qualifications, including evidence of financial stability; and 
 · Other required approvals for manufacturers or distributors of gaming equipment and services, including but not limited to new product approvals.
 
Gaming laws and regulations serve to protect the public and ensure that gaming related activity is conducted honestly, competitively, and free of corruption. Regulatory oversight additionally ensures that the local authorities receive the appropriate amount of gaming tax revenues.
 5

Certain regulators not only govern the activities within their jurisdiction, but also monitor activities in other jurisdictions to ensure that the operator complies with local standards on a worldwide basis. For example, the State of Nevada requires that its licensees maintain Nevada standards for all operations worldwide. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. We will require that our potential lessees maintain any required licenses to use our equipment in their facilities.
 Since we do not manufacture gaming equipment, we are not subject to license requirements applicable to gaming equipment manufacturers.
 Patents and Intellectual Property
We do not have any patents or trademarks.
 Impact of Inflation
 We are affected by inflation along with the rest of the economy. Specifically, our costs to operate a company whose shares are publicly traded.
 Our Financial Results May Be Affected by Factors Outside of Our Control
 Our future operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside our control. Our anticipated expense levels are based, in part, on our estimates of future revenues and may vary from projections. We may be unable to adjust spending rapidly enough to compensate for any unexpected revenues shortfall. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our planned expenditures would materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition. Further, we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily a meaningful indication of future performance.
Key Personnel
 Our future financial success depends to a large degree upon the personal efforts of our key personnel. As of the date of this report, we have three employees, Paul Parliament, our chairman, president, chief executive officer, and director, Richard Kaiser, our interim chief financial officer, secretary, corporate governance officer and director, and Douglas Brooks, our vice-president and director, all of whom will play a major role in securing the services of those persons who can develop our business strategy upon receipt of sufficient funds to pay for such services either from success through receipt of funds from earnings, borrowing or sales of our securities. While we intend to employ additional management and marketing personnel in order to minimize the critical dependency upon any one person, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining the persons needed. We have employment agreements with each of Messrs. Parliament, Brooks, and Kaiser, and consulting agreement with Julio Kostas. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of operations - Consulting Agreements. 
Adequacy of Working Capital
 We hope to generate sufficient capital to fund our business plan through investments in our securities, revenues from operations, or borrowings. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations  Financing Activities. If we are not able to raise additional capital as described above, or if we are unable to raise additional capital on terms that are reasonable, we would not be able to continue and our business would fail. As of the date of this report, we do not have any commitments for financing.
Employees
 As noted above, we currently have three employees. We anticipate that we will hire any additional employees over the next 12 months. As our operations expand, we will need to employ additional personnel. We do not feel that we would have any difficulty in locating needed help.
 From time-to-time, we anticipate that we will use the services of independent contractors and consultants to support our business development and who have experience in the sale and leasing of gaming equipment in Central and South America, such as Julio Kosta, one of our major stockholders. We believe our future success depends in large part upon the continued service of our senior management personnel and our ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial personnel.
 Mr. Martin Wolfe, didn't seek election as director at the annual shareholder meeting, held September 28, 2016, and subsequently, resigned as the Company's chief financial officer on February 28, 2017 (See Form 8-K).
 Transfer Agent
 Our transfer agent is Transfer Online Inc. whose address is 512 SE Salmon Street, Portland, Oregon 97214, and telephone number (503) 227-2950.

Company Contact Information
 Our principal executive offices are located at 590 York Road, Unit 3, Niagara On The Lake, Ontario, CANADA L0S 1J0, telephone (716) 803-0621. The information to be contained in our Internet website, www.bravomultinational.com, shall not constitute part of this report. 
Risks Relating to Our Business
 Inasmuch as mining operations by our lessee have been terminated on our mining leases, the following discussion of Risk Factors relates only to our gaming equipment leasing business going forward. However, Bravo Multinational, Inc. owns 76.63 acres within seven patented mining claims with a 29.167% ownership interest in each claim. We will maintain this ownership status for the foreseeable future. All BLM claims were dropped, and allowed to expire.
 Except as otherwise indicated by the context, references in this report to we, us, our, the company or Goldland Holdings are to the business of Bravo Multinational Incorporated and our wholly-owned subsidiary Bravo Gaming Corporation.
 We are a holding company of several affiliated companies, with limited operating businesses.
 Bravo Multinational, Inc. has no recent extensive operating history upon which you can evaluate our gaming equipment business and prospects. You must consider the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies whose businesses deal with gaming equipment leasing and sales. If we are unsuccessful in addressing these risks and uncertainties, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially and adversely affected.
 Our auditors have stated we may not be able to stay in business.
 Our auditors have issued a going concern opinion, which means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business for the next 12 months. Unless we can raise additional capital, we may not be able to achieve our objectives and may have to suspend or cease operations. In the future, we may raise additional capital though equity or debt offerings, although there is no assurance that this will occur. See Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 
 Our future revenues are unpredictable and our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.
 Although the Company was incorporated under another name in 1989, we have had only a limited operating history. We cannot forecast with any degree of certainty whether our proposed gaming equipment sales and leasing business will ever generate revenue or the amount of revenue to be generated. In addition, we cannot predict the consistency of our quarterly operating results.
 We estimate that we will need at least $750,000 to fund our operations over the next 12 months, in addition to repaying or refinancing promissory notes, which are due within 12 to 24 months. The outstanding liabilities are $2,910,090 which includes amounts due to directors, and there is no assurance that the Company will be able to raise such funds or to raise such funds on terms that would be acceptable.

We may have difficulty in attracting and retaining management and outside independent members to our board of directors as a result of their concerns relating to their increased personal exposure to lawsuits and stockholder claims by virtue of holding these positions in a publicly held company.
 Our shares of common stock are publicly traded on the OTCPK operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. discussed below. The directors and management of publicly traded corporations are increasingly concerned with the extent of their personal exposure to lawsuits and stockholder claims, as well as governmental and creditor claims which may be made against them, particularly in view of recent changes in securities laws imposing additional duties, obligations and liabilities on management and directors. Due to these perceived risks, directors and management are also becoming increasingly concerned with the availability of directors and officers' liability insurance to pay on a timely basis the costs incurred in defending such claims. We currently do not carry directors and officers' liability insurance. Directors and officers' liability insurance has recently become much more expensive and difficult to obtain. If we are unable to provide directors and officers' liability insurance at affordable rates or at all, it may become increasingly more difficult to attract and retain qualified outside directors to serve on our board of directors.
 Compliance with changing regulation of financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure may result in additional expenses and diversion of management time and attention from operational activities.
 Compliance with changing laws, regulations and standards relating to financial reporting, corporate governance and public disclosure, including new accounting standards, SEC regulations, and FINRA (Financial Industry Regulatory Authority) rules, are time consuming and expensive. We have spent substantial amounts of management time and have incurred substantial legal and accounting expense in the past in complying with these federal securities laws. Complying with these laws and regulations also creates uncertainty for companies such as ours. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity. As a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices.
 Any claims or threats of litigation could distract us from business operations and strategic planning, and costs of litigation or settlement could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
 Any claims made or litigation commenced against us, or our officers or directors, may distract our board of directors, management, or other key employees from business operations and strategic planning. There may also be an increase versus prior periods in potential claims or litigation relative to our operational growth. Claims resolution frequently entails a cost/benefit analysis, which would include consideration of the potential risks, expenses and impact to business operations. We may determine to litigate or settle such claims (including threatened claims) even if we believe those claims have little or no merit. The cost of litigation or settlements could adversely affect our financial condition or our results of operations. 
 We have a very small management team and the loss of any member of this team may prevent us from implementing our business plan in a timely manner; our management has substantial outside business interests.
 We have three executive officers and a limited number of additional consultants. Our success depends largely upon the continued services of Paul Parliament, our chairman, president, chief executive officer, and director, Richard Kaiser, our interim chief financial officer, secretary, corporate governance officer and director, and Douglas Brooks, our vice president and director. We need additional executive personnel in order to fulfill our business plan and satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company in a timely fashion. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies on the lives of any of our officers. The loss of any of our officers could seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. In such an event, we may not be able to recruit personnel to replace our officers in a timely manner, or at all, on acceptable terms.

8

Furthermore, the employment agreements with our executive officers permit them to have outside business interests, such that they are not required to devote 100% of their working time to our business. Mr. Parliament estimates that he spends about 80% of his working time on activities related to the activities of Bravo Multinational Incorporated . Mr. Kaiser estimates that he spends about 70% of his working time on activities of Bravo Multinational Incorporated . Mr. Brooks estimates he spends about 50% of his work time on activities of Bravo Multinational Incorporated. The fact that Messrs. Parliament, Brooks, and Kaiser have outside business interests could lessen their focus on our business.
 We have substantial commitments that may require that we raise capital.
 As of December 31, 2016, we had current assets of $ 204,089 and current liabilities of $2,910,090. A substantial part of our current liabilities consist of debts that we only have to pay if funds are available or that will be paid in the form of shares of our common stock. Our officers also have agreed to receive a portion their salaries in the form of shares of our common stock. If our officers do not agree to receive our stock in payment of their salaries, and we are unable to make payments in cash, we will have to raise capital in order to pay our liabilities, which we expect would be dilutive to existing stockholders. 
 Risks Relating to Our Mining Properties
 As we discussed above, although we still own our mining properties, we do not have a lessee currently conducting operations. However, there are still some risks associated with our mining properties, including those risks described below. For a complete discussion of mining operations conducted by our lessee, please see our previous Form 10-Ks, 10-Qs, and 8-Ks filed with the SEC. 
 We have minimal revenue to date from our mining properties, which may negatively impact our ability to achieve our business objectives.
 Since acquiring our mining properties in September 2007, we have experienced losses from our operations.
 The properties in which we have an interest do not have any known reserves.
 None of the properties in which we have an interest have any known reserves. To date, we have engaged in only limited preliminary exploration activities on the properties. Accordingly, we do not have sufficient information upon which to assess the ultimate success of our exploration efforts.
 There are uncertainties as to title matters in the mining industry. Any defects in such title could cause us to lose our rights in mineral properties and jeopardize our business operations.
 Our mineral properties consist of private mineral rights Bravo Multinational, Inc. owns 76.63 acres within seven patented mining claims with a 29.167% ownership interest in each claim.
 There may be challenges to title to the mineral properties in which we hold a material interest. If there are title defects with respect to any properties, we might be required to compensate other persons or perhaps reduce our interest in the affected property. Also, in any such case, the investigation and resolution of title issues would divert our management's time from our other operations. 
 The mining lease with Silver Falcon Mining, Inc., subsequently has been cancelled, and efforts to pursue monies owed from the lessee , Silver Falcon Mining, Inc., are not possible, Silver Falcon Mining, Inc. appears to be insolvent.
 Risks Relating to Our Stock
 Voting control of our shares is possessed by our management team. Additionally, this concentration of ownership could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of Bravo Multinational, Inc. that might otherwise result in a stockholder receiving a premium over the market price for his shares.
 Paul Parliament, our chairman, president, chief executive officer, and director, director, Douglas Brooks, our vice president and director, and Richard Kaiser, our interim chief financial officer, secretary and corporate governance officer, the management team of Bravo Multinational , and its subsidiaries, own approximately 6.1% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. In addition, Messrs. Parliament, Kaiser, and Brooks, own collectively 2,750,000 shares of our Series A Preferred Stock. Each share of the Series A Preferred Stock has voting rights equal to 100 shares of our common stock. As a result, our management team has the power to vote 275,085,962 shares of our common stock, which number exceeds our outstanding shares of our common stock. Therefore, Messrs. Parliament, Brooks, and Kaiser can control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval and to control our management and affairs, including extraordinary transactions such as mergers and other changes of corporate control. Additionally, this concentration of voting power could discourage or prevent a potential takeover of Bravo Multinational that might otherwise result in a stockholder receiving a premium over the market price for his shares. See Item 12. Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters.
 Even though our shares are publicly traded, an investor's shares may not be free-trading.
 Investors should understand that their shares of our common stock are not free-trading merely because Bravo Multinational is a publicly-traded company. In order for the shares to become free-trading, the shares must be registered, or entitled to an exemption from registration under applicable law.

The market price for our common stock will most likely continue to be particularly volatile given our status as a relatively unknown company with a small and thinly traded public float, limited operating history and lack of net revenues which could lead to wide fluctuations in our share price. The price at which you purchased our common stock may not be indicative of the price that will prevail in the trading market.
 The market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. As a consequence of this lack of liquidity, the trading of relatively small quantities of shares by our stockholders may disproportionately influence the price of those shares in either direction. The price for our shares could, for example, decline precipitously in the event that a large number of shares of our common stock are sold on the market without commensurate demand, as compared to a seasoned issuer which could better absorb those sales without adverse impact on its share price.

Secondly, we are a speculative or risky investment due to our lack of current revenues. As a consequence of this enhanced risk, more risk-adverse investors may, be more inclined to sell their shares on the market more quickly and at greater discounts than would be the case with the stock of a seasoned issuer.
 An investor may be unable to sell his common stock at or above his purchase price, which may result in substantial losses to the investor.
 The following factors may add to the volatility in the price of our common stock: actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly or annual operating results; government regulations, announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships or joint ventures; our capital commitments; and additions or departures of our key personnel. Many of these factors are beyond our control and may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating performance. We cannot make any predictions or projections as to what the prevailing market price for our common stock will be at any time, including as to whether our common stock will sustain the current market price, or as to what effect the sale of shares or the availability of common stock for sale at any time will have on the prevailing market price.
 We may need to raise additional capital. If we are unable to raise necessary additional capital, our business may fail or our operating results and our stock price may be materially adversely affected.
 We need to secure adequate funding. We hope to be able to fund our business through the revenues earned from operations. To date we have been unable to earn sufficient revenues to fund or business and therefore, we will need to raise the necessary capital through equity or debt offerings, which may reduce the value of our outstanding securities. We may be unable to secure additional financing on favorable terms or at all.
 Selling additional shares of our common stock, either privately or publicly, would dilute the equity interests of our stockholders. If we borrow more money, we will have to pay interest and may also have to agree to restrictions that limit our operating flexibility. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing, we may have to curtail our operations and our business would fail.
 Our issuance of additional common stock in exchange for services or to repay debt would dilute a stockholder's proportionate ownership and voting rights and could have a negative impact on the market price of our common stock.
 Our board of directors may generally issue shares of common stock to pay for debt or services, without further approval by our stockholders based upon such factors as our board of directors may deem relevant at that time. It is likely that we will issue additional securities to pay for services and reduce debt in the future. In fact, our current employment agreements with Messrs. Parliament, Brooks, and Kaiser, as well as consultants, call for the issuance of shares of our common stock to pay a portion, if not all, of the compensation to be due to them
 The elimination of monetary liability against our directors, officers and employees under our certificate of incorporation and the existence of indemnification rights for our directors, officers and employees may result in substantial expenditures by Bravo Multinational and may discourage lawsuits against our directors, officers and employees.
 Our certificate of incorporation contains provisions which eliminate the liability of our directors for monetary damages to Bravo Multinational and our stockholders. Our bylaws also require us to indemnify our officers and directors. We may also have contractual indemnification obligations under our agreements with our directors, officers and employees. The foregoing indemnification obligations could result in Bravo Multinational incurring substantial expenditures to cover the cost of settlement or damage awards against directors, officers and employees, which we may be unable to recoup. These provisions and resultant costs may also discourage Bravo Multinational from bringing a lawsuit against directors, officers and employees for breaches of their fiduciary duties, and may similarly discourage the filing of derivative litigation by our stockholders against our directors, officers and employees even though such actions, if successful, might otherwise benefit Bravo Multinational and our stockholders.

Absence of dividends.
 We have never paid or declared any dividends on our common stock. Likewise, we do not anticipate paying, in the near future, dividends or distributions on our common stock or our common stock which may be sold in the future. Any dividends will be declared at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend, among other things, on our earnings, our financial requirements for future operations and growth, and other facts as we may then deem appropriate.
 Our directors have the right to authorize the issuance of additional shares of our common stock.
 Our directors, within the limitations and restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation and without further action by our stockholders, have the authority to issue shares of common stock from time to time. Should we issue additional shares of our common stock at a later time, each stockholder's ownership interest in our stock would be proportionally reduced. No stockholder will have any preemptive right to acquire additional shares of our common stock, or any of our other securities.
 If we fail to remain current in our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTCPK, which would limit the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market.
 Companies trading on the OTCPK must be reporting issuers under Section 12 of the Exchange Act, and must be current in their reports under Section 13 of the Exchange Act, in order to maintain price quotation privileges on the OTCPK. If we fail to remain current in our reporting requirements, we could be removed from the OTCPK. In such an event, the market liquidity for our securities could be adversely affected by limiting the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and the ability of stockholders to sell their securities in the secondary market.
 Our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the trading market in our common stock will be limited, which would make transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the investment value of our stock.
 Our shares of common stock are penny stocks because they are not registered on a national securities exchange or listed on an automated quotation system sponsored by a registered national securities association, pursuant to Rule 3a51-1(a) under the Exchange Act. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require:
 · That a broker or dealer approve a person's account for transactions in penny stocks; and
 · That the broker or dealer receives from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.
 
The broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form:
 
· Sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and
 · That the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction.
 Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the penny stock rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common stock and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.
 Disclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.

The market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse.
 Stockholders should be aware that, according to SEC Release No. 34-29093, the market for penny stocks has suffered in recent years from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include:
 · Control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer;
 · Manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases;
 · Boiler room practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced 
 salespersons;
 
· Excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differential and markups by selling broker-dealers; and 
 ·The wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequential investor losses.
 
Our management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our securities. The occurrence of these patterns or practices could increase the volatility of our share price.
