ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
Envision is a sustainable technology innovation company based in San Diego, California. Focusing on what we refer to as “Solar 3.0,” we invent, design, engineer, manufacture and sell solar powered products that enable vital and highly valuable services in locations where it is either too expensive or too impactful to connect to the utility grid or where the requirements for electrical power are so important that grid failures, like blackouts, are not an option. When competing with utilities or typical solar companies, we rely on our products deployability, reliability, accessibility, and total cost of ownership, rather than producing the cheapest kilowatt hour with the help of subsidies.
 
Envision’s solar powered products and proprietary technology solutions target three verticals: electric vehicle charging infrastructure, out of home advertising platforms, and energy security and disaster preparedness. The Company focuses on creating renewably energized platforms for electric vehicle (“EV”) charging, media and branding, and energy security that management believes are attractive, rapidly deployed, and of the highest quality. Management believes that our chief differentiator is our ability to invent, design, engineer, and manufacture solar products which are a complex integration of our own proprietary technology and other commonly available engineered components. The resulting products are built to have the longest life expectancy in the industry while also delivering valuable amenities and potentially highly attractive revenue opportunities for our customers. Management believes that Envision’s products deliver multiple layers of value such as: impact free renewably energized EV charging; media, branding, and advertising platforms; sustainable and secure energy production; architectural enhancement; reduced carbon footprint; high visibility "green halo" branding; reduction of net operating costs through reduced utility bills; and revenue creation opportunities through the sales of digital out of home (“DOOH”) media. The Company sells its products to customers with requirements in one or more of the three verticals the Company addresses. Qualified customers can also lease our EV ARC™ products through leasing relationships we have developed. Envision’s products can qualify for various federal, state, and local incentives which could significantly reduce final out-of-pocket costs from the our selling price for eligible customers.
 
Products and Technologies 
 
We produce two categories of product: the EV ARC™ product (Electric Vehicle Autonomous Renewable Charger) and the Solar Tree® product. Both product lines incorporate the same underlying technology and value, having a built-in renewable energy source in the form of attached solar panels, along with battery storage capability, but one is in a transportable format and one is in a fixed format.
 
We have developed and patented a product called EV ARC™. We have observed that the EV ARC™ can solve many problems associated with electric vehicle charging infrastructure deployments. Until the introduction of the EV ARC™, the deployment of EV chargers could be hindered by complications in the site acquisition processes caused by the complicated and invasive requirements to fulfill the installation. Each typical competing EV charger requires a pedestal which is typically mounted to a poured concrete foundation which first requires excavation. Fixed chargers also typically require a trench run to deliver grid connected electricity, and often require transformers and other local electrical equipment upgrades. Additional entitlements, easements, leases, and other site acquisition requirements can be expensive and may slow, or prevent entirely, the deployment of large numbers of typical fixed format chargers. When an EV charger is deployed successfully, the host may be liable for increased kilowatt hour charges, and at times, more expensive demand charges. Landlords, corporations, venues, and other hosts often do not perceive enough value creation in the deployment of a fixed EV charger, and as such, may not be inclined to grant permission to the service providers who approach them, or to install EV chargers at their own expense for their employees and guests, because the costs and disruption associated with grid tied chargers can be prohibitive.

We believe EV ARC™ changes this paradigm completely because it is entirely self-contained and is delivered to the site ready to operate. It requires no foundation, trenching, concrete, electrical or civil works and can be deployed in minutes. Its high traction ballasted base pad creates a structurally sound platform that supports the rest of the structure. The solar array is connected via our EnvisionTrak™ tracking solution to a column which is mounted to the ballasted pad. An electrical cabinet integrated into the unit houses various components enabling the conversion of sunlight to electricity which is stored in on-board batteries, and delivers that electricity to the EV charging station. Incorporating battery storage means that an EV ARC™ operates day and night, as well as during grid interruptions such as blackouts. An EV ARC™ can deliver a clean source of power to any model of EV charger that is integrated into the structure. Further, the EV ARC™ can be remotely monitored through a cellular data connection for energy production and the state of health of its vital components. The EV ARC™ has been successfully deployed in California, New York, Colorado, Brazil, the Virgin Islands, and Spain for customers such as Caltrans, Google, NY City, Genentech, Johnson and Johnson, and the Department of Energy.
 
We have integrated a digital advertising screen onto the EV ARC™ creating the EV ARC™ Digital. This advertising screen is weather, theft, and vandalism resistant and will be powered entirely by the EV ARC™. The introduction of the advertising screen creates new potential revenue streams for the owner of the EV ARC™ and we believe that this makes an EV ARC™ a more attractive product for certain prospective customers. This advancement could lead to multiple other similar uses of our products. Because the EV ARC™ product delivers valuable services such as solar powered EV charging and a secure energy source which can be used by first responders during grid failures, management believes that it may be eligible for permitting where other advertising platforms would be prohibited.
 
“Digital Out of Home Advertising” is the third fastest growing advertising medium. Double digit growth with billions of dollars per year in national and global spending make outdoor advertising an attractive opportunity for anyone who can make it work. There are, however, significant barriers to making it work. In general, in the United States, it is becoming harder to deploy outdoor advertising in most places where it is of value. Similar to the EV charging vertical, the outdoor advertising industry seeks new solutions to overcome the significant barriers to entry such as planning, entitlement, electrical circuitry, and civil engineering. Industry veterans spend a good deal of time looking for the “new new” in advertising, a solution that is environmentally friendly, cost effective, and most importantly, can make its way through the significant hurdles of permitting and zoning. We believe that our products are ideally suited to reduce many of the barriers to entry for outdoor advertising and as such we believe that significant opportunities may present themselves to us as we continue to address this market.
 
EV ARC™ products also provide a highly reliable source of energy that is not susceptible to grid interruptions. Because an EV ARC™ has on-board energy storage, it can be used as a disaster preparedness tool. It is a reliable back up source of energy in times of emergency or grid failure caused by hurricanes, terrorism, cascading blackouts or other grid vulnerabilities. EV ARC™ can be configured to allow only a select group, such as first responders, to access the solar generated and stored energy. A fireman or police officer will be able to connect, safely to the EV ARC™ and power any devices that would typically require a gasoline or diesel generator. We believe that the EV ARC™ will be a much more reliable and a cleaner source of energy than the electric grid or other traditional back up energy sources. The EV ARC™ does not require the level of ongoing maintenance that a diesel or gasoline generator requires and there is less chance that it will not be operational in times of emergency as the first responders are not required to start it or fill it with fuel. We believe, and we have been told by our customers and prospects, that the triple use of EV charging, digital outdoor advertising, and emergency energy production make the EV ARC™ an extremely compelling value proposition.
 
EV ARC™ is designed to address the sizable market of EV charging infrastructure. We believe the current lack of such infrastructure is the single greatest impediment to the adoption of EVs in the US and elsewhere. A standardized, portable, easily deployable EV charger, which is renewably energized rather than relying on carbon based electrical energy, would appear to have significant appeal to those that are interested in the proliferation of EV’s and EV charging infrastructure. We believe no competing company has a similar product, so the Company’s first-to-market position should create an opportunity for a sizable share in the market interest.
 
In June 2015, the Department of General Services of the State of California awarded us a one year contract, with options for the State for two one-year extensions, to produce and sell the EV ARC™ to any California state, local, or municipal agency that orders them from us. In April 2016, this contract was extended for the first one year option period through June 2017.

In September 2016, New York City released an Invitation to Bid (“ITB”) for EV charging infrastructure. The ITB specified Envision Solar’s EV ARC™ product. When submitting our response, we attended the bid opening where Envision was the only respondent. We are currently in the process of going through vendor compliance, and we anticipate that process to be completed by the end of April so that we will be capable of fulfilling the first orders we receive from that contract during the second quarter of 2017.
 
In these early stages of the production evolution for the EV ARC™ with low production volumes, we believe the appropriate selling price point to be lower than the actual costs of production thus resulting in gross losses on sales. We continually succeed and strive to make productional improvements to both the products and processes designed to reduce our manufacturing costs. As unit sales continue to increase and become sufficient to overcome certain fixed overhead costs shared amongst all of our produced products, and we sustain the trend of reducing our cost through continued production economies of scale, production process improvements, and component cost reductions, management believes that gross profits can be realized and maintained.
 
Our patented Solar Tree® structure has been in deployment and continued improvement for several years. We believe the resulting product has become the standard of quality in larger scale solar powered EV charging, energy security, and media and branding. We understand the Solar Tree® product to be the only single column, tracking, and architectural solar support structure with integrated energy storage potential and media platforms available today. We believe that Solar Tree® products with integrated battery storage will become important contributors to the growing EV charging infrastructure requirements in California and the rest of the world. Because our products do not require a connection to the electrical grid, they can enable EV charging in locations where it would otherwise be impossible. For example, rest areas and park and ride locations which might have sufficient energy for lights and vending machines, but do not have sufficient power for EV charging, can be served by our Solar Tree® products which can be optimized for direct current (“ DC”) fast charging. The costs and environmental impact associated with delivering a 50kW or greater circuit to a remote rest area may be prohibitive, whereas a Solar Tree® direct current fast charger (“DCFC”) can be deployed with minimal site disturbance. Management believes that our relationship with Caltrans and other State of California agencies, which are currently limited to the sale of EV ARC™ systems, can be leveraged to enable sales of our larger Solar Tree® products. We further believe that success with Caltrans might be leveraged with other departments of transportation across the United States and the rest of the world.
 
We believe Solar Tree® products with on-board battery storage can provide a highly reliable source of energy to be used in the event of a failure of the grid. We have seen data suggesting grid failures cost businesses in the United States approximately $200 billion per year and when those failures impact vital services such as hospitals, they have been responsible for loss of life. We believe that a hospital equipped with Solar Tree® energy security products could benefit both economically and from a life safety point of view. We believe that there are many other such instances where the reliable combination of renewable energy and energy storage can deliver value which exceeds simply competing with the utility.
 
We have invented and incorporated EnvisionTrak™, our patented and proprietary tracking solution, onto all of our products, furthering the unique nature of the product and we believe increasing our technological leadership within the industry. We believe EnvisionTrak™ to be a complex integration of the highest quality gearing, electrical motors, and controls which are combined in a robust, highly engineered, and supremely reliable manner. While there are many tracking solutions available to the solar industry, we believe EnvisionTrak™ is the only tracking solution which causes the solar array to orient itself in alignment with the sun without swinging, rotating, or leaving its lineal alignment with the parking spaces below. We believe this is a vital attribute in solar shaded parking as any swinging or rotating of the arrays could result in impeding the flow of traffic, particularly first responders such as fire trucks, in the drive aisles. It is a violation of many local codes to have restricted overhead clearance in the drive aisles. EnvisionTrak™ has been demonstrated, through data obtained from our past customers, to significantly increase electrical production. An additional value is derived from the high visual appeal created by EV ARC™ or Solar Tree® structures which are tracking the sun in perfect synchronicity. Solar Tree® products incorporate our latest engineering and fabrication improvements. This has allowed us to reduce costs and time to deploy Solar Tree® structures and we have seen improvements in the fabrication processes. We anticipate further improvements in future deployments of the product. Recently, we performed on a contract to deliver 12 HVLC Solar Tree ® structures to a client in Chicago whereby all such structures were delivered during the fourth quarter of 2016.

We also believe that Solar Tree® products optimized for branding can create visually stunning platforms for the delivery of a business’ brand message with a less onerous planning and entitlement process than that experienced with traditional signage.
 
Envision continues to identify other complimentary product offerings and enhancements to current offerings, and is in the design, engineering, and patenting phase on certain such products.
 
We strive to produce products integrating only the highest quality components available. Our production philosophy is to invest in quality design, components, and integration so as to ensure the lowest costs of warranty and service in the industry, while maintaining and growing a brand which we believe is already recognized as one of the leading producers of the highest quality solar products available.
 
We produce a series of products which management believes offer multiple layers of value to our customers leveraging the same underlying technology and fabrication techniques and infrastructure. This enables us to reach a broad customer base with varied product offerings without maintaining the overhead normally associated with a diverse set of products.

Operations
 
We are headquartered in San Diego, California in a newly leased 50,000 square foot building professionally equipped to handle the significant growth possibilities we believe are in front of us. The building houses our corporate operations, sales, design, engineering and product manufacturing.
 
The EV ARC™ and Solar Tree® structures are being fabricated in this facility. We have reduced certain direct costs associated with individual products and we believe we have been better able to control quality as a result of our self-performing the manufacturing processes as opposed to outsourcing this activity as we did in the past. We have made improvements to existing products and are able to introduce new products in a much more timely and efficient manner. Management believes that the product development process is significantly faster and less expensive when carried out by an in-house fabrication facility. We no longer install our Solar Tree® products, selling them instead as an engineered kit of parts to be installed by third parties employed by the buyer of the Solar Tree® kit. We will continue to deliver our EV ARC™ product, using the specialized and proprietary ARC Mobility™ trailer, within an approximate 500 mile range of our fabrication facility and use third party transportation solutions for greater distances.

Management believes that the continuation of our strategy to create highly engineered, highly scalable products which are delivered complete or as a kit of parts to the customer site, and which require minimal planning, entitlement, or field labor activities, is further positioning us as a leader in the provision of unique and highly scalable solutions to the three market verticals we target. Our products are complex but standardized, readily deployable and reduce the exposure of the Company and our customers to the risks and inherent margin erosion that are incumbent in field deployments. We are no longer directly involved in the field installation of our Solar Tree® products, instead selling them as a kit to be installed by others. Wherever possible, the components of the Solar Tree® structures are factory integrated and assembled such that complete assemblies are delivered to customer sites so that they may be erected and installed by readily available local labor resources contracted directly to the site host without our involvement. As part of the delivery of the latest units of Solar Tree structures to our customers, our design and engineering team has created a detailed, step by step, installation manual that we believe can be easily used by any competent construction resource to seamlessly erect and install our structures. With this manual, we believe the ease of installation can be directly communicated thus minimizing the trepidation and cost estimates associated with installations and thereby continuing to reduce sales hurdles resulting in increased sales.
 
The EV ARC™ product family requires no field installation work and is typically delivered to the customer site by us or by a third-party transportation company for a fee.
 
We continue to bring engineering improvements to our products that are designed to increase the level of standardization and reduce the field labor and effort required for product deployment. The EV ARC™ is the embodiment of this strategy in that it requires almost no field activity beyond “parking” it in a space. We have invented and produced the ARC Mobility™ trailer which is a hydraulically enabled delivery trailer that can lower an EV ARC™ product to the ground in its final location in less than two minutes.
 
Management believes that we benefit through the deliberate continued leveraging of certain outsourced resources. While we develop all intellectual property in-house, product designs are vetted by third-party structural and electrical engineering firms to ensure that the designs meet the local jurisdictional requirements and codifications for the deployment locations. We believe this further helps dissipate potential liabilities for the structural and electrical elements by providing additionally insured experts with partial responsibility for the designs.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
Historically, we concentrated a sizeable portion of our resources on product development and engineering. Management believes that we now have a reproducible suite of products which address the three market verticals in which we operate (EV charging infrastructure; out of home advertising infrastructure; and renewable energy production). As a result, we have increased our focus on sales and marketing in 2016 and intend to continue this focus in 2017. In 2016, we hired employees to form a sales team to sell our products directly through telephone and emailing campaigns. We believe our sales team has created a significant pipeline of prospective customers and has already converted such efforts into contracted sales.
 
Our current sales activities are undertaken in the following manners:
 

· | Direct sales efforts undertaken by our “in-house” sales team,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


· | Direct sales efforts undertaken by other independent contractors,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Direct sales efforts as a result of management relationships, and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Follow on sales to existing customers.
--+---------------------------------------

 
Our marketing efforts are responsible for the generation of many of our sales leads and have consisted of the following:
 

· | Attendance at trade shows and conferences, often with live demonstrations of EV ARC™,
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Deliveries of a “loaner” EV ARC™ unit to potential customer sites so the customer can directly experience the benefits of the product,
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Web Site and limited search engine optimization,
--+-------------------------------------------------


· | Direct electronic mailings to prospects within our target markets,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Social Media outreach on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn,
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | Video postings on YouTube and Vimeo,
--+-------------------------------------


· | Distribution of printed materials promoting our products,
--+----------------------------------------------------------


· | Industry speaking engagements and SME panel participation across the United States, and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Media interviews in print, radio and television.
--+-------------------------------------------------

Sales and business development team members may receive a mixture of base and performance based pay. They are paid a percentage of revenue only when we actually receive payment from our customers.
 
We also have independently contracted sales resources that are paid based upon performance. They are paid a percentage of revenue only when we actually receive payment from our customers. Our team will assist such contractors in the creation of proposal documents when the prospective sale appears to warrant the commitment of resources to such an activity. These contractors are responsible for their own costs except in some instances where the Company’s management pre-approves an expenditure aimed at winning a sales contract.
 
We continue to explore the use of sales channels to communicate the value of and sell our products. Examples of the types of channels we seek are:
 

· | Upstream vendors such as solar module manufacturers, inverter manufacturers, EVSE manufactures,
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | EV charging service providers,
--+-------------------------------


· | Outdoor advertising companies,
--+-------------------------------


· | General contractors,
--+---------------------


· | Architects, and
--+----------------


· | Engineers and consultants.
--+---------------------------

 
During 2016, we added multiple members to be a part of our national sales team, including a new director of sales and business development who is a former Navy Seal Intelligence Officer, as well as developed national sales strategies. We continue to pursue and make progress on promising sales opportunities. Using our contract with the State of California, we continue to garner sales and add new state customers. We have received follow on orders from CalTrans, added new California ordering departments, and believe we are close to securing orders from other agencies. Further, we continue to have discussions with other governmental organizations such as the City of New York which management believes will result in a sizable near term future order. Additionally, we have been delivering our EV ARC™ on our ARC Mobility™ trailer to a variety of locations during a “Gorilla” marketing road show. The EV ARC™ is being delivered to corporate campuses in major California metropolitan areas such as San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Silicon Valley. We pre-announce the free availability of solar powered EV charging – “Driving on Sunshine” – through the human resource and marketing departments of the host companies. It is hoped that the host companies and their employees will see the ease of deployment and the value of highly visible solar powered EV charging, and as a result, buy our products. We believe that this has been a good way to raise awareness about the unique values our products deliver.
 
In January 2017, our EV ARC™ product was featured at the Chevrolet Bolt launch promotion in the San Francisco Bay Area. The public was able to test drive a Chevy Bolt, which was charged on sunshine using our product. We arranged for this activity to draw attention to the Company and the EVARC™ product which was equipped with an outdoor scrolling advertising panel to promote both the EV ARC™ and our ability to enable outdoor advertising.
 
Intellectual Property
 
Envision owns the registered trademarks Solar Grove® and Solar Tree® structures.
 
The Company has been issued three patents: one for our Solar Tree ® structure (patent No. 7,705,277) one for EnvisionTrak™ (a dual-synchronous tracking system for its Solar Tree® structures) (patent No. 8,648,551) and one for our EV ARC™ product (patent No. 9209648).

Key Initiatives
 
International – We believe that our products solve the same problems globally that they solve in the United States and in the same ways. We believe our ability to export our intellectual property and our knowledge is better than it has ever been. We have adapted our products so that they are easily shipped in a standard shipping container. We have moved from project to product so that we do not have to be on site when our products are installed which, we believe, means that we can ship products anywhere in the world leaving any installation work to local resources. We also believe that the learning we gained in putting a fabrication facility in place, inexpensively, to fabricate our products could allow us to rapidly scale in international markets.
 
Our current international focuses are in Spain, the European Union (“EU”), and Fujian Province in China. In Spain, we continue to work with Aconfort, a Spanish company with whom we have a three-year relationship. Aconfort secured a building in Andalusia, which is very similar to ours. Aconfort has represented that the sole purpose of this decision on its part (and at its cost) is to sell EV ARC™ units in Europe. We have registered the name Envision Europe SA and we plan to send the EV ARC™ components to Spain as sales volumes dictate. Initially, EV ARC™ will be shipped in pieces to Spain where it will be reassembled by Envision Europe personnel (these will be Aconfort employees in the early stages). Certain components such as solar modules and gears, which are subject to tariffs when imported to the EU, will be sourced locally to reduce costs. As the market for our products expands, we plan to hire employees and take on more of the fabrication tasks in Spain while reducing the components we ship from the United States. As quickly as the market will support this, we intend to become self-sufficient in the EU. It is our intention to form a subsidiary in Spain and we are currently working with lawyers in the United States and EU to help ensure that we choose the most efficient and safest structure to maximize our European opportunities while shielding us in the United States from risks associated with the EU venture to the extent feasible. We shipped the first EV ARC™ unit to Spain this summer where it has been featured in a highly visible location in the center of Malaga. Our partners at Aconfort are currently negotiating with one or more municipalities in Spain which have expressed an interest in acquiring EV ARC™ products after seeing the unit in Malaga.
 
According to the government in Beijing, China will spend $200 billion on EV charging infrastructure over the next decade. According to industry publications, China is the fastest growing market for digital outdoor advertising in the world. China’s requirements for energy security products are massive and growing rapidly due to electricity interruptions according to Chinese governmental agencies. According to ABC News, studies suggest more than one million people die prematurely every year from the toxic air that has engulfed northern China. The Chinese government’s “War on Pollution” will involve the spending of billions of dollars on renewable energy and the electrification of transportation.
 
In China we are working with Fuzhou Rongzheng Technology Company (“Fuzhou”) in Fujian Province. Our initial relationship with this group is for business development. We believe that Fuzhou is currently doing business with state owned companies and regional government players who we would like to target as customers for our products, and as such have existing relationships. We intend to test the market through these relationships and then expand our capabilities in China as demand dictates. The terms of our brokerage contract dictate that we pay our Chinese partners a success fee only when we sign contracts and sell products. We have sole discretion over whether or not we sign contracts. We believe that there may be opportunities to partner with companies in Fujian to produce our products jointly. There may also be opportunities to create Envision China with combinations of Chinese and other investment. For this reason, we have entered into a separate agreement (the “Cooperation Agreement”) with our partners to enlist their aid in discovering opportunities to partner with existing entities or to set up a new venture to produce our products in Fujian. The terms of the Cooperation Agreement only call for us to pay our partners in the event that we are successful in our endeavors. They will be paid with equity in the resulting entity only and we believe have, as a result, parallel interests to ours where the success of Envision in China is concerned. We have specifically targeted partners who are not currently engaged in solar or EV charging, but do business with our target audience, as a means to reduce the threat of intellectual property infringement, circumvention, or competition. Our strategy relies on our ability to ally ourselves with Chinese partners who are powerful, well positioned and see an opportunity to grow with our help (rather than use our intellectual property without us). We believe that our Chinese partners, who include the president of the Fujian Chamber of Commerce are well respected and well connected. We engaged a United States based attorney with 25 years of experience in crafting relationships between United States and Chinese companies to ensure that the agreements we signed were as safe as possible and matched or exceeded historical standards of fairness and equity.

We believe that our international efforts could represent a significant set of new, large, and growing opportunities for the Company.
 
ARC Mobility™ - We have observed that the commercialization of our ARC Mobility transportation solution has revolutionized the way that we deliver our EV ARC™ product to our customers. We believe that EV ARC™ is already the most easily deployed EV charging solution available today. ARC Mobility makes it even easier and as a result, we believe it could help increase the product’s penetration and sales. We have already sold the first ARC Mobility unit to a large customer and we hope to sell many more to customers who are interested in moving EV ARC™ systems around their facilities. New York City included ARC Mobility™ trailers in its request for proposals (“RFP”).
 

Out Door Advertising (or Out of Home advertising –“OOH”) - We have secured an agreement with ACE Parking to deploy EV ARC™ Digital in their parking lots across San Diego and more broadly. We seek an advertising partner to monetize the value of the advertising screens. To date, we have an agreement with one OOH company to sell the advertising space. We have an agreement with ACE Parking to deploy our EV ARC™ Digital products in key locations in downtown San Diego, California free of charge. We have walked these locations with an OOH company which has confirmed that they will allow for sufficient visibility of our screens to make an attractive advertising platform. The OOH company identified 60 initial locations in San Diego which the company believes will generate advertising revenue using our EV ARC™ Digital. We will continue to develop relationships with OOH providers and we are currently working with a senior executive in the advertising operations (“AdOps”) industry to explore other methods of securing advertising content (revenue) for our EV ARC™ Digital in San Diego locations. With success in San Diego, management plans to endeavor to expand our EV ARC™ Digital network to other cities. Management believes that the combination of our transportable, solar powered EV chargers with digital and static advertising may present a very significant growth opportunity for the Company.
 
State and Local Government – Envision’s EV ARC™ product was selected for State of California contract for transportable, solar powered EV chargers. As far as we are aware, there were no other respondents with products which qualified, which further supports our belief that EV ARC™ is a product which is unique to the Company. Similarly, when we responded to the New York City RFP, we believe we were the only respondent with a qualifying product. Members of staff of the State of California have commented to us that they believe that they are behind goals where the deployment of EV charging infrastructure is concerned. In July 2015, we were awarded a contract to supply EV ARCS™ to California state agencies (to the extent ordered by them) by the Department of General Services of the State of California, for a term of one year with two one-year renewal options. That contract was renewed by the State of California in 2016 and we have consistently and regularly delivered EV ARC™ products to state agencies during these periods. We believe that the major impediments to the deployment of EV chargers are the requirements for civil works such as trenching and foundations, as well as limited access to sufficient electrical circuits to support EV charging in the locations where it is needed. Envision’s products do not require access to utility grid circuits, and as such are perfect for remote locations such as rest areas and park & rides. Our EV ARC™ products can be deployed in minutes and our Solar Tree® DCFC can provide over 600 e miles per day through DC fast chargers which will deliver a full charge to a Nissan Leaf (for example) in 20 minutes or so. We believe that this makes our products ideal for many of the State of California’s goals for the electrification of transportation, and as such, we are aggressively targeting the state with face to face meetings and educational materials. We believe that if we are successful with the State of California and Caltrans, then it is not unreasonable to expect that we can expand sales to other states, the federal government, and the Department of Defense. New York City made its first purchase of EV ARC™ products during the second quarter of 2015. New York’s Mayor Deblasio recently announced what the city believes is the most aggressive EV adoption targets of any major city anywhere. Its goals call for over 2,000 EVs to enter the city’s fleets during the next few years with an investment of $50 to $80 million over the next 10 years to support additional charging infrastructure. We are currently working through the contracting and compliance process with New York City and we believe that completion of this process will result in the city issuing purchase orders for our products.

EV ARC™ Containerized – We are starting to see increased interest from overseas markets for our products. We are in the process of extending elements of our IP protection to Europe and China. Earlier this year, we delivered an EV ARC™ to the government of the US Virgin Islands and have received several inquiries from Caribbean island communities as a result of that sale. We have designed EV ARC™ to be transportable, and within the Continental United States, we can now transport it using either our ARC Mobility™ trailer or commercial trucking companies. EV ARC™ can currently be placed in a standard shipping container but re-assembly is required at the destination which reduces the “ready to operate” value of the product. Management and the technology team have invented, tested, and delivered a design modification which allows us to effectively collapse the EV ARC™ for containerization with a simple expansion process at the destination which does not require sophisticated personnel, tools or significant time. Our first successful deliveries of such units were made to New York City during the third quarter of 2015 as well as to the Caribbean and Spain in 2016. Management believes that our ability to ship EV ARC™ products in commercial container units will allow us to address overseas and distant markets in a way which has not been possible up until the successful testing and delivery of Transformer ARC™. We believe global growth in EV charging, Out Of Home advertising, and energy security is vibrant. We believe that our ability to ship product worldwide will allow us to take advantage of these global opportunities.
Solar Tree® Structure Product/Technology Development – We are continuing to improve the designs and efficiencies of our products. Significant emphasis is placed on innovation which we believe enables higher quality with increased deployment efficiency and reduced deployment risk. Fabrication and installation methodologies which replace labor with mechanized processes are favored. Our design, fabrication, and procurement processes are under constant improvement to increase efficiency and control costs.
 
ARC™ Technology is the integration of storage into all existing Envision products. Battery storage removes the intermittency of electrical delivery often cited as a reason for not taking advantage of renewable energy. We believe Envision is positioning itself to be a leader in the convergence of renewable energy generation and storage. We believe our EV ARC™ product is an elegant embodiment of this convergence. We plan to continue to commit engineering resources to this space with the intention of making all products storage capable. The energy storage market is nascent, and according to industry analysts, poised for growth in the coming months and years. Management intends that we be a leader in the integration of renewable energy products with battery storage solutions.

Outdoor Advertising
 
As the value of traditional advertising media such as television, radio, and print diminishes, advertisers in the United States and abroad are looking for new outlets to capture the attention of consumers. Management believes that industry experts believe that there will be significant growth in spending on outdoor advertising platforms such as billboards. We anticipate this is particularly true relative to digital content. The DOOH (digital out of home) industry, from what we understand, is enjoying a period of rapid growth and may continue to do so for the foreseeable future. Management has seen statistics suggesting DOOH and other outdoor advertising spending exceeded $7B in the United States and $25B globally in 2014, with massive potential markets such as China just beginning to enter the marketplace.
 
While we believe there is a great deal of pent up demand for billboard spending in the United States, there are also significant barriers to the widespread deployment of the infrastructure, which we believe enhance our competitive position:
 

a) | Entitlement – traditional billboards are increasingly difficult to take through the permitting and zoning process. Some jurisdictions have outlawed them entirely.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


b) | Public perception – the value of billboard advertising becomes questionable when the constituency views the medium as anti-social, as is often the case with traditional billboards.
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


c) | Energy Costs – lit and digital billboards are major energy consumers.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------


d) | Content updates – billboards can be slow and costly to update.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------


e) | Civil engineering and construction – billboards require costly installations and electrical connections.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We believe Envision has products that solve each of the above impediments to billboard and DOOH infrastructure deployments. We are currently in the process of working to secure agreements with one or more cities to allow for the deployment of our advertising funded, solar powered EV chargers. We are also working with individuals and organizations to encourage investment in our products deployed in this manner.
 
The Envision products are renewably energized, so they are shrouded in what is often referred to as the “Green Halo.” We have observed that the green/sustainable aspect of our products can make them more likely to win approval through the entitlement process, while also making them more popular with an increasingly environmentally-conscious public. The dual effect, we believe, is that our products may be deployable in locations where traditional billboards may be denied. We believe these products will be more popular with an advertisers’ intended audience and, as a result, advertisers may be willing to pay for them either as a capital purchase or through an existing payment schedule they have with vendors such as Lemar, Clear Channel or JC Decaux. Envision plans to sell products either directly to the end user or to one of the brokerages. We do not currently intend to sell space to content providers except in select locations as there are other well established companies doing that to which we can sell. Technology advances in advertising operations are making it increasingly possible to place digital content on advertising screens through the leveraging of automated platforms. Google is piloting programs in the United Kingdom for place and time based advertising on digital screens. Management is meeting with various companies involved in the automatic placement of digital content on outdoor screens to ascertain whether there is a model which will allow us to successfully monetize the EV ARC™ Digital without the active involvement of a third party which will increase direct costs. Management also intends to endeavor to engage with Google in this space. Google is a current customer, buying and using EV ARC™ for workplace charging. Google’s interest in transportation, renewable energy and advertising potentially makes it a highly suitable partner with whom Envision can further its OOH aspirations.
 
Our products produce more energy than they consume through the display of advertising content, so they do not have ongoing operating expenses associated with energy costs. In fact, they can also support other local energy requirements such as lighting or, even more politically important, EV charging infrastructure or disaster preparedness.
 
Each of our products can be equipped with a WAN (Wide Area Network) connection that can be used to monitor the condition and performance of the unit. This WAN connection can be used equally to deliver content updates to our products’ advertising screens and to network the products so that they can be intelligently linked to one another as well as to local consumers through NFC (Near Field Communications). This means that our products can be deployed without any connection to power or telecommunications while delivering the same value as those that have gone through expensive construction processes to connect to power and data.

Electric Vehicle Charging
 
The growth rates in electric vehicle sales and, as a result, the requirements for supporting infrastructure are impressive. To date, the deployment of electric vehicle service equipment (“EVSE”) has not met the goals set by federal or state governments or any of the larger companies currently engaged in the space. The reasons for the delays are numerous but the main impediments include the following:
 
a)                Site Acquisition – identifying and leasing/controlling locations
 b)                Entitlement – permitting and zoning requirements
 c)                Civil Works – foundations and trenching
 d)                Inability to move the EVSE once deployed
 e)                Energy – sources and cost of energy
 f)                 Telemetry – communications with the EV chargers
 
We believe the Envision EV ARC™ is the world’s first and only transportable, solar powered EV charger. Because it produces and stores all its own energy, it does not need a grid connection and therefore needs no trenching, switch gear, or transformer upgrades. Management believes the lack of a foundation or trench means that in most jurisdictions the EV ARC™ will not need a building permit and we have found that to be the case in every jurisdiction in which it has been deployed to date. It is immune to grid interruptions such as black outs or brown outs. As such, it will allow for vehicle charging even in times of grid failure. It can be moved at any time because it is not connected to the ground or grid, and we believe, creates an attractive and highly visible branding asset for the host. There are no utility bills to pay and, as the number of EVs increase on the host campuses, more EV ARC™ units can be added with a continued lack of disruption.
 
EV ARC™ can also be set to provide emergency power to users such as first responders during times of emergency or other grid failures. Because the EV ARC™ replenishes its batteries every day, even during cloudy conditions, we believe that it is one of the most robust and reliable back up energy sources available today. Several of our current government customers are ordering EV ARC™ units with our optional E Power panels integrated into the units. E Power is a series of secured power outlets with directed and primary energy access available to emergency responders. This is a source of increased revenue for us and, we believe, a compelling value proposition for our products.
 
EV ARC™ can be grid connected if the customer wishes. Our first utility customer connected its EV ARC™ units to the grid in 2015. The EV ARC™ products provide solar powered EV charging, but they also serve as grid stability tools. During times of low energy use the utility will charge the EV ARC™ on board batteries. During times of grid stress, the utility takes energy from EV ARC™ batteries thus reducing stress on their generation assets and grid infrastructure. We believe that “Grid Balancing” offers a potentially significant market opportunity for Envision’s products as electrical grids become increasingly unstable due to increased demand, aging infrastructure, and extreme weather events. Experts from utilities such as San Diego Gas & Electric have told us that this is the case and that distributed storage is an important part of their future plans.
 
We believe these factors make the EV ARC™ a compelling value proposition to anyone who intends to install such devices. A corporate customer can deploy EV charging quickly, efficiently, and without digging up its parking lots. The positive carbon foot print impact is greater because the EV ARC™ uses sunlight to charge the employees’ EVs and, we believe, the marketing and branding impact is far greater because the enterprise has a highly visible demonstration of its commitment to the environment.
 
We believe Envision’s larger Solar Tree® structures also make perfect EVSE locations. Considering the list of impediments to EV infrastructure deployments, we believe that the Solar Tree® structure with column integrated CleanCharge™ EV chargers offers significant advantages over a typical grid tied EV charger. We believe that they offer the most attractive and practical mounting assets for fixed EV charging stations. The single column design is ideal for centrally locating multiple chargers and making them available to the maximum number of spaces. Entitlement might go more smoothly because the Solar Tree® structures contribute more benefits to the local environment than simple EV chargers. Those additional benefits include shade, reduction in heat islanding, reduction in light pollution, architectural appeal, reduction in grid stress, and even disaster preparedness when equipped with ARC™ storage technology. We believe that commercial real estate owners and corporate campuses will recognize the multiple layers of increased value delivered by Solar Tree® structures and CleanCharge™ deployed with little disruption to their facilities.

Solar Tree® structures with ARC™ technology energy storage could generate and store enough energy to provide over 600 e miles per day through any high quality EV charger including DC fast chargers. They could be deployed in any location that is not shaded and will not require any utility grid connection. We believe that this vital factor makes them a compelling choice for remote locations where there is inadequate utility grid connection (e.g. remote rest areas). Corridor charging, the term used to describe EV charging on highways between built up areas, is recognized as being very important, but also very difficult to achieve with traditional grid tied chargers because of the lack of electrical circuits and the environmental and economic impact of bringing infrastructure to remote sites. We believe that our Solar Tree® and EV ARC™ products are ideal for corridor charging because they do not need to connect to the electrical grid. Additionally, where the requirement is for charging of mission critical vehicles (e.g. first responders, hospitals), Solar Tree® and EV ARC™ products can provide a highly robust and secure source of energy even when the grid is not available. Unlike gasoline or diesel powered generators, our products are not reliant on external sources of fuel and, we believe, require much less maintenance, testing and service. It is our further contention that any campus environment with an EV charging need and a wish for a high degree of reliability in its electrical supply can benefit from our Solar Tree® structures with ARC™ on-board energy storage because, we believe, in times of grid instability (e.g. natural disaster, terrorism, capacity constraints), the Envision products could provide the most reliable source of energy at the location.
 
We believe that so called “range anxiety” is one of the top two reasons that customers are not buying EVs. We believe our products can contribute in a significant and material manner to reducing range anxiety. As a result, we believe that any company or governmental entity that views the roll out of EV charging infrastructure as important to its business could reasonably be expected to become our customer.
 
Energy Security
 
Power outages cost the United States $200 billion per year according to the Department of Energy. A report in the Wall Street Journal stated that the United States is nine key sub stations away from a total black out, and further reported if one of a few transformer companies who could supply the hardware to repair the sub stations was also disabled, that the black outs would last 18 months. We believe that energy security will be an important growth market and that our Solar Tree® and EV ARC™ products with ARC technology energy storage can address this and provide possible growth opportunities.
 
Using solar power to reduce an entity’s utility bill is not new and is now a highly competitive market. Envision believes that the growth in energy security products will create a significant opportunity for the Company. We have overcome many hurdles inherent in the production of reliable, cost effective, stand alone, renewable energy generation and storage solutions. Our EV ARC™ product is essentially a micro-grid which generates, stores, and makes available, day or night, clean, reliable electrical energy. This technology is already offering our customers an option to back up generators or other expensive measures which they feel compelled to take to safeguard their increasingly important energy supplies. Many of our customers have expressed that they view the fact that EVs can charge from our products even when the utility grid fails as one of the key components in their decision to buy. Their ability to connect external devices to the EV ARC™ power outlets and “shore power” cable may allow them to eliminate the need for gasoline or diesel generators where EV ARC™ is deployed.
 
Distributed generation photovoltaic solar projects have historically been rooftop or adjacent property installations. Rooftops have a number of inherent problems that are avoided by utilizing parking lots and the top levels of parking structures for solar installations. Rooftops are populated with mechanical equipment, vents, skylights, elevator overruns and most importantly, roofing materials and systems including waterproof membranes, that require maintenance, are warranted, and must be replaced often – more often than solar PV products. Rooftops are also limited in the area which is required for large scale energy production by PV systems. The low returns generated by many roof top and adjacent property solar deployments are often not sufficient inducement to a real estate owner to expose themselves to the encumbrance and risks associated with those sorts of deployments, which in part, might explain the relatively low adoption of this otherwise beneficial technology.
 
There are over 800 million parking spaces in the United States. We believe there are numerous reasons that parking lots are preferable locations, in many cases, to building rooftops, which we believe accounts for the rapid growth of the solar parking array market. Parking lots are large, unobstructed, sun-drenched areas that are easily accessible during project construction. They have no waterproofing issues and benefit significantly from shade for both cars and drivers. In addition, our products emphasize “Solar You Can See!” as rooftop solar can’t be seen in most cases. Solar parking arrays, on the other hand, are experienced and enjoyed by employees and visitors. With the installation of a solar parking array, a previously barren and unpleasant parking lot could become a cool, shady, area where everyone can directly experience clean solar energy generation, shade, and soft safe lighting at night. We believe property owners will enjoy the benefits of the positive demonstration such a visible display of sustainable design that their properties are and assist in turning cost centers into revenue centers. As the adoption of Electric Vehicles increase, we believe parking lots will be ideal locations for EV charging infrastructure and Envision’s products with SunCharge™ will offer an attractive option to any entity considering the deployment of such solutions.

We believe, globally, solar deployments are growing significantly. While much of the growth has been focused on competing with utilities to provide cheaper electricity, we believe that there will be a significant growth in Solar 3.0 in which solar energy is used to enable services and amenities where the grid is unavailable or too unreliable for the intended use. Electrical energy is becoming increasingly vital to almost everything that we do and our requirements for it are no longer restricted to indoor locations where standard outlets are readily available. Solar powered products, like those that we produce, which can deliver reliable energy in locations where there is insufficient circuit, like parking lots, streets, parks, and public spaces, appear to have significant market opportunities. Our deployment speed is also important to our marketing efforts. In most cases, we deploy our Solar Tree® products in active parking lots of active businesses. Whether we are deploying for EV charging, shade, energy security, or for marketing purposes, our prospective customers often consider business disruption in their analysis and buying decisions. We believe that our products can be installed faster than any other products in the industry, making deployment of Envision products less negatively impactful than the deployment of our competitor’s products. The potential loss of revenue or opportunity caused by a torn-up parking lot can, over time, be quite substantial. We believe our deployment speed will increasingly contribute to Envision’s competitive edge.
 
Customer Concentration
 
During 2016, the Company had three customers that each exceeded 10% of our revenue.
 
Silicon Valley Bank Loan
 
On October 30, 2015, Envision and its wholly owned subsidiary Envision Solar Construction, Inc., a California corporation (“ESC” and together with Envision, individually and collectively, jointly, and severally, “Borrower”), entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “LSA”) with Silicon Valley Bank, a California corporation (“Bank”), pursuant to which the Bank agreed to provide Borrower with a revolving line of credit in the aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000, bearing interest at a floating per annum rate equal to the greater of three quarters of one percentage point (0.75%) above the Prime Rate (as that term is defined in the LSA) or four percent (4.00%). The loan was due and payable in full on or before March 27, 2017 after effecting extensions from the original due date of October 30, 2016 (see below for additional extension). The line of credit is secured by a second priority perfected security interest in all of the assets of the Company in favor of the Bank.
 
As a condition to the extension of credit to Borrower under the LSA, Keshif Ventures, LLC (“Keshif”) agreed to guarantee all of the Borrower’s obligations under the LSA pursuant to a Master Unconditional Limited Guaranty between the Bank and Keshif, dated October 30, 2015 (“Guaranty”). Keshif pledged cash equivalent collateral to the Bank as security for the Guaranty. Keshif also agreed to subordinate to the Bank all of Borrower’s indebtedness and other monetary obligations owing to Keshif pursuant to a Subordination Agreement, dated October 30, 2015 (“Subordination Agreement”). In consideration for the Guaranty, Envision agreed to issue 571,429 shares of its common stock (the “Shares”) to Keshif pursuant to a stock purchase agreement, dated October 30, 2015 (“SPA”). Pursuant to the SPA, for each six-month period from and after the six-month anniversary of October 30, 2015 (each, a “Measurement Period”) that Keshif guarantees Borrower’s obligations under the LSA, Keshif will also receive the number of additional shares of Envision’s common stock, rounded upward to the nearest whole number, equal to (a) two and one half percent (2.5%) multiplied by the maximum outstanding principal amount of the LSA at any time during such Measurement Period, such amount to be divided by (b) the twenty (20) day average closing price of our common stock, measured for the twenty (20) consecutive trading days immediately prior to such Measurement Period, the quotient of which shall be multiplied by (c) a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days during the Measurement Period which the Guaranty remained in effect and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in such Measurement Period. Additionally, we issued a side letter to Keshif (the “Side Letter”), which in addition to confirming Keshif’s entitlement to the Shares, provided certain contractual rights to Keshif in consideration for the Guaranty, including a covenant by us to provide financial statements and other periodic reports to Keshif, an agreement to reimburse Keshif for payments made by Keshif to the Bank in accordance with the Guaranty (“Reimbursement Obligation”), if any, and the grant of a security interest, subordinated to the Bank under the Subordination Agreement, to secure the Reimbursement Obligation. Keshif also has the right under the Side Letter to invite one representative to attend all meetings of Envision’s Board of Directors and, in the event Envision is unable to meet its obligations under the LSA, Keshif will immediately become entitled to elect one member to Envision’s Board of Directors.

Subsequent to December 31, 2016, and effective March 27, 2017, the Company entered into an additional amendment to the LSA with Silicon Valley Bank as it relates to our revolving line of credit. The amendment (i) extends the maturity date to March 1, 2020, (ii) increases the line to an aggregate principal amount of $1,500,000, and (iii) changes the payment terms requiring monthly interest only payments through December 2017 and starting January 1, 2018, the Company shall repay the balance outstanding in twenty seven equal monthly principal payments in addition to the monthly accrued interest.
 
Competition
 
The market we address can be intensely competitive. We are subject to competition from a number of other companies manufacturing, selling, and installing solar power products in the commercial market, many of which have longer operating histories and greater financial and other resources than the Company.
 
EV Charging
 
The EV charging sector is growing rapidly with many companies playing different roles in the space. Companies such as Schneider, Eaton, Aerovironment, and Bosch manufacture EV charging units but do not offer charging services. Companies such as Chargepoint and Car Charging Group offer EV charging services and hardware but not, typically, installation. There are many companies which offer installation services typically from electrical and general contracting backgrounds. There are one or two companies which are endeavoring to find ways to monetize EV charging beyond generating revenue from services or hardware. Volta is a San Francisco based EV charging company which derives revenue through the sale of advertising. Volta gives charging away for free. They are deployed in a small number of shopping malls and other locations. Many solar companies are now fixing EV chargers to their parking lot structures and some are offering packages combining solar rooftop installations and EV charger installations for the residential market place. These installations are almost always grid tied and do not include energy storage. We know of no other company that has a fully self-contained, transportable, autonomous, solar powered EV charging solution and we know of no other company that offers a product which delivers DC fast charging from solely solar generation.
 
Outdoor Advertising
 
Envision’s role in the outdoor advertising space is currently anticipated by management to be one of delivering hardware solutions in the billboard, street furniture, and digital signage space. There are large well established companies such as JC Decaux which specialize in the sale of advertising and also in the production of street furniture solutions. Other vendors in the space include Daktronics which makes digital billboards and street furniture. We have met with both companies and determined that neither has a transportable solar powered solution. Both companies have expressed that they recognize the value of EV charging infrastructure as a platform for DOOH. They have also expressed an interest in working with us though we have nothing definitive with either at this point. Either of them could compete with us if they determined to invest in developing solar powered products.
 
There are many companies which specialize in the placement of outdoor content on existing infrastructure, including but not limited to Capitol Outdoors, Vistar Media, EMC Outdoor and Outfront Media. We are in contact with some and intend to be in contact with all to educate them about our products. These companies can be seen as competition as they are in the business of taking as much of the market share as they can for digital content. However, they do not always produce hardware. With that in mind we see these companies more as potential partners than competitors. Perhaps one of the most interesting entrants into the outdoor digital content placement market is Google. With its recent announcement of time and place based content dispersal on outdoor digital screens, Google is taking its advertising placement technology outdoors. Google has several solar and energy projects underway and as such, could create solar powered outdoor advertising technologies. Google is currently a customer, purchasing EV ARC™ products for both EV and E bike charging on their campuses. We intend to pursue the outdoor advertising market with Google as well, but have yet to approach the subject with Google.
 
The large outdoor advertisers such as ClearChannel, Outfront Media, Lamar and JC Decaux have combinations of larger format billboards, digital billboards, screens and street furniture. They use combinations of in house and outsourced resources to acquire hardware. We are not aware that any of them currently have solar powered solutions such as those that we offer, however we have seen each of them pay close attention to sustainable options such as using solar panels adjacent to billboards to power them. We will endeavor, wherever possible to sell products to these companies. Each of them could create competing products to ours.

Energy Security
 
Our focus in energy security is to produce solar powered products which include battery energy storage and which can dispatch power during times of grid or carbon fueled generator failure. There are many companies, both large and small, with solar energy solutions, many with battery storage solutions, and many with combinations of both. As our focus is on the productization of the combination of solar generation and energy, we view the competition from companies producing these types of solutions to be most relevant to our business. Companies in this space range from small startup companies like Green Charge Networks to behemoths like General Electric and NEC. Siemens, Eaton, Schneider and other large electrical component companies are all also working on combined renewables/storage product solutions. We are in contact with all these companies and have not observed that any of them have a product which provides all the same values and differentiators which our EV ARC™ product delivers.
 
While we believe that our proprietary designs and our deployment strategies differentiate us from our competitors in the market, there is no assurance that our business, operating results, and financial condition will not be materially adversely affected by our competitors.
 
Government Regulation
 
Businesses in general and solar energy companies in particular are subject to extensive regulation at the federal, state, and local level. We are subject to extensive government regulation of employment, health, safety, working conditions, labor relations, and the environment in the course of the conduct of our business. In order for our customers to enable the installation of some of our products, they generally are required to obtain permits from local and other governmental agencies. In the case of our grid tied products, they must comply with the applicable rules and regulations of the relevant state public utility agencies. In order for our customers to take advantage of available tax and other governmental incentives associated with the installation of solar power production facilities, and the production and use or sale of solar power, they must comply with the applicable regulatory terms and conditions. Government regulation may have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.
 
Amendment to Articles of Incorporation
 
At our annual meeting of our shareholders on December 19, 2016, our shareholders voted to amend our articles of incorporation in order to increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock from 162,500,000, par value $0.001 per share, to 490,000,000, par value $0.001 per share, and to authorize 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share. We filed an amendment to our articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State of Nevada in order to effect these changes on December 23, 2016.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this report, we had 18 employees, three additional individuals engaged through a temporary employment agency, and two independent contractors who sell products for us. The individuals we utilize through the temporary employment agency work for us on a full-time basis, but were hired through an agency to maximize our flexibility and to reduce the risks and costs associated with full time employees.
Seasonality
 
Our operations are not expected to be materially affected by seasonality.
