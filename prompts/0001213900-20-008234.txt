Recent Events
 
COVID-19 Pandemic
 
With the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, we are promoting the use of sanitary medical practice with the NeuroCap, which we believe promotes the use of good, sanitary medical practice and can help flatten the COVID-19 curve.
 
A recent report from three COVID-19-designated hospitals in Wuhan, China indicated that more than one-third of coronavirus patients had some type of neurologic symptom, including altered consciousness, evidence of skeletal muscle damage, and acute cerebrovascular disease. Early data implies that COVID-19, like prior coronavirus breakouts MERS and SARS, is demonstrating a neurologic component in severe cases.
 
As hospitals and other first responders to the pandemic around the world increase their purchases of supplies to fight the virus, and the U.S. government has passed a $2 trillion aid package to prop up the country’s economy and assist in fighting the virus, we are working to position our NeuroCap as a safe and effective diagnostic tool to help against the COVID-19 virus.
 
Information in this Annual Report is based on available information from prior to the pandemic. We have not yet been able to evaluate how the pandemic has or may continue to affect our business and operations, including the potential markets for our Products.
 
History
 
We were initially organized on November 18, 2013 as a Nevada limited liability company under the name Global Energy Express LLC by the filing of articles of organization with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. On December 18, 2015, the Company converted from a Nevada limited liability company under the name Global Energy Express LLC to a Nevada corporation under the name All Soft Gels Inc. by the filing of articles of conversion and articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada. On September 18, 2018, the Company changed its name from All Soft Gels Inc. to Brain Scientific Inc. and changed its ticker symbol on the OTC Pink market to “BRSF”.

On September 21, 2018, we entered into a merger agreement (the “Merger Agreement”) with MemoryMD, Inc. and AFGG Acquisition Corp. to acquire MemoryMD, Inc. (the “Acquisition”). The transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement were consummated on September 21, 2018 and, pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, all outstanding shares of MemoryMD were exchanged for shares of our common stock. Accordingly, we acquired 100% of Memory MD, Inc. in exchange for the issuance of shares of our common stock and MemoryMD, Inc. became our wholly-owned subsidiary. Furthermore, the Company at such time ceased all operations and assigned all of its assets and liabilities from prior to the Acquisition, and assumed and commenced the business of MemoryMD as the sole business of the Company.
 
Our principal executive office is located at 205 East 42nd Street, 14th Floor, New York, New York 10017, and our telephone number is (646) 388-3788. Our website address is www.brainscientific.com. The information on our website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 
Introduction to Data Acquisition using Electroencephalography (EEG)
 
Electroencephalography, or EEG, is a method to identify and evaluate the electrical activity of the brain. The ability to do this dates back to the mid-to-late 19th century when scientists began to study the brain activity of various animals such as rabbits, dogs, and monkeys. The 1920’s saw the first example of these involving humans, when in 1924 German physiologist and psychiatrist Hans Berger recorded the first human EEG.
 
One of the first discoveries was the EEG’s ability to identify the potential for epileptic seizures. As science and scientists began to understand the workings of the EEG, they could identify more beneficial applications of the technology working in combination with other tests. These include: 
 

● | Testing brain activity after a stroke 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Dementia, including Alzheimer’s Disease 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Depression
--+-----------


● | Migraine
--+---------


● | Traumatic Head Injury (sports and non-sports related) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Sleep Disorders (e.g. Insomnia, Restless Leg Syndrome, Narcolepsy) 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Epilepsy
--+---------

 
The EEG may also be used to determine the electrical activity of the brain of an individual involved in a trauma, addiction, as well as the brain activity of comatose individuals. 
 
It is here in the advancement of technology where we believe our products and technology will play a key role in the use and development of EEG related activities.
 
Product and Services Pipeline
 
Our data acquisition platform is composed of three main parts:
 

1. | Hardware - NeuroEEG™ and NeuroCap™, our two products on the market. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Software - interpreted by remote technicians for rapid response time. 
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | NeuroNet Cloud - The database where brain data can be stored and analyzed. 
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
NeuroEEG
 
NeuroEEG™ is an FDA cleared 16 channel, portable, cloud-enabled data acquisition platform for electroencephalogram (EEG) activity. This wireless system digitizes and records electrophysiological activity at 500Hz, and is further supported by advanced artifact filtering allowing for the cleanest signal possible. The intuitive nature of the device democratizes EEG as a viable diagnostic tool that can be implemented across environments that were formerly inaccessible by traditional EEG solutions. NeuroEEG™ is designed for use in mobile (ambulatory care & emergency medical service vehicles), field applications (clinical trials), as well as hospital and athletic environments.

NeuroEEG™ is non-invasive and is intended to acquire, display and store the electrical activity of a patient’s brain on a computer (PC or laptop). The generated data serves as a clinical assessment aid within a clinical practice, rehabilitation institution, diagnostic center, neurosurgical clinics, operating room, intensive care unit, and emergency room environments. Data acquired by NeuroEEG™ is to be performed under the direction and interpretation of a licensed medical professional. This device does not provide any diagnostic conclusion about a subject's condition. The NeuroEEG is designed to be used with our NeuroCap and other brands and models of caps.
 
The Company commenced delivery of its first purchase order of this product in the fourth quarter of 2018, although it has not had any further material orders to date.
 
NeuroCap
 
The NeuroCap™ is an FDA cleared disposable, soft layered cap with an integrated electrode circuit that is designed to address existing problems of conventional EEG systems. The silver embedded wiring is pre-gelled, so it requires no prepping of the skin before application. NeuroCap™ makes it possible for medical staff of all levels to perform EEG tests, without having to laboriously apply electrodes one-by-one or spend considerable time cleaning an EEG headset after each use.
 
The NeuroCap™ works in parallel with the NeuroEEG™ amplifier device to successfully carry out EEG tests. However, the NeuroCap™ can work also with other EEG devices and not just our NeuroEEG. NeuroCap’s electrode placement follow standard alignment pursuant to the international 10-20 system. The acquisition of electrical brain activity is carried out by non-invasive pre-gelled passive Ag/AgCl scalp (cutaneous) electrodes, ensuring maximum comfortability for the wearer.
 
We received our first purchaser order for the NeuroCap from a distributor of medical supplies for testing purposes and commenced shipping product in the fourth quarter of 2018 to several hospitals and other customers, although we have not had any further material orders to date.
 
NeuroNet Cloud
 
Our NeuroNet Cloud infrastructure is being designed to provide for a robust platform to store and manage all forms of data that may be received from internal and external entities such as EHRs/EMRs, IOT devices and 3rd party apps, clinical applications and other forms of patient data. The NeuroNet Cloud is also being designed to provide for streamlined connectivity, allowing secure access to patient data for purposes of evaluation and reporting by outside clinical specialists, such as a neurologists.
 
The Company is also developing a HIPAA-compliant data storage and patient management cloud infrastructure to provide teleneurology services. The infrastructure is being designed so neurologists will be able to remotely access patient EEG and clinical data to evaluate patient conditions. We believe that such an infrastructure removes the need for direct contact with the patient, opening up underserved geographic locations with an undersupply of physicians to meet growing demand for neurological care as aging patient populations continues to grow.
 
Data is acquired via the 16 channel NeuroCap™ and would be wirelessly transmitted to the cloud, via the NeuroEEG™, as batch data (fully transferred before being consumed) or in real-time (data is consumed as it is being produced).
 
Data can then be consumed by a doctor or specialist who can recover the data, replay, and provide feedback, such as a report, on the selected patient data. This infrastructure is configurable to match unique workflows of healthcare operators.
 
As designed, the MemoryMD™ cloud would then be able to cross-reference multiple points-of-data:
 

● | Medical Images 
--+--------------------------------------------------------


● | Lab Results 
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | Genetic testing 
--+---------------------------------------------------------


● | Behavior data 
--+-------------------------------------------------------


● | Sensor data 
--+-----------------------------------------------------


● | Electronic Health Records 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | 3rd party applications 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------

 
We expect to have a fully working model of the NeuroNet Cloud by the end of 2020, subject to the availability of funds.

Artificial Intelligence Infrastructure
 
Our infrastructure is also being designed to gather and mine brain-imaging data. Clinicians and researchers would be able to access data profiles of their patients and generate risk assessment and treatment plans to address neurological conditions. This data could also be useful in establishing correlations between a myriad of brain scans, allowing us to further understand connections about the brain that have not been discovered.
 
Artificial intelligence infrastructure in the Company cloud refers to all modules used to perform automatic analysis of patient data. This infrastructure can receive inputs from many different sources such as medical databases, normative data sets, and other patient health information. By using machine-learning algorithms, the system is being designed to improve accuracy, providing for more advanced diagnostics as additional brain images are acquired.
 
The infrastructure is being designed to combine neural networks with a state-of-the-art tree search and pattern classification systems to build robust neurological health profiles of patient brain scans. These models are expected to be self-learning, so the more data supplied to it, to more “educated” it is expected to be.
 
We believe we will achieve better patient outcomes at a reduced cost through robust modelling and correlational analysis of brain imaging and other biometric data. Significant patterns recognized by the system are designed to help medical professionals detect nuances in an individual brain, allowing them to tailor more personalized treatment plans for their patients. The MemoryMD™ cloud is being designed to handle millions of brain images to create robust models that correlate health records, behaviors, and other neurological factors.

Industry Overview
 
The Company competes within the domestic and global medical device industry, referred to as the “MedTech” industry, which industry, on a global scale, is expected to reach an estimated $432.6 billion by 2025, and it is forecast to grow at a CAGR of 4.1% from 2020 to 2025.
 
The MedTech industry is characterized by rapid change resulting from technological advances and scientific discoveries. We believe that U.S. medical device companies are highly regarded on a global scale for their innovations and high-technology products, which innovations and products are produced due to a significant investment in research and development. U.S. sales are expected to grow from about $164 billion in 2018 to $208 billion in 2023, according to Fitch.
 
The global brain monitoring market is expected to reach $11.6 billion by 2024 from $8.7 billion in 2019, at a CAGR of 6.1% during the forecast period. We believe the increasing incidence and prevalence of neurological disorders, rising awareness about neurodegenerative disorders, growing incidence of traumatic brain injuries, and the increasing applications of brain monitoring in clinical trials are driving the growth of this market. In addition, of this global market, the traumatic brain injury diagnostic market size was estimated at approximately $38 million and it is expected to reach approximately $166 million by the end of 2025, with a CAGR of 23.6%.

Traumatic brain injury holds the largest share of the brain monitoring market, by disease type. Some of the major factors responsible for the large share of this market include the growing incidence of TBIs across the globe, leading to the high demand for the management of these cases—which we believe requires the intensive use of brain monitoring devices.
 
We believe the hospitals segment has accounted for the largest share of the brain monitoring market in 2019. Brain monitoring is a complex process, requiring expensive and advanced devices and equipment that are mainly found only in hospitals. Hospitals also see a considerably larger inflow of patients as compared to small clinics and other end users. Additionally, brain monitoring devices pose a considerable burden in terms of maintenance expenses on healthcare facilities; we believe that in general hospitals, more than other end users, are able to bear such costs. Hence, brain monitoring devices are mostly used in hospitals, which consequently account for the largest market share.
 
U.S. Healthcare Market
 
The National Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) are the official estimates of total health care spending in the United States. U.S. health care spending grew 4.6 percent in 2018, reaching $3.6 trillion or $11,172 per person. As a share of the nation's Gross Domestic Product, health spending accounted for 17.7%.
 
Digital health innovations are driving growth and opportunity in three major verticals of healthcare:
 

● | Remote Patient Monitoring. Devices and applications that allow care providers to keep tabs on chronically ill, recently released, and overall “high-risk” patients (also referred to as remote patient management, or RPM). Wearable patches that diagnose heart conditions, sensors that monitor asthma medication intake, and glucose monitors that send diabetics’ data straight to their smartphones are just a few examples. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Telehealth. Doctor access and advice, from outside the confines of an office visit. It could be mental health counselling from across the country, diagnosis and prescription writing in pediatrics without taking a sick child to the office, alternatives to primary care physician visits, and other, similar events.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Behavior Modification. Platforms that help patients change their habits and adopt healthier lifestyles, with the primary aim of preventing illness and a clinically validated methodology of doing so. That includes smoking cessation tools and diabetes prevention through digital weight loss and coaching, among other technologies. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Athletic Performance Market
 
Athletic performance encompasses the treatment and prevention of injuries related to athletics and exercise.
 
The growth of this market can be attributed to increased participation in athletic activities, thus leading to an increased risk of injuries. Also, government support for participation in athletics to combat high obesity rates is expected to boost participation in athletics.
 
Our business plan includes positioning our products and services as a go-to choice in diagnostic tools for brain-related sports injuries. The EEG with cortical brain maps is highly capable of identifying post-concussion syndrome. Concussions and traumatic brain injuries caused by contact sports are a growing widespread issue among athletes. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that 1.6 million to 3.8 million concussions occur each year.
 
If left undetected, concussions can lead to long-term brain damage and may even be fatal. Without professional doctors to survey the true damage of the head impact, athletes often ignore head impacts and later suffer from the consequences. Since an estimated 90% of diagnosed concussions do not include a loss of consciousness, many head impact injuries are dismissed. To prevent these outcomes, it is critical that coaches and players are aware of the dangers of contact sports and are able to conduct a proper concussion evaluation. The growing number of sports related brain injuries suggests that there is an unmet demand for a quick assessment and delivery of brain damage, which we believe our products and services can provide.
 
Government Initiatives – Pre COVID 19 Pandemic
 
Although the Covid-19 pandemic has abruptly changed the world, which we hope is temporary, prior to the outbreak, there was a surge of regional tensions and national security threats and many countries, including the United States, were increasing defense budgets. Also, prior to the pandemic, we expected that stable growth in global GDP, lower commodity prices, and an increase in travel demand could lead to more defense spending as well as investing in next generation military equipment and technology to combat terrorism and cyber-threats. While many of those expectations and paradigms have now changed, we expect that they will return as the pandemic is contained and the world economy rebounds.

The Defense Advanced Research Project Agency supports the Brain Initiative, which is a program designed to revolutionize the understanding of the human brain to find new ways to treat, cure, and prevent brain disorders. We believe our product and service offerings can be an asset in providing millions of brain scans that allow for research and analysis. In addition to the Brain Initiative and other Government sponsored research and grants, our scalable, easy to use EEG can serve the military and can be deployed in the field for either proactive brain monitoring or reactive emergency response.
 
Education Enhancement
 
Global education and training expenditures are estimated to reach approximately $10 trillion by 2030 as population growth and technology in developing markets is expected to fuel a massive expansion in education, and training.
 
The growth in the market is due to an increase in the attendance of students, the promotion of online learning, a rise in tuition costs, an escalation of graduation rates, and an expansion of scientific research. Parents are willing to spend on education for their children and government initiated awareness programs promote the importance of education. The US is one of the most efficient, and therefore desired, destinations for educational purposes. In the United States, higher growth opportunity and better career prospects reinforce the need for education and research.
 
Since analysis of EEGs are useful in recognizing cognitive differences, the brain scans of the up-to 50 million potential customers in this space can be a stepping stone for further research. Furthermore, the cognitive measurements of EEGs are useful in assessing the effectiveness of an educational program. Conclusions drawn from the analysis can then be further applied in the classroom in the future. The goal of selling to the education market is to have the opportunity to measure baseline EEGs of students. The baseline EEGs can serve in multiple studies, including those that evaluate the best methods of teaching and learning in the classroom. Some additional uses of EEGs within the education market include research and analysis into the brain images of students with learning disabilities. 
 
Clinical Trials
 
The global healthcare contract research organization market size is expected to reach approximately $62.1 billion by 2027, registering a CAGR of 6.6% over the same period, primarily resulting from the increasing cost of drug development. Rising cost of clinical trials and challenges pertaining to patient recruitment have led biopharmaceutical companies to turn to regions like Central and Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific, Latin America, and Middle East for cost savings and quick patient recruitment.
 
Clinical trials assess the safety and efficacy of a new drug, therapy, surgical procedure, medical device, or other intervention and are essential tools in conducting research. When used in clinical trials, we expect our products and services will give a fast and accurate analysis that may speed the clinical trial process. Moreover, clinical imaging is the technique and process of capturing images of the human body for clinical purposes to reveal, diagnose or examine diseases. Our EEG is a clinical imaging tool that can acquire millions of clinical images stored on a cloud infrastructure. A vast number of clinical images can assist in revealing, diagnosing, and examining neurological conditions.
 
The Global Telemedicine Market/Industry
 
In addition to the MedTech industry, we are also seeking to participate within the rapidly expanding global telemedicine industry/market. This industry focuses on the delivery of healthcare services, consultations and advice to patients wherever they are through the means of technology, software mediated video and data portals. We believe that there is and will continue to be significant demand for such services given the need to match physicians with patients in remote areas or without having patients travel long distances to access the care they need. We also believe that there is a major need within this industry to also provide point of care diagnostic, which we are seeking to develop as a niche, especially within neurology.
 
The global telemedicine market was estimated at approximately $31.5 billion in 2018 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 19.28% by 2025.
 
Factor such as, rising emergency medical incidents and ageing world population are anticipated to drive such growth. North America is anticipated to account for a significant portion of market share, and the U.S. is expected to be the largest telemedicine market in North America over this period. The Europe telemedicine market is also expected to grow substantially, due to factors such as rising cost of healthcare and rising prevalence of chronic diseases, while Asia-Pacific is projected to record the fastest growth over such period.
 
Market Dynamics
 
Driver: Growing incidence of traumatic brain injuries
 
A traumatic brain injury (“TBI”) is non-degenerative, non-congenital damage to the brain from an external mechanical force, possibly leading to permanent or temporary impairment. TBI is a major public health concern, and the most common cause of death and disability in developed as well as developing countries.
 
6

 

According to the CDC, TBI is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality, responsible for approximately 2.8 million accidents and emergency department visits annually in the U.S. and approximately 1 million in the UK. It is one of the most common causes of mortality in people aged under 25, and its incidence is high in adults and very young children, as well. However, the rate of TBI-related hospitalizations and deaths is the highest in the elderly. According to Headway, in 2016–2017, there were 348,453 hospital admissions related to brain injuries in the UK. 
 
TBI, if ignored, can lead to permanent disabilities or death. Close monitoring and immediate therapy for related abnormalities are crucial to reducing the rate of mortality or morbidity associated with TBIs. As intercranial pressure monitoring (ICP) is the most common cause of death in patients with severe TBI, ICP monitoring is considered as the standard of care. The growing incidence of TBIs is, therefore, likely to support market growth.
 
Opportunity: Increasing Expanding therapeutic applications of brain monitoring devices
 
Apart from applications in neurological disorders, neurodegenerative diseases, and psychiatric disorders, brain monitoring devices are also used in other therapeutic areas like insomnia, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and sleep apnea. Quantitative EEG analysis is widely used to investigate the neurophysiological characteristics of insomnia. EEG biofeedback is a training process that has been scientifically proven to aid in the management of PTSD.
 
A number of research studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of neurofeedback for PTSD in adults. For instance, a research study published by the NCBI in 2016 demonstrated that 24 sessions of neurofeedback significantly reduced PTSD symptoms in adult sample populations. Similar studies are also being conducted in children. Such positive research outcomes suggest that neurofeedback is a promising approach in the treatment of PTSD. This is especially important because existing treatments can be quite difficult to tolerate and have limited effectiveness for many individuals with PTSD. In addition, EEG is routinely used to measure and record brain wave activity for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep apnea. These extended applications of brain monitoring devices are expected to provide growth opportunities for players operating in this market.
 
Challenge: Shortage of trained professionals
 
Trained medical personnel are required to effectively operate devices involved in the complex process of brain monitoring. The positioning of electrodes on the scalp and the insertion of muscular needles require accuracy and can be performed only by highly trained personnel. In addition, the results generated by brain monitoring machines are complex and can only be interpreted by qualified technicians or skilled professionals. Without these fundamental skills, end users will face difficulties in maximizing the utility of their brain monitoring equipment. The presence of highly skilled medical personnel and staff is, therefore, vital for the effective use of brain monitoring equipment.
 
Currently, there is a shortage of skilled medical personnel in both developed and developing countries. It has been estimated that the United States will see a shortage of up to nearly 122,000 physicians by 2032 as demand for physicians continues to grow faster than supply, Furthermore, according to the American Association of Colleges of Nursing, there is a projected shortage of registered nurses in the US, and it is expected to intensify by 2030. Moreover, the shortage of trained and experienced neurodiagnostic technologists globally has compelled hospitals to cross-train other allied health professionals to perform neurodiagnostic examinations. This presents a key challenge for the growth of the global brain monitoring devices market.
 
We believe the market remains fragmented as many medical practices rely on dated technology and complicated brain monitoring solutions. We also believe that the overpricing and technological barriers currently existing in the market make our innovative EEG platform truly disruptive by being both user friendly and cost effective.
 
Competition
 
Our Products face a mixture of competitors ranging from large manufacturers with multiple business lines to small manufacturers offering a limited selection of products and services. Many of the competitors whom we directly compete with include companies who develop or intend to develop medical EEG products with FDA clearance to support clinical diagnosis of brain disorders. Our indirect competitors offer similar products and services, but target audiences in the clinical research and consumer solutions markets, as opposed to the medical solution market the Company targets. These indirect competitors are largely focused on the development of EEG products for research, consumer, and athletic application.
 
Major shifts in industry market share have occurred in connection with product problems, physician advisories, safety alerts, and publications about MedTech products, reflecting the importance of product quality, product efficacy, and quality systems in the medical device industry. In addition, in the current environment of managed care, economically motivated customers, consolidation among health care providers, increased competition, and declining reimbursement rates, the Company anticipates an increasing need to compete on the basis of price and quality. In order to continue to compete effectively, we must continue to create or acquire advanced technology, incorporate this technology into our current and future proprietary Products, obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, maintain high-quality manufacturing processes, and successfully market these Products. Some of these initiatives include, but are not limited to, creating integrated cloud solutions that connect specialists with generalists for simple data transfer and analysis, streamlining clinical diagnoses with new medical devices, and opening up revenue streams from secondary healthcare markets, such as primary care medical professionals who utilize EEG analyses in their practices.

Other EEG makers that we may compete against include Ceribell, Biosignal Group and Zeto. The major U.S. medical device companies who we deem as competitors include Baxter, Beckman Coulter, Becton Dickinson, Boston Scientific, GE Healthcare Technologies, Johnson & Johnson, St. Jude, Stryker Corporation, and Medtronic. Many of the companies against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and subject registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our development.

Market Application
 
For neurologists and other health providers, we aim to provide a solution for monitoring patient health and safety across a variety of locations including the hospital, specialized clinics, and home settings. In managing patients with epilepsy, providers can improve in areas concerning patient re-admittance, patient mortality and morbidity. Providers can also proactivity prevent the onset of negative chronic health conditions by engaging with at-risk populations at a fraction of the cost by implementing our affordable EEG solutions.
 
For health providers, our offering of an EEG monitoring solution could ease data collection efforts. By providing an accurate and consistent stream of EEG data, our products and services are being designed to allow physicians and other health professionals to make use of newly available bio-metric data to improve diagnosis, treatment and management of various neurological illnesses, effectively increasing the quality and value add of medical services.
 
Our portability and integration potential augment the existing suite of remote monitoring solutions, allowing physicians to more accurately differentiate between nuanced neurological conditions happening within and outside the hospital setting. An example includes helping neurologist’s contrast nocturnal epilepsy patterns across other sleep disorders such as parasomnias where individuals engage in abnormal movements during sleep.
 
Furthermore, we believe a range of medical based applications can be created in conjunction with our EEG solutions around managing patient behavior, offering incentives and parameters for individuals. By understanding what is going on with their brain and being alerted when discrepancies occur, we believe that physicians will be able to better communicate health information, improving the effectiveness and relationship between physicians and patients in improving health outcomes, and individuals with the support of their physicians will be able to better regulate targeted mental states or emotions reducing the sole reliance on on-site visits to hospitals for mental health treatment plans.
 
Sales and Marketing
 
We have commenced the commercial roll-out of the NeuroEEG™ and NeuroCap™, on a limited basis, initially targeting the United States market following with Canada market. We expect the following developmental milestones to be completed within the next 24 months, subject to cash availability:

● | Scale production in US, Europe and Russia 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Release new products to the market: 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | 12 channel EEG cap for adults and pediatric use

● | Expend AI prediction toward concussion, pain and autism applications 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | File international applications in Latin America, Europe and beyond. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
We are identifying additional long-term partners to accelerate market penetration, product diversification, and ultimate survivability across targeted verticals. Through new implementations of our EEG products and services, we expect to retain and capture additional market share through continuous enhancements.
 
We plans to utilize partner relationships and co-marketing opportunities as the initial driver of our marketing efforts, thereby benefiting from increased speed-to-market, as well as the ability to leverage a pre-existing audience/customer base and communications channels. We expect to offer to early adopters our products and services at preferential rates in exchange for expediting development, distribution, and sales of such products and services.
 
Our marketing and sales strategy is focused on rapid, cost-effective delivery of high-quality products into the U.S. and international healthcare market. The sales strategy is based on penetrating the neurology and diagnostic imaging subsectors of the MedTech industry market via planned medical device distributor arrangements or partnering on distribution of NeuroCaps through existing EEG manufacturers, and expanding into nursing homes and primary care practices. Included amongst the customers to whom we intend to market and sell our Products through distributors and partners (B2B), are individual physicians, medical practices, urgent care facilities, physician associations, and other medical professionals and medical professional groups, hospitals, health clinics, nursing homes, physical rehabilitation centers, addiction rehabilitation centers and other medical institutions, athletic organizations, and colleges, universities, and other academic institutions.
 
We intend for our products’ initial entry into the market would be at emergency departments, ICU’s and other acute care settings in the United States.
 
10

 

We will also be looking at forming partnerships with national and global telemedicine and teleneurology companies in order to leverage their relationships, to access our target end-users. This would allow our initial entry into the rapidly growing global telemedicine and teleneurology markets.
    As we grow, we intend to expand to global distributors, Group Purchasing Organizations (GPOs) of medical supplies, and Independent Physician Associations (IPAs) to scale business operations. At this time, we do not provide financing for potential customers, but we are evaluating implementing a leasing program.
 
We do not at this time have plans to have direct sales or hire a direct sales force.


In 2019, we commenced acting as a distributor of third-party medical devices (including those purchased from a company affiliated with one of our officers and directors) in Russia, which we expect to continue while we commercialize our Products and seek to generate material revenue from those sources. While we intend to continue the sale of third party medical devices, we do not intend for it to be our primary source of revenue in the long-term and expect to curtail or cease this line of operations as, if and when we commence generating material, recurring revenues from our Products.
 
Reimbursement
 
Coverage in the United States
 
Reimbursement from private third-party healthcare payors and, to a lesser extent, Medicare will be an important element of our success. Although the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, or CMS, and third-party payors have adopted coverage policies for our targeted indications, there is no guarantee this will continue at the same levels or at all in the future.
 
Regarding ICD-10 codes, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Edition (ICD-10) is a clinical cataloging system that went into effect for the U.S. healthcare industry on Oct. 1, 2015, after a series of lengthy delays. Accounting for modern advances in clinical treatment and medical devices, ICD-10 codes offer many more classification options compared to those found in its predecessor, ICD-9. Within the healthcare industry, providers, coders, IT professionals, insurance carriers, government agencies and others use ICD codes to properly note diseases on health records, to track epidemiological trends and to assist in medical reimbursement decisions.
 
We believe that many of the indications we are pursuing with our technologies are currently reimbursed on a widespread basis by Medicare, Medicaid and private insurance companies.
 
Medicare, Medicaid, health maintenance organizations and other third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new medical devices, and, as a result, their coverage policies may be restrictive, or they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our Products. In order to obtain reimbursement arrangements, we may have to agree to a net sales price lower than the net sales price we might charge in other sales channels. Our revenue may be limited by the continuing efforts of government and third-party payors to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various increasingly sophisticated means, such as requiring prospective reimbursement and second opinions, purchasing in groups, or redesigning benefits. Our future dependence on the commercial success of our technologies makes us particularly susceptible to any cost containment or reduction efforts. Accordingly, unless government and other third-party payors provide adequate coverage and reimbursement for our Products and the related insertion and removal procedures, our financial performance may be limited.
 
Coverage Outside the United States
 
If we seek to commercialize our Products in countries outside the United States, coverage may be available from certain governmental authorities, private health insurance plans, and labor unions. Coverage systems in international markets vary significantly by country and, within some countries, by region. If we seek to commercialize our technology, if approved, outside the U.S., coverage approvals must be obtained on a country-by-country, region-by-region or, in some instances, a case-by case basis. Based on our ongoing evaluation, certain countries reimburse more highly than others.
Manufacturing, Supply and Quality Assurance
 
We currently outsource the supply and manufacture of all components of our NeuroEEG and NeuroCap. We plan to continue with an outsourced manufacturing arrangement for the foreseeable future. We expect that our third-party manufacturers will be competent to manufacture our Products and have quality systems established that meet FDA requirements. We believe the manufacturers we currently utilize or that we may utilize in the future have sufficient capacity to meet our launch requirements if our technology under development is approved in the future and are able to scale up their capacity relatively quickly with minimal capital investment. We believe that, as we increase our demand in the future, our per unit costs will decrease materially. We have also identified capable second source manufacturers and suppliers in the event of disruption from any of our primary vendors.
 
Our suppliers meet ISO 13485:2003 certification, which includes design control requirements. As a medical device developer, the facilities of our sterilization and other critical suppliers are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies. We plan to audit our suppliers periodically to ensure conformity with the specifications, policies and procedures for our devices.
 
With respect to graphene electrodes, our goal is to start working with specific 3D printers and print prototypes of the next generation electrodes. Upon successful testing, of which we can give no assurance of success, we plan to submit the graphene electrode for biocompatibility testing in 2020/2021 with a follow up application to the FDA in 2021 and projected approval in 2022 with commercial implementation to follow.

Research and Development
 
Our research and development programs are generally pursued by engineers and scientists employed by us on a full-time basis or hired as per diem consultants or through partnerships with industry leaders in manufacturing and design and researchers and academia. We are also working with subcontractors in developing specific components of our technologies.
 
The primary objective of our research and development program is to advance the development of our existing and proposed Products, to enhance the commercial value of such Products.
 
We have incurred research and development costs of $103,616 for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $210,206 for the year ended December 31, 2018.We have commenced evaluating the use of graphene for brain electrodes, with an affiliate of Boris Goldstein, our Chairman of the Board. We believe the main benefits of using graphene for electrodes are:
 

● | High conductivity 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------


● | No reaction to any chemicals or human organs 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Very thin 
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | Extremely strong 
--+----------------------------------------------------------


● | Anti-bacterial
--+---------------


● | Inexpensive compared to platinum 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Anti-static
--+------------

 
Potential electronic applications of graphene in EEG include ultra-small transistors, super-dense data storage, touchscreens and a wearable e-tattoo EEG patch. In the energy field, potential applications include ultra-capacitors to store and transmit electrical power as well as highly efficient solar cells. We believe graphene-based batteries in EEG will be able to charge faster and last longer, although we have not commenced any work towards that goal at this time.
 
We also have formed a Medical Advisory Board. The current members are Dr. John Gaitanis, MD, Tufts Medical Center; and Dr. John Hixson, MD, Associate Professor of Neurology, University of California San Francisco. We intend to grant to such members from time to time equity for the services they provide to us.
 
Government Regulation
 
Our NeuroEEG and NeuroCap are each a medical device subject to extensive and ongoing regulation by the FDA, the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the European Commission, and regulatory bodies in other countries. Regulations cover virtually every critical aspect of a medical device company’s business operations, including research activities, product development, quality and risk management, contracting, reimbursement, medical communications, and sales and marketing. In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and the implementing regulations of the FDA govern product design and development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, premarket clearance or approval, product manufacturing, quality systems, import and export, product labeling, product storage, recalls and field safety corrective actions, advertising and promotion, product sales and distribution, and post-market clinical surveillance. Our business is subject to federal, state, local, and foreign regulations, such as ISO 13485, ISO 14971, FDA’s Quality System Regulation, or QSR, contained in 21 CFR Part 820, and the European Commission’s Directive 93/42/EEC concerning medical devices and its amendments.
 
U.S. Regulation
 
The FDA characterizes medical devices into one of three classes. Devices that are considered by the FDA to pose lower risk are classified as Class I or II. Class I devices and are subject to controls for labeling, pre-market notification and adherence to the FDA’s QSR. This pertains to manufacturers’ methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of products, but are usually exempt from premarket notification requirements. Class II devices are subject to the same general controls but may be subject to special controls such as performance standards, post-market surveillance, FDA guidelines, or particularized labeling, and may also require clinical testing prior to clearance or approval. Class III devices are those for which insufficient information exists to assure safety and effectiveness solely through general or special controls, including devices that support or sustain human life, are of substantial importance in preventing impairment of human health, or which present a potential, unreasonable risk of illness or injury.
     12

 

Some Class I and Class II devices are exempted by regulation from the pre-market notification requirement under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, also referred to as a 510(k) clearance, and the requirement of compliance with substantially all of the QSR. However, a pre-market approval, or PMA application, is required for devices deemed by the FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or certain implantable devices, or those that are “not substantially equivalent” either to a device previously cleared through the 510(k) process or to a “preamendment” Class III device in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 when PMA applications were not required. The PMA approval process is more comprehensive than the 510(k) clearance process and typically takes several years to complete. While the 510(k) process is typically shorter than a PMA process, both the 510(k) clearance and PMA processes can be expensive and lengthy.
 
Our NeuroCap device is characterized as a Class I device and NeuroEEG device is characterized as a Class II device.
 
FDA review of a PMA application generally takes between one and three years, but may take significantly longer. The FDA can delay, limit or deny approval of a PMA application for many reasons, including:
 

● | the device may not be safe, effective, reliable or accurate to the FDA’s satisfaction; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the data from pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support approval; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the manufacturing process or facilities may not meet applicable requirements; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in FDA approval policies or adoption of new regulations may require additional data. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
If an FDA evaluation of a PMA application is favorable, the FDA will either issue an approval letter, or approvable letter, which usually contains a number of conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the PMA. When and if those conditions have been fulfilled to the satisfaction of the FDA, the agency will issue a PMA approval letter authorizing commercial marketing of a device, subject to the conditions of approval and the limitations established in the approval letter. If the FDA’s evaluation of a PMA application or manufacturing facilities is not favorable, the FDA will deny approval of the PMA or issue a not approvable letter. The FDA also may determine that additional tests or clinical trials are necessary, in which case the PMA approval may be delayed for several months or years while the trials are conducted, and data is submitted in an amendment to the PMA. The PMA process can be expensive, uncertain and lengthy and a number of devices for which FDA approval has been sought by other companies have never been approved by the FDA for marketing.
 
New PMA applications or PMA supplements may be required for modifications to the manufacturing process, labeling, device specifications, materials or design of a device that has been approved through the PMA process. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as an initial PMA application, except that the supplement is limited to information needed to support any changes from the device covered by the approved PMA application and may or may not require as extensive technical or clinical data or the convening of an advisory panel.
 
Clinical trials are typically required to support a PMA application and are sometimes required for a 510(k) clearance. These trials generally require submission of an application for an IDE, to the FDA. The IDE application must be supported by appropriate data, such as animal and laboratory testing results, showing that it is safe to test the device in humans and that the testing protocol is scientifically sound. The IDE application must be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients, unless the product is deemed a non-significant risk device and eligible for abbreviated IDE requirements. Generally, clinical trials for a significant risk device may begin once the IDE application is approved by the FDA and the study protocol and informed consent are approved by appropriate institutional review boards at the clinical trial sites. The FDA’s approval of an IDE allows clinical testing to go forward, but it does not bind the FDA to accept the results of the trial as sufficient to prove the product’s safety and efficacy, even if the trial meets its intended success criteria. All clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s IDE regulations that govern investigational device labeling, prohibit promotion, and specify an array of recordkeeping, reporting and monitoring responsibilities of study sponsors and study investigators. Clinical trials must further comply with the FDA’s regulations for institutional review board approval and for informed consent and other human subject protections. Required records and reports are subject to inspection by the FDA. The results of clinical testing may be unfavorable or, even if the intended safety and efficacy success criteria are achieved, may not be considered sufficient for the FDA to grant approval or clearance of a product. Clinical trials must be entered into the clinical trials registry at clintrials.gov.
 
The commencement or completion of any clinical trial may be delayed or halted, or be inadequate to support approval of a PMA application, for numerous reasons, including, but not limited to, the following:
 

● | the FDA or other regulatory authorities do not approve a clinical trial protocol or a clinical trial, or place a clinical trial on hold; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | patients do not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | patients, sponsor or study sites do not comply with trial protocols; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | patient follow-up is not at the rate expected; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | patients experience adverse side effects; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
13

 


● | patients die during a clinical trial, even though their death may not be related to the products that are part of our trial; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | institutional review boards and third-party clinical investigators may delay or reject the trial protocol; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | third-party clinical investigators decline to participate in a trial or do not perform a trial on the anticipated schedule or consistent with the clinical trial protocol, good clinical practices or other FDA requirements; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the sponsor or third-party organizations do not perform data collection, monitoring and analysis in a timely or accurate manner or consistent with the clinical trial protocol or investigational or statistical plans; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | third-party clinical investigators have significant financial interests related to the sponsor or the study that the FDA deems to make the study results unreliable, or the company or investigators fail to disclose such interests; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | regulatory inspections of our clinical trials or manufacturing facilities, which may, among other things, require us to undertake corrective action or suspend or terminate our clinical trials; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the interim or final results of the clinical trial are inconclusive or unfavorable as to safety or efficacy; and 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the FDA concludes that our trial design is inadequate to demonstrate safety and efficacy. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

International Regulation
 
International sales of medical devices are subject to local government regulations, which may vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval in another country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval, and the requirements may differ. There is a trend towards harmonization of quality system standards among the European Union, United States, Canada and various other industrialized countries.
 
The primary regulatory body in Europe is that of the European Union, the European Commission, which includes most of the major countries in Europe. Other countries, such as Switzerland, have voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the European Union with respect to medical devices. The European Union has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling and adverse event reporting for medical devices. Devices that comply with the requirements of these relevant directives will be entitled to bear the CE conformity marking, indicating that the device conforms to the essential requirements of the applicable directives and, accordingly, can be commercially distributed throughout Europe. The method of assessing conformity varies depending on the class of the product, but normally involves a combination of self-assessment by the manufacturer and a third party assessment by a “Notified Body.” This third-party assessment may consist of an audit of the manufacturer’s quality system and specific testing of the manufacturer’s product. An assessment by a Notified Body of one country within the European Union is required in order for a manufacturer to commercially distribute the product throughout the European Union. Additional local requirements may apply on a country-by-country basis. Outside of the European Union, regulatory approval would need to be sought on a country-by-country basis in order for us to market our Products.
 
Medical devices in Europe are classified into four primary categories. They are as follows:
 

● | Non-invasive devices 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------


● | Invasive medical devices 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Active medical devices 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Special Rules (including contraceptive, disinfectant, and radiological diagnostic medical devices) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Devices are further segmented into the classes noted below. In Vitro Diagnostic devices (IVDs) have their own classification scheme and while active implantable devices do not follow the same classification system as provided by the Medical Device Directive (MDD), they are subject to similar requirements as Class III devices:
 

● | Class I – Provided non-sterile or do not have a measuring function (low risk) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class I – Provided sterile and/or have a measuring function (low/medium risk) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class IIa (medium risk) 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class IIb (medium/high risk) 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class III (high risk) 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------

 
14

 

We have established a wholly-owned subsidiary in Russia and are seeking to establish a wholly-owned subsidiary in Europe (Poland) for product distribution and certification.
 
Other Regulatory Requirements
 
Even after a device receives clearance or approval and is placed in commercial distribution, numerous regulatory requirements apply. These include:
 

● | establishment registration and device listing; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | QSR, which requires manufacturers, including third party manufacturers, to follow stringent design, testing, risk management, production, control, supplier/contractor selection, complaint handling, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the manufacturing process;

Our contract manufacturers, specification developers and some suppliers of components or device accessories, also are required to manufacture our Products in compliance with current good manufacturing practice requirements set forth in the QSR. The QSR requires a quality system for the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and servicing of marketed devices, and it includes extensive requirements with respect to quality management and organization, device design, buildings, equipment, purchase and handling of components or services, production and process controls, packaging and labeling controls, device evaluation, distribution, installation, complaint handling, servicing, and record keeping. The FDA evaluates compliance with the QSR through periodic unannounced inspections that may include the manufacturing facilities of our subcontractors. If the FDA believes that any of our contract manufacturers or regulated suppliers are not in compliance with these requirements, it can shut down such manufacturing operations, require recall of our Products, refuse to approve new marketing applications, institute legal proceedings to detain or seize products, enjoin future violations or assess civil and criminal penalties against us or our officers or other employees.
 
Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and Similar Foreign and State Laws and Regulations Affecting the Transmission, Security and Privacy of Health Information
 
We may also be subject to data privacy and security regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their respective implementing regulations, imposes specified requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information. Among other things, HITECH makes HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, defined as service providers of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity. HITECH also created four new tiers of civil monetary penalties and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions. In addition, many state laws govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from HIPAA and each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect.
 
Foreign data privacy regulations, such as the EU Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC), the country-specific regulations that implement Directive 95/46/EC, and the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) also govern the processing of personally identifiable data, and may be stricter than U.S. laws.
 
Fraud and Abuse Laws
 
In addition to FDA restrictions, there are numerous U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws. Our relationships with healthcare providers and other third parties are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs.
 
Federal Anti-Kickback and Self-Referral Laws
 
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or providing remuneration (including any kickback, bribe or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing, recommending, or arranging of a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program such as Medicare and Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including such items as gifts, discounts, the furnishing of supplies or equipment, credit arrangements, waiver of payments and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly. Practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchases or recommendations may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a review of all its relevant facts and circumstances. Several courts have interpreted the statute’s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of (or purchases, or recommendations related to) federal healthcare covered business, the Anti-Kickback Statute has been implicated and potentially violated.
 
The penalties for violating the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include imprisonment for up to five years, fines of up to $25,000 per violation and possible exclusion from federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Many states have adopted prohibitions similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which do not have the same exceptions and apply to the referral of patients for healthcare services reimbursed by any source, not only by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Further, the Anti-Kickback Statute was amended by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA. Specifically, as noted above, under the Anti-Kickback Statute, the government must prove the defendant acted “knowingly” to prove a violation occurred. The PPACA added a provision to clarify that with respect to violations of the Anti-Kickback Statute, “a person need not have actual knowledge” of the statute or specific intent to commit a violation of the statute. This change effectively overturns case law interpretations that set a higher standard under which prosecutors had to prove the specific intent to violate the law. In addition, the PPACA codified case law that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.

We plan to provide the initial training to providers and patients necessary for appropriate use of our technology either through our own educators or by contracting with outside educators that have completed an appropriate training course. Outside educators are reimbursed for their services at fair market value.
 
Noncompliance with the federal anti-kickback legislation could result in our exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs, restrictions on our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions, and civil and criminal penalties.
 
Federal law also includes a provision commonly known as the “Stark Law,” which prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing “designated health services,” including a company that furnishes durable medical equipment, in which the physician has an ownership or investment interest or with which the physician has entered into a compensation arrangement. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a noncompliant arrangement, civil penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. We believe that we have structured our provider arrangements to comply with current Stark Law requirements.
 
Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
 
Additionally, as some of these laws are still evolving, we lack definitive guidance as to the application of certain key aspects of these laws as they relate to our arrangements with providers with respect to patient training. We cannot predict the final form that these regulations will take or the effect that the final regulations will have on us. As a result, our provider and training arrangements may ultimately be found to be not in compliance with applicable federal law.
 
Federal False Claims Act
 
The Federal False Claims Act provides, in part, that the federal government may bring a lawsuit against any person whom it believes has knowingly presented, or caused to be presented, a false or fraudulent request for payment from the federal government, or who has made a false statement or used a false record to get a claim approved. In addition, amendments in 1986 to the Federal False Claims Act have made it easier for private parties to bring “qui tam” whistleblower lawsuits against companies under the Federal False Claims Act. Penalties include fines ranging from $5,500 to $11,000 for each false claim, plus three times the amount of damages that the federal government sustained because of the act of that person. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of healthcare companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines or be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state healthcare programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action.
 
There are other federal anti-fraud laws that that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
 
Additionally, HIPAA established two federal crimes in the healthcare fraud and false statements relating to healthcare matters. The healthcare fraud statute prohibits knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private payors. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines, imprisonment or exclusion from government sponsored programs. The false statements statute prohibits knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. A violation of this statute is a felony and may result in fines or imprisonment.
 
Civil Monetary Penalties Law
 
In addition to the Anti-Kickback Statute and the civil and criminal False Claims Acts, the federal government has the authority to seek civil monetary penalties, or CMPs, assessments, and exclusion against an individual or entity based on a wide variety of prohibited conduct. For example, the Civil Monetary Penalties Law authorizes the imposition of substantial CMPs against an entity that engages in activities including, but not limited to: (1) knowingly presenting or causing to be presented, a claim for services not provided as claimed or which is otherwise false or fraudulent in any way; (2) knowingly giving or causing to be given false or misleading information reasonably expected to influence the decision to discharge a patient; (3) offering or giving remuneration to any beneficiary of a federal health care program likely to influence the receipt of reimbursable items or services; (4) arranging for reimbursable services with an entity which is excluded from participation from a federal health care program; (5) knowingly or willfully soliciting or receiving remuneration for a referral of a federal health care program beneficiary; or (6) using a payment intended for a federal health care program beneficiary for another use. Noncompliance can result in civil money penalties of up to $10,000 for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal healthcare programs.

State Fraud and Abuse Provisions
 
Many states have also adopted some form of anti-kickback and anti-referral laws and a false claims act. We believe that we are in conformance to such laws. Nevertheless, a determination of liability under such laws could result in fines and penalties and restrictions on our ability to operate in these jurisdictions.
Physician Payment Sunshine Act
 
Transparency laws regarding payments or other items of value provided to healthcare providers and teaching hospitals may also impact our business practices. The federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act requires most medical device manufacturers to report annually to the Secretary of Human Health Services financial arrangements, payments, or other transfers of value made by that entity to physicians and teaching hospitals. The payment information is made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website. Over the next several years, we will need to dedicate significant resources to establish and maintain systems and processes in order to comply with these regulations. Failure to comply with the reporting requirements can result in significant civil monetary penalties. Similar laws have been enacted or are under consideration in foreign jurisdictions.
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
 
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making corrupt payments, gifts or transfers to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the company to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations. Activities that violate the FCPA, even if they occur wholly outside the United States, can result in criminal and civil fines, imprisonment, disgorgement, oversight, and debarment from government contracts.
Employees
 
As of March 27, 2020, we had seven employees, none of whom are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We consider our relationship with our employee to be satisfactory.
