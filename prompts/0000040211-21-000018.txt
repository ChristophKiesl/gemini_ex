Item 1. Business 
GENERAL
GATX Corporation ("GATX", "we," "us," "our," and similar terms), a New York corporation founded in 1898, is the leading global railcar lessor, owning fleets in North America, Europe, and Asia. In addition, jointly with Rolls-Royce plc, we own one of the largest aircraft spare engine lease portfolios in the world. We report our financial results through three primary business segments: Rail North America, Rail International, and Portfolio Management. Historically, we also reported financial results for American Steamship Company ("ASC") as a fourth segment. On May 14, 2020, we completed the sale of our ASC business to Rand Logistics, Inc., subject to customary post-closing adjustments. As a result, ASC is now reported as discontinued operations, and financial data for the ASC segment has been segregated and presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. See "Note 27. Discontinued Operations" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for additional information. On December 29, 2020, GATX acquired Trifleet Leasing Holding B.V. ("Trifleet"), the fourth largest tank container lessor in the world. Financial results for this business will be reported in the Other segment. See "Note 5.

RAIL NORTH AMERICA
Rail North America is composed of our operations in the United States, Canada, and Mexico. Rail North America primarily provides railcars pursuant to full-service leases under which it maintains the railcars, pays ad valorem taxes and insurance, and provides other ancillary services. These railcars have estimated economic useful lives of 27 to 45 years and an average age of approximately 20 years. Rail North America has a large and diverse customer base, serving approximately 850 customers. In 2020, no single customer accounted for more than 5% of Rail North America’s total lease revenue, and the top ten customers combined accounted for approximately 23% of Rail North America’s total lease revenue. Rail North America leases railcars for terms that generally range from one to ten years, which vary based on railcar types and market conditions. The average remaining lease term of the North American fleet was approximately 35 months as of December 31, 2020. Rail North America’s primary competitors are Union Tank Car Company, Wells Fargo Rail, the CIT Group, Trinity Industries Leasing Company, and SMBC Rail Services, LLC. Rail North America competes primarily on the basis of lease rate, maintenance capabilities, customer relationships, engineering expertise, and availability of railcars. 
Rail North America purchases new railcars from a number of manufacturers, including Trinity Rail Group, LLC ("Trinity"), a subsidiary of Trinity Industries, The Greenbrier Companies, Inc. (“Greenbrier”), National Steel Car Ltd., and Freightcar America. We also acquire railcars in the secondary market. In 2014, we entered into a long-term supply agreement with Trinity. Under the terms of that agreement, we agreed to order 8,950 newly built railcars. As of December 31, 2020, all 8,950 railcars have been ordered and delivered. On May 24, 2018, we amended our long-term supply agreement with Trinity to extend the term to December 2023, and we agreed to purchase an additional 4,800 tank cars (1,200 per year) beginning in January 2020 and continuing through the expiration of the extended term. At December 31, 2020, 1,891 railcars have been ordered pursuant to the amended terms of the agreement, of which 1,272 railcars have been delivered.
In 2018, we entered into a multi-year railcar supply agreement with American Railcar Industries, Inc. ("ARI"), pursuant to which we will purchase 7,650 newly built railcars. The order encompasses a mix of tank and freight cars that are to be delivered over a five-year period, beginning in April 2019. ARI's railcar manufacturing business was subsequently acquired by Greenbrier on July 26, 2019, and Greenbrier assumed all of ARI's obligations under our long-term supply agreement. Under this agreement, 450 railcars were to be delivered in 2019, with the remaining 7,200 to be delivered ratably over the four-year period of 2020 to 2023. As of December 31, 2020, 4,035 railcars have been ordered, of which 2,297 railcars have been delivered. The agreement also includes an option to order up to an additional 4,400 railcars subject to certain restrictions.
Additionally, we acquired a fleet of 3,098 railcars from ECN Capital Corporation, with 2,832 of the railcars acquired in 2018 and the remaining 266 railcars in early 2019. 
Rail North America also owns a fleet of locomotives, consisting of 617 four-axle and 28 six-axle locomotives as of December 31, 2020. Locomotive customers are primarily regional and short-line railroads, industrial users, and Class I railroads. Lease terms vary from month-to-month to ten years. As of December 31, 2020, the average remaining lease term of the locomotive fleet was approximately 24 months. Rail North America's primary competitors in locomotive leasing are Wells Fargo Rail, CIT Group Inc., and Progress Rail Services Corporation. Competitive factors in the market include lease rates, customer service, maintenance, and availability of locomotives. 
Rail North America also remarkets its rail assets, and these remarketing activities may generate gains which could contribute significantly to Rail North America’s segment profit.
Maintenance
Rail North America operates an extensive network of maintenance facilities in the United States and Canada dedicated to performing safe, timely, efficient, and high-quality railcar maintenance services for customers. Services include interior cleaning of railcars, routine maintenance and general repairs to the car body and safety appliances, regulatory compliance work, wheelset replacements, interior blast and lining, exterior blast and painting, and car stenciling. To the extent possible, railcar maintenance is scheduled in a manner that minimizes the amount of time the car is out of service. At December 31, 2020, Rail North America’s maintenance network consisted of: 
•Six major maintenance facilities that can complete nearly all types of maintenance services.
•Two smaller maintenance facilities with more limited capabilities. 
•Six customer-dedicated sites operating within customer facilities that offer services tailored to the needs of our customers’ fleets.
•Seven locations with mobile units that travel to many track-side field locations to provide spot repairs and interior cleaning services.
    The maintenance network is supplemented by a number of preferred third-party maintenance providers and railroads. In 2020, third-party maintenance network expenses accounted for approximately 34% of Rail North America’s total maintenance network expenses, excluding repairs performed by the railroads. In 2020, wholly owned and third-party maintenance facilities performed approximately 48,000 service events, including multiple independent service events for the same car.
Our maintenance activities are dedicated to servicing our wholly owned railcar fleet pursuant to the provisions of our lease contracts. This may include services that are not included in the full-service lease agreement, such as repairs of railcar damage or other customer-specific requirements. Revenue earned from these types of maintenance services is recorded in other revenue.
Affiliates
We previously owned a 12.5% interest in Adler Funding LLC ("Adler"), a railcar leasing partnership that was formed in 2010 with UniCredit Bank AG, Sperber Rail Holdings Inc., and LBT Holding Corporation. Rail North America provided leasing, maintenance and asset remarketing services to Adler, for which it received a base service fee and a performance-based asset remarketing fee. All Adler railcar assets were sold in 2018. There was no operating income or loss recognized from this partnership in 2019 or 2020. During 2020, Adler was legally dissolved and final proceeds were distributed.
RAIL INTERNATIONAL
Rail International is composed of our operations in Europe ("GATX Rail Europe" or "GRE"), India ("GRI"), and Russia ("Rail Russia"). GRE primarily leases railcars to customers throughout Europe pursuant to full-service leases under which it maintains the railcars and provides value-added services according to customer requirements. These railcars have estimated useful lives of 30 to 40 years and an average age of approximately 17 years. GRE has a diverse customer base with approximately 240 customers. In 2020, one customer accounted for more than 10% of GRE's total lease revenue and the top ten customers combined accounted for approximately 53% of GRE's total lease revenue. GRE's lease terms generally range from one to ten years and as of December 31, 2020, the average remaining lease term of the European fleet was approximately 22 months. GRE's primary competitors are VTG Aktiengesellschaft, the Ermewa Group, Wascosa AG, and Touax. GRE competes principally on the basis of customer relationships, lease rate, maintenance expertise, and availability of railcars.
GRE acquires new railcars primarily from Gök Yapi San. Tic. a.s., Greenbrier-Astra Rail (Wagony Swidnica sp. z.o.o and Astra Rail Industries S.A.), Duro Dacovic, and Tatravagonka a.s. Additionally, GRE's Ostróda, Poland maintenance facility assembles several hundred tank cars each year. As of December 31, 2020, GRE had commitments to acquire from third parties, primarily from Gök Yapi San. Tic. a.s. and Greenbrier-Astra Rail, approximately 925 newly manufactured railcars to be delivered in 2021. The majority of these railcars have committed leases in place with customers.
As of December 31, 2020, GRI owned 4,156 railcars with estimated useful lives of 15 to 25 years. GRI's leases are net leases and have terms generally ranging from four to fourteen years. As of December 31, 2020, the average remaining lease term of the Indian fleet was approximately 6 years. GRI has a small customer base with twelve customers in the automotive, container, steel, cement, and bulk commodities transport sector, as well as one customer in the public sector. As of December 31, 2020, GRI had entered into contracts to acquire 414 railcars to be delivered in 2021, the majority of which have committed leases in place with customers.
As of December 31, 2020, Rail Russia owned 380 railcars with useful lives of 22 to 32 years. Rail Russia's leases are service leases and have terms generally ranging from three to seven years. As of December 31, 2020, the average remaining lease term of the Russian fleet was approximately 4 years. Rail Russia has a small customer base with three customers in the timber, food products, and chemical sectors.
Maintenance
As of December 31, 2020, GRE operates a maintenance facility in Ostróda, Poland. In 2020, GRE sold its railcar maintenance facility in Hanover, Germany, which had been closed and out of operation since 2018. The maintenance facility in Ostróda, Poland assembles railcars for GRE's fleet and performs significant repairs, regulatory compliance, and modernization work for our owned railcars. This service center is supplemented by a number of third-party repair facilities. The third party facilities accounted for approximately 70% of GRE's fleet repair costs in 2020.
Similar to our Rail North America segment, GRE's customers periodically require maintenance services that are not included in the full-service lease agreement. These services are generally related to the repair of railcar damage caused by customers and railways. Revenue earned from these maintenance activities is recorded in other revenue.
In India, all railcar maintenance is performed by Indian Railways or third-parties authorized by Indian Railways, in accordance with regulatory requirements.
In Russia, all railcar maintenance is performed by third-party repair facilities either owned or authorized by Russian Railways, in accordance with regulatory requirements.
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT
Portfolio Management is composed primarily of our ownership in a group of joint ventures with Rolls-Royce plc that lease aircraft spare engines, as well as five liquefied gas-carrying vessels (the "Specialized Gas Vessels").
Affiliates
The Rolls-Royce & Partners Finance joint ventures (collectively the “RRPF affiliates”) are a group of 50% owned domestic and foreign joint ventures with Rolls-Royce plc (or affiliates thereof, collectively “Rolls-Royce”), a leading manufacturer of commercial aircraft jet engines. The RRPF affiliates are primarily engaged in two business activities: leasing of aircraft spare engines to a diverse group of commercial aircraft operators worldwide and leasing of aircraft spare engines to Rolls-Royce for use in their engine maintenance programs. As of December 31, 2020, the RRPF affiliates, in aggregate, owned 445 engines, of which 215 were on lease to Rolls-Royce. Aircraft engines generally have an estimated economic useful life of 18 to 25 years when new and, depending on actual hours of usage and with proper maintenance, may achieve extended service well beyond the useful life estimates. As of December 31, 2020, the average age of these engines was approximately 12 years. Lease terms vary, but typically range from 3 to 12 years. Rolls-Royce acts as manager for each of the RRPF affiliates and also performs substantially all maintenance activities.
Owned and Managed Assets
As of December 31, 2020, Portfolio Management's owned assets consisted primarily of the Specialized Gas Vessels. The vessels are commercially managed by Anthony Veder Group B.V. ("Veder"). Veder, based in the Netherlands, owns and operates a fleet of specialized gas-carrying vessels under contracts and charters with customers in the oil and gas industry. The Specialized Gas Vessels engage in the transport of pressurized gases and chemicals, such as liquefied petroleum gas, liquefied natural gas, and ethylene for major oil and chemical customers worldwide.
Portfolio Management also manages portfolios of assets for third parties which generate fee and residual sharing income through portfolio administration and the remarketing of these assets. As of December 31, 2020, Portfolio Management's managed activities consisted primarily of managing leases of two power generating assets.
OTHER
On December 29, 2020, GATX acquired Trifleet Leasing Holding B.V. ("Trifleet"), the fourth largest tank container lessor in the world, headquartered in Dordrecht, Netherlands. Trifleet owns and manages a fleet of over 19,000 tank containers leased to a diverse base of approximately 300 customers in the chemical, industrial gas, energy, food, cryogenic and pharmaceutical industries, as well as to tank container operators. These tank containers have estimated useful lives of 15 to 25 years and an average age of approximately 8 years for the combined owned and managed fleet. Trifleet's lease terms generally range from one to five years and as of December 31, 2020, the average remaining lease term of the combined owned and managed fleet was approximately 29 months. Trifleet manages tank containers on behalf of third-party container investors under long-term agreements. Under these agreements, Trifleet earns fees for managing these investor-owned fleets, and provides various services, including the sourcing of new containers and customers, leasing and remarketing of tank containers, arranging inspection and maintenance services. Trifleet's primary competitors are Eurotainer, Exsif, Seaco, and CS Leasing.
Trifleet acquires new tank containers primarily from China International Marine Containers (Group) Ltd. ("CIMC"), Welfit Oddy, Jingjiang Asian-Pacific Logistics Equipment Co., Ltd. ("JJAP"), and Nantong Tank Container Co., Ltd. As of December 31, 2020, Trifleet had commitments to acquire from third parties, primarily from CIMC and JJAP, 366 newly manufactured tank containers to be delivered in 2021.

We welcome and celebrate our teams’ differences, experiences, and beliefs, and are investing in a more engaged, diverse, and inclusive workforce.
Talent Development, and Retention
We believe our ability to attract, retain, and develop top talent is critical to our success. We have been voted a top workplace in Chicago by our employees and have a high overall rate of retention. In addition, we conduct an annual employee engagement survey to gather valuable feedback. We are focused on creating experiences and programs that foster professional growth, performance and retention. GATX invests significant resources in the training and development of our employees with such programs as Leadership 101 for field supervisors, Business Series sessions for employees to learn about different aspects of GATX, professional development courses, e-learning, and certification programs for maintenance personnel to enable career progression through higher skilled roles. Our talent development programs are designed to provide employees with the resources they need to help achieve their career goals, build management skills and lead their organizations.

Safety
GATX strives to maintain the highest levels of safety by fostering a culture that makes safety a top priority. GATX utilizes a continuous improvement methodology to identify safety risks and hazards and drive improvement initiatives. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken steps to ensure that our railcar maintenance facility employees and inspectors, who are deemed “essential” to the rail industry, can safely perform their jobs every day. Our efforts include establishing consistent employee screening protocols, safe work practices and training, and robust cleaning procedures within our repair facility network in order to minimize COVID-19 risk to our employees, their families and the communities in which we operate.
GATX continues to be recognized as a Responsible Care Partner by the American Chemistry Council and the Chemical Industry Association of Canada ("CIAC"), and is an active participant in the Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response initiative, a national outreach effort assisting communities to prepare for and respond to possible hazardous materials transportation incidents. In 2020, GATX donated a 30,000-gallon tank car to the CIAC to provide tank car and service equipment training to emergency responders throughout Canada. Additionally, GATX offers training on the proper use of our equipment and on regulations that impact our business. We hold training events at customer locations across North America through the use of our TankTrainer™ mobile classroom. In the past three years, we have trained more than 1,600 customers and emergency responders.
Community Commitment
We believe that building connections between our employees and their communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling and enjoyable workplace. GATX has a long history of supporting causes in communities where our employees live and work, establishing a company culture that values strong corporate citizenship. Every year, we organize and encourage employees to volunteer and give back through programs that focus on addressing the needs of underserved populations and building vibrant communities. In 2020, GATX employees donated meals to support healthcare workers on the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic and individuals experiencing hardship and homelessness, and GATX mentored students and awarded scholarships through our partnership with Big Shoulders Fund. Further, we hold an annual employee giving campaign and fundraiser for the Make-A-Wish Foundation of Illinois and have donated nearly $4.5 million to the organization since 2008.
ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
Our operations, facilities and properties are subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations. These laws cover discharges to waters; air emissions; toxic substances; the generation, handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and hazardous materials; and the investigation and remediation of contamination. These laws have the effect of increasing the cost and liability associated with leasing and operating assets, and violations can result in significant fines, penalties, or other liabilities. Environmental risks and compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations are inherent in rail and marine operations, which frequently involve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials.
We are subject to, and may from time to time continue to be subject to, environmental cleanup and enforcement actions in the United States and in the foreign countries in which we operate. In particular, the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, generally imposes joint and several liability for investigation, cleanup and enforcement costs on current and former owners and operators of a site, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct. Accordingly, we have been and may, in the future, be named as a potentially responsible party under CERCLA and other federal, state, local, and foreign laws or regulations for all or a portion of the costs to investigate and clean up sites at which certain contaminants may have been discharged or released by us, our current lessees, former owners or lessees of properties, or other third parties. Environmental remediation and other environmental costs are accrued when considered probable and amounts can be reasonably estimated. As of December 31, 2020, environmental costs were not material to our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. For further discussion, see "Note 24.  Legal Proceedings and Other Contingencies" in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.
