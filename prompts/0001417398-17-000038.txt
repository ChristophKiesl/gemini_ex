GENERAL

Hillenbrand (www.Hillenbrand.com) is a global diversified industrial company with multiple market-leading brands that serve a wide variety of industries around the world. Hillenbrand’s portfolio is composed of two business segments: the Process Equipment Group and Batesville®. The Process Equipment Group businesses design, develop, manufacture, and service highly engineered industrial equipment around the world. Batesville is a recognized leader in the North American death care industry. Hillenbrand was incorporated on November 1, 2007, in the state of Indiana and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange 
2

under the symbol “HI” on April 1, 2008.  “Hillenbrand,” “the Company,” “we,” “us,” “our,” and similar words refer to Hillenbrand, Inc. and its subsidiaries unless context otherwise requires. 
Although Hillenbrand has been a public company for more than nine years, the businesses owned by Hillenbrand have been in operation for decades.
Between 2010 and 2014, Hillenbrand completed three major acquisitions of companies that formed the foundation of our Process Equipment Group:  K-Tron International, Inc. (“K-Tron”) in April 2010, Rotex Global, LLC (“Rotex”) in August 2011, and Coperion Capital GmbH (“Coperion”) in December 2012.  
TerraSource Global, also part of our Process Equipment Group, was organized in July 2012 from three brands, Gundlach Equipment Corporation, Jeffrey Rader Corporation, and Pennsylvania Crusher Corporation, each acquired as part of the K-Tron acquisition. The remaining K-Tron brands merged with Coperion during 2013.
On October 2, 2015, Hillenbrand acquired Abel Pumps LP, Abel GmbH & Co. KG, and certain of their affiliates (collectively “Abel”). Additionally, on February 1, 2016, Hillenbrand acquired Red Valve Company, Inc. (“Red Valve”). Both Abel and Red Valve are now included in our Process Equipment Group segment.
See Note 3 to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K for more information on the Abel and Red Valve acquisitions.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS
Process Equipment Group

The Process Equipment Group designs, engineers, manufactures, markets, and services differentiated process and material handling equipment and systems for a wide variety of industries, including plastics, food and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, fertilizers, minerals and mining, energy, wastewater treatment, and forest products.  The Process Equipment Group uses its strong applications and process engineering expertise to solve problems for customers.  Its highly engineered capital equipment and systems offerings require after-market service and/or parts replacement, providing an opportunity for ongoing revenue at attractive margins.
Process Equipment Group:  Products and Services

The Process Equipment Group product portfolio has grown through a series of acquisitions over the past seven years and now includes products and services for compounding, extrusion, and material handling; size reduction; screening and separating; and flow control.  The Process Equipment Group businesses are supported by replacement parts and services that represent approximately 36% of the group’s total revenue.  Products are offered under brand names that are recognized among the leaders in their respective categories.

• | Compounding, Extrusion, and Material Handling Equipment, and Equipment System Design


• | Twin screw compounding and extrusion machines range from small laboratory compounding machines to high performance, high throughput extrusion systems. Small and mid-sized compounders are used by customers in engineering plastics, masterbatch, PVC, and other applications for the plastics, chemical, and food and pharmaceutical industries. These products are sold under the Coperion® brand. Extrusion systems are sold to customers in the polyolefin industry for base resin production. The extrusion products are sold under the Coperion® brand. 


• | Material handling equipment includes pneumatic and hydraulic conveying equipment for difficult-to-move materials; high-precision feeders that can operate at both very high and very low fill rates; blenders for pellets and powders; and rotary valves, diverter valves, and slide-gate valves used for feeding, dosing, discharge, and distribution during pneumatic conveying. The proprietary equipment is highly engineered and designed to solve the needs of customers for customized solutions. Material handling equipment is sold to a variety of industries, including plastics, food and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and minerals and mining. These products are sold under the Coperion® and Coperion K-Tron® brands. 


• | Compounding, extrusion, and material handling equipment can be sold as a complete system, where strong application and process engineering expertise is used to design and create a broad system solution for customers. Systems can range from a single manufacturing line to large scale manufacturing lines and turnkey systems. Larger system sales are generally fulfilled over 12 to 18 months. A variable amount of revenue for large system sales comes from third-party-sourced products that carry only a small up-charge. As a result, margin percentages tend to be lower on these large system sales when compared to the rest of the business. 


• | Size Reduction Equipment


• | Size reduction equipment is used to reduce the size of friable materials. Pennsylvania Crusher® and Gundlach® products are used to crush materials in the power generation, mining, quarrying, glass making, salt processing, and fertilizer manufacturing industries. Jeffrey Rader® products are used in industries including forest products, pulp and paper, biomass power and energy generation, and plastics/base resin manufacturing. Jeffrey Rader also designs and provides complete material handling and pneumatic or mechanical conveying systems to meet product specifications, including boiler feed, resource recovery, rail and truck loading/unloading, and recycling systems. 

4


• | Screening and Separating Equipment


• | Screening and separating equipment sorts dry, granular products based on the size of the particles being processed. This equipment is sold under the Rotex® brand to customers in a variety of industries including proppants, fertilizers, chemicals, agricultural goods, plastics, and food processing. The equipment uses a unique technology based on a specific gyratory-reciprocating motion that provides an optimal material distribution on the screens, gentle handling of particles, and accurate separations. 


• | Flow Control Solutions


• | Pump solutions mainly consist of piston and piston diaphragm pump technology that transfer abrasive or corrosive fluids and fluids with a high sludge or solids content for mission critical applications. This equipment is sold under the ABEL® Pump Technology brand into the power generation, wastewater treatment, mining, general industry, and marine markets. This equipment lends itself to a superior total cost of ownership over time compared to other pumping technologies. 


• | Valve solutions mainly consist of pinch valves and duckbill check valves that manage fluids for mission-critical, severe service applications. These valves, among others, are sold under Red Valve®, Tideflex Technologies, and RKL Controls brands into the water and wastewater, drainage and storm water, mining, chemicals, and power markets. These engineered valves are designed for long life in the toughest municipal and industrial applications, lending themselves to superior total costs of ownership over time. 


• | Replacement Parts and Service


• | Replacement parts and service are a major component of most of the Process Equipment Group business lines. Service engineers and technicians are located around the globe to better respond to customers’ machines and systems service needs. The parts and service division offers customers service consulting, training, maintenance and repairs, spare parts, and modernization solutions. These services are a key component of each business within the Process Equipment Group. 

Process Equipment Group:  Sales, Distribution, and Operations

The Process Equipment Group sells equipment and systems throughout the world using a combination of direct sales and a global network of independent sales representatives and distributors.  A part of the Process Equipment Group’s sales, especially in North America, is made through independent sales representatives who are compensated by commission.  In situations where a representative purchases equipment and resells it as a distributor, the product is sold at a price net of commission, depending on the type of product sold.

Equipment and systems orders are often for unique, engineered-to-order items.  Therefore, the Process Equipment Group does not typically maintain significant amounts of raw material and component stock inventory on hand at any one time, except to cover replacement part orders.  Products are either assembled and tested at Process Equipment Group facilities and then shipped to a customer or are assembled at the customer’s desired location.

We expect that future revenue associated with the Process Equipment Group will be influenced by order backlog because of the lead time involved in fulfilling engineered-to-order equipment for customers.  Though backlog can be an indicator of future revenue, it does not include projects and parts orders that are booked and shipped within the same quarter.  The timing of order placement, size of order, extent of customization, and customer delivery dates can create fluctuations in backlog and revenue.  Revenue attributable to backlog may also be affected by foreign exchange fluctuations for orders denominated in currencies other than United States (“U.S.”) dollars.
Process Equipment Group:  Customers

The Process Equipment Group has customers in a wide range of industries, including plastics, food and pharmaceuticals, chemicals, fertilizers, minerals and mining, energy, wastewater treatment, and forest products.  These customers range from large, Fortune 500 global companies to regional and local businesses.  No one customer accounted for more than 10% of Hillenbrand’s consolidated revenue during 2017.  For large or customized orders, customers generally pay a deposit and make progress payments in accordance with the project progress.  Often, long-term relationships are established with these customers.

5

The Process Equipment Group’s sales are diversified by end markets, and further penetration of these end markets is an important element of its strategy.  Currently, projects in the plastics industry represent greater than half of the Process Equipment Group’s sales.  Geographically, approximately three quarters of the revenue in the Process Equipment Group comes from the Americas and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa), with the remaining quarter coming from Asia.
We believe that long-term growth for this segment is driven by megatrends such as a rapidly growing middle class in China and India and a growing global population, resulting in rising demand for products sold in many of the end markets the Process Equipment Group serves.  While overall demand for these products is expected to increase over the long run, we expect short-term periodic fluctuations in demand from time-to-time.

Process Equipment Group:  Competition

We believe the Process Equipment Group holds leading positions in key industries because of design and quality of products, extensive application and process engineering expertise, product support services, brand name recognition, and commitment to serving the needs of customers.

The Process Equipment Group brands face strong competition in the markets where they compete. Competitors range in size from small, privately-held companies serving narrow market segments or geographical areas to larger, well-known global companies serving national and international markets with multiple product lines.  We believe the Process Equipment Group’s diversification into multiple industries and markets, its base of replacement parts business, and its strong worldwide network of suppliers and dealers will allow it to maintain leading market positions even during economic downturns.

Process Equipment Group:  Raw and Component Materials

The manufacturing of the Process Equipment Group’s products involves the machining and welding of raw materials (primarily sheet metals and steel) and castings that are assembled with other component parts that generally require particular specifications or qualifications purchased from third-party suppliers.  Although most of these raw materials and components are generally available from several sources, some of these items are currently purchased from single sources.  Volatility in the prices the Process Equipment Group pays for raw materials used in its products, including sheet metals and steel, has a direct effect on profitability. The Process Equipment Group regularly takes steps designed to mitigate the impact of volatility in raw and component material prices, including executing Lean initiatives and various sourcing actions.  In instances where third-party suppliers are depended upon for outsourced products or components, there is risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products sold due to supplier failure.  In addition, difficulties experienced by third-party suppliers can interrupt the ability to obtain the outsourced product and ultimately to supply products to customers.  Regardless, we believe the Process Equipment Group will generally be able to continue to obtain adequate supplies of key products or appropriate substitutes at reasonable costs.
Process Equipment Group:  Strategy

The Process Equipment Group seeks profitable growth through the following strategic initiatives: 

• | Build and grow leadership positions


• | Build leadership positions in core and near adjacent markets through introduction of new products and application of process expertise.


• | Leverage our geographic presence to improve access to underpenetrated channels and local regions in developed and emerging markets.


• | Pursue acquisitions that strengthen our relative market leadership position in key markets.


• | Utilize the Hillenbrand Operating Model principles and tools to strengthen our competitive position and maintain an optimal cost structure to support profitability


• | Continually improve processes to be more consistent and cost efficient and to yield industry leading quality products and services that our customers value.

Batesville
Batesville® is a recognized leader in the North American death care industry, where it has been designing, manufacturing, distributing, and selling funeral service products and solutions to licensed funeral directors operating licensed funeral homes for more than 100 years.  Batesville-branded products include: burial caskets; cremation caskets and urns; selection room display fixturing for funeral homes; personalization and memorialization products and services; and web-based technology applications that include funeral planning, website products, and back office software for licensed funeral homes.  Batesville also develops and markets comprehensive operational management software solutions for cemeteries.
Batesville:  Products and Services
As the needs of funeral professionals and consumers have evolved, Batesville has expanded its offerings with new products, value-added services, and leading partnerships.  Today, Batesville provides products and services to customers under three primary solutions platforms: (1) Burial Solutions, which accounts for the majority of Batesville’s revenue, (2) Cremation Options®, and (3) Technology Solutions.  Each platform is underpinned by expert profitability solutions designed to help funeral professionals optimize their business.  

• | Burial Solutions


• | As the leading casket manufacturer in North America, Batesville is recognized for innovation in materials, design, and proprietary features that benefit funeral professionals and the families they serve. The company has been on the forefront of casket innovation for more than 60 years - from the first mass-produced gasketed casket to the introduction of Dimensions® oversized caskets, to casket personalization and memorialization elements, such as LifeSymbols® designs, LifeStories® medallions and keepsakes, and LifeView® panels. 

Batesville produces gasketed caskets from four types of metal: carbon steel, stainless steel, copper, and bronze. Batesville also produces and markets an expanding selection of non-gasketed steel caskets. Additionally, Batesville manufactures solid hardwood and veneer caskets from multiple wood species and uses a variety of finishes to appeal to different consumers.  Its wood products cover the spectrum in variety and value - from an exclusive line of Marsellus® premium solid wood caskets, to cloth-covered units and all-wood construction caskets, which are also suitable for green burials.

• | Cremation Options®


• | The Cremation Options® platform is focused on helping funeral professionals capitalize on the growing consumer trend to select cremation. In addition to a broad line of cremation caskets, containers, and urns, Batesville offers training, merchandising, packaging support, and a complete line of marketing support materials to educate funeral directors and consumers on product and service options. Cremation caskets and containers are manufactured primarily of hardwoods and fiberboard using processes and material similar to those used to make wood burial caskets. Batesville’s memorial urns are made from a variety of materials including bronze, wood, acrylic, cloisonné, brass, and marble. Batesville also offers a broad selection of biodegradable and scattering urns. 


• | Technology Solutions


• | Technology solutions are increasingly important in the death care industry. Batesville is the leading partner to approximately 5,700 funeral homes and cemeteries across North America. The company offers a suite of integrated, easy-to-use technology products and services, including funeral home websites, e-commerce solutions, digital selection and arrangement software, and business management systems for funeral homes and cemeteries. All of these solutions are designed to support customers by (1) creating marketing and revenue opportunities; (2) making the funeral planning process easier and more efficient; and (3) creating more positive relationships with the families and communities they serve. Batesville also has exclusive agreements with leading brands such as: Legacy.com®, an on-line obituary network provider; and FTD®, an international provider of sympathy flowers and gifts that can be ordered directly from the funeral home’s website. 

7

Batesville:  Sales, Distribution, and Operations
Batesville offers several marketing and merchandising programs to funeral professionals.  Batesville-branded caskets are marketed by a direct sales force only to licensed funeral professionals operating licensed funeral establishments throughout the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico, and Australia.  Batesville also markets its products to select independent distribution facilities as well as full-service funeral establishments offering funeral products in conformance with state law in states that do not have specific licensing requirements.
Batesville has sales contracts in place with certain national death care service providers and also serves approximately 12,000 independent, privately owned funeral homes across North America.  None of Batesville’s customers accounted for more than 10% of Hillenbrand’s consolidated revenue during 2017.
Batesville:  Customer Preferences and Demographics
The death of a family member causes most people to seek the services of a state-licensed funeral director.  Most consumers have limited familiarity with funeral-related products and expect funeral directors to provide information on product and service alternatives.  Although caskets and urns can be purchased from a variety of sources, including internet sellers and casket stores, the overwhelming majority of consumers who arrange a funeral purchase these products directly from a funeral home.
Demand for Batesville products and services is partially impacted by a few key external factors: U.S. and Canadian population demographics, the number of deaths annually, and the rate at which consumers select cremation.  These primary factors have negatively impacted the burial volume trend in recent years, although periodic fluctuations can impact demand and revenue in a given quarter and year.  We anticipate this trend in burials and demand will remain relatively consistent, in part because the continued shift toward cremation will be partially offset by the anticipated higher number of deaths among the aging post-World War II baby boomer generation. As a percentage of total deaths, the estimated cremation rate in 2017 was approximately 50% in the U.S. and 70% in Canada (Source: Cremation Association of North America).  Another important factor impacting the death care industry is the gradual increase in consumer preferences for lower-price caskets.
Batesville:  Competition
Batesville is a recognized leader in the sale of death care products in North America.  We believe competition in this industry is largely based on product quality, service, price, delivery, design features and personalization.  Batesville competes with several national and regional casket manufacturers, as well as more than 100 independent casket distributors, most of whom serve fairly narrow geographic segments.  Some non-traditional death care providers, such as large discount retail stores, casket stores, and internet casket retailers also sell caskets directly to consumers.  The industry has seen a few foreign manufacturers, mostly from China, import caskets into the U.S. and Canada.  Sales from these non-traditional and foreign providers collectively currently represent less than 10% of total casket sales in North America.
The effect of declining casket demand continues to put added economic pressures on casket manufacturers and distributors as they seek to maintain volume.  Existing domestic over-capacity and commodity price increases could further impact these pressures, resulting in higher per unit costs.
Batesville:  Raw Materials
Batesville uses carbon and stainless steel, copper and bronze sheets, wood, fabrics, finishing materials, rubber gaskets, plastic and zinc in the manufacture of its caskets.  Although most of these raw materials are generally available from several sources, some are currently procured from a single source.
Volatility in the prices Batesville pays for raw materials used in its products, including steel, fuel, petroleum-based products, and fuel-related delivery costs, has a direct effect on profitability.  The company generally does not engage in hedging transactions for these purchases but does enter into fixed-price supply contracts at times.  Batesville regularly takes steps designed to mitigate the impact of volatility in raw material and fuel prices, including executing Lean initiatives and various sourcing actions.
Most of Batesville’s sales are made pursuant to supply agreements with its customers, and historically it has instituted annual price adjustments to help offset some, but not necessarily all, raw material cost increases.
8

Batesville:  Strategy
While we believe there are opportunities to generate additional revenue within a wider range of death care products and services, sustaining volume in the burial casket space continues to be a top priority.  Batesville’s leadership team is focused on two strategic initiatives to sustain burial volume:

• | Grow our leadership position in the death care industry


• | Focus on building and delivering value propositions that align with the needs of each customer segment to continue Batesville’s mission of helping families honor the lives of those they love®.


• | Utilize the Hillenbrand Operating Model principles and tools to strengthen our leadership position and maintain an optimal cost structure to support profitability


• | Continually improve processes to be more consistent and efficient and to clearly yield industry leading quality products and services that our customers value.

HILLENBRAND PATENTS AND TRADEMARKS

We own a number of patents on our products and manufacturing processes and maintain trade secrets related to manufacturing processes.  These patents and trade secrets are of importance, but we do not believe any single patent or trade secret or related group of patents or trade secrets is of material significance to our business as a whole. We also own a number of trademarks and service marks relating to products and services which are of importance.  We believe the marks Coperion®, Coperion K-Tron®, TerraSource Global®, Pennsylvania Crusher®, Gundlach®, Jeffrey Rader®, K-Tron®, Rotex®, ABEL® Pump Technology, and Red Valve® are of material significance to the Process Equipment Group.  We believe the trademark Batesville® is of material significance to our Batesville segment.

Our ability to compete effectively depends, to an extent, on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our intellectual property. In the past, certain of our products have been copied and sold by others.  Hillenbrand vigorously seeks to enforce its intellectual property rights.  However, we may not be sufficiently protected by our various patents, trademarks, and service marks, and they may be challenged, invalidated, cancelled, narrowed, or circumvented.  Beyond that, we may not receive the pending or contemplated patents, trademarks, or service marks for which we have applied or filed.

HILLENBRAND REGULATORY MATTERS

Both the Process Equipment Group and Batesville are subject to a variety of federal, state, local, and foreign laws and regulations relating to environmental, health, and safety concerns, including the handling, storage, discharge, and disposal of hazardous materials used in or derived from our manufacturing processes.  We are committed to operating all our businesses in a manner that protects the environment and makes us good corporate citizens in the communities in which we operate.  While we believe that continued compliance with federal, state, local and foreign laws relating to the protection of the environment will not have a material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position, future events or changes in existing laws and regulations or their interpretation may require us to make additional expenditures in the future.  The cost or need for any such additional expenditure is not known.
HILLENBRAND FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND EXPORT SALES

Quantitative information about foreign operations is set forth in tables relating to geographic information in Note 14 to our financial statements included in Part II, Item 8, of this Form 10-K.
