ITEM 1.    BUSINESS.
        Unless otherwise provided in this report, all references in this report to “we,” “us,” “Radius,” “our company,” “our,” or the “Company” refer to Radius Health, Inc. and our subsidiaries.
Overview
We are a global biopharmaceutical company focused on addressing unmet medical needs in the areas of bone health, neuroscience, and oncology. 
In April 2017, our first commercial product, TYMLOS (abaloparatide) injection, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture defined as history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. In May 2017, we commenced U.S. commercial sales of TYMLOS and as of January 1, 2022, TYMLOS was available and covered for approximately 288 million U.S. insured lives, representing approximately 99% of U.S. Commercial and 74% of Medicare Part D insured lives. 
During 2021, we completed three potentially pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials and announced their results, as follows:
•In October 2021, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 3 clinical trial evaluating abaloparatide for subcutaneous injection (“abaloparatide-SC”) for use in males with osteoporosis (the “ATOM Trial”). The ATOM Trial met its primary and secondary endpoints and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous trials. 
•In October 2021, together with our licensee, Berlin-Chemie AG (“Berlin-Chemie”), a company of the Menarini Group, we announced positive topline results from our Phase 3 clinical trial of elacestrant, a selective estrogen receptor degrader (SERD) we investigated as a monotherapy versus the standard of care for treatment of ER+/HER2- advanced or metastatic breast cancer (the “EMERALD Trial”). The EMERALD Trial met both primary endpoints and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with previous trials. We presented data from the EMERALD Trial at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in December 2021.
•In December 2021, we announced the results of our Phase 3 clinical trial of the abaloparatide transdermal system (“abaloparatide-TD”), a different formulation of abaloparatide delivered using Kindeva Drug Delivery’s (“Kindeva”) patented microstructured transdermal system technology (the “wearABLe Trial”). The wearABLe Trial did not meet its primary or secondary endpoints.
We are also developing RAD011, a pharmaceutical-grade synthetic cannabidiol oral solution, manufactured utilizing traditional pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. Based on feedback received from a Type C meeting with the FDA in June 2021, we are moving forward with a potentially pivotal Phase 2/3 study for treatment of hyperphagia-related behavior in patients with Prader-Willi Syndrome (“PWS”) in the first half of 2022. 
We out licensed our oncology assets in 2020. In July 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Berlin-Chemie under which we granted Berlin-Chemie an exclusive license to develop and commercialize products containing elacestrant worldwide. 
In September 2020 we sold RAD140, our internally discovered non-steroidal selective androgen receptor modulator (“SARM”) to Ellipses Pharma. Ellipses Pharma will be responsible for the clinical development and commercialization of the asset and is obligated to pay us royalties.
Our Marketed Product and Investigational Product Candidates
The success of our business is primarily dependent upon our ability to maximize the commercialization of TYMLOS and abaloparatide-SC, develop and commercialize our current and future product candidates, and benefit from Berlin-Chemie’s potential commercialization of elacestrant. With respect to abaloparatide-SC, we hold worldwide commercialization rights, except in Japan and Canada, where we have entered into exclusive license, supply and development relationships with our partners. With respect to elacestrant, Berlin-Chemie holds worldwide commercialization rights.
Our Strategy
To achieve our corporate and strategic goals, we plan to:
•Expand use of TYMLOS and abaloparatide-SC. We remain focused on growing our U.S.-based sales through a refined focus on patients with a high risk of fracture. In December 2021, we announced the removal of the boxed warning regarding the risk of osteosarcoma from the TYMLOS label. We intend to continue to expand our global abaloparatide footprint, including through our collaboration with Teijin Limited (“Teijin”) in Japan. 
•Expand abaloparatide's market potential through continued research, development and regulatory initiatives. We announced top-line data from the ATOM Trial in October 2021 and expect to file a supplemental New Drug Application (“NDA”) with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) ”) for abaloparatide for use in males with osteoporosis during the first quarter of 2022. We may continue to pursue additional formulations of and indications for abaloparatide, as well as any and all improvements to the TYMLOS product that we may identify in the future. 
•Develop RAD011 in our initial target indication, Prader-Willi Syndrome, as well as other indications we may identify in the future. Based on feedback from a Type C meeting with the FDA in June 2021, we intend to initiate a potentially pivotal study of RAD011 in the first half of 2022. This Synthetic Cannabidiol Oral Solution 015 study will be a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled seamless Phase 2/3 trial (the “SCOUT-015 Trial”) designed to support a (505(b)(2) NDA submission to the FDA for RAD011 for the treatment of hyperphagia in patients with PWS. Our efforts to identify additional indications for RAD011 are ongoing, and we expect to identify additional indications in 2022. 
•Continue to expand our product portfolio.  We may consider opportunistically expanding our product portfolio within these areas through in-licensing, acquisitions or partnerships.
Abaloparatide
We have developed or targeted two formulations of abaloparatide: abaloparatide-SC and abaloparatide-TD.
Abaloparatide-SC
In April 2017, the FDA approved TYMLOS for the treatment of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture defined as history of osteoporotic fracture, multiple risk factors for fracture, or patients who have failed or are intolerant to other available osteoporosis therapy. The first commercial sales of TYMLOS in the United States occurred in May 2017 and as of January 1, 2022, TYMLOS was available and covered for approximately 288 million U.S. insured lives, representing approximately 99% of U.S. Commercial and 74% of Medicare Part D insured lives. 
We are commercializing TYMLOS in the United States through our internal commercial organization. We hold worldwide commercialization rights to abaloparatide-SC, except for Japan and Canada, where we are entitled to receive milestones and royalties based on the development and commercialization of abaloparatide-SC under our license and development agreements.
In July 2017, we entered into a license and development agreement with Teijin for abaloparatide-SC in Japan. In May 2020, we announced that Teijin submitted an NDA for abaloparatide-SC in Japan for the treatment of osteoporosis in patients who are at high risk for fracture and in March 2021, we announced the approval in Japan of Ostabalo® abaloparatide acetate for the treatment of osteoporosis and promotion of bone formation in both female and male patients with high risk of fracture in Japan. Pursuant to the agreement, we have received an upfront payment and a regulatory milestone upon the approval of Ostabalo. We may receive additional milestone payments upon the achievement of certain sales milestones, and a fixed low double-digit royalty based on net sales of abaloparatide-SC in Japan during the royalty term. In February 2020, we elected not to exercise our option to negotiate for a co-promotion agreement with Teijin for abaloparatide-SC in Japan. 
In October 2021, we announced positive top-line results of our ATOM Trial. This study met its primary endpoint of change in lumbar spine bone mineral density (“BMD”) at 12 months compared to placebo, demonstrating statistical significance after 12 months. It also met secondary endpoints of change in lumbar spine BMD at 6 months compared to placebo, change in total hip BMD at 12 months compared to placebo, and change in femoral neck BMD at 12 months compared to placebo. We expect that these results will form the basis of a supplemental NDA seeking to expand the use of TYMLOS to increase bone mass in men with osteoporosis at high risk for fracture. The ATOM Trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial that has enrolled 228 men with osteoporosis. The primary endpoint is change in lumbar spine BMD at 12 months compared with placebo. In previous clinical trials, TYMLOS has demonstrated increases in BMD in postmenopausal women. The ATOM Trial includes specialized high-resolution imaging to examine the effect of abaloparatide on bone structure, such as the hip, in a subset of the study participants.
Abaloparatide-TD
In December 2021, we announced Phase 3 top-line results from the wearABLe Trial, which evaluated the non-inferiority of abaloparatide-TD as compared to TYMLOS. The trial did not meet its primary endpoint, as patients treated with abaloparatide-TD demonstrated an increase of 7.1% in lumbar spine BMD versus an increase of 10.9% for those treated with TYMLOS. The wearABLe Trial similarly did not meet its secondary endpoint. The wearABLe study was a single, pivotal, randomized, open label, active-controlled, BMD non-inferiority bridging study with an enrollment of approximately 500 patients with postmenopausal osteoporosis at high risk of fracture.
We, along with our partner, Kindeva, continue to evaluate all strategic options for the abaloparatide-TD program.
RAD011
We are also developing RAD011 with PWS as our initial target indication. We acquired RAD011 from Fresh Cut Development, LLC and Benuvia Therapeutics Inc. in December 2020. Prior to the Company’s acquisition of RAD011 in December 2020, it was granted fast track designation by the FDA in 2017 and orphan drug designation in August 2020 for the treatment of hyperphagia behavior and weight loss in patients with PWS. In June 2021, we participated in a Type C meeting with the FDA and, based on feedback from that meeting, intend to initiate the SCOUT Trial in the first half of 2022. The SCOUT-015 Trial will be a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled seamless Phase 2/3 trial designed to support a 505(b)(2) NDA submission for RAD011 for the treatment of hyperphagia in patients with PWS. 
Our Oncology Portfolio
Given our focus on growing our TYMLOS and abaloparatide-SC business, developing RAD011 and expanding our product portfolio, we evaluated all strategic options for our oncology assets in 2020. In July 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Berlin-Chemie for the exclusive license of elacestrant. 
In October 2021, we and Berlin-Chemie AG together announced positive top-line results from the EMERALD Trial of elacestrant. The EMERALD Trial was designed to evaluate elacestrant as a second or third-line monotherapy versus the standard of care for treatment of patients with estrogen receptor-positive (“ER+”) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative (“HER2-”) advanced or metastatic breast cancer. The study met both primary endpoints, demonstrating statistically significant progression-free survival in the overall population and in patients with tumors harboring estrogen receptor 1 (“ESR1”) mutations. Based on these results, we expect to proceed with applications for marketing approval in the United States and the European Union in collaboration with Berlin-Chemie. 
In 2020, we also sold RAD140, our internally discovered SARM, to Ellipses Pharma.
Manufacturing
We do not own or operate manufacturing facilities for the production of TYMLOS or any of our investigational product candidates, nor do we have plans to develop our own manufacturing operations in the foreseeable future.
Abaloparatide, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) for both TYMLOS and abaloparatide-TD, is manufactured for us on a contract basis by Polypeptide Laboratories Holding (PPL) AB (“PPL”) using a solid phase peptide synthesis assembly process, and purification by high pressure liquid chromatography. Abaloparatide for TYMLOS is supplied as a liquid in a multi-dose cartridge for use in a pen delivery device. The components of the TYMLOS pen delivery device are manufactured by Ypsomed AG (“Ypsomed”). The multi-dose cartridges and pen delivery device are filled, assembled and packaged by Vetter International GmbH (“Vetter”).
Abaloparatide-TD drug product is manufactured by Kindeva, based on their patented microneedle technology to administer drugs through the skin, as an alternative to subcutaneous injection.
Manufacturing is subject to extensive regulations that impose various procedural and documentation requirements, which govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture, processing, packing and holding of drugs. FDA and International Conference on Harmonisation (“ICH”) current Good Manufacturing Practice (“cGMP”) requirements include those pertaining to record keeping, manufacturing processes and controls, personnel, quality control and quality assurance, among others. Our contract manufacturing organizations are required to manufacture TYMLOS and our investigational product candidates under cGMP conditions. cGMP is a regulatory standard for the production of human pharmaceuticals that imposes extensive substantive, procedural and record keeping requirements on the manufacturing processes, testing methodology, and associated production and testing facilities.
Intellectual Property 
We strive to protect the proprietary technology that we believe is important to our business, including seeking and maintaining patents intended to cover our investigational product candidates and compositions, their methods of use and processes for their manufacture and any other inventions that are commercially important to the development of our business. We also rely on trade secrets to protect aspects of our business that are not amenable to, or that we do not consider appropriate for, patent protection.
Our success will significantly depend on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology and inventions and know-how related to our business, defend and enforce our patents, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. We also rely on know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our proprietary position.
Abaloparatide
We acquired and maintain exclusive worldwide rights, excluding development and commercialization rights for Japan and Canada, to certain patents, data and technical information related to abaloparatide through a license agreement with an affiliate of Ipsen Pharma SAS ("Ipsen").

Elacestrant (RAD1901)
In July 2020, we entered into a license agreement with Berlin-Chemie AG, a company of the Menarini Group (“Berlin-Chemie”), under which we granted Berlin-Chemie an exclusive license to develop and commercialize products containing elacestrant worldwide.
We exclusively licensed the worldwide rights to elacestrant from Eisai. U.S. Patent No. 7,612,114 (statutory term expires December 25, 2023 which may be extended up to August 18, 2026 with 967 days of patent term adjustment not taking into account any Hatch-Waxman patent term extensions) covers elacestrant as a composition of matter as well as the use of elacestrant for treatment of estrogen-dependent breast cancer. Corresponding patents issued in Australia, Canada, Japan, Poland, India, and Europe have a statutory expiration date in 2023, not taking into account extension under any applicable laws. We exclusively licensed US 9,421,264 (statutory term expires October 10, 2034) covering the treatment of ER+, SERM-resistant (such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant) breast cancer brain metastasis with elacestrant and related applications covering, more broadly, the use of elacestrant for the treatment of ER+ cancers, such as SERM-resistant ER+ breast cancer, now issued as U.S. Patent Nos. 10,420,734 and 10,071,066 (statutory term expires October 10, 2034). Patents that may issue from corresponding applications pending in Europe and Canada will have a statutory expiration date in 2035 if granted. Polymorphic forms of elacestrant are covered in U.S. Patent No. 10,385,008, U.S. Patent No. 10,745,343, and U.S. Patent No. 11,148,996 (statutory terms expire January 5, 2038, not taking into account any patent term extensions) and a companion PCT application US2018/012714 has a projected expiration date in 2038 in Australia, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, South Korea and Mexico, not taking into account any extension under any applicable laws. Elacestrant combination therapies with a CDK4/6 inhibitor (e.g., palbociclib) or an mTOR inhibitor (e.g., everolimus) for treatment of cancers that are drug-resistant and/or expressing mutant ER+ would be covered by patents that may issue from applications pending in the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe, Hong Kong, Israel, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, and Singapore (statutory expiration date in 2036, not taking into account any extension under any applicable laws).

The issued patents and pending applications that may issue from the pending applications will have statutory expiration dates of 2035, not taking into account extension under any applicable law. 
We also acquired worldwide rights to certain patent applications directed to methods of synthesizing CBD, nanocrystal compositions of CBD and self-emulsifying compositions of CBD. These applications are currently pending in the United States, Canada and Europe. These applications are licensed from Fresh Cut Development, LLC and Benuvia Therapeutics Inc. Any patents that might issue from these applications will have statutory expiration dates extending to 2040, not taking into account extension under any applicable laws.
Competition
The development and commercialization of new products to treat the targeted indications of our marketed and investigational product candidates faces competition from major pharmaceutical, biotechnology and specialty pharmaceutical companies that currently market and/or are seeking to develop products for similar indications. Many of our competitors have comparable resources to us, including financial, manufacturing, marketing, research and drug development resources. In addition, some of these companies have longer operating histories and more experience than us in preclinical and clinical development, manufacturing, regulatory and global commercialization, while others have less experience.
Abaloparatide
Osteoporosis drugs currently available in the United States include anti-resorptive agents, anabolic agents, and an agent that has both anabolic and anti-resorptive characteristics. Anti-resorptive agents including bisphosphonates, estrogen, SERMs and Amgen's Prolia are the most common treatments for osteoporosis. Teriparatide, marketed by Lilly under the name Forteo/Forsteo (outside the U.S.), is one of two other anabolic drug targeting the PTH receptor approved in the United States for the treatment of osteoporosis. In 2020, Pfenex, Inc., which was acquired by Ligand Inc., along with its commercialization partner Alvogen began marketing another teriparatide injection drug, Bonsity. We are aware of companies pursuing development in the United States of teriparatide through various regulatory pathways, including Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., under regulatory review and APOTEX, under regulatory review. We believe other companies may be in earlier stages of development of a generic version of teriparatide. Romosozumab, an anti-sclerostin monoclonal antibody for the treatment of osteoporosis, marketed by Amgen and UCB under the name Evenity, received marketing approval in Japan in January 2019, the United States in April 2019, and the European Union in December 2019. In addition, we may also face competition from companies that seek to market generic versions of TYMLOS through an abbreviated new drug (“ANDA”) application.
Other organizations are also working to develop new therapies to treat osteoporosis. For example, we are aware that Corium is developing a transdermal formulation of parathyroid hormone (“PTH”) (1-34) that is in Phase 2 clinical development and which, if approved, would compete with abaloparatide-TD, if approved.
RAD011
We expect to develop RAD011 for treatment of hyperphagia related to Prader-Willi syndrome. While there is no treatment for Prader-Willi syndrome (“PWS”) currently approved in the United States, there have been select competitive molecules in development, including intranasal carbetocin for the treatment of hyperphagia and behavior associated with PWS, by Levo Therapeutics Inc.; intranasal oxytocin for the treatment of hyperphagia in PWS by Montefiore Medical Center; cannabidivarin for treatment of irritability, restricted/repetitive behaviors, hyperphagia in PWS, by GW Pharmaceuticals plc; CSTI-500 for the treatment of hyperphagia in PWS, by ConSynance Therapeutics Inc.; HM04 for the treatment of hyperphagia in PWS, by  Helsinn Group; GDD3898 for the treatment of etabolic conditions associated with PWS, by Lipidio Pharmaceuticals Inc.; NS200 to suppress food intake and mood disorders in PWS, by Neuracle Science; OPN-300 for the treatment of PWS, by OptiNose Inc.; RM-853 for the treatment of PWS, by Rhythm Pharmaceuticals; and Tesomet for the treatment of hyperphagia in PWS, by Saniona AB.
We cannot assure you that any of our current investigational product candidates, if successfully developed and approved, will be able to compete effectively against these, or any other competing therapeutics that may become available on the market.
Collaborations and License Agreements
Kindeva
The Company is a party to a Scale-Up and Commercial Supply Agreement (the “Supply Agreement”) with Kindeva Drug Delivery (“Kindeva”), as successor to 3M Company and 3M Innovative Properties Company (collectively with 3M Company, “3M”), pursuant to which Kindeva has agreed to exclusively manufacture Phase 3 and global commercial supplies of an abaloparatide-coated transdermal system (“abaloparatide-TD”). Under the Supply Agreement, Kindeva will manufacture abaloparatide-TD for the Company according to agreed-upon specifications in sufficient quantities to meet the Company’s projected supply requirements. If abaloparatide-TD is commercialized, Kindeva would manufacture commercial supplies of abaloparatide-TD at unit prices that decrease with an increase in the quantity the Company orders. The Company would pay Kindeva a mid-to-low single-digit royalty on worldwide net sales of abaloparatide-TD and reimburse Kindeva for certain capital expenditures incurred to establish a commercial supply of abaloparatide-TD. The Company is responsible for providing, at its expense, supplies of abaloparatide drug substance to be used in manufacturing abaloparatide-TD. During the term of the Supply Agreement, Kindeva and the Company have agreed to work exclusively with each other with respect to the delivery of abaloparatide, parathyroid hormone (“PTH”), and/or PTH related proteins via active transdermal, intradermal, or microneedle technology. 
The initial term of the Supply Agreement began on its effective date, February 27, 2018, and will continue for five years after the first commercial sale of abaloparatide-TD. The Supply Agreement then automatically renews for successive three-year terms, unless earlier terminated pursuant to its terms or upon either party’s notice of termination to the other 24 months prior to the end of the then-current term. The Supply Agreement may be terminated by either party upon an uncured material breach of its terms by the other party, or due to the other party’s bankruptcy, insolvency, or dissolution. The Company may terminate the Supply Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including for certain clinical, technical, or commercial reasons impacting abaloparatide-TD, if it is unable to obtain U.S. regulatory approval for abaloparatide-TD within a certain time period, or if it ceases development or commercialization of abaloparatide-TD. Kindeva may terminate the Supply Agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, including if there are certain safety issues related to abaloparatide-TD, if the Company is unable to obtain U.S. regulatory approval for abaloparatide-TD within a certain time period, or if the Company fails to order abaloparatide-TD for a certain period of time after commercial launch of abaloparatide-TD in the U.S. Upon certain events of termination, Kindeva is required to transfer the manufacturing processes for abaloparatide-TD to the Company or a mutually agreeable third party and continue supplying abaloparatide-TD for a period of time pursuant to the Company’s projected supply requirements. 
In October 2018, the Company committed to fund 3M’s purchase of capital equipment totaling approximately $9.6 million in preparation for manufacturing Phase 3 and potential commercial supplies of abaloparatide-TD. Milestone payments for the equipment commenced in the fourth quarter of 2018 and are expected to be paid in full in the first quarter of 2022. In addition, there are cancellable purchase commitments in place to fund the facility build out and future purchases of capital equipment. The Company has paid 3M and Kindeva approximately $63.0 million, in the aggregate, through December 31, 2021 with respect to performance under the Supply Agreement, including the purchase of capital equipment. In addition, there are cancellable purchase commitments in place to fund certain facility build out and future purchases of capital equipment. In addition, there are cancellable purchase commitments in place to fund certain facility build out and future purchases of capital equipment.
Ipsen Pharma
In September 2005, the Company entered into a license agreement (the “License Agreement”), as amended, with an affiliate of Ipsen Pharma SAS (“Ipsen”) under which the Company exclusively licensed certain Ipsen compound technology and related patents covering abaloparatide to research, develop, manufacture, and commercialize certain compounds and related products in all countries, except Japan and France (where the Company’s commercialization rights were subject to certain co-marketing and co-promotion rights exercisable by Ipsen, provided that certain conditions included in the License Agreement were met). The Company believes that Ipsen’s co-marketing and co-promotion rights in France have permanently expired. Ipsen also granted the Company an exclusive right and license under the Ipsen compound technology and related patents to make, and have made, compounds or products in Japan. Ipsen further granted the Company an exclusive right and license under certain Ipsen formulation technology and related patents solely for purposes of enabling the Company to develop, manufacture, and commercialize compounds and products covered by the compound technology license in all countries, except Japan and France (as discussed above).
In consideration for these rights, to date, the Company has made nonrefundable, non-creditable payments in the aggregate of $13.0 million to Ipsen, including payment in recognition of certain milestones having been achieved through December 31, 2021. The License Agreement provides for further payments upon the achievement of certain future regulatory and commercial milestones. Total additional milestone payments that could be payable under the agreement are €24.0 million (approximately $29.5 million). In connection with the FDA’s approval of TYMLOS in April 2017, the Company paid Ipsen a milestone of €8.0 million (approximately $8.7 million on the date paid) under the License Agreement, which the Company recorded as an 
intangible asset within the consolidated balance sheet and will amortize over the remaining patent life or the estimated useful life of the underlying product. The License Agreement also provides that the Company is obligated to pay to Ipsen a fixed five percent royalty based on net sales of the products containing abaloparatide by the Company or its sublicensees on a country-by-country basis until the later of the last to expire of the licensed patents or for a period of 10 years after the first commercial sale in such country. The royalty expense was $10.9 million, $10.4 million and $8.7 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is included within cost of sales within the consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive loss. The date of the last to expire of the abaloparatide patents licensed from or co-owned with Ipsen, after patent term extension, is expected to be April 28, 2031.
If the Company sublicenses abaloparatide to a third party, then the agreement provides that the Company would pay Ipsen a percentage of certain payments received from such sublicensee (in lieu of milestone payments not achieved at the time of such sublicense). The applicable percentage is in the low double-digit range. In addition, if the Company or its sublicensees commercialize a product that includes a compound discovered by it based on or derived from confidential Ipsen know-how, then the License Agreement provides that the Company would pay to Ipsen a fixed low single-digit royalty on net sales of such product on a country-by-country basis until the later of the last to expire of the licensed patents that cover such product or for a period of 10 years after the first commercial sale of such product in such country.
The License Agreement expires on a country-by-country basis on the later of (1) the date the last remaining valid claim in the licensed patents expires in that country, or (2) a period of 10 years after the first commercial sale of the licensed products in such country, unless it is sooner terminated in accordance with its terms.
The License Agreement may be terminated by us with prior notice to Ipsen. The License Agreement may be terminated by Ipsen upon notice to us with immediate effect, if we, in any country of the world, bring an action or proceeding to challenge any Ipsen patent. The License Agreement can also be terminated by Ipsen if we fail to use reasonable commercial efforts to develop the licensed product for sale and commercialization in those countries within the territory where it is commercially reasonable to do so as contemplated by the License Agreement, or fail to use reasonable commercial efforts to perform our obligations under the latest revised version of the development plan approved by the joint steering committee, or fail to use reasonable commercial efforts to launch and sell one licensed product in those countries within the territory where it is commercially reasonable to do so. Either party may also terminate the License Agreement upon an uncured material breach by the other party. Ipsen may terminate the License Agreement if the License Agreement is assigned or sublicensed, if a third party acquires us, or if we acquire control over a PTH or a PTHrP compound that is in clinical development or is commercially available in the territory, and if following such assignment, sublicense, acquisition, or acquisition of control by us, such assignee, sublicensee, acquirer or we, fail to meet the timetable under the latest revised version of the development plan approved by the joint steering committee under the License Agreement.
Prior to executing the License Agreement for abaloparatide with Radius, Ipsen licensed the Japanese rights for abaloparatide to Teijin. 
Pursuant to a final decision in arbitration proceedings with Ipsen in connection with the License Agreement, the Company paid Ipsen $10.0 million (and pre-award interest of $0.8 million). Under the final decision, we are obligated to pay Ipsen a fixed mid-single-digit royalty based on net sales of abaloparatide in Japan. In March 2021, Teijin received approval for Ostabalo® abaloparatide acetate for the treatment of osteoporosis and for promotion of bone formation in both female and male patients with high risk fracture. As a result, the Company recognized a liability of $5.0 million which was recorded as accrued expenses and other current liabilities within the condensed consolidated balance sheet as of March 31, 2021.
The arbitration decision does not impact the Company’s rights under the License Agreement or its license agreement with Teijin for abaloparatide-SC in Japan, under which the Company previously received a $10.0 million upfront payment and is entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $40.0 million upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones, and a fixed low double-digit royalty based on net sales of abaloparatide-SC in Japan.
Teijin Limited
In July 2017, the Company entered into a license and development agreement (the “Teijin Agreement”) with Teijin Limited (“Teijin”) for abaloparatide-SC in Japan. 
Pursuant to the Teijin Agreement, the Company granted Teijin: (i) an exclusive payment-bearing license under certain of the Company’s intellectual property to develop and commercialize abaloparatide-SC in Japan, (ii) a non-exclusive payment-bearing license under certain of the Company’s intellectual property to manufacture abaloparatide-SC for commercial supply in Japan, (iii) a right of reference to certain of the Company’s regulatory data related to abaloparatide-SC for purposes of developing, manufacturing and commercializing abaloparatide-SC in Japan, (iv) a manufacture transfer package, upon Teijin’s request, consisting of information and the Company’s know-how that is necessary for the manufacture of active pharmaceutical ingredient and abaloparatide-SC, (v) a right to request that the Company manufacture (or arrange for a third party to 
manufacture) and supply (or arrange for a third party to supply) the active pharmaceutical ingredient for the clinical supply of abaloparatide-SC in sufficient quantities to enable Teijin to conduct its clinical trials in Japan, and (vi) a right to request that the Company arrange for Teijin to directly enter into commercial supply agreements with the Company’s existing contract manufacturers on the same pricing terms and on substantially similar commercial terms to those set forth in the Company’s existing agreements with such contract manufacturers. In consideration for these rights, the Company received an upfront payment of $10.0 million, and has received and may receive further payments upon the achievement of certain regulatory and sales milestones, as well as a fixed low double-digit royalty based on net sales of abaloparatide-SC in Japan during the royalty term, as defined below. In addition, the Company has an option to negotiate a co-promotion agreement with Teijin for abaloparatide-SC in Japan upon commercialization. In March 2021, Teijin received approval for Ostabalo® abaloparatide acetate for the treatment of osteoporosis and for promotion of bone formation in both female and male patients with high risk fracture. Upon achievement of this regulatory milestone, the Company received a payment of $10.0 million from Teijin. 
Pursuant to the Teijin Agreement, the parties may further collaborate on new indications for abaloparatide-SC, and the Company also maintains full global rights to its development program for abaloparatide-TD, which is not part of the Teijin Agreement.
Unless earlier terminated, the Teijin Agreement expires on the later of the (i) date on which the use, sale or importation of abaloparatide-SC is no longer covered by a valid claim under the Company’s patent rights licensed to Teijin in Japan, (ii) expiration of marketing or data exclusivity for abaloparatide-SC in Japan, or (iii) 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale of abaloparatide-SC in Japan.
Berlin-Chemie
In July 2020, the Company entered into a license agreement (“License Agreement”) with Berlin-Chemie under which the Company granted Berlin-Chemie an exclusive license to develop and commercialize products containing elacestrant (RAD1901) worldwide.
Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, Berlin-Chemie made a nonrefundable initial license fee payment to the Company of $30.0 million in July 2020. The Company is also eligible to receive up to $20.0 million in development and regulatory milestone payments and up to $300.0 million in sales milestone payments, with such payments contingent on the achievement of specified milestones with respect to the licensed products. The Company is also eligible to receive tiered royalties on sales of licensed products at percentages ranging from low to mid-teens, subject to certain reductions. Royalties on net sales will be payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest of the expiration date of the last to expire of the relevant patent rights, the expiration of regulatory exclusivity, or ten years from such first commercial sale.
The License Agreement will continue on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis until the last to expire royalty term. Either party may terminate the License Agreement for an uncured material breach by the other party or upon the bankruptcy or insolvency of the other party. The Company may terminate the License Agreement for certain patent challenges or if no development, manufacture or commercialization activity occurs in any given 24-month period. Berlin-Chemie may terminate the License Agreement at its discretion for any reason by delivering 180 days’ prior written notice to the Company; provided that such termination will not be effective prior to the third anniversary of the effective date.
The Company and Berlin-Chemie simultaneously entered into a Transition Services Agreement (the “TSA”), pursuant to which the Company agreed to perform certain services for Berlin-Chemie related to the EMERALD Phase 3 monotherapy study until the earlier of the completion of the contemplated services or the filing with the FDA of a New Drug Application for elacestrant. Pursuant to the TSA, Berlin-Chemie agreed to reimburse the Company for all out-of-pocket and full-time employee costs in performing the services, for total estimated reimbursements of $111.5 million. The Company will continue to incur research and development expenses in support of scale up costs under the TSA.
Supply and Manufacturing Agreements
In June 2016, we entered into a Supply Agreement with Ypsomed AG (“Ypsomed”), pursuant to which Ypsomed agreed to supply commercial and clinical supplies of a disposable pen injection device customized for subcutaneous injection of abaloparatide, the API for TYMLOS. We agreed to purchase a minimum number of devices at prices per device that decrease with an increase in quantity supplied. In addition, we made milestone payments for Ypsomed’s capital developments in connection with the initiation of the commercial supply of the device and paid a one-time capacity fee. All costs and payments under the agreement are delineated in Swiss Francs. The agreement has an initial term of three years which began on June 1, 2017, after which, it automatically renewed for a two-year term. Following its current term, the agreement automatically renews for additional two-year terms unless either party terminates the agreement upon 18 months’ notice prior to the end of the then-current term. During the two-year term beginning May 2020, we are required to purchase a minimum number of batches CHF 1.9 million ($2.0 million).
In June 2016, we entered into a Commercial Supply Agreement with Vetter Pharma International GmbH (“Vetter”), pursuant to which Vetter has agreed to formulate the finished abaloparatide-SC drug product, to fill cartridges with the drug product, to assemble the pen delivery device, and to package and label the pen for commercial distribution. We agreed to purchase the cartridges and pens in specified batch sizes at a price per unit. For labeling and packaging services, the Company has agreed to pay a per unit price dependent upon the number of pens loaded with cartridges that are labeled and packaged. These prices are subject to an annual price adjustment. The term of the agreement automatically renewed on January 1, 2021 for an additional two-year term and will automatically renew for additional two-year terms thereafter unless either party notifies the other party two years before the end of the then-current term that it does not intend to renew. 
In July 2016, we entered into a Manufacturing Services Agreement with Polypeptide Laboratories Holding AB (“PPL”), as successor-in-interest to Lonza Group Ltd., pursuant to which PPL has agreed to manufacture the commercial and clinical supplies of the API for abaloparatide. The Company has agreed to purchase the API in batches at a price per gram in euros, subject to an annual increase by PPL. The Company is also required to purchase a minimum number of batches annually, equal to €2.9 million ($3.2 million) per year and $17.2 million in total through the year ended December 31, 2022. The agreement has an initial term of a six years, after which, it automatically renews for three-year terms unless either party provides notice of non-renewal 24 months before the end of the then-current term.
Government Regulation
United States—FDA Product Approval Process
The research, development, testing, manufacture, labeling, promotion, marketing, advertising, and distribution, among other things, of our products and product candidates are extensively regulated by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA” or the “Agency”) regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and its implementing regulations. Failure to comply with the applicable United States requirements may subject us to administrative or judicial sanctions, such as FDA refusal to approve pending NDAs, imposition of clinical holds, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, and/or criminal prosecution. We have active investigational new drug (“IND”) applications for abaloparatide, elacestrant and RAD011 in the United States, with the goal of filing an NDA for each product candidate.
Approval Process—We are not permitted to market our product candidates in the United States until we receive FDA approval of an NDA. The steps required to be completed before a drug may be marketed in the United States include, among others:
•preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies, all performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND application for human clinical testing, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin and for which progress reports must be submitted annually to the FDA;
•approval by an independent institutional review board (“IRB”) or Ethics Committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
•adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials, conducted in accordance with applicable IND regulations, Good Clinical Practices (“GCP”), and other clinical trial related regulations, to establish the safety and efficacy of the drug for each proposed indication to FDA’s satisfaction;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA and payment of user fees for FDA review of the NDA (unless a fee waiver applies);
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of one or more clinical trial site(s) at which the drug was studied in a clinical trial(s) and/or of us as a clinical trial sponsor to assess compliance with GCP regulations;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the drug is produced to assess compliance with current GMPs regulations;
•agreement with FDA on the final labeling for the product and the design and implementation of any required Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (“REMS”); and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA, including satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable, based on a determination that the drug is safe and effective for the proposed indication(s).
Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity, and formulation, as well as animal studies. The conduct of the preclinical tests and formulation of the compounds for testing must comply with federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations. The results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, are submitted to the FDA as part of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. An IND application will automatically become effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions about issues such as the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND application, and places the clinical trial(s) on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND application sponsor and the FDA must resolve any 
outstanding FDA concerns or questions before clinical trials can proceed. We cannot be certain that submission of an IND application will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin.
Clinical trials necessary for product approval are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the Phases may overlap or be combined. The study protocol and informed consent information for study subjects in clinical trials must also be approved by an IRB for each institution where the trials will be conducted, and each IRB must monitor the study until completion. Study subjects must provide informed consent and sign an informed consent form before participating in a clinical trial. Clinical testing also must satisfy the extensive GCP regulations for, among other things, informed consent and privacy of individually identifiable information.
•Phase 1—Phase 1 clinical trials involve initial introduction of the study drug in a limited population of healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are typically designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the study drug in humans, evaluate the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence of effectiveness.
•Phase 2—Phase 2 clinical trials typically involve administration of the study drug to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
•Phase 3—Phase 3 clinical trials typically involve administration of the study drug to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the study drug and to provide an adequate basis for product approval. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of an NDA.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after receiving initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and are commonly intended to generate additional safety data regarding use of the product in a clinical setting. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA or, in certain circumstances, post-approval.
Information about certain clinical trials, including details of the protocol and eventually study results, also must be submitted within specific time frames to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on the Clinicaltrials.gov data registry.
The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review and accelerated approval, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development, and FDA’s review of drugs (e.g., approving an NDA on the basis of surrogate endpoints subject to post-approval trials). Generally, drugs that may be eligible for one or more of these programs are those intended to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs for those disease or conditions, and/or those that provide a meaningful benefit over existing treatments. For example, a sponsor may be granted FDA designation of a drug candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the drug candidate is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. If a drug is designated as breakthrough therapy, FDA will take actions to help expedite the development and review of such drug. Moreover, if a sponsor submits an NDA for a product intended to treat certain rare pediatric or tropical diseases or for use as a medical countermeasure for a material threat, and that meets other eligibility criteria, upon approval such sponsor may be granted a priority review voucher that can be used for a subsequent NDA. From time to time, we anticipate applying for such programs where we believe we meet the applicable FDA criteria. A company cannot be sure that any of its drugs will qualify for any of these programs, or even if a drug does qualify, that the review time will be reduced.
The results of the preclinical studies and of the clinical studies, together with other detailed information, including information on the manufacture and composition of the drug, are submitted to the FDA in the form of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more proposed indications. The testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources. Unless the applicant qualifies for an exemption, the filing of an NDA typically must be accompanied by a substantial “user fee” payment to the FDA. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the product in the proposed patient population to the satisfaction of the FDA. After an NDA is accepted for filing, the FDA substantively reviews the application and may deem it to 
be inadequate, and companies cannot be sure that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. The FDA may also refer the application to an appropriate advisory committee, typically a panel of clinicians, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved, but is not bound by the recommendations of the advisory committee.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA usually will inspect the facility or the facilities at which the drug is manufactured and determine whether the manufacturing and production and testing facilities are in compliance with cGMP regulations. The FDA also may audit the clinical trial sponsor and one or more sites at which clinical trials have been conducted to determine compliance with GCPs and data integrity. If the NDA and the manufacturing facilities are deemed acceptable by the FDA, it may issue an approval letter, and, if not, the Agency may issue a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”). An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for a specific indication(s). A CRL indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete and the application is not ready for approval. A CRL may require additional clinical data and/or an additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s), and/or other significant, expensive and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies or manufacturing. Even if such additional information is submitted, the FDA may ultimately decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. The FDA could also require, as a condition of NDA approval, post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the drug’s safety or efficacy or impose other conditions, or a REMS that may include both special labeling and controls, known as Elements to Assure Safe Use, on the distribution, prescribing, dispensing and use of a drug product. Once issued, the FDA may withdraw product approval if, among other things, ongoing regulatory requirements are not met, certain defects exist in the NDA, or safety or efficacy problems occur after the product reaches the market.
After approval, certain changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, making certain manufacturing changes or making certain additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval. Before a company can market products for additional indications, it must obtain an approval from the FDA for each indication. Obtaining approval for a new indication generally requires that additional clinical studies be conducted. A company cannot be sure that any additional approval for new indications for any product will be approved on a timely basis, or at all. In addition, FDA may require certain labeling changes based on its receipt of new safety or efficacy information, such as additional warnings and information on reduced effectiveness.
Post-Approval Requirements— Even after a drug has been approved by the FDA, the FDA may impose certain post-approval requirements, including the conduct of additional clinical studies. If such post-approval conditions are not satisfied, the FDA may withdraw its approval of the drug. In addition, holders of an approved NDA are required to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements governing manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of adverse events and other post-market information. These requirements include registration with the FDA, as well as continued compliance with current GCP regulations for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with GMP requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents. Future FDA inspections may identify compliance issues at the facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution or require substantial resources to correct. In addition, discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, including recall or withdrawal of the product from the market, labeling changes, imposition of REMS, or the requirement to conduct additional studies.
Hatch-Waxman Act—Under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, also known as the Hatch-Waxman Act, Congress created an abbreviated FDA review process for generic versions of pioneer (brand name) drug products under section 505(j) of the FDCA. Section 505(j) provides for approval of an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) that contains information to show that the proposed product is identical in active ingredient, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, quality, performance characteristics, and intended use, among other things, to a previously approved drug (commonly known as the reference drug). In considering whether to approve such a generic drug product, the FDA requires that an ANDA applicant demonstrate, among other things, that the proposed generic drug product’s active ingredient is the same as that of the reference product, that the proposed generic is bioequivalent to the reference product, that any impurities in the proposed product do not affect the product’s safety or effectiveness, and that its manufacturing processes and methods ensure the consistent potency and purity of its proposed product.
The Hatch-Waxman Act provides five years of data exclusivity for new chemical entities (“NCE”) referred to as NCE exclusivity, which generally (except as discussed below) prevents the FDA from accepting ANDAs containing the protected active ingredient or active moiety for five years after initial approval of the NCE. A drug is a NCE if the FDA has not previously approved an NDA for another drug that contains the same active moiety, which FDA defines to mean the molecule or ion (excluding certain specified appended portions) responsible for the physiological or pharmacological action of the drug substance. TYMLOS qualified as an NCE, thus received five years of NCE exclusivity following the FDA’s approval in April 
2017. Under FDA’s “umbrella policy,” NCE exclusivity protects all drug products that contain the qualifying NCE, so if, for example, abaloparatide-TD is approved prior to the expiration to the NCE exclusivity granted to TYMLOS, we would expect abaloparatide-TD to be protected by any remaining NCE exclusivity period.
Additionally, the Hatch-Waxman Act requires NDA applicants and NDA holders to submit certain information about patents related to their drugs for listing in the FDA’s list of Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (commonly known as the Orange Book).
European Union—Product Approval Process
In the European Union (“EU”), medicinal products are subject to a variety of EU and EU Member States regulations governing clinical trials, commercial sales, and distribution. Pharmaceutical companies are required to obtain marketing authorization in the EU before they can market their medicinal products. The EU has adopted Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, which replaced the prior Directive 2001/20/EC and introduces a complete overhaul of the existing regulation of clinical trials for medicinal products in the EU, including a new coordinated procedure for authorization of clinical trials that is reminiscent of the mutual recognition procedure for marketing authorization of medicinal products, and increased obligations on sponsors to publish clinical trial results. The Clinical Trials Regulation came into effect in each EU Member State on January 31, 2022.
In the EU, medicinal products are authorized following a similar demanding process as that required in the United States and applications for marketing authorization must be submitted based on the ICH Common Technical Document format. The applicable legislation in the EU also requires applicants to either conduct clinical trials in a pediatric population in accordance with a Pediatric Investigation Plan (“PIP”) approved by the Pediatric Committee of the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) or to obtain a waiver or deferral from the conduct of these studies by this Committee. In the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (comprising 27 EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), medicines can be authorized by using either the centralized authorization procedure or national authorization procedures, albeit through the decentralized or mutual recognition procedure to gain access to two or more EEA Member States. The marketing authorization process is essentially the same in both types of procedures and its maximum duration is 210 days, excluding clock-stops.
Centralized procedure—Under the centralized procedure governed by Regulation (EC) 726/2004, a single marketing authorization application is submitted to the EMA for its scientific evaluation of the safety, quality and efficacy. The CHMP then carries out a scientific assessment of the application and issues an opinion on the approvability of the medicine. Following adoption of the CHMP’s opinion, the European Commission, as the EU licensing authority, will adopt a legally binding decision on granting of a centralized marketing authorization which is valid across the EU and through the EEA Agreement, the Member States of the EEA. The centralized procedure is mandatory for human medicines derived from certain biotechnology processes, advanced therapy medicinal products (such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy and tissue engineered products), medicines containing a new active substance falling within the mandatory centralized procedure such as those which are indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, or neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and other immune dysfunctions, viral diseases, and orphan-designated medicines. The centralized procedure is optional for applicants seeking marketing authorizations for medicines which contain a new active substance which is not authorized in the EEA. Alternatively, a medicine which is shown to constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation, or if its authorization via the centralized procedure would be in the interest of public health in the EEA would be considered as eligible for centralized assessment. Accelerated evaluation may be sought by an applicant and granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases in relation to medicinal products that are expected to be of a “major public health interest” provided that three cumulative criteria are fulfilled. These relate to the seriousness of the disease; the absence or insufficiency of an appropriate alternative therapeutic approach; and the anticipated high therapeutic benefit of the medicinal product. CHMP delivers its opinion within 150 days in the framework of accelerated procedures.
National authorization procedure—Pure national authorization procedure is applicable where the applicant intends to market the product only in one Member State. However, if an applicant intends to market the product in two or more Member States, there are two other possible regulatory procedures for products that fall outside the scope of the mandatory or the optional centralized procedure:
•Decentralized procedure.  Where a medicinal product has not been authorized anywhere in the EEA and the product does not fall within the mandatory centralized procedure, an applicant may request a Member State to act as the Reference Member State to lead the assessment of the marketing authorization for it to be considered by the selected number of Member States which are concerned by the procedure. A positive decision adopted during the decentralized procedure will result in national marketing authorizations being granted by the Reference and Concerned Member States. Concerned Member States may refuse to approve the assessment made by the Reference Member State only on the basis of a potential serious risk to public health. In these circumstances, the disputed elements are be referred to the Heads of Medicines Agencies (“CMDh”) for review. This review, which 
may also be escalated to the CHMP in case of disagreement in CMDh would result in a decision by the European Commission. This decision is binding on all EU Member States.
•Mutual recognition procedure.  Where the medicinal product has been authorized in an EU Member State, the applicant can request the Member State to act as the Reference Member State for the national marketing authorization to be recognized progressively in the other Concerned Member States.
Under both decentralized and mutual recognition procedures, the Reference Member State leads the assessment for it to be recognized by the national authorities in Member States concerned by the procedure. A satisfactory conclusion of a procedure will result in granting of a national marketing authorization. 
Marketing authorizations granted in the EU are initially valid for five years and can be subsequently renewed and remain valid for an unlimited period unless the national competent authorities of the EU Member State or the European Commission decides on justified grounds to proceed with one additional five-year renewal period. The renewal of a marketing authorization is subject to a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance of the product by the national competent authorities of the EU Member State or the EMA.
Good manufacturing practices—Like the FDA, the EMA, the competent authorities of the EU Member States and other regulatory agencies regulate and inspect equipment, facilities and processes used in the manufacture of pharmaceutical and biologic products. Prior to the CHMP adopting an opinion with respect to approvability of an application for marketing authorization, the EMA, acting upon the advice of the CHMP, may decide to coordinate an inspection to be undertaken by the designated EU Supervising Authority of the proposed manufacturing site to verify the manufacturer’s compliance with EU GMP principles and guidelines or to investigate a specific GMP-related matter that may arise from the assessment of the application. If there is a material change in manufacturing equipment, location, or process, affecting the quality of the product, additional regulatory review and approval may be required from the relevant competent regulatory authority. Once we or our partners commercialize products, we will be required to comply with GMP with regard to manufacture and control, and product-specific requirements according to the terms of the marketing authorization. Also, like the FDA, the EMA (as a coordinating body for centrally authorized medicinal products), the competent authorities of the EU Member States and other regulatory agencies also conduct regular, periodic visits to re-inspect equipment, facilities, and processes following the initial approval of a product. If it is determined that the equipment, facilities, or processes used to manufacture our product do not comply with applicable regulations and conditions of product approval, regulatory agencies may seek civil, criminal or administrative sanctions, or enforcement actions and/or remedies against the manufacturer holding the requisite manufacturing authorization and us, including the suspension of our manufacturing operations or the withdrawal of our product from the market, which in turn could potentially result in the suspension or withdrawal of the related marketing authorization for the medicinal product.
Data and market exclusivity—Similar to the United States, there is a process for approval of generic versions of innovator drug products in the EU. Abridged applications for the authorization of generic versions of drugs authorized centrally by the European Commission can be submitted to the EMA through the centralized procedure referencing the innovator’s non-clinical and clinical data to support generic approval provided always that the following conditions are met: the generic product has the same qualitative and quantitative composition in the active substances and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference innovator drug product and the generic product is shown to be bioequivalent to the reference product.
Medicinal products authorized in the EU on the basis of a full marketing authorization application (as opposed to an application for marketing authorization that relies on data available in the marketing authorization dossier for another, previously approved, medicinal product) and not falling within the scope of the so-called “global marketing authorization” will benefit from eight years of data protection within which the generic applicant cannot rely on the non-clinical and clinical data contained in the dossier of the reference product to support product approval, and two years of market protection within which the generic applicant is not permitted to place the generic product on the market even if it is approved. This period of data and market protection can be extended to a maximum of eleven years if during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which during the scientific assessment prior to their authorization are held to bring a significant benefit in comparison with existing therapies. 
Other International Markets—Drug approval process
In some international markets (e.g., China or Japan), although data generated in U.S. or EU trials may be submitted in support of a marketing authorization application, additional clinical trials conducted in the host territory, or studying people of the ethnicity of the host territory, may be required prior to the filing or approval of marketing applications within the country.
Pricing and Reimbursement
In the United States and internationally, the commercial success of any products we market, or may market in the future, is dependent, in significant part, on the scope of coverage and amount of reimbursement from third-party payors such as government health programs and private health insurance. Third-party payors are increasingly focused on controlling the costs of drug products by managing utilization and reducing payments for drugs. Third party payor initiatives to do so include establishing formularies that limit coverage of drug products and create financial incentives for patients to use lower cost drugs (through implementation of differential cost-sharing) or requiring prescribing physicians to demonstrate medical necessity for a drug product for a particular patient before coverage will be authorized (prior authorization). Pharmaceutical manufacturers may be required by law or market conditions to provide discounts or rebates to third party payors or purchasers in order to ensure coverage or sales of drug products. Coverage and payment of drug products is subject to ongoing scrutiny and reform efforts. Future legislation or other action by government authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions could affect pricing, coverage and reimbursement for the products we market and may develop in the future. Any such legislation could impact, in a significant way, our ability to generate revenues from sales of products that, if successfully developed, we bring to market.
Within the United States, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from third-party payor to third-party payor. One third party payor’s decision to cover a particular drug product does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the drug product. As a result, the coverage determination process usually requires manufacturers to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of their products to each payor separately and can be a time consuming process. Additionally, obtaining coverage does not mean that reimbursement for covered drugs will be adequate. A significant proportion of patients eligible for TYMLOS are Medicare beneficiaries. Drugs like TYMLOS that are dispensed by pharmacies to patients for self-administration are potentially eligible for coverage under Medicare Part D. Medicare Part D is a voluntary program that offers prescription drug coverage through private plans to members enrolled with the plan. Medicare Part D coverage may vary from plan to plan and the plans may implement formularies and certain utilization management activities as well as negotiate rebates with pharmaceutical manufacturers to manage access and costs. Manufacturers must also provide discounts on Medicare Part D brand name prescription drugs sold to Medicare beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D coverage gap (i.e., the so called “donut hole”).
Decisions on pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in the European Union are based upon national rules subject to the control of the Transparency Directive, (Council Directive 89/105/EEC) which aims to ensure the transparency of measures established by EU countries to control the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products. It defines a series of procedural requirements designed to verify that national pricing and reimbursement decisions do not create obstacles to the pharmaceutical trade within the EU’s Internal Market. The competent authorities of each of the 27 EU Member States have adopted individual national measures aimed at regulating the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products in their territory. These measures often vary widely in nature, scope and application. However, a major element that they have in common is an increased move toward reduction in the reimbursement price of medicinal products, a reduction in the number and type of products selected for reimbursement, and an increased preference for generic products over innovative products. These efforts have mostly been executed through these countries’ existing price-control methodologies, including price cuts, mandatory rebates, value-based pricing, and reference pricing (i.e., referencing prices in other countries and using those reference prices to set a price). It is increasingly common in many EU Member States for Marketing Authorization Holders to be required, in order to get support for reimbursement under national health schemes and, therefore, access to the market, to demonstrate the cost effectiveness or otherwise added value benefit of their products as compared to products (which are considered as standard of care) already subject to pricing and reimbursement in specific countries. In order for drugs to be evaluated positively under such criteria, pharmaceutical companies may need to re-examine, and consider altering, a number of traditional functions relating to the selection, study, and management of drugs, whether currently marketed, under development, or being evaluated as candidates for research and/or development.
Many EU Member States review periodically their decisions concerning the pricing and reimbursement of medicinal products. The outcome of this review cannot be predicted and it could have an adverse effect on the pricing and reimbursement of our medicinal products in the EU Member States. Potential reductions in prices and changes in reimbursement levels could be the result of different factors, including reference pricing systems, parallel distribution and parallel trade. It could also result from the application of external reference pricing mechanisms, which consist of arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced countries. Reductions in the pricing of our medicinal products in one EU Member State could affect the price in other EU Member States and, thus, have a negative impact on our financial results. 
Health Technology Assessment (“HTA”) of medicinal products in the EU is an essential element of the pricing and reimbursement decision-making process in a number of EU Member States. This includes most of the big markets in the EU, such as France, Germany and Sweden. HTA is currently mainly governed by the national laws of the EU Member States. The HTA authorities of the EU Member States assess the public health impact, therapeutic benefit and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare system of the individual country. The outcome of HTA has a direct impact on the pricing and reimbursement status granted to the medicinal product. The extent of this impact varies 
between the EU Member States. Moreover, a negative HTA by a leading and recognized HTA body concerning a medicinal product could undermine the prospects to obtain reimbursement for such product not only in the EU Member State in which the negative assessment was issued, but also in other EU Member States.
In 2011, Directive 2011/24/EU was adopted at the EU level. This Directive establishes a voluntary network of national authorities or bodies responsible for HTA in the individual EU Member States. The network facilitates and supports the exchange of scientific information concerning HTAs. Further to this, on January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on HTA. This legislative proposal is intended to boost cooperation among EU Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at the EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. The European Commission has stated that the role of the draft HTA regulation is not to influence pricing and reimbursement decisions in the individual EU Member States. However, this consequence cannot be excluded.
Future legislation, including proposals being considered at the federal and state level in the United States and at the national level in EU Member States, or regulatory actions implementing recent or future legislation may have a significant effect on our business. Our ability to successfully commercialize products depends in part on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement for the costs of our products and related treatments will be available in the United States and worldwide from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Substantial uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products by third-party payors. In addition, negotiating prices with government authorities under current and proposed legislation can delay the commercialization of our product candidates.
Sales and Marketing
The FDA regulates all advertising and promotion activities for products under its jurisdiction both prior to and after approval. If a product is approved, we must also comply with post-marketing requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with advertising and promotion requirements, which include restrictions on promoting products for unapproved uses or patient populations (known as ‘‘off-label use’’), monitoring and record-keeping activities, reporting of adverse events, product sampling and distribution restrictions, and limitations on industry sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available products for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Promotional materials for approved drugs must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use or first publication. If there are any modifications to the product, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, we may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or an NDA supplement, which may require us to develop additional data or conduct additional pre-clinical studies and clinical trials.
Within the United States, we are subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry, including anti-kickback and false claims laws. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, and/or exclusion from federal health care programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Federal and state authorities are paying increased attention to enforcement of these laws within the pharmaceutical industry, and private individuals have been active in alleging violations of the laws and bringing suits on behalf of the government under the federal civil False Claims Act (“FCA”). Violations of these laws can result in imprisonment, criminal fines, penalties or exclusion from participation in government health care programs. Given the broad scope of these laws, our activities could be subject to scrutiny under the laws. If we were subject to allegations concerning, or were convicted of violating, these laws, our business could be harmed. 
The federal anti-kickback statute generally prohibits, among other things, a pharmaceutical manufacturer from directly or indirectly soliciting, offering, receiving, or paying any remuneration in cash or in kind where one purpose is either to induce the referral of an individual for, or the purchase or prescription of, a particular drug that is payable by a federal health care program. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or a specific intent to violate the statute. A claim arising from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute also constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the FCA. 
Federal and state false claims laws generally prohibit anyone from knowingly and willfully, among other activities, presenting, or causing to be presented for payment to third party payors (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for drugs or services that are false or fraudulent (which may include claims for services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary services). There is also a criminal FCA statute by which individuals or entities that submit false claims can face criminal penalties. In addition, under the federal civil monetary penalty law, the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General has the authority to exclude from participation in federal health care programs or to impose civil penalties against any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, certain false or otherwise improper claims. A federal healthcare fraud statute prohibits the knowing and willful execution, or attempt to execute, a 
scheme to defraud a health care benefit program, including private health plans, or obtain, through false or fraudulent pretenses, money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, such a health care benefit program.
The majority of states also have anti-kickback, false claims, and similar fraud and abuse laws and although the specific provisions of these laws vary, their scope is generally broad, and there may not be regulations, guidance or court decisions that apply the laws to particular industry practices. 
Laws and regulations have also been enacted by the federal government and various states to regulate the sales and marketing practices of pharmaceutical manufacturers. The laws and regulations generally limit financial interactions between manufacturers and health care providers; require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government; and/or require disclosure to the government and/or public of financial interactions (so-called “sunshine laws”). State laws may also require disclosure of pharmaceutical pricing information and marketing expenditures. Manufacturers must also submit information to the FDA on the identity and quantity of drug samples requested and distributed by a manufacturer during each year. Many of these laws and regulations contain ambiguous requirements or require administrative guidance for implementation. Given the lack of clarity in laws and their implementation, our activities could be subject to the penalty provisions of the pertinent federal and state laws and regulations.
The advertising of medicinal products in the EU and the United Kingdom (“UK”) is subject to strict regulation set out in the EU, EU Member States’ and UK national laws, including, among others, the laws governing the promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. Promotional materials for medicinal products must comply with the Summary of Product Characteristics (“SmPC”) as approved by the competent authorities. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the medicinal product and forms an intrinsic and integral part of the related marketing authorization. Promotional materials that do not comply with the SmPC are considered to constitute off‑label promotion which is prohibited. The direct‑to‑consumer advertising of prescription‑only medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU and the UK. 
Interactions between pharmaceutical companies and physicians in the EU and the UK are subject to strict laws, regulations, industry self‑regulation codes of conduct and physicians’ codes of professional conduct in the individual EU Member States and the UK, including the anti-corruption laws. These rules prohibit the provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medicinal products. 
In the UK, the Bribery Act 2010 applies to any company incorporated in or “carrying on business” in the UK, irrespective of where in the world the alleged bribery activity occurs and could have implications for company’s interactions with physicians in and outside the UK.
In addition, transfers of value to physicians in certain EU Member States and the UK must be publicly disclosed. Agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician’s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the individual EU Member States and the UK.
Prohibited promotion of medicinal products in the EU and the UK, prohibited interactions with healthcare professionals or failures to publicly disclose transfers of value to healthcare professionals in the EU and the UK could lead to restriction of the promotional activities conducted by a company and the imposition of administrative penalties, fines and imprisonment.
Similar rigid restrictions are imposed on the promotion and marketing of medicinal products in other countries. Laws (including those governing promotion, marketing and anti-kickback provisions), industry regulations and professional codes of conduct often are strictly enforced. Even in those countries where we are not directly responsible for the promotion and marketing of our products, inappropriate activity by our international distribution partners can have adverse implications for us.
Other Laws and Regulatory Processes
We are subject to a variety of financial disclosure and securities trading regulations as a public company in the United States, including laws relating to the oversight activities of the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) and the regulations of the Nasdaq Global Market or any national securities exchange on which our capital stock may be traded. In addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) the SEC and other bodies that have jurisdiction over the form and content of our accounts, our consolidated financial statements and other public disclosure are constantly discussing and interpreting proposals and existing pronouncements designed to ensure that companies best display relevant and transparent information relating to their respective businesses.
Our international operations are subject to compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the “FCPA”) which prohibits corporations and individuals from paying, offering to pay, or authorizing the payment of anything of value to any 
foreign government official, government staff member, political party, or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity. We also may be implicated under the FCPA for activities by our partners, collaborators, clinical research organizations, vendors or other agents.
Our present and future business has been and will continue to be, subject to various other laws and regulations. Various laws, regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions, laboratory practices, the experimental use of animals, and the purchase, storage, movement, import and export and use and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our research work are or may be applicable to our activities. Certain agreements entered into by us involving exclusive license rights or acquisitions may be subject to national or supranational antitrust regulatory control, the effect of which cannot be predicted. The extent of government regulation, which might result from future legislation or administrative action, cannot accurately be predicted.
