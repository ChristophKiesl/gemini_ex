ITEM 1. BUSINESS 
The following discussion of our business contains “forward-looking statements,” as discussed in Part II, Item 7 below. Our business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks as set forth in Part I, Item 1A below. The following information should be read in conjunction with Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes and the Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
Overview
ServiceMaster Global Holdings, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiary partnerships, limited liability companies and corporations (collectively, “ServiceMaster,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our”) is a leading provider of essential services to residential and commercial customers in the termite, pest control, cleaning and restoration markets, operating through an extensive service network of company-owned Terminix branches, Terminix franchise and license agreements and ServiceMaster Brands company-owned locations and franchise and license agreements. Our mission is to simplify and improve the quality of our customers’ lives by delivering services that help them protect and maintain their homes or businesses, typically their most highly valued assets. Our portfolio of well-recognized brands includes AmeriSpec (home inspections), Copesan (commercial national accounts pest management), Furniture Medic (cabinet and furniture repair), Merry Maids (residential cleaning), Nomor (European pest control), ServiceMaster Clean (commercial cleaning), ServiceMaster Restore (restoration), Terminix (residential termite and pest control) and Terminix Commercial (commercial termite and pest control). Our strategy is to provide a differentiated service offering promoting convenient service through improving service levels and the customer experience. 
For the year ended December 31, 2019, we had revenue, net income and Adjusted EBITDA of $2,077 million, $128 million and $417 million, respectively. In 2019, Terminix, our largest segment, represented approximately 87 percent of our revenue, while ServiceMaster Brands represented approximately 12 percent of our revenue. The remaining one percent of our revenue is derived primarily from our European pest control operations which are included in Corporate and Other Operations. For a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA, see “Selected Financial Data.”
Approximately 97 percent of our 2019 revenue was generated by sales and services in the United States. A significant portion of our assets are located in the United States, and the consolidated book value of all assets located outside of the United States is not material. Organized in Delaware in 2007, ServiceMaster is the successor to various entities dating back to 1929. Financial information for each reportable segment and Corporate and Other Operations for 2019, 2018 and 2017 is contained in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
We believe that our customers understand the financial and reputational risks associated with inadequate maintenance of their homes or businesses and that our high-quality, professional services are low-cost expenditures when compared to the alternative of failing to perform essential maintenance. We strive to be the service provider of choice and believe our customers have recognized our value proposition, as evidenced by our long-standing customer relationships and the high rate at which our customers renew their contracts from year to year. 
We believe our significant size and scale provide a competitive advantage in our purchasing power, route density and marketing and operating efficiencies compared to smaller local and regional competitors. Our scale also facilitates the standardization of processes, shared learning and talent development across our entire organization.
We believe our businesses are strategically positioned to benefit from a number of favorable demographic and secular trends, including growth in population, household formation, new and existing home sales increasing regulation of commercial pest control services and increasing pest populations driven by the increasing temperatures of climate change. In addition, we believe there is increasing demand for outsourced services, fueled by a trend toward “do-it-for-me” as a result of an aging population and shifts in household structure and behaviors, such as dual-income families and consumers with “on-the-go” lifestyles. 
Exploring Strategic Alternatives for ServiceMaster Brands
On January 21, 2020, we announced we are exploring strategic alternatives relating to ServiceMaster Brands, including the potential sale of the business. The ServiceMaster Brands segment is reported in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in continuing operations. Beginning with our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2020, the ServiceMaster Brands segment will be classified as held for sale and reported in discontinued operations. 
Our financial statements will include non-recurring costs incurred to evaluate, plan and execute the exploration of strategic alternatives related to ServiceMaster Brands, including the potential sale of the business. Costs will primarily be related to third-party consulting and other incremental costs directly associated with the strategic alternatives process. Our results for the year ended December 31, 2019 included charges of less than $1 million related to the initiative. We expect to incur charges, which may be significant, in 2020 related to the initiative. In addition, we expect incremental capital expenditures will be required to effect the initiative, which may be significant, principally reflecting costs to replicate information technology systems historically shared by our business units.

 

CEO Transition
On January 21, 2020, Nikhil M. Varty, resigned from his position as Chief Executive Officer and as a member of our board of directors. Our board of directors appointed our current Chairman of the Board, Naren K. Gursahaney, as interim Chief Executive Officer until a replacement Chief Executive Officer is identified. While Mr. Gursahaney is in the interim Chief Executive Officer role Mark Tomkins will serve as Lead Independent Director.
Refinancing of Indebtedness
On November 5, 2019, we entered into a $600 million Term Loan B due 2026, as well as a $400 million revolving credit agreement due 2024. The proceeds of the transaction were used to repay approximately $171 million of debt outstanding under our previous Term Loan B due 2023, $120 million outstanding under our previous revolving credit agreement due 2021, as well as $150 million from a recent short-term borrowing entered on October 4, 2019. In conjunction with the debt refinancing, we entered into a seven year interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $550 million. During the term of the agreement, the effective interest rate on $550 million of the new Term Loan B is fixed at a rate of 3.365%.
Our Reportable Segments
Our current operations are organized into two reportable segments: Terminix (which includes Terminix, Terminix Commercial, Copesan and other pest control brands) and ServiceMaster Brands (which includes ServiceMaster Restore, ServiceMaster Clean, Merry Maids, Furniture Medic and AmeriSpec). Our European pest control operations are reported within Corporate and Other Operations, and primarily include the operations of Nomor Holdings AB (“Nomor”), a pest control company operating in Sweden and Norway.
Terminix
Terminix is a leading provider of residential and commercial termite and pest control services in the United States, specializing in protection against termite damage, rodents, insects and other pests, including cockroaches, spiders, wood-destroying ants, ticks, fleas, mosquitos and bed bugs. Our services include termite remediation, annual termite inspection and prevention treatments with termite damage repair guarantees, periodic pest control services, insulation services, crawlspace encapsulation and wildlife exclusion. 
For the year ended December 31, 2019, Terminix recorded revenue of $1,798 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $319 million, with revenue generated from services in the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018 as follows:

 | 2019 | | 2018
Residential Pest Control | 39 | % | | 39 | %
Commercial Pest Control | 22 | % | | 20 | %
Termite and Home Services | 32 | % | | 33 | %
Fumigation Services | 2 | % | | 3 | %
Other | 5 | % | | 5 | %

___________________________________
(1)On April 1, 2019, we divested the assets associated with our fumigation service line and now provide fumigation services to our customers through arrangements with third parties.
Approximately 80 percent of Terminix revenue comes from customers who enter into contracts with the option to renew annually. Typically, termite services require an initial inspection and the installation of a protective bait station or liquid barrier surrounding the home. Termite contracts can be either service contracts or protection plans. The protection plan contracts provide a guarantee for the repair of new damage resulting from termite infestation. After the first year, a customer has the option to renew the contract at a significantly reduced cost that extends the guarantee. Consequently, revenue generated from a renewal customer is less than revenue generated from a first-year termite customer.
We believe that the strength of the Terminix brand, along with our history of providing a high level of consistent service, allows us to enjoy a competitive advantage in attracting, retaining and growing our customer base. We believe our investments in systems and processes, such as our new contract with salesforce.com, inc. (“Salesforce”), as well as our routing and scheduling optimization, on-the-way notifications and mobile customer management solutions, and the national footprint in our commercial business enable us to deliver a higher level of customer service when compared to smaller regional and local competitors.
Our focus on attracting and retaining customers begins with our employees in the field, who interact with our customers every day and bring a strong level of passion and commitment to the Terminix brand. Our field organization is supported by dedicated customer care center personnel. Our culture of continuous improvement drives an intense focus on the quality of the services delivered, which we believe produces high levels of customer satisfaction and, ultimately, customer retention and referrals.
The Terminix national branch structure includes approximately 330 company-owned locations and approximately 100 franchise locations, which serve approximately 2.8 million customers in 47 states and the District of Columbia. Terminix’s approximately 10,500 employees made a daily average of over 50,000 visits to residential and commercial customer locations during 2019. Terminix also provides termite and/or pest control services through subsidiaries in Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and Central 

 
America, as well as through a joint venture in India. In addition, licensees of Terminix provide these services in Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, Central America and the Middle East. In 2019, substantially all Terminix revenue was generated in the United States, with approximately two percent derived from international markets. Terminix has a presence in a total of 22 countries outside the United States. Franchise fees from Terminix franchisees represented less than one percent of Terminix revenue in 2019. Customer-level revenue represents the total of our estimate of revenue generated by our franchisees, a portion of which is included in our reported revenue from royalty fees, and revenue generated by our company-owned operations, and is calculated as follows:


(in millions) | | 
Revenue | $ | 1,798
Royalty fees | | (11) 
Estimated sales generated by franchisees | | 372 
Customer-level revenue | $ | 2,159

In 2019, we completed 32 acquisitions at Terminix, including Assured Environments, Gregory Pest Solutions and McCloud Services at Terminix. We believe these acquisitions will enhance service and other capabilities, including increasing the breadth of our service offerings to strengthen our capabilities in commercial pest control.
Terminix Competitive Strengths
#1 recognized brand in U.S. termite and pest control services
Passionate and empowered employees focused on delivering superior customer service
Expansive scale and deep presence across a national footprint
Effective multi-channel customer acquisition strategy
History of innovation leadership and introducing new products and services
ServiceMaster Brands
ServiceMaster Brands consists of ServiceMaster Restore (restoration), ServiceMaster Clean (commercial cleaning), Merry Maids (residential cleaning), Furniture Medic (cabinet and furniture repair) and AmeriSpec (home inspection) businesses. Our businesses in this segment operate principally through franchisees. We serve our franchises and customers through a base of approximately 700 Company employees. Our franchisees are independent business owners, so they and their employees are not included in our employee count.
For the year ended December 31, 2019, ServiceMaster Brands recorded revenue of $257 million and Adjusted EBITDA of $92 million. In 2019, approximately 52 percent of our revenue in this segment consisted of ongoing monthly royalty fees. Royalty fees are the amounts paid to us by our franchisees and are based upon a percentage of our franchisees’ customer-level revenue. Customer-level revenue is calculated as follows:

(in millions) | | 
Revenue | $ | 257 
Royalty fees | | (133)
Estimated sales generated by franchisees | | 2,617
Customer-level revenue | $ | 2,741

We believe that each business holds a leading position in its respective category and that our scale and national presence create competitive advantages for us in attracting and retaining franchisees, commercial customers and insurance partners. We are able to invest in best-in-class systems, training and process development, provide multiple levels of marketing support and direct new business leads to our franchisees through our relationships with major insurance carriers and national account customers. ServiceMaster Brands serves both residential and commercial customers across all 50 states and the District of Columbia through approximately 4,600 franchise agreements, with additional locations in 13 other countries.
On January 21, 2020, we announced we are exploring strategic alternatives relating to ServiceMaster Brands, including the potential sale of the business. The ServiceMaster Brands segment is reported in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in continuing operations. Beginning with our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2020, the ServiceMaster Brands segment will be classified as held for sale and reported in discontinued operations. 
ServiceMaster Brands Competitive Strengths
Strong and trusted brands with leading positions in their respective categories
Infrastructure and scale supporting our ability to sell and service national accounts
Attractive value proposition to franchisees
Exceptional focus on customer service
National network and 24/7/365 service availability supports mission-critical nature of the ServiceMaster Restore business
Long-standing and strong relationships with 9 of the top 10 insurance carriers

 

American Home Shield Spin-off
On October 1, 2018, we completed the previously announced separation of our American Home Shield business (the “Separation”). The Separation was effectuated through a tax-free, pro rata dividend (the “Distribution”) to our stockholders of approximately 80.2 percent of the outstanding shares of common stock of frontdoor, inc. (“Frontdoor”), which was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company to hold our American Home Shield business. As a result of the Distribution, Frontdoor is an independent public company that trades on the Nasdaq Global Select Market under the symbol “FTDR.” The American Home Shield segment is reported in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in discontinued operations. See Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements for further information.
The Distribution was made to our stockholders of record as of the close of business on September 14, 2018 (the “Record Date”), and such stockholders received one share of Frontdoor common stock for every two shares of ServiceMaster common stock held as of the close of business on the Record Date. Subsequent to the Distribution, we retained 16,734,092 shares, or approximately 19.8 percent, of the common stock of Frontdoor immediately following the Distribution. 
On March 27, 2019, we completed a non-cash debt-for-equity exchange in which we exchanged the 16.7 million retained shares of Frontdoor common stock and proceeds from a short-term credit facility to extinguish $600 million of our indebtedness under the short-term credit facility. The sale of the Frontdoor common stock resulted in a realized gain of $40 million, which was recorded within (Gain) loss on investment in frontdoor, inc. on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income for the year ended December 31, 2019. 
Our Opportunity 
U.S. Termite and Pest Control Industry
The outsourced segment for residential and commercial termite and pest control services in the United States was approximately $9 billion in 2019, according to Specialty Consultants, LLC. We estimate that there are approximately 20,000 U.S. termite and pest control companies, nearly all of which have fewer than 100 employees.
Termites are responsible for an estimated $5 billion in home damage in the United States annually, according to the National Pest Management Association. The termite control industry provides treatment and inspection services to residential and commercial property owners for the remediation and prevention of termite infestations. We believe homeowners value quality and reliability over price in choosing professional termite control services, as the cost of most professional treatments is well below the potential cost of inaction or ineffective treatment. As a result, we believe the demand for termite remediation services is relatively insulated from changes in consumer spending. In addition to remediation services, the termite control industry offers periodic termite inspections and preventative treatments to residential and commercial property owners in areas with high termite activity, typically through annual contracts. These annual contracts carry guarantees that protect the property owner against the cost of structural damage caused by a termite infestation. Termites can cause significant damage to a structure before becoming visible to the untrained eye, highlighting the value proposition of professional preventative termite services. As a result, the termite control industry experiences high renewal rates on annual preventative inspection and treatment contracts and revenues from such contracts are generally stable and recurring.
Pest infestations may damage a home or business while also carrying the risk of the spread of diseases. Moreover, for many commercial facilities, pest control is essential to regular operations and regulatory compliance (e.g., hotels, restaurants and healthcare facilities). As a result of these dynamics, the pest control industry experiences high rates of renewal for its pest inspection and treatment contracts. Pest control services are often delivered on a contracted basis through regularly scheduled service visits, which include an inspection of premises and application of pest control materials. 
Both termite and pest activity are affected by weather. Termite activity increases during the spring and summer months, the intensity of which varies based on weather and is changing due to the effects of climate change. Similarly, pest activity tends to accelerate in the spring months when warmer temperatures arrive in many U.S. regions. However, the high proportion of termite and pest control services which are contracted and recurring, as well as the high renewal rates for those services, limit the effect of weather anomalies on the termite and pest control industry in any given year.
European Pest Control Industry
Through acquisitions and minority investments completed in 2019, we provide pest control services in Sweden, Norway, the United Kingdom, Spain and Ireland. We estimate that the European pest control market was approximately $3.8 billion in 2019 with approximately 8,000 service providers. While currently one percent of our revenue, we plan to pursue additional organic and inorganic growth opportunities in this attractive and growing market.
ServiceMaster Brands Industries
Restoration (ServiceMaster Restore). We estimate that the North American restoration segment was approximately $40 billion in 2019, just over one-half of which is related to residential customers and the remainder related to commercial customers. This market primarily includes mitigation and reconstruction of fire and flood related damages for both commercial and residential customers. Most emergency response mitigation and reconstruction needs result from regularly occurring emergency situations, such as burst pipes and kitchen fires, for residential and commercial customers. Extreme weather events and natural disasters also provide demand for mitigation and reconstruction services. Critical factors in the selection of an emergency response service provider are the 

 
firm’s reputation, relationships with insurers, available resources, proper insurance and credentials, quality of service, timeliness and responsiveness. 
Cleaning (ServiceMaster Clean, Merry Maids). We estimate that the U.S. cleaning market was approximately $145 billion in 2019. This market includes commercial cleaning national accounts in the commercial market serviced through ServiceMaster Clean as well as residential cleaning provided through the Merry Maids brand. The segment is highly fragmented with most competition coming from local, independently-owned firms the majority of which has five or fewer employees. We believe our strong brand name and nationwide footprint give us a differentiated offering and competitive advantage in the market.
Our Competitive Strengths
#1 Positions in Large, Fragmented and Growing Segments. We are a leading provider of essential residential and commercial services in the majority of segments in which we operate. Our segments are generally large, growing and highly fragmented, and we believe we have significant advantages over smaller local and regional competitors. We have spent decades developing a reputation built on reliability and superior quality and service. As a result, we enjoy industry leading brand awareness and a reputation for high-quality customer service, both of which serve as key drivers of our customer acquisition efforts. Our nationwide presence also allows our brands to effectively serve both local residential customers and large national commercial accounts and to capitalize on lead generation sources such as large real estate agencies and insurance carriers.
Diverse Revenue Streams Across Customers and Geographies. ServiceMaster is diversified in terms of customers and geographies. We operate in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, with approximately three percent of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 generated internationally. Our Terminix business, which accounted for 87 percent of our revenue in 2019, served approximately 2.8 million customers. Our diverse customer base and geographies help to mitigate the effect of adverse market conditions and other risks in any particular geography or customer segment we serve. We therefore believe the size and scale of our Company provide us with added protection from risk relative to our smaller local and regional competitors.
High-Value Service Offerings Resulting in High Retention and Recurring Revenues. We believe our high annual customer retention demonstrates the highly valued nature of the services we offer and the high level of execution and customer service that we provide. Many of our technicians have built long-standing, personal relationships with their customers. We believe these personal bonds, often forged over decades, help to drive customer loyalty and retention. As a result of our high retention and long-standing customer relationships, we enjoy significant visibility and stability in our business, and these factors limit the effect of adverse economic cycles on our revenue base.
Capital-Light Business Model. Our business model is characterized by strong Adjusted EBITDA margins and limited capital requirements. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our net cash provided from operating activities from continuing operations was $245 million, $229 million and $204 million, respectively, and our property additions were $28 million, $41 million (net of government grants received of $7 million) and $66 million (net of government grants received of $2 million), respectively. Free Cash Flow was $216 million, $187 million and $139 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. For a reconciliation of Free Cash Flow to net cash provided from operating activities from continuing operations, which we consider to be the most directly comparable financial measure presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”), see “Selected Financial Data.”
Resilient Financial Model with Track Record of Consistent Performance.
Solid revenue and Adjusted EBITDA growth through business cycles. Our consolidated revenue and Adjusted EBITDA compound annual growth rates from 2014 through 2019 were five percent and three percent, respectively. We believe that our strong performance is attributable to the essential nature of our services, our strong value proposition and management’s focus on driving results through strategic investment and operational execution.
Solid margins with attractive operating leverage and productivity improvement initiatives. Our business model enjoys inherent operating leverage stemming from route density and fixed investments in infrastructure and technology, among other factors. This allows us to generate productivity to expand margins through a variety of initiatives, including metric-driven continuous improvement in our customer care centers, application of consistent process guidelines at the branch level, leveraging size and scale to improve the sourcing of labor and materials and deploying shared services models. We have also deployed mobility solutions and routing and scheduling systems across many of our businesses in order to enhance overall efficiency and reduce operating costs.
Multi-Channel Marketing Approach Supported by Sophisticated Customer Analytic Modeling Capabilities. Our multi-channel marketing approach focuses on building the value of our brands and generating revenue by understanding the decisions consumers make at each stage in the purchase of residential and commercial services. We also have been deploying increasingly sophisticated consumer analytics models that allow us to more effectively segment our prospective customers and tailor campaigns towards them and, as a result, we have kept cost per sale relatively flat. In addition, we are seeing success with innovative ways of reaching and marketing to consumers, including content marketing, online reputation management and social media channels.
Operational and Customer Service Excellence Driven by Superior Employee Development. We are constantly focused on improving customer service. The customer experience is at the foundation of our business model and we believe that each employee is an extension of ServiceMaster’s reputation. We employ rigorous hiring and training practices and continuously analyze our operating metrics to identify potential improvements in service and productivity. Technicians in our Terminix branches create continuity in 

 
customer relationships and ensure the development of best practices based on on-the-ground experience. We also provide our field personnel with access to sophisticated data management and mobility tools which enable them to drive efficiencies, improve customer service and ultimately grow our customer base and profitability.
Experienced Management Team. We have assembled a management team of highly experienced leaders with significant service industry expertise. Our senior leaders have track records of producing profitable growth in a wide variety of industries and economic conditions. We also believe that we have a deep bench of talent across each of our business units, including long-tenured individuals with significant expertise and knowledge of the businesses they operate. Our management team is highly focused on execution and driving growth and profitability across our Company. Our compensation structure, including incentive compensation, is tied to key performance metrics and is designed to incentivize senior management to seek the long-term success of our business.
Our Strategy 
Grow Our Customer Base. We are focused on the growth of our businesses through the introduction and delivery of high-value services to new and existing customers. 
To accelerate new customer growth, we make strategic investments in sales, marketing and advertising to drive new business leads, brand awareness and market share. In addition, we employ multiple initiatives to improve customer satisfaction and service delivery, which we believe leads to improved retention and growth in our customer base across our business segments.
Develop and Expand New Service Offerings. We intend to continue to leverage our existing sales channels and local coverage to deliver additional value-added services to our customers. Our product development teams draw upon the experience of our technicians in the field, combined with in-house scientific expertise, to create innovative customer solutions for both our existing customer base and identified service/category adjacencies. We have a strong history of new product introductions, such as Terminix’s crawlspace encapsulation, mosquito control and wildlife exclusion services, that we believe will appeal to new potential customers as well as our existing customer base. Mosquito, wildlife exclusion and crawl space encapsulation are being offered in substantially all U.S. geographic segments where we believe substantial opportunity exists. We are now focusing our efforts on increasing our share in these product lines.
National Accounts Platform. Our acquisition of Copesan Services, Inc. (“Copesan”) in 2018 broadened our national account service offerings in commercial pest control and provides us with the opportunity to expand into combined offerings in the future. These national accounts customers operate multi-location businesses that pair well with our national footprint.
Grow Our Commercial Business. Our revenue from commercial customers comprised approximately 25 percent of our 2019 revenue. We believe we are well positioned to leverage our national coverage, brand strength and broad service offerings to target both large multi-regional accounts and local and regional commercial customers. We believe these capabilities provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage, especially compared to smaller local and regional competitors. With respect to the large, multi-regional customer base, we recognize these companies seek to outsource or reduce the number of vendors used for certain services and, accordingly, we have reenergized our marketing approach in this channel. At Terminix, for example, we have hired a dedicated sales team to focus on the development of commercial sales. Our commercial expansion strategy targets industries with a demonstrated need for our services, including healthcare, manufacturing, warehouses, hotels and commercial real estate.
Expand Our Geographic Segments. Through detailed assessments of local economic conditions and demographics, we have identified target segments for expansion, both in existing segments, where we have capacity to increase our local position, and in new geographies, where we see opportunities. In addition to geographic expansion opportunities within the United States, we may also continue to grow our international presence through strategic acquisitions and franchise expansions, additional licensing agreements and/or Company operated subsidiaries. 
Enhance Our Profitability. We have and will continue to invest in initiatives designed to improve our margins and drive profitable growth. We have been able to increase productivity across our segments through actions such as continuous process improvement, targeted systems investments, sales force initiatives and technician mobility tools. We also focus on strategically capitalizing on our purchasing power to achieve more favorable pricing and terms. In addition, we have implemented tools and processes to centralize and systematize pricing decisions. These tools and processes enable us to optimize pricing at the local and product levels while creating a flexible and scalable pricing architecture that is fully scalable across our business. We intend to leverage these investments as well as identify further opportunities to enhance profitability. We also evaluate our brands periodically to determine which vehicle to market or ownership strategy optimizes total value creation and our profitability.
Pursue Selective Acquisitions. Historically, we have a track record of being able to source and purchase targets at attractive prices and successfully integrate them into our business to increase branch density and improve operating margins. From 2015 through 2019, we have completed approximately 90 acquisitions. In 2019, we completed 39 acquisitions and eight minority investments for a total purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $513 million. Our acquisitions in 2019 included Assured Environments, Nomor, Gregory Pest Solutions, McCloud Services and the reacquisition of three ServiceMaster Brands franchisees. In 2018, we completed a total of 20 acquisitions, including Copesan and the acquisitions of a Terminix franchisee and a ServiceMaster Restore master distributor, for a total purchase price, net of cash acquired, of $254 million. The Nomor acquisition is the beginning of our strategic expansion into the $3.8 billion European pest control market. In addition, we acquired a smaller national and global accounts focused business in the UK, to help us build foundational capabilities to serve Europe based national and global accounts. We anticipate that the highly fragmented 

 
nature of our market segments will continue to create opportunities for further consolidation. In the future, we intend to continue to take advantage of tuck-in as well as strategic acquisition opportunities, including Terminix franchise repurchases, particularly in underserved geographies where we can enhance and expand our service capabilities. We seek to use acquisitions to expand our capabilities, geographic footprint and talent levels.
Sales and Marketing
We market our services to both homeowners and businesses on a national and local level through various means, including the internet, direct mail, television and radio advertising, print advertisements, marketing partnerships, door-to-door summer sales programs, telemarketing, various social media channels and through national sales teams. 
Franchises 
Franchises are important to the Terminix, ServiceMaster Restore, ServiceMaster Clean, Merry Maids, Furniture Medic and AmeriSpec businesses. Nearly all of the franchise fees received by our ServiceMaster Brands segment are derived from the ServiceMaster Restore, ServiceMaster Clean and Merry Maids businesses. Franchise fees from our Terminix franchisees represented less than one percent of Terminix revenue for each of those years. We evaluate the performance of our franchise businesses based primarily on operating profit before corporate general and administrative expenses, interest expense and amortization of intangible assets. Franchise agreements entered into in the course of these businesses are generally for a term of five years. The majority of these franchise agreements are renewed prior to expiration. Internationally, we have license agreements, whereby licensees provide services under our brand names that would ordinarily be provided by franchisees in the United States. The majority of international licenses are for 10-year terms. The following table provides a summary of the financial information from our franchised operations:

 | Year ended December 31,
(in millions) | 2019 | | 2018 | | 2017
Franchise fees | $ | 150 | | $ | 149 | $ | 143
Franchise operating expenses | $ | 60 | | $ | 62 | $ | 56 
Profits from franchised operations | $ | 89 | | $ | 87 | $ | 87 

Customers and Geographies 
We have no single customer that accounts for more than two percent of our consolidated revenue. Neither of our reportable segments are dependent on a single customer or a few customers, the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the segment. A significant percentage of our revenue is concentrated in the southern and western regions of the U.S. In our Terminix segment, California, Texas and Florida collectively accounted for approximately one-third of our revenue in 2019. 
Competition
We compete in residential and commercial services industries, focusing on residential and commercial termite and pest control, commercial national accounts pest management, restoration, commercial cleaning, residential cleaning, cabinet and furniture repair and home inspections. We compete with many other companies in the sale of our services, franchises and products. The principal methods of competition in our businesses include quality and speed of service, brand awareness and reputation, customer satisfaction, pricing and promotions, professional sales forces, contractor network and referrals. While we compete with a broad range of competitors in each distinct market segment, we do not believe that any of our competitors provides all of the services we provide in all of the market segments we serve. All of the primary market segments in which we operate are highly fragmented.
Residential and Commercial Termite and Pest Control
Competition in the industry for professional termite and pest control services in the United States and Europe comes primarily from smaller regional and local, independently-owned firms, as well as from Orkin, Inc. (a subsidiary of Rollins, Inc.), Ecolab, Inc., Rentokil Initial, plc. and Anticimex International AB, all of which compete internationally.
Commercial National Accounts Pest Management
Competition in industry for national account pest management services in the United States comes primarily from Orkin, Inc. and Rentokil Initial, plc., both of which compete nationally.
Restoration, Emergency Response and Related Services
This segment is highly fragmented and competition in the industry for restoration, emergency response and related services comes mainly from local, independently-owned firms and a few national professional cleaning companies, such as Servpro Industries, Inc., Belfor, a subsidiary of Belfor Europe GmbH, Interstate Restoration and FirstOnSite (operating brands of Global Restoration Holdings, LLC and Bellwether FOS Holdco, Inc.), BMS CAT, Inc., Paul Davis Restoration, Inc. and Stanley Steemer International, Inc.

Commercial Cleaning

Information Technology
We have invested in information systems and software packages designed to allow us to grow efficiently and scale across our organization, while retaining local and regional flexibility. We believe this capability provides us with a competitive advantage in our operations. Our sophisticated IT systems enable us to provide a high level of convenience and service to our customers. In 2018, we announced our contract with Salesforce to replace legacy operating systems as part of a fundamental reimagining of our operating model which will provide a full 360-degree vision of the customer and enable more data driven decision making.
Employees
The average number of persons employed by us during 2019 was approximately 12,000.
Intellectual Property
We hold various service marks, trademarks and trade names, such as ServiceMaster, Terminix, Copesan, Nomor, ServiceMaster Restore, ServiceMaster Clean, Merry Maids, Furniture Medic and AmeriSpec, that we deem particularly important to the advertising activities conducted by each of our reportable segments as well as the franchising activities conducted by certain reportable segments. As of December 31, 2019, we had marks that were protected by registration (either by direct registration or by treaty) in the United States and approximately 80 other countries. 
Insurance
We maintain insurance coverage that we believe is appropriate for our business, including workers’ compensation, auto liability, general liability, umbrella and property insurance. In addition, we provide various insurance coverages, including deductible reimbursement policies, to our business units through our wholly-owned captive insurance company. 
Regulatory Compliance
Our businesses are subject to various international, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations, compliance with which increases our operating costs, limits or restricts the services provided by our reportable segments or the methods by which our businesses offer, sell and fulfill those services or conduct their respective businesses, or subjects us and our reportable segments to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. Noncompliance with these laws and regulations can subject us to fines or various forms of civil or criminal prosecution, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows.
These international, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations include laws relating to consumer protection and data privacy, wage and hour, deceptive trade practices, permitting and licensing, state contractor laws, real estate settlements, workers’ safety, tax, healthcare reforms, franchise-related issues, collective bargaining and other labor matters, environmental and employee benefits. The Terminix business must also meet certain Department of Transportation and Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration requirements with respect to certain vehicles in its fleet. Terminix is regulated by federal, state and local laws, ordinances and regulations which are enforced by pest control boards, environmental protection agencies and similar government entities. Terminix, Copesan, ServiceMaster Clean and Merry Maids use products containing ingredients regulated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), and ServiceMaster Clean is subject to licensing and certification requirements for applying disinfectants, sanitizers and other EPA registered products in certain states. AmeriSpec is regulated by various state and local home inspection laws and regulations.
Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
Our businesses are subject to various international, federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding environmental, health and safety matters. Among other things, these laws regulate the emission or discharge of materials into the environment, govern the use, storage, treatment, disposal, transportation and management of hazardous substances and wastes and protect the health and safety of our employees. These laws also impose liability for the costs of investigating and remediating, and damages resulting from, present and past releases of hazardous substances, including releases by prior owners or operators of sites we currently own or operate.
Compliance with environmental, health and safety laws increases our operating costs, limits or restricts the services provided by our reportable segments or the methods by which they offer, sell and fulfill those services or conduct their respective businesses, or subjects us and our reportable segments to the possibility of regulatory or private actions or proceedings.

 

Terminix is regulated under many federal and state environmental laws, including the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986, the Federal Environmental Pesticide Control Act of 1972, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act of 1947, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, the Clean Air Act, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 and the Clean Water Act of 1977, each as amended.
We cannot predict the effect of possible future environmental laws on our operations. Changes in, or new interpretations of, existing laws, regulations or enforcement policies, the discovery of previously unknown contamination, or the imposition of other environmental liabilities or obligations in the future, may lead to additional compliance or other costs. During 2019, there were no material capital expenditures for environmental control facilities, and there are no material expenditures anticipated for 2020 or 2021 related to such facilities. 
Consumer Protection and Solicitation Matters
We are subject to international, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations designed to protect consumers, including laws governing consumer privacy and fraud, the collection and use of consumer data, telemarketing and other forms of solicitation.
The telemarketing rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission pursuant to the Federal Telephone Consumer Protection Act and the Federal Telemarketing Sales Rule issued by the Federal Trade Commission govern our telephone sales practices. The CAN-SPAM Act regulates email solicitations and the Consumer Review Fairness Act regulates consumer opinions on social media regarding products and services. In addition, some states and local governing bodies have adopted laws and regulations targeted at direct telephone sales and “do-not-knock,” “do-not-mail” and “do-not-leave” activities. If we were to fail to comply with any applicable law or regulation, we could be subject to substantial fines or damages, be involved in lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities, suffer losses to our reputation and our business or suffer the loss of licenses or penalties that may affect how the business is operated, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. 
Franchise Matters
Terminix, ServiceMaster Restore, ServiceMaster Clean, Merry Maids, Furniture Medic and AmeriSpec are subject to various international, federal, state, provincial and local laws and regulations governing franchise sales, marketing and licensing and franchise trade practices generally, including applicable rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission. These laws and regulations generally require disclosure of business information in connection with the sale and licensing of franchises. Certain state regulations also affect the ability of the franchisor to revoke or refuse to renew a franchise. We seek to comply with regulatory requirements and deal with franchisees and licensees in good faith. From time to time, we and one or more franchisees may become involved in a dispute regarding the franchise relationship, including payment of royalties or fees, location of branches, advertising, purchase of products by franchisees, non-competition covenants, compliance with our standards and franchise renewal criteria. There can be no assurance that compliance problems will not be encountered from time to time or that significant disputes with one or more franchisees will not arise.
From time to time, we receive communications from our franchisees regarding complaints, disputes or questions about our practices and standards in relation to our franchised operations and certain economic terms of our franchise arrangements. If franchisees or groups representing franchisees were to bring legal proceedings against us, we would vigorously defend against the claims in any such proceeding, but our reputation, business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted and the price of our common stock could decline.
