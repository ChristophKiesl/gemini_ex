ITEM 1.  BUSINESS
HISTORY AND BACKGROUND
 
We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on December 30, 2010 originally under the name Lifetech Industries, Inc. Effective August 2, 2013, the name was changed from "Lifetech Industries, Inc." to "mCig, Inc." reflecting the new business model.  All agreements related to the Lifetech business were terminated and closed as of April 30, 2014.  The Company redomiciled to Puerto Rico on April 17, 2020. Effective April 17, 2020, the name was changed from "MCIG, Inc.," to "BOTS, Inc."  The Company’s common stock is traded under the symbol “BOTS.”  The Company is headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel. 
GENERAL

Originally, we were formed to open and operate a full-service day spa in Montrose, California. In October 2013 we repositioned ourselves as a technology company focused on two long-term secular trends sweeping the globe: (1) The decriminalization and legalization of marijuana for medicinal or recreational purposes; and, (2) the adoption of electronic vaporizing cigarettes (commonly known as “eCigs”).
 
The Company initially earned revenue through wholesale and retail sales of electronic cigarettes, vaporizers, and accessories in the United States. It offered electronic cigarettes and related products through its online store at www.BOTS.org, as well as through the company’s wholesale, distributor, and retail programs. We expanded operations to include the VitaCig brand in 2014.
 
From 2015 through 2020 the Company was involved in multiple cannabis business entities. We have elected to discontinue all operations in the cannabis markets and focus on robotics.
 
During this fiscal year, we operated multiple websites (which are not incorporated as part of this Form 10K report). The Company’s primary website is www.BOTS.BZ. 
 
INDUSTRY OVERVIEWS
 
The Halvening
 
The most concrete event that will take place in 2020 is the bitcoin halving in May, which will reduce the number of bitcoins rewarded for successfully mining a block in the digital ledger by half, from 12.5 to 6.25 BTC. Even though it sounds dramatic, it’s happened twice before, and each event saw some interesting price action. In the months surrounding the 2012 halving, bitcoin price went from less than $10 to more than $100 while in 2016 the currency surged from $400 before the halving to more than twice that by the end of the year.
 
At its face, halving introduces new scarcity to the market and bitcoin traders are already anticipating similar supply-side price growth as the past two halvings. However, traders shouldn’t forget that demand is also necessary in driving price. As bitcoin mining becomes less lucrative, the number of miners competing for a block will fall as will the hash rate necessary for mining until an equilibrium is reached. Of course, expectations might be all that’s required to see an effect. “There are arguments for and against a price increase, the main argument against it being that the majority of people are expecting it,” said Alex Lindenmeyer- industry veteran and co-founder of cryptocurrency tracking and tax software company Accointing. “What I know for certain is that there will be a lot of volatility due to speculation.” The halving is aimed at stabilizing the supply of bitcoins as it approaches full saturation and there are no more bitcoins to be mined. After that, well, bitcoins may become rarer and more valuable than gold, or Satoshi Nakamoto could create more bitcoins to be mined so the coin’s price can continue to be moderated, or it could gradually lose value to more abundant or practical digital currencies like Bitcoin Cash, which forked off from the original Bitcoin in 2017 for just that purpose. Ultimately, the world’s first cryptocurrency still needs to decide whether its scarcity alone defines its value.

FaceBook Cryptocurrency Libra
 
The flipside of this is libra, the asset-backed stablecoin that Facebook announced earlier this year, although it won’t be available until at least the summer of 2020, if and when it clears the necessary regulatory hurdles. In any event, a lot of uncertainties remain about the new stablecoin that has backing from the likes of Uber, Vodafone, Coinbase and even a member of the Kushner family. Part of these uncertainties prompted other interested parties like Mastercard, eBay, and Paypal Holdings, to bow out of the cryptocurrency altogether.
 
However, the one certainty around libra is that it will have a potential user base of nearly 170 million in the United States alone. Thanks to Facebook’s omnipresence, their adoption of Libra and its associated Calibra wallet will mean that users of the social network, many of whom have never touched a cryptocurrency, might suddenly be paying their Uber drivers with the stuff.
 
Accointing’s co-founder viewed the issue as a matter of bringing an air of legitimacy to cryptocurrency, saying, “Stablecoins are hugely important to the space. For adoption, it is important to be able to easily switch between a store of value and a stable currency you can use daily. Furthermore [libra] will broaden the understanding that money doesn’t have to come from countries. Alone, the discussion around libra this year just got people thinking about cryptocurrencies.”
 
Depending on how well this model is adopted — and pending the already massive scrutiny from government regulators — libra could well mark the point at which cryptocurrency goes mainstream, and other tech and finance companies will certainly follow.
 
More regulations expected
 
2019 revealed a growing awareness on the part of federal agencies that cryptocurrency (and technology in general) is beginning to become less a component of society and more of the core element of it. The Federal Reserve revealed recently the U.S. central bank is mulling over a potential digital analogue for the greenback. Meanwhile, the Internal Revenue Service has firmed up its guidance on reporting cryptocurrency transactions for the coming tax season.
 
Now with one of the biggest and most controversial tech companies in the world getting in on the cryptocurrency game, the cryptocurrency industry will likely see local and national governments pay closer attention to the digital currencies, for good or ill. For his part, Benzinga sees the current outlook on guidance and regulations in cryptocurrency as mostly benign.
 
While most of the current legislation has been encouraging, ongoing experiments may cut both ways for the larger cryptocurrency market. Supportive regulations like those highlighted by Alex promise to foster growth and increase transparency throughout the industry. On the other hand, highly restrictive regulations like those coming out of China could mean increased turmoil for digital assets.
 
The Market Consolidations
 
Turmoil might be a characteristic feature lower on the cryptocurrency food chain. Because, despite flattening in 2018 as the price of bitcoin fell, the number of cryptocurrencies in the market surged to more than 2300 through 2019, according to the latest account from CoinMarketCap. Unfortunately, fewer than a third of coins trade more than $100,000 of volume in a day. Meanwhile, more than a third are valued at less than a tenth of a penny. The result is that there are more coins in the cryptocurrency market now than ever before, but the total amount of capital has flatlined throughout 2019. While a potential upswing in cryptocurrency interest from mainstream finance might contribute to a subsequent increase of capital, it’s unlikely to trickle down to the very smallest coins. What’s more, as greater scrutiny comes to the market, regulatory burdens and increased transparency among the larger players will likely root out those just trying to make quick coin. In any case, the market has probably reached a saturation point, and the number of available coins is unlikely to grow through 2020.
Crypto and Fintech Hook Up
 
The overarching theme of all of these trends is that cryptocurrency is growing up, becoming mainstream and finally finding actual use cases, rather than just hypothetical ones. With the introduction of Libra, the problem isn’t explaining why cryptocurrency will be valuable and necessary soon but making it valuable and necessary now — do or die. There are obviously questions about how transactions will be implemented across an array of ledgers or how anonymized transactions can be regulated. Part of this will come in the consolidation of the industry and the continued struggle for interoperability between wallets and ledgers. However, most of these questions will likely be answered by whoever tries first, and financial technology companies are by far the most eager to fill that role.
 
This necessity of innovation has been an evident trend throughout major areas of the cryptocurrency market. Libra itself is (or was) stacked with members from various fintech companies. Meanwhile, fintech unicorns like Plaid and Chime have reached their valuations largely from investments by companies in the finance industry like Visa and Goldman Sachs Group that are curious about digital assets, but terrified of the uncertainty that surrounds them.

BUSINESS MODEL
 
The Company continues to look at increasing revenue internally and through strategic acquisitions. The Company utilizes many methods of identifying new products to produce and potential companies to acquire. Our staff continually reviews current market trends to determine appropriate products to introduce. We have had them presented to us by business brokers, have reviewed competition and looked for compelling stories, or incorporated a subsidiary directly for a specific purpose. In some instances, the companies come looking to us for assistance. We will continue to finance additional acquisitions through private placements of stock, debt, or revenue from operations.
 
The BOTS business model is built around developing and incubating self-sustaining business entities in the technology space. We look for strong management teams that have expertise in their fields and want to operate within the cannabis and e-Cig industry. Once the entities are self-sustaining the company divest them either through i) a sale of the assets, ii) a spin-off into its own publicly traded entity, or iii) seek additional partners and privatize the business. 
 
Expansion through Acquisition
 
The Company continues to look for additional acquisition opportunities in the cannabis and e-Cig fields that will enhance our overall growth, complement our existing operations and increase shareholder value. BOTS considers acquisitions as a critical element to our strategic growth. We look for synergistic companies that will provide strength and growth opportunities to the developing products and services of BOTS. We will review current competition in many markets and determine if an acquisition or joint venture is in the best interest of BOTS. 
Marketing and Sales Strategy
 
BOTS marketing and sales strategy is subject to change quickly and often. When we evaluate a new product or service, we place considerable analysis on immediate return on investment (during initial 12-month period of launch) as the future long-term opportunities are uncertain and highly speculative. In instances where a client has demonstrated an ability to continue to control a market share the Company may consider long term sales as well. 
 
Our products and services are marketed directly through each subsidiary. As we continue to acquire companies or services, we look for synergic growth opportunities that will allow for expansion of the multiple services available under our umbrella of companies. The growth in revenue created by the cross pollination of products and services are desirable.
 
The Company continues to utilize newsletters, advertisement, and viral knowledge of our services to expand our customer base. The Company utilizes all social media platforms to grow its customer awareness. 
 
Patents and Intellectual Properties
 
The Company owns patent number US9135787 “Bitcoin kiosk/ATM device and system integrating enrollment protocol and method of using the same”.
 
In addition, the Company has a patent application number US20180315072A1 entitles “Method and system of facilitating management of cryptocurrency based loyalty points associated with one or more of a product and a service”.

EMPLOYEES AND CONSULTANTS
 
As of April 30, 2020, the Company has a total of 3 full-time/part-time employees and consultants throughout the various subsidiaries. None of our employees are covered by a collective bargaining agreement, and management believes its relationship with our employees is good.
 
The Company utilizes a considerable number of consultants to provide periodic work requirements. When workflow demands a fulltime or justifiable part-time employee the Company hires the appropriate person to fulfill the job requirements.

ITEM 1. A. RISK FACTORS
 
Investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risk factors as well as other information contained herein, including our financial statements and the related notes. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of, or that we currently deem immaterial, also may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following risks occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.
 
RISK RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY
 
We have incurred losses in the past and cannot assure you that we will achieve or maintain profitable operations.
 
As of April 30, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $13,149,659. Our accumulated deficit is primarily due to, among other reasons, the establishment of our business infrastructure and operations, stock-based compensation expenses and increases in our marketing expenditures to grow sales. For the year ended April 30, 2020, we had net loss of $3,883,988 compared to a net loss of $3,057,241 for the year ended April 30, 2019. We cannot assure you that we will generate operating profits now or in the immediate future, or be able to on, a sustainable basis, continue to expand our infrastructure, further develop our marketing efforts and otherwise implement our growth initiatives.
 
We make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results.
 
We frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results if we believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and improve our financial performance over the long term. We may introduce changes to existing services, or introduce new stand-alone services, that direct our customers away from our current services. We are also investing in new products and services, and we may not successfully monetize such experiences. We also may take steps that result in limiting distribution of products and services in the short term in order to attempt to ensure the availability of our products and services to users over the long term. These decisions may not produce the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our customer growth and our business results of operations could be harmed.
 

8

 
We face intense competition and our failure to compete effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.
 
Some of our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources or better competitive positions in certain product segments, geographic regions or user demographics than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to respond more effectively than us to new or emerging technologies and changes in market conditions. We believe that some of our users are aware of and actively engaging with other services similar to, or as a substitute for, our services, and we believe that some of our users have reduced their use of and engagement with our product in favor of these other services. In the event that our users increasingly 
 
engage with other services, we may not experience the anticipated growth, or see a decline, in use and engagement in key user demographics or more broadly, in which case our business would likely be harmed.
 
Our competitors may develop products, features, or services that are like ours or that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts or marketing campaigns, or may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. 
 
We believe that our ability to compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:
 

· | the popularity, usefulness, ease of use, performance, and reliability of our services compared to our competitors' services; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | the size and composition of our user base; 
· | the engagement of our users with our products and competing services; 
· | the timing and market acceptance of services, including developments and enhancements to our or our competitors' services; 
· | our ability to distribute our services to new and existing users; 
· | our ability to monetize our services; 
· | the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence of the ads displayed by us or our competitors; 
· | customer service and support efforts; 
· | marketing and selling efforts, including our ability to measure the effectiveness of our ads and to provide marketers with a compelling return on their investments; 
· | our ability to establish and maintain developers' interest in building mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other services; 
· | our ability to establish and maintain publisher interest in integrating their content with Facebook and our other services; 
· | changes mandated by legislation, regulatory authorities, or litigation, including settlements and consent decrees, some of which may have a disproportionate effect on us;
· | acquisitions or consolidation within our industry, which may result in more formidable competitors; 
· | our ability to attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and product managers; 
· | our ability to cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and 
· | our reputation and brand strength relative to those of our competitors. 

 
If we are not able to compete effectively, our user base and level of user engagement may decrease, we may become less attractive to developers and marketers, and our revenue and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.
 

9

 
Credit card payment processors and merchant account pose a risk.
 
We accept credit cards as a means of payment for the sale of our services. If we are unable to find suitable providers or an alternative method of payment for our customers, our cash-flow will be constrained and our sales may be affected which may have a material adverse effect on our performance, financial condition and results of operations.
 
Our costs are continuing to grow, which could harm our business and profitability.
 
Operating our business is costly, and we expect our expenses to continue to increase in the future as we broaden our products and services, and as these services and products increase, the amount of customer support and management needed increases. The development of new products and services, expanding our technical infrastructure, and the hiring of additional personnel will add cost to our expanding operations. We expect to continue to invest in our global efforts and other initiatives, which may not have clear paths to monetization. We may also be subject to increased costs in order to obtain and attract third-party content or to facilitate the distribution of our services. Any investments may not be successful, and any such increases in our costs may adversely affect our business and profitability.
 
If we are unable to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brands and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected.
 
We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom we have relationships, as well as trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, to protect our proprietary rights. In the United States and internationally, we have filed various applications 
 
for protection of certain aspects of our intellectual property. Third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held by us, and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not be approved. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which we operate or intend to operate our business. In any or all these cases, we may be required to expend significant time and expense in order to prevent infringement or to enforce our rights. Although we have generally taken measures to protect our proprietary rights, there can be no assurance that others will not offer products or concepts that are substantially like ours and compete with our business. Any of these events could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results.
 
We plan to continue to make acquisitions, which could harm our financial condition or results of operations and may adversely affect the price of our common stock.
 
As part of our business strategy, we have made and intend to continue to make acquisitions to add specialized employees and complementary companies, products, or technologies. We may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. In some cases, the costs of such acquisitions may be substantial. There is no assurance that we will receive a favorable return on investment for these or other acquisitions.
 

10

 
We may pay substantial amounts of cash or incur debt to pay for acquisitions, which could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence of indebtedness would also result in increased fixed obligations, increased interest expense, and could also include covenants or other restrictions that would impede our ability to manage our operations. We may also issue equity securities to pay for acquisitions, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result in dilution to our stockholders. In addition, any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by customers, shareholders, or investors, which may adversely affect our business or the price of our common stock.
 
In the future, we may use shares of preferred stock as consideration in connection with acquisitions. However, we may not be able to issue shares of preferred stock because companies that we are interested in acquiring may not agree to accept shares that carry no voting rights, or for other reasons. Companies that we seek to acquire may also demand more shares in exchange for accepting such stock as consideration. In such instances, we may need to pay cash, issue common stock as consideration, or issue a relatively greater number of shares of preferred stock to consummate the acquisitions.
 
We may also discover liabilities or deficiencies associated with the companies or assets we acquire that were not identified in advance, which may result in significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness of our due diligence review and our ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness of statements and disclosures made or actions taken by the companies we acquire or their representatives, as well as the limited amount of time in which acquisitions are executed. In addition, we may fail to accurately forecast the financial impact of an acquisition transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions may also result in our recording of significant additional expenses to our results of operations and recording of substantial finite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet upon closing. Any of these factors may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.
 
We may not be able to successfully integrate our acquisitions, and we may incur significant costs to integrate and support the companies we acquire.
 
The integration of acquisitions requires significant time and resources, and we may not manage these processes successfully. Our ability to successfully integrate complex acquisitions is unproven, particularly with respect to companies that have significant operations or that develop products where we do not have prior experience. We cannot assure you that these investments will be successful. If we fail to successfully integrate the companies we acquire, we may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may be harmed.
 
If our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets become impaired, we may be required to record a significant charge to earnings.

We review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable, such as a decline in stock price and market capitalization. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. If such goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets are deemed to be impaired, an impairment loss equal to the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the assets would be recognized. We may be required to record a significant charge in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or finite-lived intangible assets is determined, which would negatively affect our results of operations.
 

11

 
In addition, some members of our management do not have significant experience managing a large global business operation, so our management may not be able to manage such growth effectively. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial, and management processes and systems and to effectively expand, train, and manage our employee base. As our organization continues to grow, and we are required to implement more complex organizational management structures, we may find it increasingly difficult to maintain the benefits of our corporate culture, including our ability to quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance.
 
We have significant international operations and plan to continue expanding our operations abroad where we have limited operating experience, and this may subject us to increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results.
 
We may enter new international markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our services. Our services are generally available globally through the web and on mobile, but some or all our services or functionality may not be available in certain markets due to legal and regulatory complexities. We also outsource certain operational functions to third-party vendors globally. If we fail to deploy, manage, or oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. In addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:
 

· | political, social, or economic instability; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
· | risks related to legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable to U.S. companies with sales and operations in foreign jurisdictions, including with respect to privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade compliance, intellectual property, and terrestrial infrastructure matters;
· | potential damage to our brand and reputation due to compliance with local laws, including potential censorship or requirements to provide user information to local authorities; 
· | fluctuations in currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls; 
· | foreign exchange controls and tax regulations that might prevent us from repatriating cash earned in countries outside the United States or otherwise limit our ability to move cash freely, and impede our ability to invest such cash efficiently; 
· | higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud; 
· | enhanced difficulties of integrating any foreign acquisitions; 
· | burdens of complying with a variety of foreign laws; 
· | reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; 
· | difficulties in staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations; 
· | compliance with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and similar laws in other jurisdictions; and 
· | compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences. 

 
If we are unable to expand internationally and manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, our financial results could be adversely affected.
 
The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with the officers and directors and we may be required to indemnify our Directors and Officers, which could create significant losses for the Company.
 
We have authority under Puerto Rico law to indemnify our directors and officers to the extent provided in that statute. Our Articles of Incorporation require the Company to indemnify each of our directors and officers against liabilities imposed upon them (including reasonable amounts paid in settlement) and expenses incurred by them regarding any claim made against them or any action, suit or proceeding to which they may be a party by reason of their being or having been a director or officer of the company. We currently do not maintain officer's and director's liability insurance coverage. Consequently, any judgment against our Officers and Directors, the Company will be forced to pay. We have entered into indemnification agreements with each of our officers and directors containing provisions that may require us, among other things, to indemnify our officers and directors against certain liabilities that may arise because of their status or service as officers or directors (other than liabilities arising from willful misconduct of a culpable nature) and to advance their expenses incurred because of any proceeding against them as to which they could be indemnified. Management believes that such indemnification provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and executive officers. We are subject to claims arising from disputes with employees, vendors and other third parties in the normal course of business. These risks may be difficult to assess or quantify and their existence and magnitude may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. If the plaintiffs in any suits against us were to successfully prosecute their claims, or if we were to settle such suits by making significant payments to the plaintiffs, our operating results and financial condition would be harmed. In addition, our organizational documents require us to indemnify our senior executives to the maximum extent permitted by Puerto Rico law. If our senior executives were named in any lawsuit, our indemnification obligations could magnify the costs of these suits. 
 

12

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CRYPTOCURRENCY & BLOCKCHAIN INDUSTRY
 
We have an evolving business model that will require significant resources, and our upcoming business model may not develop as we project.
 
As blockchain technology becomes more widely available and utilized, we expect the services and products associated with them to evolve and, as a result our contemplated blockchain consulting business will have to continue to evolve. Distributed ledger technology is relatively new, and we believe that it will take significant resources to become a competitive provider of consulting services relating to the application of distributed ledger technology. Future additions and modifications to our business will increase the complexity of our business and may place significant strain on our management, personnel, and operations.
 
If we do not keep pace with technological changes, our blockchain consulting business, when developed, may not become competitive and/or our competitors may develop and market similar products that receive greater market acceptance.
 
The market for blockchain technology and any related consulting services is characterized by rapid technological change, frequent product and service innovation and evolving industry standards. As a result, our contemplated blockchain consulting business must be able to keep pace with this rapidly developing and competitive marketplace. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully grow our contemplated blockchain consulting business. 
 
We have not voluntarily implemented various corporate governance measures, in the absence of which, shareholders may have more limited protections against interested director transactions, conflicts of interest, and similar matters.
 
Federal legislation, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, has resulted in the adoption of various corporate governance measures designed to promote the integrity of the corporate management and the securities markets. Some of these measures have been adopted in response to legal requirements. Others have been adopted by companies in response to the requirements of national securities exchanges, such as the NYSE or the Nasdaq Stock Market, on which their securities are listed. Among the corporate governance measures that are required under the rules of national securities exchanges are those that address board of directors’ independence, and audit committee oversight. We have not yet adopted any of these corporate governance measures and, since our securities are not yet listed on a national securities exchange, we are not required to do so. It is possible that if we were to adopt some or all of these corporate governance measures, stockholders would benefit from somewhat greater assurances that internal corporate decisions were being made by disinterested directors and that policies had been implemented to define responsible conduct. Prospective investors should bear in mind our current lack of corporate governance measures in formulating their investment decisions.
 
If we are unable to retain our staff, our business and results of operations could be harmed.
 
Our ability to develop our blockchain consulting business is largely dependent on the services of certain executive officers and other employees and contractors which assist such individuals in management and operation of the business (collectively, “Key Personnel”). If we are unable to retain Key Personnel and to attract qualified senior management on terms satisfactory to us, our business will be adversely affected. We do not have key man life insurance covering the life of any executive officers and, even if we are able to afford such a key man policy, our coverage levels may not be sufficient to offset any losses we may suffer as a result of the loss of any Key Personnel.
 
We may acquire stakes in businesses and enter joint ventures that will expose us to increased operating risks.
 
As part of our growth strategy, we intend to enter joint venture arrangements intended to complement or expand our business and will likely continue to do so in the future. These joint ventures are subject to substantial risks and liabilities associated with their operations, as well as the risk that our relationships with our joint venture partners fail in the manner that we can’t anticipate.
 

13

 
Current and future litigation could adversely affect us.
 
We, along with certain directors and/or officers of the Company may become subject to other legal proceedings in our ordinary course of business. Such legal proceedings involve substantial costs, including the costs associated with investigation, litigation and possible settlement, judgment, penalty or fine. As a smaller company, the collective costs of litigation proceedings represent a drain on our cash resources, as well as an inordinate amount of our management’s time and attention. Moreover, an adverse ruling in respect of certain litigation could have a material adverse effect on our results of operation and financial condition.
 
We may face competition and, if we are not able to effectively compete in our markets, our revenues may decrease.
 
Competitive pressures in our markets could adversely affect our competitive position, leading to a possible loss of customers or a decrease in prices, either of which could result in decreased revenues and profits. Though the market sectors in which we compete are new, our competitors are numerous, and the recent increase in popularity of such market sectors only creates more competition. New or current competitors may have significantly greater capital resources than us, and our business could be adversely affected because of increased competition from such competitors.
 
We are in the development stage, are not generating revenue in our continuing operations, and have a limited operating history in providing consulting services.
 
The Company is in the development stage and faces all the risks and uncertainties associated with a new and unproven business. Our future is based on an unproven business plan with no historical facts to support projections and assumptions. The Company was founded in March 2017 and has limited history of providing blockchain consulting services. The Company is not currently generating revenues and cannot guarantee when it expects to generate revenue. Investors should understand that an investment in a start-up business is significantly riskier than an investment in a business with any significant operating history. There can be no assurance that the Company will ever achieve revenues or profitability. The Company’s operations are subject to all of the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise. The likelihood of our success must be considered in light of the challenges, expenses and delays frequently encountered in connection with the operation of a pre-revenue business. Our lack of a significant and relevant operating history makes it difficult to predict future operating results.
 
If our remedial measures are insufficient to address material weaknesses and we are unable to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, timely file our periodic reports, maintain our reporting status or prevent fraud.
 
Our internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls, or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. If we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, including any failure to implement new or improved controls, or if we experience difficulties in their implementation, our business and financial results could be harmed and we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.
 
Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented, detected or corrected on a timely basis. If the enhanced controls implemented to remediate and address the material weaknesses are not designed or do not operate effectively, if we are unsuccessful in implementing or following these processes, if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, or we are otherwise unable to remediate the material weaknesses, this may result in untimely or inaccurate reporting of our financial results.

We may be forced to cease operations or take actions that result in the dissolution of the Company.
 
It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, regulations that decrease interests in or inhibit the growth of Blockchain technology, the inability by the Company to maintain its competitiveness among companies operating in similar market sectors, the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, the Company may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve or take actions that result in a dissolution event.
 
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR COMMON STOCK 
 
The market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile or may decline regardless of the Company’s operating performance, and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the initial public offering price and the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.
 
Since the commencement of trading of our common stock on the OTC Markets, the market price of our common stock has been volatile and fluctuates widely in price in response to various factors, which are beyond our control. Since the commencement of trading of our common stock on the OTC Markets, the price of our common stock went from $0.02 per share to almost $0.90 per share. The price of the stock as of fiscal year ending April 30, 2020 was trading at $0.0266 per share. We attribute this large fluctuation especially on the industry that we operate in. Management believes that when the industry is doing well, we believe our stock price will benefit but when the industry is experiencing a downturn, we will not be immune from the decline.
 
Furthermore, we must note that the price of our common stock is not necessarily indicative of our operating performance or long-term business prospects. In addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Factors such as the following could cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially:
 
Volatility in our common stock price may subject us to securities litigation.
 
The market for our common stock is characterized by significant price volatility when compared to seasoned issuers, and we expect that our share price will continue to be more volatile than a seasoned issuer for the indefinite future. In the past, plaintiffs have often initiated securities class action litigation against a company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities. We may, in the future, be the target of similar litigation. Securities litigation could result in substantial costs and liabilities to us and could divert our management’s attention and resources from managing our operations and business.
 
The Company may issue more shares in connection with future mergers or acquisitions, which could result in substantial dilution to existing shareholders.
 
Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 2,000,000,000 shares of common stock. Any future merger or acquisition effected by us may result in the issuance of additional securities without stockholder approval and may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then-current stockholders. Moreover, the common stock issued in any such merger or acquisition transaction may be valued on an arbitrary or non-arm’s-length basis by our management, resulting in an additional reduction in the percentage of common stock held by our then existing stockholders. Our Board of Directors has the power to issue any or all of such authorized but unissued shares without stockholder approval. To the extent that additional shares of common stock or preferred stock are issued in connection with a future business combination or otherwise, dilution to the interests of our stockholders will occur, and the rights of the holders of common stock could be materially and adversely affected.

We do not anticipate paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future, and therefore investors should not buy our stock if they wish to receive cash dividends.
 
We have not paid dividends in the past and do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future, and any return on investment may be limited to potential future appreciation on the value of our common stock.
 
We currently intend to retain any future earnings to support the development and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.  Our payment of any future dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors after considering various factors, including without limitation, our financial condition, operating results, cash needs, growth plans, and the terms of any credit agreements that we may be party to at the time.  To the extent we do not pay dividends, our stock may be less valuable because a return on investment will only occur if and to the extent our stock price increases, which may never occur.  In addition, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize their investment, and if the price of our stock does not appreciate, then there will be no return on investment.  Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.  
 
Our common stock may be considered a “penny stock,” and thereby be subject to additional sale and trading regulations that may make it more difficult to sell.
 
Our common stock is a “penny stock.” It does not qualify for one of the exemptions from the definition of “penny stock” under Section 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. Our common stock is a “penny stock” because it meets one or more of the following conditions (i) the stock trades at a price less than $5.00 per share; (ii) it is not traded on a “recognized” national exchange or (iii) it is not quoted on the NASDAQ Global Market or has a price less than $5.00 per share. The principal result or effect of being designated a “penny stock” is that securities broker-dealers participating in sales of our common stock are subject to the “penny stock” regulations set forth in Rules 15-2 through 15g-9 promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act. For example, Rule 15g-2 requires broker-dealers dealing in penny stocks to provide potential investors with a document disclosing the risks of penny stocks and to obtain a manually signed and dated written receipt of the document at least two business days before effecting any transaction in a penny stock for the investor's account. Moreover, Rule 15g-9 requires broker-dealers in penny stocks to approve the account of any investor for transactions in such stocks before selling any penny stock to that investor. This procedure requires the broker-dealer to (i) obtain from the investor information concerning his or her financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives; (ii) reasonably determine, based on that information, that transactions in penny stocks are suitable for the investor and that the investor has sufficient knowledge and experience as to be reasonably capable of evaluating the risks of penny stock transactions; (iii) provide the investor with a written statement setting forth the basis on which the broker-dealer made the determination in (ii) above; and (iv) receive a signed and dated copy of such statement from the investor, confirming that it accurately reflects the investor's financial situation, investment experience and investment objectives. Compliance with these requirements may make it more difficult and time consuming for holders of our common stock to resell their shares to third parties or to otherwise dispose of them in the market or otherwise.
 
FINRA sales practice requirements may limit a shareholder’s ability to buy and sell our common shares.
 
In addition to the “penny stock” rules described above, FINRA has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low-priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer’s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common shares, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock and have an adverse effect on the market for our shares.

Rule 144 sales in the future may have a depressive effect on the company's stock price as an increase in supply of shares for sale, with no corresponding increase in demand will cause prices to fall.
 
All of the outstanding shares of common stock held by the present officers, directors, and affiliate stockholders are "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.  As restricted shares, these shares may be resold pursuant to an effective registration statement or under the requirements of Rule 144 or other  applicable exemptions from  registration  under  the  Securities Act of 1933  and  as  required  under  applicable  state securities laws.  Rule 144 provides in essence that a person who is an affiliate or officer or director who has held restricted securities for six months may, under certain conditions, sell every three months, in brokerage transactions, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of 1.0% of a Company's issued and outstanding common stock. There is no limit on the amount of restricted securities that may be sold by a non-affiliate after the owner has held the restricted securities for a period of six months if the Company is a current reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A sale under Rule 144 or under  any  other  exemption  from the Securities Act of 1933,  if  available,  or  pursuant  to subsequent  registration of shares of common stock of present stockholders,  may have a  depressive  effect upon the price of the common stock in any market that may develop.  
 
Future issuances of shares for various considerations including working capital and operating expenses will increase the number of shares outstanding which will dilute existing investors and may have a depressive effect on the company's stock price.
 
There may be substantial dilution to our shareholders purchasing in future offerings as a result of future decisions of the Board to issue shares without shareholder approval for cash, services, payment of debt or acquisitions.
 
There may in all likelihood be little demand for shares of our common stock and as a result investors may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all if they need to liquidate their investment.
 
There may be little demand for shares of our common stock on the OTC Bulletin Board, or OTC Markets.com, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or 
 
non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors,  including the fact that it is a small  company  which is  relatively  unknown to stock analysts,  stock brokers,  institutional  investors and others in the  investment  community that generate or  influence  sales  volume,  and that even if the Company came to the attention of such persons, they tend to be risk-averse and would be reluctant to follow an  unproven,  early stage  company such as ours or purchase or recommend the purchase of any of our Securities until such time as it became more seasoned and viable.  As a consequence, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in the Company's securities is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer which has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on the securities price.  We cannot give investors any assurance that a broader or more active public trading market for the Company's common securities will develop or be sustained, or that any trading levels will be sustained.  Due to these conditions, we can give investors no assurance that they will be able to sell their shares at or near ask prices or at all if they need money or otherwise desire to liquidate their securities of the Company.
 
Public disclosure requirements and compliance with changing regulation of corporate governance pose challenges for our management team and result in additional expenses and costs which may reduce the focus of management and the profitability of our company.
 
Changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and SEC regulations, have created uncertainty for public companies and significantly increased the costs and risks associated with accessing the U.S. public markets. Our management team will need to devote significant time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving standards for public companies, which will lead to increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities.
