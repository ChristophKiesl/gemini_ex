Company History and Recent Developments
 
Image Chain Group Limited, Inc.
 
Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. (formerly Have Gun Will Travel Entertainment, Inc.) was incorporated under the laws of Nevada on December 18, 2013, and initially sought to create reality television programming. References in this Report to “ICGL”, “Image Chain”, the “Company”, the “Registrant”, “we”, “our” or “us” are to Image Chain Group Limited, Inc.
 
On May 5, 2015, ICGL entered into a share exchange agreement (the “FDHG Exchange Agreement”) with Fortune Delight Holdings Group Ltd (“FDHG”) and Wu Jun Rui, on behalf of himself and certain other individuals who were to receive shares of ICGL pursuant to the FDHG Exchange Agreement (the “FDGH Shareholders”). On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in the FDHG Exchange Agreement, on May 5, 2015, Wu Jun Rui transferred all 50,000 shares of FDHG common stock, consisting of all of the issued and outstanding shares of FDHG, to ICGL in exchange for the issuance to the stockholders of FDHG of 59,620,000 shares of the Company’s common stock, par value $.001 per share (“Common Stock”) and 5,000,000 shares of the Company’s preferred stock, par value $.001 per share (“Preferred Stock”).
 
As a result of the closing of the FDHG Exchange Agreement, FDHG became the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary. FDHG, through its subsidiaries, manufactured and sold “Image Tea”-branded tea products from its tea garden in Yunnan Province.
 
On June 11, 2015, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation in order to change its name to Image Chain Group Limited, Inc. and to increase the authorized shares of Common Stock from 70,000,000 to 400,000,000. The name change was undertaken in order to more closely align with the operations of the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary, the increase in authorized Common Stock was undertaken to allow the Company to utilize the newly available shares to raise capital.
 
On or about November 15, 2016, FDHG disposed of its ownership of all operating assets, and as a result ICGL became a shell company, as defined by Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act (the “Disposition Event”). The Disposition Event is evidenced by a bought and sold note stamped by the Inland Revenue Department of Hong Kong, which we believe is a legally binding document.
 
On February 13, 2017, the Company filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada a Certificate of Correction (the “Certificate of Correction”) to correct a mistake made in the Company’s original Articles of Incorporation with regard to the Preferred Stock issued in connection with the FDHG Exchange Agreement. As a result, ICGL had 395,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 5,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. The Company subsequently entered into an agreement pursuant to which the holder of the Preferred Stock agreed to retire the Preferred Stock in exchange for receiving an equal number of shares of Common Stock of the Company. As of the date of this Report, that exchange of Preferred Stock for Common Stock has not yet occurred.
 
On May 1, 2017, upon recommendation of the Board of Directors, a majority of Image Chain’s common stockholders consented in writing to amendment of Image Chain’s Articles of Incorporation to (i) effect a reverse stock split on a 1 for 100 stock split basis from 400,000,000 authorized shares with a par value of $0.001 per share to 4,000,000 authorized shares with a par value of $0.001, and (ii) after the reverse stock split, to increase the authorized shares of Common Stock from 3,950,000 to 2,000,000,000 shares with a par value of $0.001 per share, and to decrease the authorized shares of Preferred Stock from 50,000 to zero (0). As of the date of this Report, the reverse stock split and increase in authorized shares have been completed, and the decrease in shares of Preferred Stock has not yet occurred, as a result 50,000 shares of Preferred Stock are authorized and outstanding.

Image P2P Trading Group Limited
 
Image P2P Trading Group Limited (“Image P2P”), a company organized under the laws of the British Virgin Islands, was incorporated on April 21, 2015. Asia Grand Will (“AGW”) was incorporated on March 18, 2017 in the Hong Kong SAR. AGW wholly owns Fuzhi Yuan (Shenzhen) Holdings Limited (“FYSZ”) which was established on June 20, 2017 in the PRC. FYSZ is a wholly owned foreign entity under PRC law. FYSZ wholly owns Jiangxi Fuzhiyuan Biotechnology Limited (“Fuzhiyuan Biotechnology”), which was established on January 5, 2013 in the PRC.

The Share Exchange
 
On November 14, 2017, Image Chain entered into a share exchange agreement (the “Exchange Agreement”) with Image P2P and the shareholders of Image P2P (the “Sellers”). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, the Sellers transferred all 50,000 shares of Image P2P outstanding common stock to the Company in exchange for 500,000,000 shares of Common Stock (the “Share Exchange”). As a result of the Share Exchange, Image P2P became the Company’s wholly-owned subsidiary. Image P2P, through its subsidiaries, is engaged in producing, marketing and selling tea polyphenol products, and is developing for production tea polyphenol-based products. Image P2P is located in the PRC.
 
The Share Exchange has been accounted for as a reverse- merger and recapitalization of Image Chain where Image Chain (the legal acquirer) is considered the accounting acquiree and Image P2P (the acquiree) is considered the accounting acquirer. As a result of this transaction, the Company is deemed to be a continuation of the business of Image P2P.
 
Accordingly, the accompanying consolidated financial statements are those of the accounting acquirer, Image P2P. The historical stockholders’ equity of the accounting acquirer prior to the share exchange has been retroactively restated as if the Share Exchange occurred as of the beginning of the first period presented.
 
As used in this Report, unless otherwise stated or the context clearly indicates otherwise, the terms “ICGL”, “Image Chain”, the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to Image Chain after having given effect to the acquisition of Image P2P.
 
Our authorized capital stock currently consists of 2,000,000,000 shares of Common Stock and 50,000 shares of Preferred Stock. Our Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Markets under the symbol “ICGL”.
 
Share Exchange and disposal of subsidiaries
 
On November 28, 2018, the Company entered into a Business Transfer Agreement and Share Exchange Agreement (the “Agreements”) with a group of the original shareholders of Image P2P (the “Image P2P Shareholding Group”), Image P2P and its subsidiaries. Pursuant to the Agreements, the Image P2P Shareholding Group will exchange 200,000 common shares of the Company for the one common share of Asia Grand Will Limited held by Image P2P. Asia Grand Will Limited is the holding company for the Company’s operations in the PRC. Also pursuant to the Agreements, the Image P2P Shareholding Group, Image P2P and Image P2P’s subsidiaries will transfer to the Company (i) all of its right, title and interest to the intellectual property, including copyrights, patents, trademarks, process technology and production know-how, of Image P2P and its subsidiaries, (ii) the exclusive distribution rights in the PRC and worldwide for all products of Image P2P and its subsidiaries, (iii) the exclusive right to all intellectual property developed by Image P2P and its subsidiaries in the future and (iv) the exclusive distribution rights in the PRC and worldwide for all products of Image P2P and its subsidiaries developed in the future.

Company Overview
 
On November 28, 2018, the Company disposed of Asia Grand Will Limited and its subsidiaries and hence has terminated its business of tea polyphenol products production and sales.
 
Currently, since the Sino-US trade war may affect the enterprises operating in China starting from 2018, the Company has gradually shifted its market target to Malaysia. It is seeking to develop business in healthy Halal food.
 
While we expect to focus on our efforts in the Halal Food License area, we will continue to seek new business opportunities with established business entities for merger with or acquisition of a target business in order to best protect our shareholder interests. In certain instances, a target business may wish to become our subsidiary or may wish to contribute assets to us rather than merge. We have not yet begun negotiations or entered into any definitive agreements in the Halal Food License business, or for any other potential new business opportunities, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into any definitive agreements.
 
We anticipate that the selection of a business opportunity in which to participate will be complex and without certainty of success. Business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex. Business opportunities that we believe are in the best interests of our company may be scarce, or we may be unable to obtain the ones that we want. We can provide no assurance that we will be able to locate compatible business opportunities.
 
Currently, we do not have a source of revenue. We are not able to fund our cash requirements through our current operations. We have been reliant on loans by affiliated and non-affiliated parties to provide financial contributions and services to keep our company operating. Further, we believe that our company may have difficulties raising capital from other sources until we locate a prospective merger candidate through which we can pursue our plan of operation. If we are unable to secure adequate capital to continue our acquisition efforts, our shareholders may lose some or all of their investment and our business may fail. We currently have no written or oral agreement from our majority shareholder to continue to provide financial contributions.
 
COVID-19 Outbreak
 
It is worth highlighting that, on March 16, 2020, Malaysia Prime Minister announced the implementation of Movement Control Order (“MCO”) under Control of Infectious Diseases Act 1988 and the Police Act 1967 to contain the spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”). Pursuant to the declaration, initial phase of the MCO effectively take place from March 18, 2020 to March 31, 2020 for a period of 14 days, and subsequently extended to May 12, 2020 with three 14-day MCO extensions declared by Malaysia Prime Minister.
 
Pursuant to the MCO, all government and private premises except those involved in essential supply of goods and services such as water, electricity, energy, telecommunications, postal, transportation, irrigation, oil, gas, fuel, lubricants, broadcasting, finance, banking, health, pharmacy, fire, prison, port, airport, safety, defense, cleaning, retail and food supply should be closed.
 
On May 1, 2020, Malaysia Prime Minister announced that Conditional Movement Control Order (“CMCO”), a relaxation of MCO will replaced existing MCO on May 4, 2020 onwards and scheduled to expire on original 4th MCO expiration date, May 12, 2020. On May 10, 2020, Malaysia Prime Minister announced that the CMCO will be extended for a period of 4 weeks from May 13, 2020 until June 9, 2020.
 
Pursuant to CMCO, most economic sectors and activities are allowed to operate while observing the business standard operation procedures such as in our case social distancing and recording the names and telephone numbers of customers and the dates of their visit.
 
On June 7, 2020, Malaysia Prime Minister announced that Recovery Movement Control Order (“RMCO”) would take place from June 10, 2020 to August 31, 2020, while preserving previous allowable economic activity, interstate travelling is now permissible. On August 28, 2020, Malaysia Prime Minister announced the extension of the RMCO by a further 4 months until 31 December, 2020.
 
On October 14, 2020, the National Security Council announced that Selangor, Kuala Lumpur and Putrajaya will be placed under CMCO for a period of 14 days to October 27, 2020.
 
On January 1, 2021, RMCO has been extended until March 31, 2021, following the risk assessment conducted by the Ministry of Health of Malaysia.
 
During the MCO, CMCO and RMCO period, we have minimized the operations and have stopped to seek new business opportunities with established business entities for merger with or acquisition of a target business. We expect the business activities will be resumed gradually.
