Item 1. Business.
Our Business
We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing engineered monoclonal antibody and cytokine therapeutics to treat patients with cancer and autoimmune diseases who have unmet medical needs. We are advancing a broad portfolio of clinical-stage drug candidates from our proprietary XmAb® technology platforms. We use our protein engineering capabilities to increase our understanding of protein structure and interactions and to design new XmAb technologies and development candidates with improved properties. In contrast to conventional approaches to antibody design, which focus on the segment of antibodies that interact with target antigens, our work is focused on the Fc domain, the part of an antibody that interacts with multiple segments of the immune system and controls antibody structure. The Fc domain is constant and interchangeable among antibodies, and our engineered Fc domains, the XmAb technology, can be readily substituted for natural Fc domains. 
Our protein engineering capabilities and XmAb technologies enable us and our partners to develop antibodies and biotherapeutic drug candidates with improved properties and function, which can provide innovative approaches to treating disease and potential clinical advantage over other treatment options. For example, our capabilities have enabled us to develop an antibody scaffold to rapidly create novel bispecific antibodies that bind two different targets simultaneously, creating entirely new biological mechanisms. Other applications of our XmAb technologies enhance antibody performance by increasing immune inhibitory activity, improving cytotoxicity, extending circulating half-life and stabilizing novel protein structures, such as engineered cytokines. Currently, there are two marketed drugs that have been developed with our XmAb technologies.
On July 31, 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved our partner MorphoSys’ Monjuvi® (tafasitamab-cxix) in combination with lenalidomide, for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) not otherwise specified, including DLBCL arising from low grade lymphoma, and who are not eligible for autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). This indication is approved under accelerated approval based on overall response rate. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in a confirmatory trial(s). We created and initially developed tafasitamab, which incorporates our XmAb Cytotoxic Fc Domain to enhance its tumor killing properties. Monjuvi is a registered trademark of MorphoSys AG.
Alexion's Ultomiris® (ravulizumab-cwvz) was first approved by the FDA in December 2018. It is now approved in the U.S., Europe and Japan for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and for the treatment of patients with atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Alexion used our Xtend™ Fc Domain to enhance the half-life of Ultomiris to allow for a longer duration of action, less frequent dosing and reduced patient burden of therapy compared to the previous generation therapy, Soliris®.
Our protein engineering capabilities allow us to continually explore new functionality in the Fc region, which provides us with opportunities to:

● | Create new technology platforms;
--+---------------------------------


● | Make new drug candidates for internal development or partnering opportunities; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy
Our goal is to become a leading biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing engineered biologic medicines to treat patients with severe and life-threatening diseases with unmet medical needs. Key elements of our strategy are to: 

1. | Advance the clinical development of our XmAb bispecific antibody and cytokine drug candidates. Our modular XmAb bispecific technology and protein engineering capabilities enable us to rapidly advance multiple drug candidates into clinical development. We and our partners are enrolling Phase 1 studies for seven of these candidates to treat patients with many different types of cancer, and an eighth, to be developed for patients with autoimmune disease, is expected to start a Phase 1 study in early 2021. We and our partners plan to advance additional bispecific antibodies and cytokines into clinical development in the future.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Build a large and diversified portfolio of XmAb drug candidates. We create new XmAb-engineered antibody and cytokine product candidates to exploit the novel mechanisms of action enabled by our XmAb technology platforms and advance them into our internal portfolio of preclinical and clinical-stage assets, or, if strategically appropriate, we license certain drug candidates to leading pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies.
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Leverage our protein engineering capabilities, XmAb technologies, and XmAb drug candidates with partnerships, collaborations, and licenses to generate revenue streams, create new drug candidates and combination treatments, and identify new indications for our pipeline of drug candidates.Generate revenue streams. The plug-and-play nature of our XmAb technologies and our ability to generate multiple drug candidates efficiently provides us opportunities to generate revenue from licensing and collaboration arrangements. In 2020, we received total proceeds of $165 million in upfront payments, milestone payments and royalties from such arrangements.Create new drug candidates and investigate novel combination therapies. We seek to leverage our XmAb technologies and drug candidates with partners to create novel drug candidates, including combination therapies. In 2020, we entered into separate agreements with Atreca, Inc. and The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center to create novel CD3 bispecific antibody drug candidates. We also entered into a clinical collaboration with MorphoSys AG and Incyte Corporation, in which we plan to conduct multiple clinical studies in B-cell lymphomas, combining our plamotamab drug candidate with tafasitamab in combination with lenalidomide. Identify new indications for our pipeline of drug candidates. In August 2020, we entered into a five-year strategic collaboration with MD Anderson. We will support Investigator Sponsored Trials (ISTs) in which MD Anderson's investigators may explore additional indications for our pipeline of candidates.

4. | Broaden the functionality of our XmAb technology platform. We are conducting further research into the function and application of antibody Fc domains in order to expand the scope of our XmAb technology platforms. We use the modularity of our XmAb bispecific Fc technology to build bispecific antibodies and cytokines in a variety of formats, recently introducing CD3 bispecific antibodies of a mixed valency format, the XmAb 2+1 bispecific antibody. XmAb 2+1 bispecific antibodies may preferentially kill tumor cells with high target expression which may be especially beneficial in designing antibodies that target solid tumors. Additionally, we have engineered CD28 bispecific antibodies to provide conditional CD28 co-stimulation of T cells, activating them when bound to tumor cells. Targeted CD28 bispecific antibodies may provide conditional co-stimulation of T cells, for example, to T cells recognizing neoantigens or in concert with CD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies.

5. | Continue to expand our patent portfolio protecting our XmAb technologies and XmAb candidates. We seek to expand our intellectual property estate and protect our XmAb technologies, our development programs, and product candidates by filing and prosecuting patents in the United States and other countries. Where appropriate we will seek expansion and extension of patents issued for our product candidates.

XmAb Bispecific Technologies
A distinguishing feature of our XmAb technologies arises from our modular approach to protein engineering. This provides us with flexibility to seek out new applications of the XmAb Bispecific Fc Domain and enables us to design new bispecific antibody and cytokine drug candidates with distinct and novel mechanisms-of-action. This approach is illustrated through the expansion of our portfolio of novel bispecific antibody and cytokine candidates. Our business, research, and clinical efforts are to develop and advance our XmAb bispecific technologies and our portfolio of bispecific antibodies and cytokines in oncology and autoimmune diseases.
CD3 candidates: our initial bispecific antibody candidates are designed to redirect T cells to tumor cells through the engagement of an antigen on tumor cells and CD3, an activating receptor on T cells. We are currently conducting Phase 1 studies for three CD3 bispecific antibody candidates: plamotamab, vibecotamab, and tidutamab.
We have expanded our T-cell redirecting CD3 class of bispecific antibodies to create the XmAb 2+1 bispecific antibody format, utilizing two identical tumor targeting domains and one CD3 targeting domain. The affinities for antigen binding are reduced, which allows for selective engagement and killing of high antigen-expressing tumor cells over low antigen-expressing normal cells. In preclinical models, XmAb 2+1 bispecific antibodies bound preferentially to tumor cells compared to normal cells and effectively recruited T cells to kill tumor cells selectively. We believe that these properties will be particularly important when developing bispecific antibodies against many solid tumor targets, which can have poor tolerability because such targets are often expressed on a range of normal tissues, including critical organs. Our initial candidate using the XmAb 2+1 format is XmAb819, an ENPP3 x CD3 bispecific antibody, and we expect to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application in 2021.
CD28 candidates: T cells in the tumor microenvironment require both T cell receptor (TCR) and co-stimulatory receptor engagement to achieve full activation. CD28 is a key immune co-stimulatory receptor on T cells; however, the ligands that activate T cells through CD28 are often not expressed on tumor cells. Targeted CD28 bispecific antibodies may provide conditional co-stimulation of T cells, for example, to T cells recognizing neoantigens or in concert with CD3 T-cell engaging bispecific antibodies. We have engineered XmAb bispecific antibodies to provide conditional CD28 co-stimulation of T cells, activating them when bound to tumor cells, and we are conducting preclinical studies of internal CD28 candidates. Under our collaboration with Janssen Biotech, Inc., we are applying our XmAb bispecific Fc technology to create and characterize CD28 bispecific antibody candidates against a prostate tumor target.
TME activator candidates: we expanded the functionality of our bispecific Fc platform with a suite of tumor microenvironment (TME) activators that have been designed to promote tumor-selective T-cell activation by targeting multiple checkpoints or co-stimulating receptors. These candidates incorporate our Xtend technology for longer half-life. We are currently conducting Phase 1 studies for three TME activator candidates: XmAb717, XmAb841 and XmAb104.
Cytokine candidates: we have expanded the use of our bispecific Fc platform to engineer novel cytokine candidates, which are not antibodies but fusions of a heterodimeric Fc domain and immune signaling proteins. Our cytokine candidates are potency tuned to improve therapeutic index and incorporate our Xtend technology for longer half-life. XmAb306 (RO7310729), formerly XmAb24306, is an IL-15/IL-15Ra-Fc fusion, which we believe is a promising candidate for oncology combination therapies, and our partner Genentech is conducting a Phase 1 dose-escalation study. A second IL-15 cytokine candidate, which is engineered with a target-specific binding arm for immune cell targeting, is also being explored in preclinical studies.
XmAb564 is a wholly owned IL-2-Fc fusion that we intend to develop for the treatment of patients with autoimmune diseases. In January 2021, the IND application for XmAb564 was allowed by the FDA, and we plan to initiate a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers for this candidate in early 2021.

We continue to invest in our protein engineering efforts to identify novel technologies and drug candidates.
Other XmAb Fc Technologies
We have also designed additional XmAb Fc technologies and XmAb drug candidates. We have successfully partnered our technologies and many drug candidates, and we will continue to seek additional partnering and licensing opportunities for these technologies and candidates. Additional XmAb Fc domains include:

1. | Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain – selective immune inhibition and rapid target clearance, targeting the receptor FcγRIIb;
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Cytotoxic Fc Domain – increased cytotoxicity, targeting the receptors FcγRIIIa on natural killer (NK) cells and FcγRIIa on other immune system cells; and
---+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Xtend™ Fc Domain – extended antibody half-life, targeting the receptor FcRn on endothelial cells.
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Drug Candidates in Clinical Development
Currently 20 drug candidates in clinical development have been engineered with one or more of our Fc technologies, and one incorporates our DN-TNF technology. Ten of the candidates that are being advanced by us and our partners have been engineered with our bispecific Fc domain for dual targeting and are bispecific antibody and cytokine candidates; one candidate in clinical development incorporates our immune inhibitor Fc domain, and seven candidates incorporate our cytotoxic or Xtend Fc domains.

XmAb Bispecific Fc Drug Candidates
Currently 10 drug candidates that have been engineered with our bispecific Fc domain are in clinical development. Six candidates are wholly owned and are being evaluated by us in Phase 1 studies. We are co-developing two candidates with partners. In addition, partners are advancing two bispecific antibody candidates through clinical development. Additional candidates are advancing through the preclinical stages of development. Drug candidates with our bispecific Fc domain, both bispecific antibodies and cytokines, in clinical development include:

1. | Plamotamab is a bispecific antibody that targets CD20, an antigen on B-cell tumors, and CD3, an activating receptor on T cells. In February 2017, we dosed the first patient in an open-label, Phase 1, multiple-dose, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of plamotamab in patients with B-cell malignancies. At the ASH Annual Meeting in December 2019, we presented preliminary safety and anti-tumor activity of plamotamab, including from patients with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL). We are enrolling patients in the ongoing dose-escalation study, and we are planning to initiate additional studies for plamotamab in 2021 including a Phase 1/2 study evaluating the combination of

2. | XmAb717 is a bispecific antibody that targets PD-1 and CTLA-4, two immune checkpoint receptors, to selectively activate the tumor microenvironment, and it is being developed in multiple types of solid tumors, including for patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer. In July 2018, we dosed the first patient in an open-label Phase 1 dose-escalation and expansion study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb717 in patients with selected solid tumors.We presented updated data from the study at the Annual Meeting of the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) in November 2020. In the study's escalation phase, a dose of 10 mg/kg was identified as the recommended dose for the multi-cohort, parallel-group expansion phase, based on an observation of consistent proliferation of both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells, indicative of dual checkpoint blockade, and a complete response (CR) in one patient with melanoma. At the data cut off on September 30, 2020, 89 patients had been treated at the recommended dose in five dose expansion cohorts that enrolled patients with melanoma (n=20), renal cell carcinoma (RCC, n=11), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC, n=20), castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC, n=18) and other cancers without approved checkpoint therapies (n=20). XmAb717 was generally well-tolerated, and the most common treatment-related adverse events were immune-related adverse events (irAEs); however, rates of irAEs, including colitis, were lower than typically observed with CTLA-4 blockade. With exceptions for rash and increases in transaminases, other Grade 3 or higher irAEs were reported for no more than three patients each. The efficacy analysis included 42 evaluable patients at the recommended dose level. A complete response was observed in a patient with melanoma (1/10), and partial responses were observed in multiple tumor types, including melanoma (2/10), RCC (1/4), NSCLC (2/14), CRPC (1/4), and ovarian cancer (1/5). The objective response rate across cohorts was 19.0% (8/42). Across the expansion cohorts, approximately half of evaluable patients had at least 10% tumor shrinkage from baseline assessments, and nearly all these reductions occurred in patients with prior checkpoint inhibitor treatment. The median duration of response was 119 days at the time of the data cut off, and 24 patients remained on treatment. Of nine patients with prostate cancer who had baseline and follow-up prostate-specific antigen (PSA) assessments, one achieved a PSA reduction of greater than 50 percent. Two additional patients achieved reductions of greater than 30 percent, one of whom had an unconfirmed partial response by RECIST. Six of these nine patients remained on therapy as of the cut-off date.In the first half of 2021, we plan to initiate a Phase 1b study of XmAb717 for patients with certain molecular subtypes of CRPC, as a monotherapy or in combination depending on the subtype, as these patients represent a high unmet medical need.

​

3. | Vibecotamab is a bispecific antibody that targets CD123, an antigen on acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells and leukemic stem cells, and CD3, an activating receptor on T cells. It is being developed in collaboration with our partner Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, Inc. (Novartis) and is being evaluated in a Phase 1 study. In September 2016, we dosed the first patient in an open-label, multiple-dose, dose escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of vibecotamab in patients with relapsed or refractory AML and other CD123-expressing hematologic malignancies. The study is ongoing, and additional patients are being enrolled.We presented updated data from the study at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2020. At data cut off on October 28, 2020, 112 heavily pretreated patients with relapsed or refractory AML had received vibecotamab. Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was the most common toxicity occurring in 61% of patients (n=68), and 9% of patients (n=10) experienced CRS at Grade 3 or higher. The majority of CRS was observed in the first dose and was generally manageable with premedication. Additional mitigation measures included selecting a lower priming dose, avoiding weekly dose step-up, and more frequent dosing in the first week to allow a higher cumulative exposure and to avoid the potential CD123 antigen sink. There was no evidence of drug related myelosuppression. Neurological events were infrequent and primarily Grade 1 and Grade 2 headaches. The efficacy analysis included 54 evaluable patients who received a dose of at least 0.75 mcg/kg, completed at least the first cycle of treatment and had at least one post-treatment disease assessment.

Two patients achieved complete remission (CR), and three patients achieved a CR with incomplete hematologic recovery. Additionally, two patients reached a morphologic leukemia-free state, and one patient experienced partial remission, as assessed by the investigator. The overall response rate (ORR) was 15% (n=8/54). Biomarker analyses suggest that low baseline leukemic burden and low PD-1 expression on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are independent predictors of response. Seven responders had a baseline blast count less than or equal to 25% blasts in bone marrow. The ORR increased to 26% (n=7/27) when using this threshold to define the population with low disease burden for the analyses.In 2021, pending final dose escalation data and agreement with our partner, Novartis, we plan to initiate additional clinical studies evaluating vibecotamab.

​

4. | Tidutamab is a bispecific antibody that targets somatostatin receptor 2, or SSTR2, a target on many neuroendocrine-like tumor types, and CD3. In February 2018, we dosed the first patient in an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of tidutamab in patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET) or gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST).
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​
In October 2020, we presented initial dose-escalation data in patients with NETs at the North American Neuroendocrine Tumor Society’s 2020 Multidisciplinary NET Medical Virtual Symposium (NANETS). Tidutamab was generally well tolerated at the recommended dose identified for the expansion portion of the study, a 0.3 mcg/kg priming dose and subsequent 1.0 mcg/kg repeated doses. Analysis of peripheral blood biomarkers indicated that tidutamab induced acute and sustained T-cell activation at the recommended dose for expansion. The analysis also indicated a dose-dependent increase in proliferation and activation markers on CD8-positive effector T cells, which is consistent with tidutamab's mechanism of action. Fourteen patients, including 12 across the first three dose-escalation cohorts and two in the expansion cohort, were included in the analysis to describe clinical activity. The best overall response was stable disease, with a disease control rate of 43% and a median duration of treatment of approximately seven months. Completion of enrollment in the expansion cohort and longer follow-up are required to evaluate progression-free survival and the clinical utility of tidutamab in this NET patient population. 
​
Because tidutamab induced sustained activation of cytotoxic T cells and engagement of the SSTR2 target, as designed, and has an encouraging safety profile, we plan to initiate a clinical study for tidutamab in patients with Merkel cell carcinoma and small cell lung cancer, SSTR2-expressing tumor types known to be responsive to immunotherapy, in early 2021. 
​

5. | XmAb841 is a bispecific antibody that targets CTLA-4 and LAG-3, also an immune checkpoint receptor, and is being developed in multiple oncology indications. We are advancing XmAb841 in combination with an anti-PD-1 drug to create a triple checkpoint blockade. In May 2019, we dosed the first patient in an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb841 in patients with selected solid tumors. We are enrolling patients to a single-agent dose-escalation portion cohort and a cohort combining XmAb841 with pembrolizumab.

6. | XmAb104 is a bispecific antibody that targets PD-1 and ICOS, an immune co-stimulatory receptor, and is being developed in multiple oncology indications. In May 2019, we dosed the first patient in a an open-label, Phase 1, dose-escalation study to assess the safety, tolerability, and preliminary anti-tumor activity of XmAb104 in patients with selected solid tumors. We continue to enroll patients with select solid tumors in the Phase 1 dose escalation study.

We believe a broad combination development strategy will be critical to realize the potential of IL-15 cytokines like XmAb306 in oncology. In February 2019, we entered into a research and license agreement with Genentech, Inc. and F. Hoffmann-LaRoche Ltd. (collectively Genentech), to develop and commercialize novel IL-15 cytokine therapeutics, whereby the companies are co-developing XmAb306 and other potential IL-15 programs.

XmAb Immune Inhibitor Fc Candidates
AIMab7195 (XmAb7195) uses our XmAb Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain and is designed to reduce blood serum levels of IgE, which mediates allergic responses and allergic disease. In February 2020, we licensed this drug candidate to Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc., now a wholly owned subsidiary of Nestlé S.A., which is advancing the candidate in clinical studies for allergic indications.
Obexelimab targets CD19 with its variable domain and uses our XmAb Immune Inhibitor Fc Domain, which is designed to inhibit the function of B cells, an important component of the immune system. We believe that obexelimab has the potential to address a key unmet need in autoimmune diseases due to its combination of potent reversible B-cell inhibition without B-cell depletion, enabling the immune system to resume natural function once treatment is no longer needed. We are exploring opportunities to continue development of obexelimab with partners. 
XmAb Cytotoxic Fc and Xtend Candidates
Currently, one drug engineered with our Xtend Fc Domain and one drug we engineered with our XmAb Cytotoxic Fc Domain are marketed commercially by partners. In addition, our partners are advancing eight clinical programs with antibodies engineered with XmAb technologies through clinical development: three programs are in Phase 3, one program is in Phase 2, and four programs are in Phase 1. Other partners are conducting preclinical studies of drug candidates engineered with these XmAb technologies.

Market Opportunity
Our drug candidates that use the XmAb bispecific Fc domain, including plamotamab, XmAb717, vibecotamab, tidutamab, XmAb841, XmAb104 and XmAb306: We are developing our bispecific antibody and cytokine candidates to treat cancer. Cancer is a broad group of diseases in which cells divide and grow in an uncontrolled fashion, forming malignancies that can invade other parts of the body, and it is the second leading cause of death in the United States (U.S.). The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2021 there will be approximately 1.9 million new cases of cancer and approximately 608,570 deaths from cancer. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimated that based on growth and aging of the U.S. population, medical expenditures for cancer in the year 2020 were projected to reach at least $158.0 billion (in 2010 dollars).

Intellectual Property
The foundation for our XmAb technology and our product candidates and partnering is the generation and protection of intellectual property for novel antibody and cytokine therapeutics. We combine proprietary computational methods for amino acid sequence design with laboratory generation and testing of new antibody and cytokine compositions. Our design and engineering team prospectively assesses, with patent counsel, the competitive landscape with the goal of building broad patent positions and avoiding third-party intellectual property. 
As a pioneer in Fc domain engineering, we systematically scanned the structure of the Fc domain to discover Fc variants. We have filed patent applications relating to thousands of specific Fc domain variants with experimental data on specific improvements of immune function, pharmacokinetics, structural stability, and novel structural constructs. We have filed additional patent applications derived from these applications as we discover new properties of the Fc variants and as new business opportunities arise. We continually seek to expand the intellectual property coverage of our technology and candidates and invest in discovering new Fc domain technologies, antibody product candidates, and cytokine product candidates.
Our patent estate, on a worldwide basis, includes over 1,000 issued patents and pending patent applications which we own, with claims directed to XmAb Fc domains, all of our clinical and preclinical stage product candidates and our computational protein design methods and platforms. We also have a large number of issued patents and pending patent applications with claims directed specifically to our XmAb technology and candidates. 
The patent expiration in the U.S. and major foreign countries (ex-U.S.) for our key technologies and drug candidates is set forth below. We have pending applications filed that may extend the exclusivity of some of our technology and products:

The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension for FDA-approved drugs, including biological products, of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. Patent extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our pharmaceutical product candidates receive FDA approval, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on patents covering those products. We intend to seek patent term extensions to any of our issued patents in any jurisdiction where these are available, however there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and even if granted, the length of such extensions.
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Healthcare and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act (collectively the ACA) created a regulatory scheme authorizing the FDA to approve biosimilars via an abbreviated licensure pathway. In many cases, this allows biosimilars to be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators. Under the ACA, a manufacturer may submit an application for licensure of a biologic product that is "biosimilar to" or "interchangeable with" a previously approved biological product or "reference product." The "biosimilar" application must include specific information demonstrating biosimilarity based on data derived from: (1) analytical studies, (2) animal studies, and (3) a clinical study or studies that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in one or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed, except that FDA may waive some of these requirements for a given application. Under this new statutory scheme, an application for a biosimilar product may not be submitted to the FDA until four years after the date of first licensure. The FDA may not approve a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was first licensed. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biological products. Even if a product is considered to be a reference product eligible for exclusivity, another company could market a competing version of that product if the FDA approves a full Biologics License Application (BLA) for such product containing the sponsor's own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity, and potency of their product. There have been recent proposals to repeal or modify the ACA and it is uncertain how any of those proposals, if approved, would affect these provisions.
In addition to patent protection, we rely on trade secret protection and know-how to expand our proprietary position around our technology and other discoveries and inventions that we consider important to our business. We seek to protect this intellectual property in part by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors, clinical investigators, and other contractors and also by requiring our employees, commercial contractors, and certain consultants and investigators, to enter into invention assignment agreements that grant us ownership of certain discoveries or inventions made by them. 
Further, we seek trademark protection in the United States and in certain other jurisdictions where available and when we deem appropriate. We have obtained registrations for the Xencor trademark, as well as certain other trademarks, which we use in connection with our pharmaceutical research and development services and our clinical-stage products, including XmAb, PDA, Protein Design Automation, Proteins By Design and Antibodies By Design. We currently have registrations for Xencor and PDA in the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Community, and Japan, for Protein Design Automation in the United States, Australia, Canada and the European Community, and for XmAb in the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Community and Japan.
Third Party Vendors and Suppliers
Our internal research activities are focused on early research stage and preclinical activities and studies. We rely on third party vendors, suppliers and contractors for all other research, development and clinical activities. We are able to internally manufacture the quantities of our product candidates required for relatively short preclinical animal studies. We believe that this allows us to accelerate the drug development process by not relying on third parties for all of our manufacturing needs. We have adopted a manufacturing strategy of contracting with third parties in accordance with current good manufacturing practices (cGMPs) for the manufacture of drug substance and product, including our pipeline of bispecific antibody and cytokine development candidates and also our obexelimab development candidate. We have used third party manufacturers for all our bispecific antibody and cytokine candidates which include: 

19



vibecotamab, plamotamab, tidutamab, XmAb717, XmAb841, XmAb104, XmAb306, and XmAb564. Additional contract manufacturers are used to fill, label, package and distribute investigational drug products. This allows us to maintain a more flexible infrastructure while focusing our expertise on developing our products. Obexelimab is produced by mammalian cell culture of a Chinese hamster ovary cell line that expresses the antibody, followed by multiple purification and filtration steps typical of those used for monoclonal antibodies. We do not have any long-term manufacturing agreements in place and will ultimately depend on contract manufacturers for the manufacture of our products for commercial sale, as well as for process development. We have successfully completed clinical trials with subcutaneous formulations for obexelimab which have been manufactured with third party contract manufacturers. In February 2020, we entered into a License, Development and Commercialization Agreement for XmAb7195 (Aimmune Agreement) with Aimmune Therapeutics, Inc. (Aimmune). Under the Aimmune Agreement, Aimmune will assume all future manufacturing of XmAb7195.
 KBI Biopharma, Inc.
In July 2014, we entered into a master services agreement (KBI Agreement) with KBI Biopharma, Inc. (KBI). We have engaged KBI under the KBI Agreement for process development, clinical scale-up, analytical method development, formulation development, and other services related to drug substance and drug product for our bispecific antibody and cytokine development candidates: vibecotamab, plamotamab, tidutamab, XmAb717, XmAb841, XmAb104, XmAb306, and XmAb564 in accordance with cGMP regulations. For each bispecific program, we have entered into a separate agreement with the terms and conditions of services and payment. The KBI Agreement is for a three-year term but is automatically extended on an annual basis until the services are completed. The KBI Agreement may be terminated by either party for a breach that is not remedied within 30 days after notice or 60 days after notice of the existence of an incurable scientific or technical issue that renders KBI unable to render services under the KBI Agreement, by after 60-day notice, or in the event of a bankruptcy of a party. For termination other than a material breach by KBI, we must pay for all services conducted prior to the termination and to wind down the activities.
 Cell Line Agreements with Selexis
In December 2015, we entered into a master service agreement (Selexis Agreement) with Selexis SA (Selexis) for the manufacture of Selexis cell lines. Under the terms of the Selexis Agreement, Selexis will manufacture cell lines for the antibody candidates provided by us and upon completion of the cell lines, we have the option to take an unrestricted commercial license to the cell line. The terms of each commercial license require us to make payments upon achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones and we will also pay royalties based on a percentage of net sales for products that are derived from or utilize the Selexis cell line. The royalty is less than 1%.
Selexis has manufactured cell lines for all our bispecific antibody and cytokine drug candidates, and we currently have commercial licenses to the Selexis cell line for the following bispecific antibody and cytokine candidates: vibecotamab, plamotamab, tidutamab, XmAb717, XmAb841, XmAb104, XmAb306 and XmAb564.
 License Agreements with BIO-TECHNE 
In February 2015, we entered into a license agreement with BIO-TECHNE Corporation (BIO-TECHNE) for a non-exclusive license to certain antibody technology including monoclonal antibodies which recognize human somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2). The variable domain of this antibody is incorporated in our tidutamab drug candidate. Under the terms of this agreement, we made an upfront payment and are obligated to make payments upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones, and royalties based on a percentage of net sales from products that are derived from the tidutamab program. The royalty is less than 1%.
We entered into a second agreement with BIO-TECHNE effective February 2018 for a non-exclusive license to a certain recombinant monoclonal antibody reactive with human programmed death protein, PD-1 antibody. We expect to use this protein in certain of our oncology drug candidates. Under the terms of this agreement, we made an upfront payment and are obligated to make payments upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestones, and royalties based on a percentage of net sales from products that are derived from the PD-1 antibody. The royalty is 1%.

Umbrella Development Services Agreement with Patheon Biologics LLC
In September 2018, we entered into an Umbrella Development Services Agreement (Patheon Agreement) with Patheon Biologics LLC (Patheon). Under the terms of the Patheon Agreement, any of the affiliates within the global network of service sites in Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.’s Pharma Services Group may perform clinical manufacturing and development services for us in accordance with cGMP regulations. The Patheon Agreement includes a statement of work for Patheon to provide process transfer, process development and cGMP manufacturing to support our obexelimab program. The Patheon Agreement may be terminated by either party for a breach or default that is not remedied within 30 days, or such other time period as may be reasonably necessary to remedy such breach after receiving notice of the breach from the non-breaching party or if the other party is subject to an insolvency event. We have the unilateral right to terminate the Patheon Agreement upon 30 days written notice to Patheon for any business reason, subject to cancellation fees. Patheon has the unilateral right to terminate the Patheon Agreement if we request to reschedule work beyond 120 days, the project work is not progressing according to our expectations and we cannot agree on appropriate changes, after six months of inactivity on a project at our request or if Patheon determines it is unable to perform its obligations in a safe and effective way in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. 
Patheon is currently conducting process transfer, process development and cGMP manufacturing for our obexelimab program and process development and cGMP manufacturing for our XmAb819 program.
Competition
We compete in an industry that is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. Our competitors include pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, academic institutions, and other research organizations. We compete with these parties for promising targets for antibody-based therapeutics, new technology for optimizing antibodies and cytokines, and in recruiting highly qualified personnel. Many competitors and potential competitors have substantially greater scientific, research, and product development capabilities as well as greater financial, marketing and sales, and human resources than we do. In addition, many specialized biotechnology firms have formed collaborations with large, established companies to support the research, development, and commercialization of products that may be competitive with ours. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than we may be in developing, commercializing, and achieving widespread market acceptance. In addition, our competitors’ products may be more effective, more effectively developed, or more effectively marketed and sold than any treatment we or our development partners may commercialize, which may render our product candidates obsolete or noncompetitive before we can recover the expenses related to developing and commercializing any of our product candidates.
Competition in the field of cancer drug development is intense, with hundreds of compounds in clinical trials. Many large pharmaceutical companies and other smaller biotechnology companies are developing competing bispecific antibody platforms, and many of these companies have advanced multiple drug candidates into clinical development, including Amgen Inc.; Genmab A/S; Macrogenics, Inc.; Merus N.V.; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Roche Holding AG; and Zymeworks Inc.
We are developing bispecific antibody drug candidates engineered to direct cytotoxic T cell killing of tumor cells, by engaging the CD3 receptor on T cells and an antigen on tumor cells. Regarding plamotamab, other companies developing CD3 bispecific antibodies directed to CD20, an antigen expressed on many blood tumors, include AbbVie Inc. and Genmab A/S; IGM Biosciences, Inc.; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and Roche Holding AG. Other antibodies, antibody drug candidates and cell therapies are in development or approved to treat patients with non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Regarding vibecotamab, other companies developing CD3 bispecific antibodies directed to CD123, an antigen expressed on myeloid tumors, include Aptevo Therapeutics Inc. and Macrogenics, Inc.
We are also developing several bispecific antibody drug candidates engineered to selectively engage the immune system in order to treat patients with cancer, such as XmAb717, XmAb841 and XmAb104. Immuno-oncology is a competitive field within the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and most large pharmaceutical companies are developing drug candidates, have marketed medicines in this space, or both: AstraZeneca plc; Bristol-Myers Squibb Company; GlaxoSmithKline plc; Merck & Co., Inc.; Novartis AG; Pfizer Inc.; Roche Holding AG; and Sanofi S.A. 

21



While tuning the binding affinities plays a crucial role in designing the mechanism of action for this class of bispecific antibody, smaller companies advancing clinical programs that, like XmAb717, dually target the immune checkpoint receptors PD-1 and CTLA-4 include Akeso, Inc. and Macrogenics, Inc. 
Several companies are developing engineered cytokines intended to activate specific immune cell populations in order to treat patients with cancer and/or autoimmune diseases, including Alkermes plc; Amgen Inc.; Cue Biopharma, Inc.; Cytune Pharma; Eli Lilly and Company; IGM Biosciences, Inc.; ImmunityBio, Inc.; Kadmon Holdings, Inc.; Medicenna Therapeutics Corp.; Nektar Therapeutics, Inc.; Neoleukin Therapeutics, Inc.; Novartis AG; Pandion Therapeutics, Inc.; Roche Holding AG; Sanofi S.A.; Sutro Biopharma, Inc.; and Xilio Therapeutics, Inc.
In addition, we are aware of a number of other companies with development stage programs that may compete with the drug candidates we and our licensees are developing in the future. We anticipate that we will face intense and increasing competition as new treatments enter the market and advanced technologies become available.
Regulatory Overview
Our business and operations are subject to a variety of U.S. federal, state and local and foreign supranational, national, provincial and municipal laws, regulations and trade practices. The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing, and distribution of drugs and biologics. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate research and development activities and the testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, recordkeeping, approval, advertising and promotion, and export and import of our product candidates.
U.S. Government Regulation
We are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. and other countries. Regulation by government authorities is a significant factor in the development, manufacture, distribution and ongoing research activities. All our products in development will require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, drugs and biologic products are subject to rigorous preclinical studies and clinical trials and other approval procedures of the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in foreign countries. The process of obtaining these approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal and state statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Various federal and state statutes and regulation also govern or influence testing, manufacturing, safety, labeling, storage, tracking, tracing and record-keeping of drugs and biologic products and their marketing. 
U.S. Drug Development Process
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FDCA), its implementing regulations, and other laws including, in the case of biologics, the Public Health Service Act. Our product candidates are subject to regulation by the FDA as a biologic. Biologics require the submission of a BLA to the FDA and approval of the BLA by the FDA before marketing in the United States. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals for commercial sale and distribution and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions. These sanctions could include the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, license suspension or revocation, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold on clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production, or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil and/or criminal penalties. The process required by the FDA before a biologic may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:

1. | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies, and formulation studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s current Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) regulations;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

22




2. | submission to and acceptance by the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials in the United States may begin;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with the FDA’s current good clinical practices (GCP) regulations to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use;
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | submission to and acceptance by the FDA of a BLA;
---+--------------------------------------------------


5. | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection (if the FDA deems it as a requirement) of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the product is produced to assess compliance with the FDA’s cGMP regulations to assure that the facilities, methods, and controls are adequate to preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity;
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


6. | potential audits by the FDA of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA;
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


7. | potential review of the BLA by an external Advisory Committee to the FDA, whose recommendations are not binding on the FDA; and
---+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


8. | FDA review and approval of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Before testing any compounds with potential therapeutic value in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, stability, and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential toxicity and activity of the product candidate. Clinical trials involve the administration of the product candidate to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the clinical trial sponsor’s control. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and effectiveness. The FDA or responsible Institutional Review Board may place a trial on hold at any time related to perceived risks to patient safety. Phases of clinical development include:

1. | Phase 1. The product candidate is initially introduced into a limited population of healthy human subjects, or in some cases, patients with the disease for which the drug candidate is intended, and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, and excretion. In the case of some products for some diseases, or when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients with the disease or condition for which the product candidate is intended to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2. | Phase 2. The product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population (but larger than in Phase 1) to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted indications, and to assess dosage tolerance, optimal dosage, and dosing schedule.
---+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


3. | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage and provide substantial evidence of clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population (such as several hundred to several thousand) at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. Phase 3 clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. Generally, two adequate and well-controlled Phase 3 clinical trials are required by the FDA for approval of a BLA.
---+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


4. | Post Approval. Clinical trials or other post-approval commitments may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These studies are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication and may be required by the FDA as a condition of approval.
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

23



Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the biologic and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. 
U.S. Review and Approval Processes
The results of product development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests, proposed labeling, and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more specified indications. The standard time for the FDA to accept a BLA submission is two months.
If the FDA determines that the BLA is substantially complete, it will accept the BLA for review.
Once accepted, the FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe and effective for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to assure and preserve the product’s identity, strength, quality, and purity, and it may inspect the manufacturing facilities to assure cGMP compliance and clinical sites used during the clinical trials to assure cGMP compliance. The standard FDA review process is 10 months once a BLA is accepted for review, but it can take longer. During the review process, the FDA also will determine whether a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS prior to approval. A REMS can substantially increase the costs of obtaining approval. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA will issue a complete response letter describing deficiencies in the BLA and recommend actions if the agency decides not to approve the BLA. The applicant will have to address all of the deficiencies which could take substantial time to address. 
If the product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages, or the indications for use may otherwise be limited and may require that certain contraindications, warnings, or precautions be included in the product labeling. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing studies, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 testing, which involves clinical trials designed to further assess drug safety and effectiveness and may require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Post-Approval Requirements
Any biologic products for which we or our collaborators receive FDA approvals are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, cGMP compliance for product manufacture, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse experiences with the product, providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information, product sampling and distribution requirements, complying with certain electronic records and signature requirements, and complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among others, restrictions on direct-to-consumer advertising, promoting biologics for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Failure to comply with these or other FDA requirements can subject a manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as product reclass, warning letters, suspension of manufacturing, seizure of product, injunctive action, mandated corrective advertising or communications with healthcare professionals, possible civil or criminal penalties, or other negative consequences, including adverse publicity.

24



U.S. Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of any of our biologic product candidates, we may apply for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years for one patent per product as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process of that product. The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. 
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications of other companies seeking to reference another company’s BLA. Specifically, the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act established an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products generally not earlier than 12 years after the original BLA approval. The abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as “interchangeable” based on their similarity to existing brand product. 
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Pricing and Reimbursement
The cost of pharmaceuticals continues to generate substantial governmental and third-party payor interest. We expect that the pharmaceutical industry will experience pricing pressures due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of managed care organizations and additional legislative proposals. 
Healthcare Reform
In the United States and foreign jurisdictions, there have been and will continue to be a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our product candidates profitably, once they are approved for sale. Among policy makers and payors in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.
Other Healthcare Laws and Compliance Requirements
In the United States, the research, manufacturing, distribution, sale and promotion of drug products and medical devices are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, other divisions of Health and Human Services (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, state Attorneys General, and other state and local government agencies. 
Europe / Rest of World Government Regulation
In addition to regulations in the United States, we, and our collaborators, will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical trials and any commercial sales, marketing and distribution of our products, similar or more stringent than the U.S. laws.
Whether or not we, or our collaborators, obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In addition, we and our collaborators may be subject to foreign laws and regulations and other compliance requirements, including, without limitation, anti-kickback laws, false claims laws and other fraud and abuse laws, as well as laws and regulations requiring transparency of pricing and marketing information and governing the privacy and security of health information, such as the European Union’s Directive 95/46 on the Protection of Individuals with regard to the Processing of Personal Data.

25



If we, or our collaborators, fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
