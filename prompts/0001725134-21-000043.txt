(“DMS Inc.”) is a digital performance marketing company offering a diversified lead and software delivery platform that drives high value and high intent leads to its customers. As used in this Annual Report, the “Company” refers to DMS Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, (including its wholly-owned subsidiary, CEP V DMS US Blocker Company, a Delaware corporation (“Blocker”)). The Company is headquartered in Clearwater, Florida, with satellite offices throughout the United States and Canada. The Company primarily operates and derives most of its revenues in the United States.
Leo Holdings Corp. (“Leo”), a special purpose acquisition company, was incorporated on November 29, 2017 as a Cayman Islands exempted company for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination involving the Company and one or more businesses. On July 15, 2020, Leo consummated a transaction structured similar to a reverse recapitalization (the “Business Combination”) and domesticated as a corporation incorporated in the state of Delaware. At the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing”), Leo acquired the equity in Blocker and a portion of the equity of Digital Media Solutions Holding, LLC (“DMSH”), Blocker became the sole managing member of DMSH, and Leo was renamed Digital Media Solutions, Inc.
The Business Combination was structured as a reverse recapitalization. The historical operations of DMSH are deemed to be those of the Company. Thus, the financial statements included in this Annual Report reflect: (i) the historical operating results of DMSH prior to the Business Combination; (ii) the combined results of the Company following the Business Combination; (iii) the assets and liabilities of Leo at historical cost; and (iv) the Company’s equity and earnings (loss) per share for all periods presented.

Recent Business Acquisitions
Our acquisitions in the past few years have enabled us to expand our reach into high quality proprietary targeted media solutions in a wide range of industries and include the following.
On July 16, 2020, we purchased substantially all assets and business of SmarterChaos for cash and equity of DMSH totaling approximately $5.8 million. We believe this acquisition has created expanded media distribution, allowing the Company to further accelerate the digital marketing acquisition efforts of our advertiser customers and enable brands to acquire new customers by leveraging our customer acquisition platform and the relationships cultivated by the SmarterChaos team.
On November 1, 2019, we purchased substantially all assets and business of UE Authority Co. (“UE”) for cash of approximately $56.6 million. UE generates and purchases leads, clicks or calls for sale to its carriers and agent customers. Post-acquisition, UE was rebranded to DMS Insurance, a component of the Marketplace reportable segment. Through the acquisition of UE, we launched into the digital insurance advertising marketplace as a key player with a comprehensive suite of products that connect high-intent consumers with our nation’s largest auto, home, health and life insurance providers, allowing for continued expansion in the insurance vertical.
Human Capital

Our people are vital to our success in the digital marketing services industry. As a human-capital business, the long-term success of our firm depends on our people. We strive to make our employees feel as though they are a number one priority before other interests of the Company. Our goal is to ensure that we have the right talent, in the right place, at the right time. We do that through our commitment to attracting, developing and retaining our associates.
We strive to attract individuals who are people-focused and share our values. We have competitive programs dedicated to selecting new talent and enhancing the skills of our associates. In our recruiting efforts, we strive to have a diverse group of candidates to consider for our roles. To that end, we have strong relationships with a variety of industry associations that represent diverse professionals and with diversity groups on university and college campuses where we recruit. 
We have designed a compensation structure, including an array of benefit plans and programs, that we believe is attractive to our current and prospective associates. We also offer our associates the opportunity to participate in a variety of professional and leadership development programs. Our program includes a variety of industry, product, technical, professional, business development, and leadership trainings. 
We seek to retain our associates by using their feedback to create and continually enhance programs that support their needs. We have formal annual goal setting and performance review processes for our employees. We have a values-based culture, an important factor in retaining our associates, which is memorialized in a culture “blueprint” that is communicated to all associates. Our training to share and communicate our culture to all associates plays an important part in this process. We are committed to having a diverse workforce, and an inclusive work environment is a natural extension of our culture. We have recently renewed our commitment to ensuring that all our associates feel welcomed, valued, respected and heard so that they can fully contribute their unique talents for the benefit of clients, their careers, our firm and our communities. 
We take a proactive approach to philanthropy and driving meaningful change in the world, holding ourselves accountable to leading by example. On an individual level, we provide paid time-off opportunities for volunteering or donating to a cause that matters to each person. On a corporate level, we follow our carbon negative promise, and have ongoing Charity Mile Challenges, whereby each person gains charitable contributions through activities. We monitor and evaluate various turnover and attrition metrics throughout our management teams. Our annualized voluntary turnover is relatively low, as is the case for turnover of our top performers, a record which we attribute to our strong values-based culture, commitment to career development, and attractive compensation and benefit programs.
Since our technologies can be securely accessed remotely, during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we transitioned to a fully remote workforce. Ongoing feedback from employee surveys indicate that our talent has embraced, and prefers to continue, working in a remote environment. We have prioritized virtual communications, wellness programs, and work-life balance adaptation that has increased engagement and supports our trust-first mentality. Recognizing safety as a priority, once safe to return, our people will have the opportunity to work at our headquarters.
The Company is headquartered in Clearwater, Florida with nearly 400 employees as of December 31, 2020 .
Disaggregation of Revenue 
The Company has three material revenue streams, which represents disaggregation of services for: (1) customer acquisition, (2) managed services and (3) software services (“SaaS”). 
•Customer acquisition - The process of identifying and cultivating potential customers (also known as near customers or leads) for customer’s business products or services through impressions, clicks and direct messaging (email, sms and push) based on predefined qualifying characteristics specified by the customer. Revenue is earned based on the cost per action (“CPA”) defined within the executed insertion order (“IO”) and/or agreed to with the customer.
•Managed Services - The management of a customer’s marketing spend and performance, through the utilization of proprietary software delivery platform. Revenue in certain cases, is earned based on a percentage (%) of the customer’s total media spend, which is recognized as a net revenue, while other revenue is recognized on a gross basis.
•Software Services (“SaaS”) - The application of propriety performance marketing software, which tracks lead counts, sources and channels, pricing and overall spend for each client. The software allows online real-time management of marketing activities and spend to attract potential applicants, sourced through various digital online methods. Revenue is earned by licensing the software to customers under a Software Services (“SaaS”) based contract.
Segments Revenue 
We classify our operations into three reportable segments: Brand Direct, Marketplace and Other. Under the Brand Direct reportable segment, revenues are earned from fees we charge to our customers when we advertise directly for them under their 
brand name. In servicing our customers under this reportable segment, the end consumer of our customer interacts directly with our customer and does not interface with the Company at any point during the transaction process. Under the Marketplace reportable segment, we earn revenues from fees we charge to our customers when we advertise their business under our brand name. The end consumer interfaces directly with our brand and may be redirected to our customer based on information obtained during the transaction process. Under the Other reportable segment, we earn revenues from fees for other services provided to our customers such as the management of digital media services on behalf of our customers as well as SaaS.
Revenue is recognized when control of goods or services is transferred to customers, in amounts that reflect the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for those goods and services. Upon satisfaction of the associated performance obligation, the Company recognizes revenue.
Industry Overview
The Company operates as a digital performance marketing engine for companies across numerous industries, including insurance, consumer finance, e-commerce, home services, brand performance, health and wellness and education & career placements. We also operate in managed services that provide better access and control over the advertising spend of our customers, including marketing automation and SaaS. The vertical agnostic brand direct solutions approach allows the number of verticals we serve to expand the Total Addressable Market (“TAM”), and the balance of business across these industries protects our revenue stream from unpredictable market shifts, which we believe, in comparison, is a significant risk faced by vertical-specific, marketplace only companies.
Business Strategies
The Company is a premier digital performance-based marketing company offering a diversified customer leads and software delivery platform that drives high value, high intent leads to our customers. We are a major contributor to the structural shift from traditional media to the online and digital arena currently ongoing in the advertising industry. Through our cutting-edge technologies and multi-faceted platforms, the Company enables advertising customers to more closely track, monitor and adjust marketing campaigns based on their return on investment.
Competition
The Company is a brand-direct solutions provider that offers a diversified set of advertising and customer acquisition solutions to a wide variety of industries, most comparable to adtech firms such as The TradeDesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:TTD) and LiveRamp Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: RAMP). As a complement to our industry-agnostic offerings, the Company has also developed marketplace solutions that are more vertically oriented to key markets such as insurance, finance, education, health and wellness, which are most comparable to marketplaces offered by EverQuote, Inc. (NASDAQ: EVER), SelectQuote, Inc. (NYSE: SLQT), LendingTree, Inc. (NASDAQ: TREE), QuinStreet, Inc. (NASDAQ: QNST), CarGurus, Inc. (NASDAQ: CARG), and eHealth, Inc. (NASDAQ: EHTH) but with less risk exposure to a single industry.
Customer Concentration
No customer accounted for more than 10% of our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We market for advertisers on our platform primarily through utilizing impressions, ad clicks, direct messaging to consumers, leads, and email to sales conversions, directly measuring results and providing accountability. Our initial contract terms for Customer acquisition are typically one to three months, Managed services are typically signed for one-month terms with auto-renewal for subsequent period and revenue by licensing the Software to customers under SaaS based contracts, which is typically one-month with auto-renewal for subsequent months. The large majority of our customers pay monthly. Our services are billed on a monthly basis for the services provided in the previous month. Our pricing method reflects the price and quantities for the service provided, which is driven by the volume of customer acquisition, includes access to our direct service, technical support and managed services infrastructure. We generally recognize revenues from our leads, services and software platform ratably over the contractual term of the arrangement. We do not charge third party suppliers who are on our platform to transact with our customers. We believe this approach helps attract more suppliers to our platform and increases the value of our platform.
Our Business 
Management of high quality targeted media sources
In the digital marketing solutions industry, it is essential that advertising service providers are able to acquire and retain high quality media sources that attract targeted users for advertiser customers on a large scale at low cost. This can be particularly challenging given the dynamic nature of the media resources available to advertising service providers. Frequent updates in search engine algorithms and consolidation of media sources result in high costs of retaining high quality media sources. This, combined with high levels of competition by a large number of service providers, drives up costs within the advertising industry.
To combat this challenge, we have formed strategic partnerships through acquisitions with other advertising and proprietary media marketing software providers to increase our access to high quality targeted media. Our acquisitions of W4 Holding Company, LLC and UE provide us access to proprietary software to drive meaningful engagement with advertising targets.
Regulation
Federal, state and industry-based regulations impact the businesses of our customers and in turn impact our revenues. Increased regulations can cause customers to reduce their expenditures and thus, their advertising budgets, which can potentially lower our revenues.
Macroeconomic conditions
During 2020, the U.S. economy increasingly suffered the adverse effects of the COVID-19 economic and health crisis. Macroeconomic factors, such as the level of interest rates, credit availability and the level of unemployment, including during economic downturns and global pandemics, could all have an adverse impact on our customers’ costs of services and their demand for our services and our revenues. Any difficulties faced by our customers due to hardships in the economy could cause a reduction in their advertising budgets as they seek to manage expenses in general.
Conversely, to an extent, we believe that the digital media advertising industry is also counter-cyclical to macroeconomic conditions since some customers increase their advertising and promotion efforts in times where consumers are more difficult to acquire. This enables us to ease the downward impact on our revenues during a downturn in the economy.
Our technologies can be securely accessed remotely, which put us in a good position to seamlessly transition to operating our business remotely during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Feedback from employee surveys indicate that our employees have embraced and prefer to continue to work in a remote environment, which caused us to look into a more flexible working environment. During the third quarter in 2020, management analyzed our leases and closed certain office locations and will continue to analyze the Company’s capacity needs into the fourth quarter and beyond.
