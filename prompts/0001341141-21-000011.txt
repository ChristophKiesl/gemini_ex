ITEM 1.BUSINESS
General 
CatchMark Timber Trust, Inc. ("CatchMark Timber Trust") (NYSE: CTT) owns and operates timberlands located in the United States and has elected to be taxed as a REIT for federal income tax purposes. CatchMark Timber Trust acquires, owns, operates, manages, and disposes of timberland properties directly, through wholly-owned subsidiaries, or through joint ventures. We strive to deliver consistent and predictable per-share cash flow growth from disciplined acquisitions, active management, sustainable harvests, and well-timed real estate sales. We intend to grow over time through selective acquisitions and investments in high-demand fiber markets and to efficiently integrate new acquisitions and investments into our operations. Operationally, we focus on generating cash flows from sustainable harvests and improved harvest mix on high-quality industrial timberlands, as well as opportunistic land sales, asset management fees and rent from hunting and recreational leases to provide recurring dividends to our stockholders. We continue to practice intensive forest management and silvicultural techniques that improve the biological growth of our forests.
We also seek to create additional value by entering into joint ventures with long-term, institutional equity partners to opportunistically acquire, own, and manage timberland properties that fit our core investment strategy. In April 2017, we entered into our first joint venture, the Dawsonville Bluffs Joint Venture, with MPERS. In July 2018, we entered into the Triple T Joint Venture with a consortium of institutional investors. Our joint venture platform drives growth through our fee-based management business that leverages our scale and timberland management efficiencies. 
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our revenues from timber sales, timberland sales, asset management fees, and other non-harvest related sources, as a percentage of our total revenue, are set forth in the table below: 

 | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Timber sales | 69 | % | | 68 | % | 71 | %
Timberland sales | 15 | % | | 17 | % | 18 | %
Asset management fees | 12 | % | | 11 | % | 6 | %
Other revenues | 4 | % | | 4 | % | 5 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Current Timberland Holdings
As of December 31, 2020, we wholly owned interests in 408,200 acres of high-quality industrial timberlands consisting of 16.6 million tons of merchantable timber inventory. Of the wholly-owned timberlands, 390,100 acres were located in four states in the U.S. South and 18,100 acres were located in Oregon. Our timberlands have been intensively managed for sustainable commercial timber production and are located within attractive and desirable fiber baskets encompassing a diverse group of pulp, paper and wood products manufacturing facilities. 
In addition to our wholly-owned timber assets, as of December 31, 2020, we owned the common limited partnership interest in the Triple T Joint Venture, which owns 1.1 million acres of high-quality industrial East Texas timberlands with an estimated 44.1 million tons of merchantable timber inventory, and we owned a 50% membership interest in the Dawsonville Bluffs Joint Venture, which owns a mitigation bank with a book basis of $2.3 million as of December 31, 2020. 
Please refer to Item 2 — Properties for more details on our timber and timberland properties.
Our Business and Growth Strategies
Our objective is to produce cash flow and value growth through the ongoing implementation of the following business and growth strategies: 
Actively Manage Our Timberlands for Long-Term Results. We seek to maximize long-term returns by actively managing our timberlands to achieve an optimum balance among biological timber growth, current harvest cash flow, and responsible environmental stewardship. Further, we expect to continue making investments in forest technology, including improved seedlings, in order to increase the sustainable yield of our timberlands over the long-term. 
Maximize Profitability on Timber Sales. We actively manage our log merchandising efforts together with delivered and stumpage sales with the goal of achieving the highest available price for our timber products. We compete with other timberland owners on the basis of the quality of our logs, the prices of our logs, our reputation as a reliable supplier, and our ability to meet customer specifications. We will continue to work diligently and proactively with our third-party contractors with a view towards optimizing our logging, hauling, sorting, and merchandising operations to extract the maximum profitability from each of our logs based on the foregoing considerations. 
Pursue Attractive Timberland Acquisitions. We seek to identify and acquire high-quality industrial timberland properties, with our average deal size ranging from 2,500 to 25,000 acres. Critical evaluation of prospective property acquisitions is an essential component of our acquisition strategy. When evaluating acquisition opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the prospective timberland property or properties, including, but not limited to:
•Local market dynamics (supply/demand balance);
•Predominantly softwood merchantable inventory mix;
•Merchantable inventory/mix (tons per-acre);
•Sustainable productivity (on a tons per-acre, per-year basis);
•Quality of existing and prospective customers; and
•Target cash yields (near-term/long-term).
We expect our transaction pipeline to continue to be driven by timber fund portfolio rebalancing and private owner liquidations. 
We may enter into fiber supply agreements with respect to acquired properties in order to ensure a steady source of demand for our incremental timber production. 
Opportunistically Sell Timberland Assets. We continuously assess potential alternative uses of our timberlands, as some of our properties may be more valuable for development, conservation, recreational or other rural purposes than for growing timber. We intend to capitalize on the value of our timberland portfolio by opportunistically monetizing timberland properties. When evaluating our land sale opportunities, we assess a full range of matters relating to the timberland property or properties, including, but not limited to:
•Inventory stocking below portfolio average;
•Predominantly hardwood merchantable inventory mix; and
•Poor productivity.
The close proximity of our existing timberlands to several major population centers provides us with opportunities to periodically sell parcels of our land at favorable valuations. We generally expect to sell approximately 2% of our fee timberland acreage on an annual basis pursuant to our land sales program, although such results may vary. We may also decide to pursue various land entitlements on certain properties in order to realize higher long-term values on such properties.
From time to time, we also sell blocks of timberland properties under a capital recycling program in order to generate proceeds to fund capital allocation priorities, including, but not limited to, redeployment into more desirable timberland investments, paying down outstanding debt, or repurchasing shares of our common stock. Such large dispositions are not part of core operations, are infrequent in nature, and may or may not have a higher or better use than timber production or result in a price premium above the land’s timber production value. Timberland disposition opportunities under our capital recycling program are evaluated based in part on inventory stocking and mix profiles, productivity characteristics, geographical diversification and procurement and operating areas.
Create Value Through Joint Ventures. We seek to create additional value through institutional equity joint ventures to acquire, own, and manage timberland properties that meet our core investment strategy. The timberland properties acquired through the Triple T Joint Venture and the Dawsonville Bluffs Joint Venture fit our profile for high quality assets with excellent stocking. Additionally, we have established and expanded our investment management business by managing the day-to-day operations of both joint ventures and earning asset management fee income, which supports our dividend and growth strategy. 
Practice Sound Environmental Stewardship. We remain committed to responsible environmental stewardship and sustainable forestry. Our wholly-owned timberlands and timberlands held by the Triple T Joint Venture, have been third-party audited and certified in accordance with the 2015-2019 SFI standards (extended through December 2021). SFI standards promote sustainable forest management through recognized core principles, including measures to protect water quality, biodiversity, wildlife habitat and at-risk species. Our timberlands are further managed to meet or exceed all state regulations through the implementation of best management practices as well as internal policies designed to ensure compliance. We believe our continued commitment to environmental stewardship will allow us to maintain our timberlands’ productivity, grow our customer base, and enhance our reputation as a preferred timber supplier. 
Financing Strategy
Our long-term financing strategy seeks to maximize balance sheet liquidity and operational flexibility for the purpose of generating current income and attractive long-term returns for our stockholders. We intend to employ prudent amounts of debt and equity financing as a means of providing additional funds for the selective acquisitions of timber assets, to refinance existing debt, or for general corporate purposes. In particular, we seek to maximize balance sheet liquidity and flexibility by:
•Maintaining sufficient liquidity through borrowing capacity under our credit facilities and cash-on-hand;
•Minimizing the amount of near-term debt maturities in a single year;
•Maintaining low to modest leverage; 
•Managing interest rate risk through an appropriate mix of fixed and variable rate debt instruments, either directly or using interest rate swaps, caps or other arrangements; and
•Maintaining access to diverse sources of capital.
We determine the amount of debt and equity financing to be used when acquiring an asset by evaluating terms available in the credit markets (such as interest rate, repayment provisions and maturity), our cost of equity capital, and our assessment of the particular asset’s risk. Historically, a significant portion of our debt has consisted of long-term borrowings secured by our timber assets. 
We anticipate that we will continue to use a number of different sources to finance our operations and selective acquisitions going forward, including cash from operations, proceeds from asset dispositions, funds available under bank credit facilities (which may or may not be secured by our assets), co-investments through partnerships or joint ventures, potential future issuances of common or preferred equity or partnership interests in our operating partnership, or any combination of these sources, to the extent available to us, or other sources that may become available from time to time. 
Transaction Activities
We executed the following transactions during the three years ended December 31, 2020:
Acquisitions
We did not acquire any additional timberlands during 2020, consistent with our capital allocation priorities during the year. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we acquired 900 acres and 18,100 acres of timberlands, respectively. The properties acquired are well stocked with merchantable timber inventory, located in high-demand mill markets, and complement our existing timberland portfolio. Together, they added 724,400 tons to our merchantable timber inventory, averaging 38 tons per acre, comprised of 89% pine plantations by acreage and 79% sawtimber by tons. Our timberland ownership expanded into the Pacific Northwest in 2018. 
On July 6, 2018, we invested $200.0 million in the Triple T Joint Venture in exchange for a common limited partnership interest, exclusive of transaction costs. The Triple T Joint Venture acquired 1.1 million acres of East Texas industrial timberlands (the "Triple T Timberlands") for $1.39 billion. The Triple T Timberlands contained an estimated 38.0 million tons of merchantable timber inventory as of the date of acquisition. On June 24, 2020, we invested an additional $5.0 million of equity in connection with amendments to a sawtimber supply agreement between the Triple T Joint Venture and GP, as well as the joint venture agreement and asset management agreement. See Note 4 — Unconsolidated Joint Ventures of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information. 
Land Sales
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we sold 9,300, 9,200, and 8,500 acres of timberland, respectively, in the U.S. South. These land sales represented approximately 2.3%, 2.2%, and 1.8%, respectively, of our average fee timberland acreage (based on average quarterly fee timberland acreage) for each year. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, the disposed timberlands had an average merchantable timber stocking of 26, 37 and 26 tons per acre, respectively, as compared to 42, 43 and 42 tons per acre for our U.S. South portfolio at the beginning of each respective year.
Large Dispositions
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we completed large dispositions of 14,400, 14,400 and 56,100 acres of wholly-owned timberlands for $21.3 million, $25.4 million and $79.3 million, respectively. These large dispositions represented approximately 3.4%, 3.4% and 11.9% of our average fee timberland acreage (based on average quarterly fee timberland acreage) for each year. The net proceeds received from these large dispositions were used to pay down our outstanding debt. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, 
the large dispositions had an average merchantable timber stocking of 29, 37 and 32 tons per acre, as compared to 42, 43 and 42 tons per acre for our U.S. South portfolio at the beginning of each respective year. 
Timber Agreements
Mahrt Timber Agreements
We are party to a master stumpage agreement and a fiber supply agreement (collectively, the “Mahrt Timber Agreements”) with a wholly-owned subsidiary of WestRock. The master stumpage agreement provides that we will sell specified amounts of timber and make available certain portions of our timberlands to CatchMark TRS for harvesting. The fiber supply agreement provides that WestRock will purchase a specified tonnage of timber from CatchMark TRS at specified prices per ton, depending upon the type of timber product. The prices for the timber purchased pursuant to the fiber supply agreement are negotiated every two years but are subject to quarterly market pricing adjustments based on an index published by TimberMart-South, a quarterly trade publication that reports raw forest product prices in 11 southern states. The initial term of the Mahrt Timber Agreements is October 9, 2007 through December 31, 2032, subject to extension and early termination provisions. The Mahrt Timber Agreements ensure a long-term source of supply of wood fiber products for WestRock in order to meet its paperboard and lumber production requirements at specified mills and provide us with a reliable consumer for the wood products from its timberlands. 
For the year ended December 31, 2020, WestRock purchased 409,000 tons under the Mahrt Timber Agreements, which exceeded the annual minimum requirement of 380,800 tons. WestRock has historically purchased tonnage that exceeded the minimum requirement under Mahrt Timber Agreements. See Note 7 — Commitments and Contingencies of our accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the material terms of the Mahrt Timber Agreements. 
We derived approximately 11%, 12%, and 17% of our net timber sales revenue from the Mahrt Timber Agreements in each of the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. For 2021, WestRock is required to purchase at least 380,800 tons and we are committed to make available for purchase by WestRock a minimum of 443,200 tons of timber under the Mahrt Timber Agreements. 
Carolinas Supply Agreement
We assumed a pulpwood supply agreement with IP (the "Carolinas Supply Agreement") in connection with a timberland acquisition completed in 2016. The Carolinas Supply Agreement is effective through November 3, 2026 and requires us to sell agreed-upon pulpwood volumes to IP and IP is required to purchase these volumes at defined market prices. 

We sold 73,200 tons of timber under the Carolinas Supply Agreement in 2020. We derived approximately 2%, 4%, and 5% of our net timber sales revenue from the Carolinas Supply Agreement in 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively. For 2021, IP is required to purchase at least 65,500 tons and we are committed to make available for purchase by IP a minimum of 88,600 tons of timber under the Carolinas Supply Agreement. 
Credit Risk of Customers
For the year ended December 31, 2020, our largest customer, WestRock, represented 15% of our total revenues. No other customer represented more than 10% of our total revenues. The loss of WestRock as a customer would have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We sold timber to 74 customers in 2020, compared to 69 in 2019 and 67 in 2018.
We are not aware of any reason why our current customers will not be able to pay their contractual amounts as they become due in all material respects. 
Competition 
We compete with various private and industrial timberland owners as well as governmental agencies that own or manage timberlands in the U.S. South and the Pacific Northwest. Due to transportation and delivery costs, pulp, paper and wood products manufacturing facilities typically purchase wood fiber within a 100-mile radius of their 
location, which thereby limits, to some degree, the number of significant competitors in any specific regional market. Factors affecting the level of competition in our industry include price, species, grade, quality, proximity to the mill customer, and our reliability and consistency as a supplier. Also, as we seek to acquire timberland assets, we are in competition for targeted timberland tracts with other similar timber investment companies, as well as investors in land for purposes other than growing timber. As a result, we may have to pay more for the timberland tracts to become the owner if another suitable tract cannot be substituted. When it becomes time to dispose of timberland tracts, we will again be in competition with sellers of similar tracts to locate suitable purchasers of timberland. 
Seasonality
Our harvest operations are affected by weather conditions, where wet weather could reduce our harvest volume but boost prices due to limited supply, while dry weather could suppress prices due to increases in supply.
COVID-19 Pandemic
See Part II, Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our business.
Regulatory Matters 
See Item 1A — Risk Factors, Risk Related to Our Business and Operations for discussions of regulatory matters, including environmental matters that impact our business. 
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had 25 employees, all of whom were full-time and based in the United States. We care about our employees and recognize that they are key to our success.
Protection from Harassment, Discrimination and Retaliation. We believe that all individuals should be treated with dignity and respect, and have adopted a Human Rights Policy that, among other things, includes a No Harassment Policy that does not tolerate discriminatory harassment of any sort, including based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, pregnancy, childbirth, or related medical conditions, gender identity, sexual orientation, genetic information, citizenship status, service member status or any other characteristic protected by federal, state or local anti-discrimination laws. We also value and protect an employee's right to raise workplace issues without concern for retaliation. We believe our employee relations are good and we have policies and procedures in place to quickly address and remedy employee grievances and any workplace disputes.
Diversity and Inclusion. We value diversity in the workplace. As of December 31, 2020, 50% of our executive officers were women and 48% of our total number of employees were women. Approximately 20% of our workforce is comprised of individuals that identify as a member of an ethnic or racial minority group. 
Health and Safety. We are committed to providing and maintaining a safe and healthy workplace for all workers (including vendors, contractors, temporary employees and volunteers) as well as clients, visitors and members of the public. Risks and hazards to health and safety will be eliminated or minimized, as far as is reasonably practicable. We have adopted a Health and Safety Policy in furtherance of this commitment. During the year ended December 31, 2020, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented additional safety protocols to protect our employees and others, including protocols regarding social distancing, health checks and working remotely. Our experienced teams adapted quickly to the changes and have managed our business successfully during this challenging time. 
Benefits, Training and Professional Development. We provide high-quality benefits to our employees, including healthcare and wellness initiatives, and a 401(k) plan with a generous company match, time-off for volunteering, and a charitable matching program. We also provide regular training and professional development opportunities for our employees. These include semi-annual, company-wide information security training programs, as well as personal coaching for all officers and executives, and opportunities to attend conferences and other events relevant to the timberland, forest products and REIT industries.
Scholarship Program. In 2020, we established the Willis J. Potts, Jr. scholarship program for our employees. This program was established to honor Willis J. Potts, Jr., who was a director on our Board beginning in 2006 and our 
Chairman of the Board from 2013 until 2020, when he retired. This scholarship program is administered through our scholarship committee and awards are granted to non-officer employees and without regard to race, color, creed, religion, orientation, gender, disability or national origin. 
Low Turnover Rate. We believe that all of our initiatives to make CatchMark an exceptional place to work have resulted in our low turnover rate, which was 3.92% in 2020 and averaged 3.92% annually over the past three years.
