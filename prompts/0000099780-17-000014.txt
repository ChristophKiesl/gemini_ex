We serve our customers through the following five business groups: 
Rail Group. Through wholly-owned subsidiaries with manufacturing facilities in the U.S. and Mexico, our Rail Group is a leading manufacturer of freight and tank railcars in North America used for transporting a wide variety of liquids, gases, and dry cargo (the “Rail Group”).
The Rail Group offers a complete array of railcar solutions to our customers. We are capable of manufacturing a full line of railcars, including:
Autorack Cars - Autoracks and flatcars transport finished automobiles, SUV's, and light trucks.
Box Cars - Box cars carry a wide variety of bulk cargo such as auto parts, paper, and food products.
Covered Hopper Cars - Covered hopper cars transport commodities such as industrial sand and cement, grain products, dry fertilizer, and plastics. Pressure differential covered hopper cars carry products such as flour and starch.
Gondola Cars - Rotary gondola cars are primarily used for coal service. Other gondola cars carry bulk commodities such as scrap metal, aggregates, ores, and finished steel.
Intermodal Cars - Intermodal cars transport shipping containers in single or double stacked configurations as well as truck trailers.
Open Hopper Cars - Open hopper cars are used to transport coal, aggregates, and other similar products.
Tank Cars - Non-pressurized tank cars transport a wide variety of liquid commodities including chemicals, food products, and petroleum products. Pressurized tank cars are used to transport liquefied gases.
Our Rail Group is capable of manufacturing a diversified railcar product line, allowing us to capitalize on changing industry trends and developing opportunities in various markets including the energy, chemical, agriculture, automotive, and construction markets. Through plants in Mexico and the U.S., we are a leading manufacturer of railcar axles and coupling devices in North America and also manufacture and sell a variety of other railcar parts and components used in manufacturing and repairing railcars. We provide railcar maintenance services at multiple facilities in the U.S.
Our customers include railroads, leasing companies, and industrial shippers of products, such as utilities, petrochemical companies, grain shippers, agricultural product companies, and major construction and industrial companies. We compete in the North American market primarily against five major railcar manufacturers.

For the year ended December 31, 2016 we shipped 27,240 railcars, or 42% of total North American railcar shipments. As of December 31, 2016, our Rail Group backlog consisted of 29,220 railcars valued at $3.0 billion. This amount included approximately $0.9 billion in orders from our Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group (“Leasing Group”). The orders in our backlog from the Leasing Group are fully supported by lease commitments with external customers. The final amount dedicated to the Leasing Group may vary by the time of delivery as customers may alternatively choose to purchase railcars as external sales from the Rail Group. 
We hold patents of varying duration for use in our manufacture of railcars and components. We believe patents offer a marketing advantage in certain circumstances. No material revenues are received from the licensing of these patents.
Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group. Our Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group is a leading provider in North America of comprehensive rail industry services. Through wholly-owned subsidiaries, primarily Trinity Industries Leasing Company ("TILC"), and partially-owned subsidiaries, TRIP Rail Holdings LLC (“TRIP Holdings”) and RIV 2013 Rail Holdings LLC ("RIV 2013"), we offer operating leases for tank and freight railcars. Trinity's Rail Group and TILC coordinate sales and marketing activities under the registered trade name TrinityRail®, thereby providing a single point of contact for railroads and shippers seeking rail equipment and services.
In addition, TILC originates and manages railcar leases for third-party investor-owned funds and provides fleet maintenance and management services to industrial shippers. Our affiliations with third-party investor-owned funds, through strategic railcar alliances and the formation of railcar investment vehicles, combined with TILC's fleet maintenance and management services capabilities, complement our leasing business by generating stable fee income, strengthening customer relationships, and enhancing the view of TrinityRail® as a leading provider of railcar products and services. 
The railcars in our lease fleet are leased to industrial shippers and railroads. These companies operate in various markets including the chemical, agricultural, automotive, and energy industries. Substantially all of the railcars in our lease fleet were manufactured by our Rail Group. The terms of our railcar leases generally vary from one to twenty years and provide for fixed monthly rentals, predominantly under full-service leases. A small percentage of our fleet is leased on a per diem basis. As of December 31, 2016, the lease fleet of our subsidiaries included 85,110 owned or leased railcars that were 97.6% utilized. Of this total, 75,550 railcars were owned by TILC or its affiliates and 9,560 railcars were financed in sale-leaseback transactions. Total railcars under management including those managed for third-parties totaled 103,840 railcars.
Our railcar leasing businesses compete against a number of well-established entities that are also in the business of leasing railcars.
Construction Products Group. Through wholly-owned subsidiaries, our Construction Products Group manufactures highway products as well as other primarily-steel products for infrastructure-related projects; and mines and produces construction aggregates. Many of these lines of business are seasonal and revenues are impacted by weather conditions and fluctuations in government spending levels.
Our highway products business is a leading U.S. manufacturer of guardrail, crash cushions, and other barriers. The Federal Highway Administration, which determines product eligibility for cost reimbursement using federal funds, has approved many of our products as eligible for federal-aid reimbursement based on satisfactory performance testing pursuant to criteria established under either the National Cooperative Highway Research Program Report 350 or the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware, as applicable. Our crash cushion, barrier, and guardrail products include multiple proprietary products manufactured under license from certain public and private research organizations and inventors as well as Company-held patents. We sell highway products in Canada, Mexico, and throughout the U.S., and we export highway products, including proprietary products, internationally. The Company does not perform any installation services with respect to its highway products, except minimally in Mexico. We compete against several national and regional highway products manufacturers.
We are a leading producer and distributor of lightweight and natural construction aggregates, including expanded shale and clay; crushed stone; sand and gravel; asphalt rock; and various other products in the Western and Southwestern U.S. Our construction aggregates customers are concrete producers; commercial, residential, and highway contractors; manufacturers of masonry products; and state and local governments. We compete with lightweight construction aggregates producers nationwide and natural construction aggregates producers located in the regions where we operate. 
We also manufacture a line of trench shields and shoring products for the construction industry.
Inland Barge Group. Through wholly-owned subsidiaries, our Inland Barge Group is a leading U.S. manufacturer of inland barges and fiberglass barge covers. We manufacture a variety of dry cargo barges, such as deck barges, and open or covered hopper barges that transport various commodities, such as grain, coal, and aggregates. We also manufacture tank barges used to transport liquids including chemicals and a variety of petroleum products. Our fiberglass reinforced lift covers are used primarily for grain barges. Our barge manufacturing facilities are located along the U.S. inland river systems, allowing for rapid delivery to our customers. Our Inland Barge Group backlog as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $120.0 million.
4

Our primary Inland Barge customers are commercial marine transportation companies. Many companies have the capability to enter into, and from time to time do enter into, the inland barge manufacturing business. We strive to compete through operational efficiency, timely delivery, and quality products. We have a number of competitors for our products in this industry.
Energy Equipment Group. Through wholly-owned subsidiaries, our Energy Equipment Group manufactures structural wind towers; utility steel structures for electricity transmission and distribution; storage and distribution containers; cryogenic tanks; and tank heads for pressure and non-pressure vessels. 
We are a leading manufacturer in North America of structural wind towers used in the wind energy market. These towers are manufactured in the U.S. and Mexico to customer specifications and installed by our customers. Our customers are generally wind turbine producers. Our structural wind towers backlog as of December 31, 2016 was approximately $1.1 billion.
We are one of the leading manufacturers in North America of steel utility structures for electricity transmission and distribution, which are used principally by municipalities and other local and state governmental entities, as well as by public and private utilities. These structures are manufactured in the U.S. and Mexico to customer specifications and installed by our customers.
We are a leading manufacturer in North America of storage and distribution containers. We manufacture these products in the U.S., Mexico, and Canada. We market a portion of our products in Mexico under the brand name of TATSA®. Our storage and distribution containers support the oil, gas, and chemical industries and are used by industrial plants, utilities, residences, and small businesses in suburban and rural areas. Additionally, we manufacture fertilizer storage and distribution containers for bulk storage, farm storage, and the application and distribution of anhydrous ammonia. We also manufacture cryogenic tanks and trailers for the distribution of industrial gases and liquefied natural gas. Our storage and distribution container products range from nine-gallon containers for motor fuel use to 1.8 million-gallon bulk storage spheres. We sell our storage and distribution containers to dealers and large industrial users. We generally deliver storage and distribution containers to our customers who install and fill the containers. Our competitors include large and small manufacturers of storage and distribution containers. Additionally, we manufacture and sell oil and gas process and storage equipment.
We also manufacture tank heads, which are pressed metal components used in the manufacturing of many of our finished products, both pressure rated and non-pressure rated, depending on their intended use. We use a significant portion of the tank heads we manufacture in the production of our railcars and storage and distribution containers. We also sell our tank heads to a broad range of other manufacturers. There are many competitors in the tank heads business.
There are a number of well-established entities that actively compete with us in the business of manufacturing energy equipment.
All Other. All Other includes our captive insurance and transportation companies; legal, environmental, and maintenance costs associated with non-operating facilities; and other peripheral businesses.
Foreign Operations. Trinity's foreign operations are primarily located in Mexico. Continuing operations included sales to foreign customers, primarily in Mexico, which represented 7.7%, 7.0%, and 5.8% of our consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we had 3.3% and 3.9%, respectively, of our long-lived assets located outside the U.S. We manufacture railcars, storage and distribution containers, tank heads, structural wind towers, steel utility structures, parts and steel components, and other products at our Mexico facilities for local consumption as well as for export to the U.S. and other countries. 
Backlog. As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, our backlog of firm orders was as follows:

 | December 31,2016 | | December 31,2015
 | (in millions) 
Rail Group | | | 
External Customers | $ | 2,156.6 | | | $ | 3,948.5
Leasing Group | 850.9 | | | 1,452.7 | 
 | $ | 3,007.5 | | | $ | 5,401.2
Inland Barge Group | $ | 120.0 | | | $ | 416.0 
Wind towers | $ | 1,148.4 | | | $ | 371.3 

For the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, our rail manufacturing businesses received orders for 7,825 railcars. The change in backlog as of December 31, 2016 compared with our backlog as of December 31, 2015 reflects the value of orders taken, net of cancellations during 2016 totaling 250 railcars, executory contract change orders and price modifications, and orders delivered during the year. The orders in our backlog from the Leasing Group are fully supported by lease commitments with external customers. The final amount dedicated to the Leasing Group may vary by the time of delivery as customers may alternatively choose to purchase railcars as external sales from the Rail Group. Approximately 41% of our railcar backlog is expected to be delivered during the twelve months ending December 31, 2017 with the remainder to be delivered from 2018 through 2021. Substantially all of our Inland Barge backlog is expected to be delivered during the twelve months ending December 31, 2017. 
5

Approximately 30% of our structural wind towers backlog is expected to be delivered during the twelve months ending December 31, 2017 with the remainder to be delivered during 2018 and 2019. The Company does not report backlog from its utility structures business because certain contracts contain partial order cancellation provisions.
Marketing. We sell or lease substantially all of our products and services through our own sales personnel operating from offices in multiple locations in the U.S. as well as Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, Singapore, Sweden, and Peru. We also use independent sales representatives on a limited basis.
Raw Materials and Suppliers.
Railcar Specialty Components and Steel. Products manufactured at our railcar manufacturing facilities require a significant supply of raw materials such as steel, as well as numerous specialty components such as brakes, wheels, axles, side frames, bolsters, and bearings. Although the number of alternative suppliers of specialty components has declined in recent years, at least two suppliers continue to produce most components.
The principal material used in our manufacturing segments is steel. During 2016, the supply of steel was sufficient to support our manufacturing requirements. Market steel prices continue to exhibit periods of volatility and ended 2016 higher than 2015. Steel prices may be volatile in the future in part as a result of market conditions. We often use contract-specific purchasing practices, existing supplier commitments, contractual price escalation provisions, and other arrangements with our customers, to mitigate the effect of steel price volatility on our operating profits for the year. In general, we believe there is enough capacity in the supply industry to meet current production levels and that our existing contracts and other relationships we have in place will meet our current production forecasts. 
Construction Aggregates. Aggregates can be found throughout the U.S., and many producers exist nationwide. Shipments of natural construction aggregates from an individual quarry are generally limited in geographic scope because the cost of transporting processed construction aggregates to customers is high in relation to the value of the product itself. Lightweight construction aggregates have a much wider, multi-state distribution area due to their higher value relative to their distribution costs. We currently operate mining facilities located in Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Colorado, and California.
Employees. The following table presents the approximate headcount breakdown of employees by business group:

Business Group | December 31,2016
Rail Group | 9,090 
Construction Products Group | 1,370 
Inland Barge Group | 980 
Energy Equipment Group | 5,230 
Railcar Leasing and Management Services Group | 200 
All Other | 450 
Corporate | 360 
 | 17,680 

As of December 31, 2016, approximately 8,350 employees were employed in the U.S. and 9,270 employees were employed in Mexico.
Acquisitions and Divestitures. See Note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.
Environmental Matters. We are subject to comprehensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental laws and regulations relating to the release or discharge of materials into the environment; the management, use, processing, handling, storage, transport, and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste and materials; and other activities relating to the protection of human health, natural resources, and the environment. 
Environmental operating permits are, or may be, required for our operations under these laws and regulations. These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal, and revocation. We regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures, and policies for compliance with our operating permits and related laws and regulations. We believe that our operations and facilities, whether owned, managed, or leased, are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations and that any non-compliance is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our operations or financial condition.
Governmental Regulation.
Railcar Industry. Our railcar and related manufacturing, maintenance services, and leasing businesses are regulated by multiple governmental regulatory agencies such as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("USEPA"); Transport Canada ("TC"); the U.S. Department of Transportation ("USDOT") and the administrative agencies it oversees, including the Federal Railroad Administration ("FRA"), the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration ("PHMSA"), and the Research and Special Programs Administration; and industry authorities such as the Association of American Railroads ("AAR"). All such agencies and 
6

authorities promulgate rules, regulations, specifications, and operating standards affecting railcar design, configuration, and mechanics; maintenance, and rail-related safety standards for railroad equipment, tracks, and operations, including the packaging and transportation of hazardous or toxic materials. We believe that our product designs and operations are in compliance with these specifications, standards, and regulations applicable to our business.
Revised regulations pertaining to the transportation of flammable materials by rail are now in effect. These regulatory changes materially impact: the rail industry as a whole; railroad operations; older and newer tank railcars that met or exceeded prior regulatory requirements and standards; future tank railcar specifications; and market decisions relative to capital investment in rail products. 
Inland Barge Industry. The primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of the inland barge industry are the U.S. Coast Guard; the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board; the U.S. Customs Service; the Maritime Administration of the USDOT; and private industry organizations such as the American Bureau of Shipping. These organizations establish safety criteria, investigate vessel accidents, and recommend improved safety standards. We believe that our product specifications and operations are in compliance with the laws and regulations applicable to our business.
Highway Products. The primary regulatory and industry authorities involved in the regulation of highway products manufacturers are the USDOT, the Federal Highway Administration ("FHWA"), and various state highway departments and administrative agencies. These organizations, with participation from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ("AASHTO"), establish certain specifications, product testing criteria, and performance standards related to the manufacture of our highway products. We believe that our highway products are in compliance with the standards and specifications applicable to our business. 
Storage and Distribution Containers. The primary regulatory authorities involved in the regulation of manufacturers of storage, transportation, and distribution containers are the PHMSA and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration ("FMCSA"), both agencies being part of the USDOT. These agencies promulgate and interpret rules and regulations and issue approvals and special permits pertaining, in part, to the manufacture of containers that are used in the storage, transportation, and distribution of regulated and non-regulated substances. We believe that our storage and distribution containers are in compliance with the rules, regulations, and permits applicable to our business.
Occupational Safety and Health Administration and Similar Regulations. Our operations are subject to regulation of health and safety matters by the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration and the U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration. We believe that we employ appropriate precautions to protect our employees and others from workplace injuries and harmful exposure to materials handled and managed at our facilities. However, claims that may be asserted against us for work-related illnesses or injury and the further adoption of occupational and mine safety and health regulations in the U.S. or in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate could increase our operating costs. While we do not anticipate having to make material expenditures in order to remain in substantial compliance with health and safety laws and regulations, we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance.
See Item 1A for further discussion of risk factors with regard to environmental, governmental, and other matters.
