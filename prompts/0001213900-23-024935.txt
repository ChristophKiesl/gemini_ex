ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview



We are a cell therapy pioneer working to turn cells into powerful therapeutics. We apply a proprietary expansion platform leveraging the properties of nicotinamide, or NAM, to allogeneic cell sources including umbilical cord blood-derived cells and natural killer, or NK, cells to create cell therapy candidates with the potential to redefine standards of care. Our primary product candidate is omidubicel, an advanced cell therapy candidate for allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant that, if approved, has the potential to expand access and improve outcomes for patients with blood cancers. Historically, we had also developed a line of enhanced and engineered NK cells targeted at solid tumors and hematological malignancies.



Cell therapies involve the delivery of human cells to replace or repair damaged tissue or cells in order to treat a variety of cancers and other diseases. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with donor cells, or allogeneic HSCT, also called bone marrow transplantation, is the most frequently used cell therapy to treat a variety of hematologic malignancies and other serious conditions. HSCT involves reconstituting a patient’s bone marrow from a seed population of stem cells obtained from a donor whose blood-forming and immune-system-forming cells are both cancer free and effective at carrying out their functions.



There are multiple sources of donor cells. The best source for donor cells is often viewed as a sibling who is a matched related donor, or MRD, but the chances of having a sibling match in the United States are only 25% to 30%. The majority of patients rely on alternate sources of donor cells, including matched unrelated donor, or MUD, haploidentical, or “half-matched” donors, and mismatched unrelated donor, or MMUD, as well as umbilical cord blood. However, due to disease progression and other complications during the time needed to find a suitable donor, unfortunately many patients cannot find an appropriate donor. According to the CIBMTR, in the U.S., there are approximately 8,000 patients above the age of 12 with hematologic malignancies who undergo an allogeneic stem cell transplant each year and we believe that number of patients may grow over time. We estimate that there are approximately 1,200 patients each year, who are above the age of 12 and are deemed eligible for an allogeneic stem cell transplant but cannot find an appropriate donor.



Notwithstanding the various potential sources of donor cells, HSCT is subject to a number of significant limitations, including: (i) delays in finding a suitable match, during which disease progression may make patients ineligible for transplant; (ii) an insufficient number or delayed engraftment of donor cells, leaving patients without a functioning immune system and leading to potentially life-threatening immune deficiency following transplant; (iii) a lack of long-term compatibility between the donor cells and the patient’s own cells, resulting in potentially fatal graft versus host disease, or GvHD; and (iv) older donor age may correspond to a negative impact on the patient’s outcome. In addition, there is ethnic and racial disparity in access to HSCT: data from 2018 indicate that white patients of European descent are approximately four times more likely to receive a transplant than Black patients.



Umbilical cord blood is a readily available source of stem cells for patients who need HSCT and do not have a matched related donor. It is easier to find a match when using stem cells derived from cord blood, since a full match is not required for a successful transplant using cord blood. However, on average, a typical cord blood graft contains approximately one-tenth the number of stem and progenitor cells compared to stem cell grafts from adult bone marrow or peripheral blood donors. This lower number of cells may delay engraftment of the donor cells and reconstitution of the immune system. This, in turn, increases both time in the hospital and the likelihood that a patient might contract a life-threatening infection.



Omidubicel, our primary product candidate, is designed to address the limitations of current donor sources used for HSCT. Omidubicel consists of NAM-expanded and enhanced hematopoietic stem cells and differentiated immune cells, including T cells. The final cell therapy product is cryopreserved until the patient is ready to begin the transplant, when it is thawed and infused. Omidubicel has the potential to be a stem cell donor source in two broad patient groups: (i) patients with high-risk leukemias and lymphomas who require HSCT; and (ii) patients with severe hematologic disorders such as severe aplastic anemia. Based on results from our clinical studies, if approved, omidubicel has the potential to improve outcomes as compared to other donor sources and to increase access for patients who cannot find an appropriate donor.



In October 2021, the complete results from our pivotal Phase 3 clinical study of omidubicel in 125 patients with various hematologic malignancies were published in the peer-reviewed medical journal Blood. The trial achieved its primary endpoint of time to neutrophil engraftment as well as all three of the prespecified secondary endpoints. These secondary endpoints were the proportion of patients who achieved platelet engraftment by day 42, the proportion of patients with grade 2 or grade 3 bacterial or invasive fungal infections in the first 100 days following transplant, and the number of days alive and out of the hospital in the first 100 days following transplant. All three secondary endpoints demonstrated statistical significance in an intent-to-treat analysis.

In December 2021, we reported data from an analysis of a subset of 37 patients from the Phase 3 randomized trial of omidubicel at Annual Meeting of the American Society of Hematology, or ASH. The analysis was aimed at investigating the reduced infection rates observed in the study and showed that the omidubicel-treated patients had more rapid recovery of a wide variety of immune cells including CD4+ T cells, B cells, NK cells and dendritic cell subtypes. The recovery of the immune system provides rationale for fewer severe bacterial, fungal and viral infections in patients treated with omidubicel. In February 2023 we presented additional data at the Transplantation and Cellular Therapy, or TCT, Meetings of the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy. These new data focused on peripheral blood lymphocyte counts measured in correlation with time to neutrophil and platelet engraftment in omidubicel-transplanted and standard cord blood-transplanted patients. Seven days post-transplant, omidubicel-transplanted patients showed a robust reconstitution of a broad repertoire of immune cells, which correlated with successful neutrophil engraftment. These data support past findings that omidubicel stimulates faster immune recovery than standard cord blood and may also explain the lower incidence of serious bacterial, fungal and viral infections for omidubicel transplanted patients.



In early 2022, the FDA agreed that the initiation of our rolling biologics license application, or BLA, submission for omidubicel was appropriate and we initiated the rolling submission process. We completed submission of the BLA in June 2022. The FDA accepted the BLA in July 2022. Subsequently, the FDA issued an information request and viewed the data in our response as a major amendment. On November 18, 2022, we received correspondence from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, that the agency had updated our previous target action date under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, from January 30, 2023 to May 1, 2023, for our BLA for omidubicel. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Israeli Ministry of Health and the FDA completed physical inspections of our Kiryat Gat facility which, to date, has resulted in no FDA 483 observations.



Beginning in March 2023, we initiated a strategic restructuring of our business to primarily focus on the commercial launch of omidubicel, following FDA approval if granted. This launch will involve a more limited financial investment than we had previously planned in order to manage our financial resources, resulting in a slower ramp of sales. To support a more fulsome commercial launch of omidubicel, if approved, we intend to seek potential commercial or strategic partnerships. We plan to engage a strategic advisor for this process. Potential strategic alternatives that may be evaluated include a sale of our assets or merger of our company, securing additional financing, and commercial or strategic partnerships that would enable further commercialization and development of our programs. There can be no assurance that this strategic review process will result in our pursuing any transaction. We aim to run this strategic review process into the third quarter of 2023. Additionally, there can be no assurances that any particular course of action, business arrangement or transaction, or series of transactions, will be pursued, successfully consummated or lead to increased shareholder value. If we are unable to secure additional financing or a commercial or strategic partnership for omidubicel, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation. In the event of such liquidation or other wind-down event, holders of our securities may suffer a total loss of their investment.



In connection with our strategic restructuring:




● | We intend to allocate the vast majority of our resources to support a commercial launch of omidubicel, following approval by the FDA if granted, including manufacturing at our dedicated and certified Kiryat Gat facility. To manage our cash runway, we will hire employees at a reduced pace and reduce planned commercial and medical operating expenses, which we anticipate will result in lower sales than we had previously planned.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Solely for financial reasons, we are reducing planned investment in the development of our clinical stage NK cell therapy candidate, GDA-201. While we will continue enrollment into the Phase 1/2 clinical trial of GDA-201 for the treatment of follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, we will not advance any previously planned Phase 2 start-up activities. We intend to complete the treatment of patients in the Phase 1 portion of the Phase 1/2 study; however, following our assessment of the results from Phase 1, we may decide not to proceed with the enrollment of patients in the Phase 2 portion of the study and may wind down the Phase 1/2 study of GDA-201.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Solely for financial reasons, we will discontinue the development of our engineered NK cell therapy pipeline, including GDA-301, GDA-501, and GDA-601, but will retain the intellectual property rights to develop, sell or license these assets in the future.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have implemented a reduction in force to rationalize the employee base to support the new business strategy, which will include closing our Jerusalem research and development facility and terminating the lease or securing a sub-tenant for the space. We expect that we will incur charges of approximately $1.1 million for severance and other employee termination-related costs primarily in the second quarter of 2023.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Strategy



Our goal is to deliver curative cell therapies to patients with serious and life-threatening medical conditions. The key strategies to achieve our goal are the following:

● | Obtain regulatory approval for omidubicel in hematologic malignancies. We submitted the full BLA for omidubicel in June 2022, and have been assigned a PDUFA date of May 1, 2023. Our BLA was supported by data from our international, multicenter, randomized, pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial that evaluated transplantation with omidubicel compared to standard umbilical cord blood in 125 patients with various hematological malignancies, including acute lymphocytic leukemia, or ALL, acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, myelodysplastic syndrome, or MDS, chronic myeloid leukemia, or CML, and lymphoma. The primary endpoint was time to neutrophil engraftment. The trial achieved its primary endpoint, as well as all three of the prespecified secondary endpoints. If omidubicel is approved in the United States, we may seek regulatory approval in the European Union, or the EU, or other jurisdictions.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Initial commercial launch of omidubicel in the United States, if approved. While the BLA for omidubicel is under review by the FDA, we are preparing for the commercial launch of omidubicel in the United States that will involve a more limited financial investment than previously planned, which we anticipate may result in a slower ramp of sales, and are assessing alternatives for the further commercialization of omidubicel within the United States. Additionally, we are developing a reimbursement strategy modeled upon recently approved cell therapies in oncology, including potentially through the New Technology Add-on Payment program.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cash conservation, strategic review and operational efficiency. In the near-term, we intend to allocate the vast majority of our financial resources to executing a launch of omidubicel, following approval by the FDA if granted, including manufacturing at our dedicated and certified Kiryat Gat manufacturing facility. We also initiated a process to seek potential commercial or strategic partnerships to maximize patient access to omidubicel, if approved. In response to current liquidity challenges, we are managing operational expenses and implementing various cost reduction measures, including implementation of a workforce reduction of approximately 17% in March 2023.

NAM Cell Expansion Technology



While cell-based therapies have the potential to address a variety of medical conditions, one of the key technical challenges for developing treatments with this approach is the expansion of therapeutically functional cells. In order for cell therapies to be clinically effective, there must be a sufficient quantity of therapeutically active cells for treatment, which requires the donor cells to be expanded in cell culture. While this may increase the number of cells, the functionality of those cells often diverges from the therapeutic functionality of the original donor cells. This shortcoming in the cells used for treatment can result in suboptimal clinical outcomes.





3







Our NAM cell expansion technology is designed to address this challenge by leveraging the biochemical properties of the small molecule nicotinamide in our manufacturing process. We expand and enhance the number of donor cells while maintaining their functional therapeutic characteristics through the proprietary combination of NAM, intended to maintain silencing of cell differentiation and preservation of gene expression, and particular cytokines which promote cell growth. Our optimized manufacturing process results in robust and replicable batch production, enabling the generation of standardized donor-derived cell products, potentially resulting in better clinical outcomes.



We have presented research describing the mechanism of action for the role of NAM in expanding CD34+ stem cells. The research included transcriptome, transcription factor, and pathway analysis to elucidate the factors that lead to the preservation of engraftment after ex vivo expansion of CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells derived from umbilical cord blood (the starting point for omidubicel) compared to CD34+ cells grown in the absence of NAM. Analyses showed that the presence of NAM reduced the expression of genes involved in the production of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, suggesting that cell stress was minimized during expansion. In addition, NAM also decreased growth factor of pathways responsible for activation and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells, suggesting NAM expanded cells while keeping them in an undifferentiated state. The presence of NAM also led to a decrease in the expression of genes responsible for matrix metalloproteinase secretion, simulating the microenvironment of the bone marrow. Additionally, NAM led to an increased expression of telomerase genes, which is believed to enable cells to remain in a more quiescent, stem-like state. These data provide further scientific rationale for the favorable stem cell engraftment and patient outcomes that were observed in the Phase 3 clinical study of omidubicel.



Historically, we have also applied NAM technology in developing our NK cell product candidates.



Hematologic Malignancies and Allogeneic HSCT



Overview



Hematologic malignancies are characterized by an abnormal and excessive proliferation of malignant blood cells that replace normal blood cells in the bone marrow and the circulation. In some patients, these cancerous cells proliferate rapidly, requiring urgent treatment. Patients are initially treated with chemotherapy in order to destroy the malignant cells in a rapid manner. However, in most patients, remission is temporary and the disease will return after initial treatment. One of the most effective treatment options for these patients is hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT, where the blood-forming cells in the patient are destroyed using chemotherapy, radiation or a combination of both. These patients then receive new bone marrow stem cells from a healthy donor.



Allogeneic HSCT is the transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells, derived from a donor’s bone marrow or peripheral blood, or standard umbilical cord blood. HSCT involves reconstituting a person’s entire blood and bone marrow from a seed population of cells. In some clinical settings, autologous HSCT may be performed, in which cells are derived from the patient and reinfused at a later date. In leukemia and other hematologic malignancies, it is more appropriate to use allogeneic HSCT obtained from a donor, which ensures that the graft does not contain the patient’s malignant cells and leverages the ability of donor cells to fight against a patient’s cancer, which is known as the “graft versus leukemia” effect.



In HSCT, a patient is treated with chemotherapy and/or radiation to destroy the residual cancerous or defective cells that reside in the bone marrow. This procedure, called myeloablation, also destroys the hematopoietic stem cells that are responsible for forming red blood cells, platelets and white blood cells. Stem cells from a donor are then infused into a patient, migrate and home to the bone marrow and begin to proliferate and differentiate into various types of blood cells, eventually leading to a full reconstitution of the bone marrow and immune system.









4







HSCT is a potentially curative treatment for many refractory and high-risk hematologic malignancies that would otherwise be fatal with conventional therapies. As of 2019, an estimated 600,000 allogeneic HSCT procedures will have been performed worldwide over the past 50 years. In 2016, more than 38,000 such procedures were performed worldwide, and in 2020, more than 8,000 were performed in the United States. From 2010 to 2019, the number of patients receiving an allogeneic HSCT procedure increased by approximately 3% per year in the United States due to multiple factors, including an aging population and new transplant modalities. Approximately 90% of HSCT procedures performed in the United States are for patients with various hematologic malignancies.



Approximately 90% of HSCT procedures performed in the United States are for patients with various hematologic malignancies. Although the number of allogeneic HSCT procedures performed is growing and there are new modalities for the procedure, HSCT continues to have a number of limitations. There are two major areas of unmet need. First, of those who receive a transplant, there is concomitant morbidity and mortality associated with the treatment. Second, a significant number of patients who are candidates for transplant do not receive one in a timely fashion. We believe that omidubicel can address these significant limitations.



Current Sources of Donor Cells for Allogeneic HSCT



There are multiple potential sources of donor cells for transplants. For each donor, there are various baseline requirements including age and overall health. In general, younger donors produce more and better cells for HSCT than older donors. Donor matching is determined by human leukocyte antigens, or HLA, which are proteins present on most cells and inherited genetically. HLA are recognized by the immune system, and “foreign” or nonmatching HLA may be rejected. Therefore, matching of HLA between bone marrow donor and recipient is needed for a successful transplant outcome.



The best source of donor cells is often viewed as a matched sibling of appropriate age and health, but the chances of having a sibling match are only 25% to 30%. An alternate source of donor cells is a MUD, but non-Caucasian patients have a lower likelihood of finding a MUD. There is ethnic and racial disparity in access to HSCT. Data from 2018 indicate that white patients of European descent are approximately four times more likely to receive a transplant than Black patients. The ability to find a match through this process is particularly challenging for individuals of ethnic backgrounds that are not well-represented in donor databases. Furthermore, it takes approximately two to three months on average to identify an appropriate MUD who is medically suitable and willing to donate. During this lengthy time period, there is a risk of disease recurrence. Over time, the patient may also become ineligible due to other health complications. Moreover, prolonged donor searches heighten anxiety for patients and their families.



If a matched donor cell source is not identified, there are three alternatives for transplant candidates: mismatched unrelated donor, or MMUD, haploidentical donors and umbilical cord donors. Haploidentical, or “half-matched” donors, and MMUD are only partially compatible with the recipient. Because of the immune incompatibility in transplants from such donors, there is a high risk of GvHD, infection and other complications.



Alternatively, donor cells can be obtained from umbilical cord blood. In contrast to adult graft sources, which require a greater degree of matching, matching requirements for cord blood are less stringent than those from unrelated donors, leading to a greater probability for finding a match: 96% for Caucasians of European descent, 81% for Black patients, and 82-91% of other minorities. This obviates the need to go through a prolonged search process with uncertain outcomes in order to find a donor and arrange for the collection of donor cells. Because the donor T cells in cord blood are naïve, meaning that they have not matured, they readily adapt to the recipient and are associated with a low risk of a patient developing GvHD, in particular chronic GvHD. Furthermore, transplantation with cord blood reduces the risk of potential transmission of an infection from an adult donor.

Limitations of Allogeneic HSCT



There are three critical limitations to successful HSCT:




● | delays in finding a suitable match, during which disease progression may make patients ineligible for a transplant;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | insufficient number or delayed engraftment of donor cells, leaving patients without a functioning immune system and leading to potentially life-threatening immune deficiency following transplant; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | lack of long-term compatibility between the donor cells and the patient’s own cells, resulting in potentially fatal GvHD.

Omidubicel is Designed to Address the Limitations of Current Donor Sources for HSCT



In addition to the general limitations of HSCT, the low number of hematopoietic cells in standard umbilical cord blood is a major clinical constraint. With standard umbilical cord blood, the small number of stem cells infused leads to a prolonged time to engraftment, the process by which donor stem cells home to the bone marrow, differentiate, and repopulate the recipient’s blood cells. Longer time to engraftment is associated with a higher rate of post-transplant complications, longer hospitalization time, and an increase in transplant-related mortality. Omidubicel is designed to address the limitations of current donor sources used for allogeneic HSCT because it expands the number of donor cord blood stem cells while maintaining the cells’ functional therapeutic characteristics. The omidubicel manufacturing process also enhances cell functionality.



Omidubicel consists of two fractions of a unit of cord blood separated based on the expression of a marker on the surface of individual cells known as CD133. A cell’s CD133 status reflects its “stem cell” properties. Those cells that express CD133 represent a pool of stem or progenitor cells, cells that are capable of generating blood cells that can differentiate into a variety of cell subtypes. The CD133-positive stem or progenitor cells are also capable of reproducing themselves. Once the cells bearing this marker, are isolated, they are cultured using the proprietary NAM technology platform to expand their number while maintaining their regenerative properties. After approximately three weeks, the cells are harvested and cryopreserved.



Those cells that do not express CD133 represent other types of more mature, differentiated cells, including essential components of the immune system such as T cells. These mature cells cannot engraft but can provide immunological support until T cells derived from the stem cell graft recover. The CD133-negative cells are also cryopreserved and retained for use as the second component of omidubicel. The two components collectively are known as “omidubicel,” as approved by the United States Adopted Names Council (USAN).





6







Omidubicel is shipped cryogenically to transplant centers where both components are thawed and infused to patients on the day of transplantation. The thawing process occurs in a closed system and can also be performed at the patient’s bedside for ease of administration. The cryopreserved product resulted in engraftment results similar to those obtained with non-cryopreserved product in a Phase 1 pilot study at Duke University.




● | Omidubicel is a stem cell graft with less stringent matching requirements than conventional HSCT, intended to reduce problems with donor matching. If approved, this will provide an option for the patients who currently have lengthy searches to find a suitable match and may never receive one, thereby creating an opportunity to improve outcomes and access to HSCT for such patients.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Omidubicel is designed to deliver a therapeutic dose of stem cells that may lead to rapid engraftment and immune reconstitution.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Omidubicel provides a compatible graft, observed to reduce morbidities including GvHD and infections.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




Given these characteristics, omidubicel may serve as a new alternative to existing graft modalities as well as expand the transplant market for those who are unable to find a match.



Omidubicel: Clinical Trial Results



Our clinical trials of omidubicel include an initial safety evaluation of omidubicel in a Phase 1 pilot study at Duke University, a Phase 1/2 clinical trial that enrolled 36 patients in an international, multicenter, open-label, single-arm trial, and a Phase 3 clinical trial that evaluated 125 patients in a pivotal, international, multi-center, randomized trial. All patients in our clinical trials of omidubicel had been previously treated for various hematologic malignancies, including ALL, AML, MDS, CML and lymphoma. These patients were deemed to be in remission and at high risk of subsequent relapse.
Pivotal Phase 3 Trial



In January 2020, we enrolled the last patient in the pivotal, international, multi-center, randomized Phase 3 trial of omidubicel. Initiated in 2017, the study compared omidubicel to single or double standard, unmanipulated umbilical cord blood transplantation. Randomization was stratified by treatment center, disease risk, age and intent to perform single or double cord blood transplant. The primary endpoint of time to neutrophil engraftment was met.



All secondary endpoints-time to platelet engraftment, the incidence of grade 2 or grade 3 bacterial or invasive fungal infections and the number of days alive and out of hospital during the first 100 days following transplantation-were also met.







Phase 3 Study Schema



A total of 125 patients were randomized at 33 centers in the United States, South America, Europe and Asia. These 125 patients formed the basis of the intent-to-treat, or ITT, analysis. Of the 62 patients randomized to omidubicel, 52 were transplanted per protocol with the omidubicel graft. Of the 63 patients randomized to the control arm, 56 were transplanted as per protocol.

Phase 3 Patient Disposition and Analysis Populations



Patient demographics were well-balanced in the two study arms, with a median age in the early 40s. The study population was diverse, with approximately 40% either Black, Asian, Latino or patients characterized under “other”. The majority of patients (over 70%) had acute leukemia. With respect to the transplant, all patients received myeloablative conditioning regimens, with approximately half of the patients receiving a total-body-irradiation regimen, and approximately half receiving a chemotherapy-only conditioning regimen. Myeloablative conditioning therapy is a combination of chemotherapy agents, and in some cases radiotherapy, that is expected to produce low blood counts and is administered in order to reduce the tumor burden, suppress the patient’s immune system, and allow engraftment of donor stem cells. Over 70% of patients had a 4/6 HLA matching cord, either serving as the starting material for omidubicel, or as the standard control. A double cord transplant was intended for two-thirds of patients randomized to the standard cord arm. The omidubicel unit was expanded a median 133-fold to a median of 6.6 x 10e8 CD34+ cells. This provided the patients with a median CD34+ cell dose of 9 x 10e6 CD34+ cells/kg, which is a larger cell dose than can be collected from many healthy adult stem cell donors. In contrast, recipients on the control arm received a median 0.3 x 10e6 CD34+ cells/kg.

Phase 3 Baseline Disease and Transplant Characteristics



The primary endpoint was time to neutrophil engraftment, based on recovery of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that helps fight infections. In the ITT population, the patients randomized to omidubicel engrafted at median of 12 days following transplantation (95% confidence interval 10-15 days). Those randomized to the control arm engrafted at a median of 22 days (95% confidence interval 19-25 days). This was statistically significant (p<0.001). In the as-treated, or AT, analysis, patients who received omidubicel had a median time to neutrophil engraftment of 10 days, vs 20.5 days for the control. The cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment was 96% for omidubicel recipients and 89% for the controls.
Cumulative Incidence of Neutrophil and Platelet Engraftment



The results of the study were published in October 2021 in the peer reviewed ASH journal Blood. Results included statistically significant positive results in all three secondary endpoints: platelet engraftment, infections, and hospitalization. Platelets are required for normal blood clotting. Platelet engraftment on day 42 after transplant was achieved in 55% of those randomized to omidubicel and 35% of those randomized to the control arm (ITT). This difference had a p value of 0.028.



Patients randomized to omidubicel were less likely to develop a grade 2 or grade 3 bacterial or invasive fungal infection: 37% versus 57% for those randomized to the control arm (p=0.03). The cumulative incidence of first grade 3 viral infection during the first year after transplantation was also lower for those randomized to omidubicel (10% vs 26%; p=0.02). When looking at the overall number and rate of infections, or infection density, during the first year after transplantation, the risk ratio for all infections, irrespective of severity, was significantly lower among recipients of omidubicel.

Incidence of Serious Bacterial and Viral Infection Post-Transplant







Relative Risk (95% CI) for Bacterial, Viral, and all Infections at One Year



Patients randomized to omidubicel spent a median of 60.5 days alive and out of the hospital during the first 100 days following transplantation, compared to 48 days for control patients (p=0.005).



In the ITT population, the cumulative incidence of non-relapse mortality at 210 days following randomization was 11% for omidubicel and 24% for control. The incidence of relapse at 15 months following randomization was 25% for omidubicel and 17% for the controls. These differences were not statistically different.







Incidence of Non-Relapse Mortality and Incidence of Relapse

There was no statistically significant difference between the omidubicel arm and the control arm in one year overall survival or disease-free survival. The Hazard Ratio of overall survival was 0.57 in favor of omidubicel, p=0.09.







Disease-Free Survival and Overall Survival



The safety profile for omidubicel recipients in this study was consistent with the expected toxicities of allogeneic stem cell transplantation following conditioning therapy, and there was no increase in adverse events, serious adverse events, or infusion reactions in the omidubicel arm compared to control. GvHD is a multisystem disorder that is common in allogeneic HSCT. GvHD occurs when immune cells from a donor graft recognize the transplant recipient host as foreign and initiate an immune reaction. Acute GvHD usually presents around the time of engraftment and manifests as rash, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or increased serum bilirubin. Chronic GvHD is usually diagnosed later during the first year post-transplant, and clinical manifestations include skin involvement, gastrointestinal disease, and increased bilirubin. There was no statistically significant difference between omidubicel and control patients in the cumulative incidence of acute GvHD in the first 100 days post-transplant.



Grade 2-4 acute GvHD was observed in 56% of omidubicel recipients and 43% of controls. The numbers for grade 3/4 (severe) acute GvHD were 14% and 21% for omidubicel and control, respectively. There was also no statistically significant difference in the cumulative incidence of chronic GvHD (all grades, including mild, moderate and severe) in the first year, 35% vs 29% for omidubicel and control, respectively. Overall, the results of the Phase 3 study showed superior hematopoietic recovery, decreased risk of serious infection, and shorter duration of hospitalization in patients treated with omidubicel, with an acceptable safety profile.



In November 2021, we completed a Type B Pre-BLA meeting with the FDA for omidubicel during which the FDA requested that we provide revised analysis of the manufacturing data generated at our manufacturing facility in Kiryat Gat, Israel to demonstrate the analytical comparability of the omidubicel produced at Kiryat Gat to the omidubicel that was produced at the clinical manufacturing sites for the Phase 3 study. In January 2022, we received positive Type B meeting correspondence from the FDA that we had established the requisite analytical comparability. Based on the positive Phase 3 trial results and the comparability analysis, the FDA agreed that the initiation of a rolling BLA submission is appropriate. In February 2022, we initiated the rolling submission process with the FDA, and we submitted the full BLA for omidubicel to the FDA in June 2022. The FDA accepted the BLA in July 2022 with priority review and a PDUFA data of January 30, 2023. Subsequently, the FDA issued an information request and viewed the volume of data required to address the information request as a major amendment. On November 18, 2022, we received correspondence from the FDA that the agency had updated our previous target action date under the PDUFA from January 30, 2023 to May 1, 2023, for our BLA for omidubicel.



Omidubicel has Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA. Additionally, omidubicel received orphan drug designation from both the FDA and from the European Commission for the indication haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Phase 1/2 Clinical Trial



The main objective of the Phase 1/2 study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of omidubicel treatment in patients with hematologic malignancies following myeloablative conditioning therapy. The study compared outcomes against a group of historic controls that were identified from data collected by the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, or CIBMTR, which tracks all allogeneic transplants conducted in the United States. From the CIBMTR database, we identified 146 age and disease matched patients who received standard cord blood transplants and served as historic controls.



The primary endpoint of this study was also time to neutrophil engraftment, which was also met. Patients treated with omidubicel recovered their neutrophils (500 cells per microliter) with a median recovery of 11.5 days after transplantation, which is significantly shorter than the 21 days observed in the historic controls (p<0.001). Platelet counts recovered within a median time period of 34 days in the omidubicel treated patients, compared to 46 days in the historic controls (p<0.001). For both neutrophils and platelets, the percentage of patients who achieved engraftment was higher than in the historic controls. The age-adjusted cumulative incidence of neutrophil engraftment at 42 days following transplantation was 94% for omidubicel recipients and 85% for the CIBMTR comparator cohort.



Rates of acute GvHD, chronic GvHD, infections, and hospitalization, as well as safety findings, were similar to those observed in the Phase 3 study.



Omidubicel: Health Economic Implications



The potential clinical advantages of omidubicel could lead to societal benefits such as enabling patients to return to work, spend time with loved ones and enjoy improved quality of life. Omidubicel may also reduce the costs to the healthcare system versus standard cord HSCT due to reductions in health care resource utilization such as potentially shortened isolation and intensive care hospital stays, reduced re-admission rates and decreased severity and rates of infections. At the December 2021 Annual Meeting of ASH, we reported the results of an analysis of resource utilization data from the first 100 days after transplant for 108 patients in the Phase 3 trial showing that the omidubicel-treated patients had significantly shorter durations of hospitalization and intensive care unit stays, and fewer consultant visits, procedures, and transfusions than the patients in the control arm. These data provide further evidence of the clinical benefit associated with the more rapid hematopoietic recovery in patients treated with omidubicel and the corresponding reduction in healthcare resource utilization. These data will help to inform pricing and reimbursement.
Omidubicel for the Treatment of Bone Marrow Failure Disorders



In addition to hematologic malignancies, we are pursuing the development of omidubicel for the treatment of severe aplastic anemia and other bone marrow failure disorders. Severe aplastic anemia is a rare disease, with an estimated incidence in the United States of 600-900 patients per year.



Underlying causes include autoimmune disease, certain medications or toxic substances, and inherited conditions. However, the cause is unknown in approximately half of all cases of severe aplastic anemia. The disease is characterized by stem cells in the bone marrow that are damaged and unable to produce enough new blood cells. This leads to extremely low blood cell counts and platelet levels, and often requires patients to be immediately hospitalized for treatment.



Allogeneic HSCT is the treatment of choice for patients with severe aplastic anemia who have an available matched sibling donor. Among the 2,471 patients with severe aplastic anemia receiving HSCT with a matched sibling donor between 2005 and 2015, the three-year probability of survival was 91% for those younger than 18 years, and 78% for patients 18 years of age or older. Among the 1,751 recipients of HSCT with a MUD during the same period, the probabilities of survival were 78% and 68% for severe aplastic anemia patients under 18 years and greater than or equal to 18 years, respectively. We believe omidubicel may be able to provide a treatment option for those patients who are unable to locate such a donor in time.



The goal in treating these diseases is to replace defective bone marrow cells with cells derived from cord blood donors. Omidubicel is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1/2 NIH-sponsored clinical trial. In this trial, omidubicel is administered in combination with a reduced conditioning preparative protocol, which is designed to minimize toxicity, in up to 62 patients with severe aplastic anemia or hypoplastic myelodysplastic syndrome, another bone marrow failure disease. This research protocol is designed to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of transplantation with omidubicel to overcome the high incidence of graft rejection associated with standard cord blood HSCT in severe aplastic anemia patients, where graft rejection occurs in up to 50% of subjects. In December 2020, we reported updated and expanded data at the Annual Meeting of ASH that demonstrated that patients with severe aplastic anemia treated with omidubicel achieved sustained early engraftment.





12







Omidubicel for the Treatment of Non-Malignant Disorders



Omidubicel has also been tested in patients with sickle cell disease, or SCD, for which HSCT is currently the only clinically established cure. The results of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial were published in Blood. Overall, 16 patients with severe SCD were treated, 13 patients with omidubicel in conjunction with a standard unit of cord blood, and three patients with standalone omidubicel. All patients initially engrafted at a median of seven days for double cord and eight days for single cord. Two of the patients died, one due to chronic GvHD and the other due to secondary graft failure. The rate of grades II-IV acute GvHD was 69%, and the rate of grades III-IV acute GvHD was 23%. The engraftment results were favorable when compared to those from a study of 29 patients with SCD who underwent HSCT with cells from a MUD donor. In that study, 27 of the patients had neutrophil engraftment, and the median time to engraftment was 12 days. There were eight deaths, seven due to GvHD and one due to graft rejection; 19 of 29 were disease-free at two years. While the clinical study in patients with SCD is currently closed, we continue to believe that omidubicel has potential to replace other allogeneic HSCT procedures in certain hematologic diseases and some metabolic disorders.



Our NK Cell Product Candidates



Our pipeline of NK cell-based cancer immunotherapies is comprised of GDA-201 and three additional preclinical programs that involve modifications intended to direct NK cells against specific tumor markers to improve their cancer killing capabilities in both hematological and solid tumors.



GDA-201 is our lead investigational NK cell-based cancer immunotherapy product candidate. GDA-201 addresses a key limitation in the therapeutic potential of NK cells by increasing the cytotoxicity and in vivo retention and proliferation in the bone marrow and lymphoid organs of NK cells expanded in culture conditions. GDA-201 was evaluated in an investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 trial for the treatment of NHL and MM. We believe that GDA-201 may have broad potential in both hematologic malignancies and in solid tumors.



In May 2022, we announced the dosing of our first patient in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of GDA-201 for the treatment of patients with follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas, and patient enrollment in this study is ongoing.



Limitations of Therapeutic Antibodies in Cancer Treatment



NHL is the most common malignancy of B cells. An estimated 77,240 new cases of NHL were diagnosed in the United States in 2020. The five-year survival rate for those with NHL is approximately 73%. The combination of an antibody such as rituximab and chemotherapy is the standard of care for patients with NHL. However, many patients develop resistance to rituximab, and when used as monotherapy, only 15% of patients respond. One mechanism that contributes to this resistance is the inability of patient or autologous NK cells to locate and kill tumor cells that rituximab has bound to. Treatment with donor-derived NK cells may overcome this resistance.



NK Cells: Broad Anti-Cancer Potential



Extensive research efforts are ongoing to generate cellular products for the treatment of cancer patients. There is much interest in the field in the potential of NK cells because they have potent anti-tumor properties. In contrast to other immune cell therapies, NK cells can be used independently from genetic matching, potentially enabling NK cells to serve as a universal donor-based therapy when combined with certain antibodies.



NK cells’ tumor killing activity is greatly enhanced by antibodies that recognize tumor cells, which trigger ADCC. In ADCC, the binding of an antibody to a cell marks it for destruction by NK cells. A number of antibody products have been approved by the FDA as therapeutics in oncology, each of which has limited efficacy as monotherapy. The effectiveness of these antibodies can potentially be enhanced through coadministration with NK cells. A key limitation in the application of NK cells in cell therapy has been the traditionally challenging task of generating sufficient numbers of highly functional NK cells in culture.

GDA-201



We have developed GDA-201, a cell therapy product candidate generated by expansion of healthy donor NK cells using our NAM technology. We believe that GDA-201 has potential application in boosting the innate immune response to cancer. Functional studies have shown that our GDA-201 cells expanded in culture with our NAM technology and the cytokine IL-15 display increased tumor killing activity over NK cells expanded with IL-15 but without NAM. We have also demonstrated ADCC with GDA-201 in combination with antibodies, including rituximab.



An investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical study of GDA-201 in patients with multiple myeloma, or MM, or NHL was initiated in 2017 at the University of Minnesota. These patients have relapsed or refractory NHL or MM, meaning that their disease has come back after standard therapy and/or they are not responding to standard therapy for their disease. In combination with GDA-201, these patients also receive therapeutic antibodies, which, in the case of NHL, includes rituximab, and in the case of MM, elotuzumab. At the December 2021 Annual Meeting of ASH, we reported two-year follow-up data from the clinical trial on outcomes and cytokine biomarkers associated with survival. The safety profile was consistent with that reported previously: there were no dose limiting toxicities in the 35 treated patients. In 19 patients with lymphoma, the data demonstrated a median duration of response of 16 months (range 5- 36 months), an overall survival at two years of 78% (95% CI, 51%-91%).







Phase 1/2 Study of GDA-201 in Patients with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or Multiple Myeloma



Treatment included lymphodepleting chemotherapy with fludarabine and cyclophosphamide followed by two doses of GDA-201 (Days 0 and 2) and low-dose IL-2 (6 million units subcutaneously). Three doses of monoclonal antibodies were administered pre and post GDA-201. The study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose of GDA-201 cells. Patients who derived clinical benefit received a second cycle of GDA-201 infusion without lymphodepleting chemotherapy. A total of 35 patients were treated in three cohorts of escalating cellular doses of GDA-201, with a maximum dose of 200 million cell/kg. Sixteen patients with MM and 19 patients with NHL were evaluable. The median age was 61 and the oldest patient was 83 years old. Among the patients with NHL, eight had diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, or DLBC, 10 had follicular lymphoma, or FL, and one had mantle cell lymphoma. Patients were heavily pre-treated with a median of three lines of prior chemotherapy (range 1-8 lines). Four of the NHL patients and three of the MM patients had prior HSCT.



There were no dose limiting toxicities at any of the doses administered. One patient, who initially was thought to have cytokine release syndrome, died of E-coli sepsis. The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse events were decreased neutrophil count, febrile neutropenia, anemia and low platelet count, generally attributed to lymphodepleting chemotherapy. No neurotoxic events, GvHD or marrow aplasia were observed.



Among the 16 patients with MM, one patient achieved a complete response, and four patients achieved stable disease. Among the 19 patients with NHL, 13 achieved a complete response and one achieved a partial response. Overall response rate among the 19 NHL patients was 74%, with responses observed in 8 patients with FL and 5 patients with DLBCL. Median duration of response was 10 months with a range of 1 - 28 months. In three patients, an initial partial response deepened over time to a complete response: one (patient 009) without any further therapy, and two in the context of a second cycle of GDA-201 and rituximab. Two patients with complete response who received a second cycle of GDA-201 after initial complete response had maintained a complete response after a total of 6 and 12 months, respectively.

Responses in Patients with Lymphoma Treated with GDA-201



Given the results of this study, we have developed a cryopreserved, allogeneic, readily available formulation of GDA-201 to enable further clinical trials. In September 2021, we submitted an IND for a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of GDA-201 for the treatment of patients with follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. In October 2021, the FDA placed this IND on clinical hold prior to the initiation of patient dosing. The FDA requested modifications in donor eligibility procedures and sterility assay qualification. The FDA removed the clinical hold in April 2022, and we opened enrollment of our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of GDA-201 in patients with follicular and diffuse large B-cell lymphomas in May 2022 and announced the dosing of our first patient in this trial in August 2022. We intend to compete the treatment of patients in the Phase 1 portion of the Phase 1/2 study; however, following our assessment of the results from Phase 1, we may decide not to proceed with the enrollment of patients in the Phase 2 portion of the study and may wind down the Phase 1/2 study of GDA-201.



At the 2023 Transplantation & Cellular Therapy (TCT) Meetings of the American Society for Transplantation & Cellular Therapy and the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research, new preclinical data on the cryopreserved formulation of GDA-201 was reported, which showed increased potency and enhanced cytotoxicity. GDA-201 cells were tested for viability, phenotyping, function and potency. Previous characterization of GDA-201 showed high levels of CD56, CD16, CD49a and CD62L expression, low levels of CD57, and low levels of immune checkpoints such as LAG3 and CD200R. The analyses showed that cryopreserved GDA-201 exhibited high viability (>90%) and high purity up to 12 months post-manufacturing and preserved the ability to proliferate post-thaw. GDA-201 maintained high levels of expression of CD16, which mediates antibody-dependent cellular toxicity, and CD62L, which is a homing and retention marker. GDA-201 also demonstrated high potency, based on the intracellular secretion of TNF-alpha & IFN-gamma and extracellular degranulation marker CD107a.

Additional NK Cell Product Candidates in Our Portfolio



We have developed other NAM-enabled genetically modified NK cell product candidates, which utilize CAR, membrane bound- and CRISPR-mediated strategies to increase targeting, potency and persistence against hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. As part of our strategic restructuring, in March 2023 we discontinued development of this preclinical pipeline. We will, however, maintain the intellectual property rights to the portfolio, which includes the following candidates:

● | GDA-301: Knockout of CISH, or cytokine inducible SH2 containing protein, in NK cells using CRISPR/Cas9 in combination with a membrane-bound IL-15/IL-15Ra. Designed to improve tumor killing by promoting activation of NK cells and inhibiting negative feedback signals. Potential applications exist across a range of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. Data presented at the International Society for Cell & Gene Therapy, or ISCT, 2022 meeting demonstrated that after six hours of co-culture with a chronic myelogenous leukemia (K562) or multiple myeloma (RPMI) cell line, GDA-301, a combined genetic manipulation of CISH gene editing and the engineered expression of mb IL-15, showed increased cytotoxicity compared with control NAM-NK cells. Additional in vitro assays showed elevation of degranulation marker CD107a, intracellular proinflammatory cytokines interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α, suggesting increased potency of GDA-301 compared with control cells. The potency and cytotoxicity data suggest that GDA-301 represents a novel potential immunotherapeutic targeting hematologic malignancies as well as solid tumors.

● | GDA-501: CAR-engineered NK cells to target HER2+ solid tumors with the potential to enhance homing and activation against cancers with HER2 overexpression, including breast, ovarian, lung, bladder, and gastric cancers. At the 2022 Society of Immunotherapy of Cancer, or SITC, annual meeting, we announced new preclinical data on GDA-501 that provide support for its continued preclinical development. GDA-501 displayed significantly enhanced in vitro cytotoxicity when cultured with HER2+ targeted cancer cells, as well as increased potency based on elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines and biomarkers compared with control cells. Importantly, increased cytotoxicity and potency were persistent. These preclinical data demonstrate potent antitumor activity.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | GDA-601: Knockout of CD38 on NK cells to avoid fratricide by CD38-targeting antibodies in combination treatment of multiple myeloma, combined with a CD38 CAR designed to enhance killing of multiple myeloma cells. Data presented at the ISCT 2022 meeting showed that in vitro killing assays, performed six hours after co-culture of GDA-601 with a MM (RPMI) cell line, showed increased cytotoxicity compared with control NAM-NK cells. Fratricide attributable to CD38 antigen was effectively eliminated with GDA-601. There was a significant enhancement of potency against CD38-positive MM cells demonstrated by elevation of the degranulation marker CD107a, intracellular proinflammatory cytokines interferon-γ and tumor necrosis factor-α in vitro. These results suggest that GDA-601 displays superior antitumoral responses against MM cells and represent a promising adoptive cell therapeutic strategy against MM.

Competition



The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology platform, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future.



We anticipate intensifying competition in the field of cell therapies as new therapies are approved and advanced technologies become available.



Many of our competitors will have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources. Competitors may also have more experience developing, obtaining approval for, and marketing novel treatments in the indications we are pursuing. These factors could give our competitors an advantage over us in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, completing clinical development, and commercializing their products. Competitors that are able to obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we can for our products may also establish a stronger market position, diminishing our commercial opportunity. Key considerations that would impact our capacity to effectively compete include the efficacy, safety, ease of use, as well as pricing and reimbursement of our products.

Manufacturing



Omidubicel is currently manufactured at our Kiryat Gat, Israel facility using a scalable process with well-defined unit operations. This highly specialized and precisely controlled manufacturing process enables us to manufacture product candidates reproducibly and efficiently for clinical and commercial applications. In the fourth quarter of 2022, the Israeli Ministry of Health and the FDA completed physical inspections of our Kiryat Gat facility which, to date, has resulted in no FDA 483 observations. If omidubicel is approved for marketing by the FDA, we plan to commercially manufacture omidubicel for sale in the United States at our Kiryat Gat, Israel manufacturing facility in 2023.



We currently rely on third-party clinical cell processing facilities and contract manufacturers for all our required raw materials, active ingredients and finished products for our preclinical research and clinical trials. In addition, we currently rely on third parties for supply of our required raw materials and active ingredients for omidubicel.



Marketing, Sales and Distribution



Our strategy is to ensure omidubicel is made available to appropriate patients upon FDA approval. While the BLA for omidubicel is under review by the FDA, we are preparing for a commercial launch of omidubicel in the United States that will require a more limited investment resulting in a slower ramp of sales. We have conducted market insight studies to understand the unmet needs that omidubicel can potentially address. If omidubicel were to be fully distributed to all appropriate patients in the U.S. market, we would anticipate that upon reaching peak market share, which would be 20 – 25% of the addressable U.S. patient population, omidubicel has the potential to treat approximately 2,000 – 2,500 patients each year.



If we receive regulatory approvals for omidubicel, we intend, where appropriate, to pursue commercialization relationships, including strategic alliances and licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies and other strategic partners that are equipped to market or sell our products through their well-developed sales, marketing and distribution organizations in such countries.



Intellectual Property



We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions, products and product candidates, methods of manufacture, methods of using our products and product candidates, and improvements thereof that are commercially important to our business. We protect our proprietary intellectual property by, among other things, filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States covering our proprietary technologies, inventions, products and product candidates, methods, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business.



As of December 31, 2022, we own 33 issued patents and 61 pending patent applications worldwide, including five U.S. issued patents, six pending U.S. non-provisional patent applications and three pending PCT applications.

The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we have filed, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO in examining and granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier filed patent. The term of a patent that covers a drug or biological product may also be eligible for patent term extension when FDA approval is granted for a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, subject to certain limitations and provided statutory and regulatory requirements are met. Any such patent term extension can be for no more than five years, only one patent per approved product can be extended, the extension cannot extend the total patent term beyond 14 years from approval, and only those claims covering the approved drug, a method for using it or a method for manufacturing it may be extended. We may not receive an extension if we fail to exercise due diligence during the testing phase or regulatory review process, fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension could be less than we request. In the future, if and when our product candidates receive approval from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents we may obtain in the future covering those products, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each product and other factors. There can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents.



Provisional patent applications are not eligible to become issued patents until, among other things, we file a non-provisional patent application within 12 months of filing of one or more of our related provisional patent applications. If we do not timely file any non-provisional patent applications, we may lose our priority date with respect to our provisional patent applications and any patent protection on the inventions disclosed in our provisional patent applications.



As with other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, our ability to establish and maintain our proprietary and intellectual property position for our product candidates will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims if granted. There can be no assurance that any of our current or future patent applications will result in the issuance of patents or that any of our current or future issued patents will provide any meaningful protection of our product candidates or technology. For more information regarding the risks related to our intellectual property, see “Item 1A: Risk Factors-Risks Related to Our Intellectual Property.”



Research Grants



Grants under the Innovation Law



Under the Encouragement of Research, Development and Technological Innovation in the Industry Law 5744-1984, and the provisions of the applicable regulations, rules, procedures and benefit tracks, (collectively, the “Innovation Law”), research and development programs that meet specified criteria and are approved by a committee of the IIA are eligible for grants. The grants awarded are typically up to 50% of the project’s expenditures, as determined by the research committee and subject to the benefit track under which the grant was awarded. A company that receives a grant from the IIA, or a grant recipient, is typically required to pay royalties to the IIA on income generated from products incorporating know-how developed using such grants (including income derived from services associated with such products), until 100% of the U.S. dollars linked grant plus annual LIBOR interest is repaid. The rate of royalties to be paid may vary between different benefits tracks, as shall be determined by the IIA. Under the regular benefits tracks the rate of royalties varies from 3% to 3.5% of the income generated from the IIA-supported products. The obligation to pay royalties is contingent on actual income generated from such products and services. In the absence of such income, no payment of such royalties is required.



The terms of the grants under the Innovation Law also generally require that the products developed as part of the programs under which the grants were given be manufactured in Israel and that the know-how developed thereunder may not be transferred outside of Israel, unless a prior written approval is received from the IIA (such approval is not required for the transfer of a portion of the manufacturing capacity which does not exceed, in the aggregate, 10% of the portion declared to be manufactured outside of Israel in the applications for funding, in which case only notification is required) and additional payments are required to be made to the IIA. It should be noted that this does not restrict the export of products that incorporate the funded know-how. See “Item 1A: Risk Factors-Risks Related to Israeli Law and Our Operations in Israel” for additional information.



Since our incorporation, we have received grants from the IIA relating to various projects. We were members of Bereshit Consortium, sponsored by IIA in which certain of our technologies were developed, such program does not require payments of royalties to the IIA, but all other restrictions under the Innovation Law, such as local manufacturing obligations and know-how transfer limitations, as further detailed hereunder, are applicable to the know how developed by us with the funding received in such consortium program. No royalties have been paid to the IIA in respect of any grant. Our total outstanding obligation to the IIA, including the interest accrued through December 31, 2022, amounts to approximately $43.5 million of which $37.7 million is royalty-bearing grants, and approximately $2.6 million is non-royalty-bearing grants.

Government Regulation in the U.S.



The FDA and other regulatory authorities at federal, state, and local levels, as well as in non-U.S. countries, extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, import, export, safety, effectiveness, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion, marketing, post-approval monitoring, and post-approval reporting of biologics such as those we are developing. We, along with third-party contractors, will be required to navigate the various preclinical, clinical and commercial approval requirements of the governing regulatory agencies of the countries in which we wish to conduct studies or seek approval or licensure of our product candidates.



The process required by the FDA before biologic product candidates may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:




● | completion of preclinical laboratory tests and animal studies performed in accordance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, regulation;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before clinical trials may begin and must be updated annually or when significant changes are made;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before the trial is commenced;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety, purity and potency of the proposed biologic product candidate for its intended purpose;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preparation of and submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of a BLA to file the application for review; satisfactory completion of an FDA Advisory Committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the proposed product is produced to assess compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s continued safety, purity and potency, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | FDA review and approval of the BLA to permit commercial marketing of the product for particular indications for use in the United States.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical and Clinical Development



Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate, we must submit an IND to the FDA. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational new drug product to humans. The central focus of an IND submission is on the general investigational plan and the protocol(s) for clinical studies. The IND also includes results of animal and in vitro studies assessing the toxicology, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and pharmacodynamic characteristics of the product; chemistry, manufacturing, and controls information; and any available human data or literature to support the use of the investigational product. An IND must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, raises safety concerns or questions about the proposed clinical trial. In such a case, the IND may be placed on clinical hold and the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns or questions before the clinical trial can begin. Submission of an IND therefore may or may not result in FDA authorization to begin a clinical trial.





20







For purposes of BLA approval, human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap.




● | Phase 1: The investigational product is initially introduced into patients with the target disease or condition. These studies are designed to test the safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism and distribution of the investigational product in humans, the side effects associated with increasing doses, and, if possible, to gain early evidence on effectiveness.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 2: The investigational product is administered to a limited patient population with a specified disease or condition to evaluate the preliminary efficacy, optimal dosages and dosing schedule and to identify possible adverse side effects and safety risks. Multiple Phase 2 clinical trials may be conducted to obtain information prior to beginning larger and more expensive Phase 3 clinical trials.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Phase 3: The investigational product is administered to an expanded patient population to further evaluate dosage, to provide statistically significant evidence of clinical efficacy and to further test for safety, generally at multiple geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the investigational product and to provide an adequate basis for product approval.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




In some cases, the FDA may require, or companies may voluntarily pursue, additional clinical trials after a product is approved to gain more information about the product. These so- called Phase 4 studies may be made a condition to approval of the BLA. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing commitments following approval. Concurrent with clinical trials, companies may complete additional animal studies and develop additional information about the biological characteristics of the product candidate, and must finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final product, or for biologics, the safety, purity and potency. Compliance with Good Tissue Practices, or GTPs, is also required to the extent applicable. These are FDA regulations and guidance documents that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the GTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. Good Tissue Practices regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and when applicable, to evaluate donors through screening and testing. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.



BLA Submission and Review



Assuming successful completion of all required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA as part of a BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. The BLA must include all relevant data available from pertinent preclinical and clinical studies, including negative or ambiguous results as well as positive findings, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacturing, controls, and propose labeling, among other things. The submission of a BLA requires payment of a substantial application user fee to FDA, unless a waiver or exemption applies.



Once a BLA has been submitted, the FDA’s goal is to review standard applications within ten months after it accepts the application for filing, or, if the application qualifies for priority review, six months after the FDA accepts the application for filing. The FDA may issue a refusal-to-file letter if the BLA is not sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. In both standard and priority reviews, the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA reviews a BLA to determine among other things, whether a product is safe, pure and potent and the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packed, or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, purity and potency. The FDA may convene an advisory committee to provide clinical insight on application review questions. Before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure compliance with GCP. If the FDA determines that the application, manufacturing process or manufacturing facilities are not acceptable, it will outline the deficiencies in the submission and often will request additional testing or information. Notwithstanding the submission of any requested additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval.





21







After the FDA evaluates a BLA and conducts inspections of manufacturing facilities where the investigational product will be produced, the FDA may issue an approval letter or a Complete Response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the product with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response letter will describe all of the deficiencies that the FDA has identified in the BLA, except that where the FDA determines that the data supporting the application are inadequate to support approval, the FDA may issue the Complete Response letter without first conducting required inspections, testing submitted product lots, and/or reviewing proposed labeling. In issuing the Complete Response letter, the FDA may recommend actions that the applicant might take to place the BLA in condition for approval, including requests for additional information or clarification. The FDA may delay or refuse approval of a BLA if applicable regulatory criteria are not satisfied, require additional testing or information and/or require post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor safety or efficacy of a product.



If regulatory approval of a product is granted, such approval will be granted for particular indications and may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which such product may be marketed. For example, the FDA may approve the BLA with a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to ensure the benefits of the product outweigh its risks. A REMS is a safety strategy to manage a known or potential serious risk associated with a product and to enable patients to have continued access to such medicines by managing their safe use, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. The FDA also may condition approval on, among other things, changes to proposed labeling or the development of adequate controls and specifications. Once approved, the FDA may withdraw the product approval if compliance with pre- and post-marketing requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the marketplace. The FDA may require one or more Phase 4 post-market studies and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization, and may limit further marketing of the product based on the results of these post-marketing studies.



Post-Approval Requirements



Any products manufactured or distributed by us pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to record-keeping, reporting of adverse experiences, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, and advertising and promotion of the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims, are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing user fee requirements, under which FDA assesses an annual program fee for each product identified in an approved BLA. Biologic manufacturers and their subcontractors are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP, which impose certain procedural and documentation requirements upon us and our third-party manufacturers.



Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers that we may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.





22







The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:




● | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of a product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of existing product approvals;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product seizure or detention, or refusal of the FDA to permit the import or export of products; or
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------




The FDA closely regulates the marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of biologics. A company can make only those claims relating to safety and efficacy, purity and potency that are approved by the FDA and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties. Physicians may prescribe legally available products for uses that are not described in the product’s labeling and that differ from those tested by us and approved by the FDA. Such off-label uses are common across medical specialties. Physicians may believe that such off-label uses are the best treatment for many patients in varied circumstances. The FDA does not regulate the behavior of physicians in their choice of treatments. The FDA does, however, restrict manufacturer’s communications on the subject of off-label use of their products.



Breakthrough Therapy Designation



A sponsor may seek FDA designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy” if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other products, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation allows more intensive FDA interaction and guidance. The breakthrough therapy designation is a distinct status from both accelerated approval and priority review, which can also be granted to the same drug if relevant criteria are met. If a product is designated as breakthrough therapy, the FDA will work to expedite the development and review of such drug.



Government Regulation in the EU



Clinical Trials in the EU



In the EU, clinical trials are governed by the Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or CTR, which entered into effect on January 31, 2022, repealing and replacing the former Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20, or CTD, and related national implementing legislation of EU Member States.



The CTR is intended to harmonize and streamline clinical trial authorizations, simplify adverse-event reporting procedures, improve the supervision of clinical trials and increasing their transparency. Specifically, the regulation, which is directly applicable in all EU Member States, introduces a streamlined application procedure through a single-entry point, the "EU portal", the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application; as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors. A harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials has been introduced and is divided into two parts. Part I assessment is led by the competent authorities of a reference Member State selected by the trial sponsor and relates to clinical trial aspects that are considered to be scientifically harmonized across EU Member States. This assessment is then submitted to the competent authorities of all concerned Member States in which the trial is to be conducted for their review. Part II is assessed separately by the competent authorities and Ethics Committees in each concerned EU Member State. Individual EU Member States retain the power to authorize the conduct of clinical trials on their territory.





23







The extent to which on-going clinical trials will be governed by the CTR will depend on the duration of the individual clinical trial. Sponsors could choose to submit a clinical trial application under either the CTD or the CTR until January 31, 2023. For clinical trials in relation to which application for approval was made on the basis of the CTD before January 31, 2022, the CTD will continue to apply on a transitional basis for three years. If authorized, those clinical trials will be governed by the CTD until January 31, 2025. By that date, all ongoing trials will become subject to the provisions of the CTR. The CTR will apply to clinical trials from an earlier date if the clinical trial has already transitioned to the CTR framework.



EU Review and Approval Process



In the EU, medicinal products can only be commercialized after a related marketing authorization, or MA, has been granted. A company may submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA, either on the basis of the centralized, or decentralized procedure or mutual recognition procedure.



To obtain an MA for a product in the EU, which is valid throughout the EEA, an applicant must submit an MAA either under a centralized procedure administered by the EMA or one of the procedures administered by competent authorities in the EU Member States (decentralized procedure, national procedure or mutual recognition procedure). An MA may be granted only to an applicant established in the EU.



The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single MA by the European Commission that is valid for all EU Member States. Pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the centralized procedure is compulsory for specific products, including for (i) medicinal products derived from biotechnological processes, (ii) products designated as orphan medicinal products, (iii) advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, and (iv) products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, diabetes, auto-immune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases. For products with a new active substance indicated for the treatment of other diseases and products that are highly innovative or for which a centralized process is in the interest of patients, authorization through the centralized procedure is optional on related approval.



Under the centralized procedure, the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP, conducts the initial assessment of a product. The CHMP is also responsible for several post-authorization and maintenance activities, such as the assessment of modifications or extensions to an existing MA.



Under the centralized procedure in the EU, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of an MAA is 210 days, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions of the CHMP. Accelerated assessment may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product targeting an unmet medical need is expected to be of major interest from the point of view of public health and, in particular, from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts a request for accelerated assessment, the time limit of 210 days will be reduced to 150 days (excluding clock stops). The CHMP can, however, revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it considers that it is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.



Unlike the centralized authorization procedure, the decentralized MA procedure requires a separate application to, and leads to separate approval by, the competent authorities of each EU Member State in which the product is to be marketed. This application is identical to the application that would be submitted to the EMA for authorization through the centralized procedure. The reference EU Member State prepares a draft assessment and drafts of the related materials within 120 days after receipt of a valid application. The resulting assessment report is submitted to the concerned EU Member States who, within 90 days of receipt, must decide whether to approve the assessment report and related materials. If a concerned EU Member State cannot approve the assessment report and related materials due to concerns relating to a potential serious risk to public health, disputed elements may be referred to the Heads of Medicines Agencies’ Coordination Group for Mutual Recognition and Decentralised Procedures – Human, or CMDh, for review. The subsequent decision of the European Commission is binding on all EU Member States.





24







The mutual recognition procedure allows companies that have a medicinal product already authorized in one EU Member State to apply for this authorization to be recognized by the competent authorities in other EU Member States. Like the decentralized procedure, the mutual recognition procedure is based on the acceptance by the competent authorities of the EU Member States of the MA of a medicinal product by the competent authorities of other EU Member States. The holder of a national MA may submit an application to the competent authority of an EU Member State requesting that this authority recognize the MA delivered by the competent authority of another EU Member State.



An MA has, in principle, an initial validity of five years. The MA may be renewed after five years on the basis of a re-evaluation of the risk-benefit balance by the EMA or by the competent authority of the EU Member State in which the original MA was granted. To support the application, the MA holder must provide the EMA or the competent authority with a consolidated version of the eCTD (Common Technical Document) providing up-to-date data concerning the quality, safety and efficacy of the product, including all variations introduced since the MA was granted, at least nine months before the MA ceases to be valid. The European Commission or the competent authorities of the EU Member States may decide on justified grounds relating to pharmacovigilance, to proceed with one further five-year renewal period for the MA. Once subsequently definitively renewed, the MA shall be valid for an unlimited period. Any authorization which is not followed by the actual placing of the medicinal product on the EU market (for a centralized MA) or on the market of the authorizing EU Member State within three years after authorization ceases to be valid (the so-called sunset clause).



Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the Priority Medicines, or PRIME, scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicinal products that target unmet medical needs. Eligible products must target conditions for which there is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the EU or, if there is, the new medicinal product will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and potentially accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted.



In the EU, a “conditional” MA may be granted in cases where all the required safety and efficacy data are not yet available. The European Commission may grant a conditional MA for a medicinal product if it is demonstrated that all of the following criteria are met: (i) the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product is positive; (ii) it is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data post-authorization; (iii) the medicinal product fulfils an unmet medical need; and (iv) the benefit of the immediate availability to patients of the medicinal product is greater than the risk inherent in the fact that additional data are still required. The conditional MA is subject to conditions to be fulfilled for generating the missing data or ensuring increased safety measures. It is valid for one year and must be renewed annually until all related conditions have been fulfilled. Once any pending studies are provided, the conditional MA can be converted into a traditional MA. However, if the conditions are not fulfilled within the timeframe set by the EMA and approved by the European Commission, the MA will cease to be renewed.



An MA may also be granted “under exceptional circumstances” where the applicant can show that it is unable to provide comprehensive data on efficacy and safety under normal conditions of use even after the product has been authorized and subject to specific procedures being introduced. These circumstances may arise in particular when the intended indications are very rare and, in the state of scientific knowledge at that time, it is not possible to provide comprehensive information, or when generating data may be contrary to generally accepted ethical principles. Like a conditional MA, an MA granted in exceptional circumstances is reserved to medicinal products intended to be authorized for treatment of rare diseases or unmet medical needs for which the applicant does not hold a complete data set that is required for the grant of a standard MA. However, unlike the conditional MA, an applicant for authorization in exceptional circumstances is not subsequently required to provide the missing data. Although the MA “under exceptional circumstances” is granted definitively, the risk-benefit balance of the medicinal product is reviewed annually, and the MA will be withdrawn if the risk-benefit ratio is no longer favorable.

Other Healthcare Regulations



Our business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payers, patient organizations and customers, may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute our product candidates, if approved. Such laws include those described below.



The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity, from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, the referral of an individual for, or purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, any good, facility, item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The federal Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, and formulary managers on the other hand. The term remuneration has been interpreted broadly to include anything of value. There are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting some common activities from prosecution. The exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly and practices that involve remuneration that may be alleged to be intended to induce prescribing, purchasing or recommending may be subject to scrutiny if they do not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. Failure to meet all of the requirements of a particular applicable statutory exception or regulatory safe harbor does not make the conduct per se illegal under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Instead, the legality of the arrangement will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis based on a cumulative review of all facts and circumstances. Additionally, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively the PPACA, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and other healthcare criminal fraud statutes, so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have violated the statute. The PPACA also provided that a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute is grounds for the government or a whistleblower to assert that a claim for payment of items or services resulting from such violation constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.



The federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, or FCA, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the U.S. federal government, including the Medicare and Medicaid programs, or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government.



In addition, manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a “whistleblower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery. FCA liability is potentially significant in the healthcare industry because the statute provides for treble damages and mandatory penalties. Government enforcement agencies and private whistleblowers have investigated pharmaceutical companies for or asserted liability under the FCA for a variety of alleged impermissible promotional and marketing activities, such as providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product; providing consulting fees and other benefits to physicians to induce them to prescribe products; engaging in promotion for “off-label” uses; and submitting inflated best price information to the Medicaid Rebate Program.



The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of whether the payer is public or private, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a health care benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a health care offense and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick, scheme or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Additionally, the PPACA amended the intent requirement of some of these criminal statutes under HIPAA so that a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute, or the specific intent to violate it, to have committed a violation.





26







Additionally, the federal Open Payments program pursuant to the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, created under Section 6002 of the PPACA and its implementing regulations, require some manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologicals and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program (with specified exceptions) to report annually information related to specified payments or other transfers of value provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, and chiropractors), other healthcare professionals (such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners) and teaching hospitals, or to entities or individuals at the request of, or designated on behalf of, the physicians, and teaching hospitals and to report annually specified ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members.



In addition, we may be subject to data privacy and security regulation of both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, impose requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information held by covered entities subject to the law, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses, and certain healthcare providers, and their business associates, defined as independent contractors or agents of covered entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity and their subcontractors that use, disclose, access, or otherwise process protected health information. Among other things, HITECH created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties and HIPAA’s security standards directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys’ fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions.



Further, the U.S. Public Health Service Act, prohibits, among other things, the introduction into interstate commerce of a biological product unless a biologics license is in effect for that product.



Many states have also adopted laws similar to each of the above federal laws, which may be broader in scope and apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers. We may also be subject to state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives, state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures and pricing information, and/or state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts.



Ensuring that our internal operations and business arrangements with third parties comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will likely be costly. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations were found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, possible exclusion from government funded healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could substantially disrupt our operations. If the physicians or other providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs.





27







Coverage and Reimbursement



Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any product candidates for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the extent to which third-party payers provide coverage, and establish adequate reimbursement levels for such products. In the United States, third-party payers include federal and state healthcare programs, private managed care providers, health insurers and other organizations.



The process for determining whether a third-party payer will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the price of a product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that such a payer will pay for the product. Third-party payers may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of medical products, therapies and services, in addition to questioning their safety and efficacy.



We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of our products, in addition to the costs required to obtain the FDA approvals. Our product candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. Payer’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Further, the determination of one payer to provide coverage for a product does not assure that other payers will also provide such coverage for the product.



Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.



Different pricing and reimbursement schemes exist in other countries. In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product, or they may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced EU Member States), can further reduce prices.



The downward pressure on health care costs has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. In addition, in some countries, cross-border imports from low-priced markets exert a commercial pressure on pricing within a country.



The marketability of any of product candidates for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payers fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. In addition, emphasis on managed care in the United States has increased and we expect will continue to increase the pressure on healthcare pricing. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.

Healthcare Reform Measures



The United States and some non-U.S. jurisdictions are considering or have enacted a number of legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system. Among policy makers and payers in the United States and elsewhere, there is significant interest in promoting changes in healthcare systems with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and/or expanding access. In the United States, the pharmaceutical industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives.



For example, the pharmaceutical industry in the United States has been affected by the passage of PPACA, which, among other things: imposed new fees on entities that manufacture or import certain branded prescription drugs; expanded pharmaceutical manufacturer obligations to provide discounts and rebates to certain government programs; implemented a licensure framework for follow-on biologic products; expanded health care fraud and abuse laws; revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for certain drugs and biologics, including products that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; imposed an additional rebate similar to an inflation penalty on new formulations of drugs; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations; expanded the 340B program which caps the price at which manufacturers can sell covered outpatient pharmaceuticals to specified hospitals, clinics and community health centers; and provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research.



There have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or Tax Act, includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress. Further, there have been a number of health reform measures by the Biden administration that have impacted the PPACA. For example, on August 16, 2022, President Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, into law, which among other things, extends enhanced subsidies for individuals purchasing health insurance coverage in PPACA marketplaces through plan year 2025. The IRA also eliminates the “donut hole” under the Medicare Part D program beginning in 2025 by significantly lowering the beneficiary maximum out-of-pocket cost and by creating a new manufacturer discount program. It is possible that the PPACA will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration.



Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2.0% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the BBA, will remain in effect until 2031, unless additional U.S. Congressional action is taken. Under current legislation, the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 4% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. In addition, in January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several categories of healthcare providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Additional changes that may affect our business include new quality and payment programs such as Medicare payment for performance initiatives for physicians under the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015, or MACRA, which ended the use of the statutory formula for clinician payment and established a quality payment incentive program, also referred to as the Quality Payment Program.



In addition, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices in recent years, particularly with respect to drugs that have been subject to relatively large price increases over relatively short time periods. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Presidential executive orders, Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for pharmaceutical products. At the federal level, for example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, “Promoting Competition in the American Economy,” with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden’s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. In addition, the IRA, among other things, (i) directs the Secretary of HHS to negotiate the price of certain high-expenditure, single-source drugs and biologics covered under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D, and subjects drug manufacturers to civil monetary penalties and a potential excise tax by offering a price that is not equal to or less than the negotiated “maximum fair price” under the law, and (ii) imposes rebates under Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D to penalize price increases that outpace inflation. These provisions will take effect progressively starting in fiscal year 2023, although they may be subject to legal challenges. Further, the Biden administration released an additional executive order on October 14, 2022, directing HHS to report on how the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Innovation can be further leveraged to test new models for lowering drug costs for Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.





29







In addition, individual states in the United States have become increasingly active in passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. In the future, there will likely continue to be proposals relating to the reform of the U.S. healthcare system, some of which could further limit coverage and reimbursement of products.



The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act



The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any U.S. individual or business from paying, offering or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any non-U.S. official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the non-U.S. entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring the companies to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the companies, including international subsidiaries, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
Non-U.S. Government Regulation



To the extent that any of our product candidates, once approved, are sold in a country outside of the United States, we may be subject to similar non-U.S. laws and regulations, which may include, for instance, applicable post-marketing requirements, including safety surveillance, anti-fraud and abuse laws and implementation of corporate compliance programs and reporting of payments or other transfers of value to healthcare professionals.



In order to market our future products in the EEA (which is comprised of the 27 Member States of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and many other jurisdictions, we must obtain regulatory approvals from such jurisdictions. More precisely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. Our current product candidates would be subject to a centralized MA that would be granted by the European Commission.



The EU centralized MA, which is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, advanced therapeutic medicinal products, orphan medicinal products and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of HIV or AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, autoimmune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the European Union. Further, gene therapy medicinal products, somatic cell therapy medicinal products and tissue-engineered medicinal products are additionally governed by Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 on ATMPs, Directive 2004/23/EC and its implementing Directives governing the collection and use of human cells and tissues where applicable, Directive 2002/98/EC and its implementing Directives governing the collection and use of human blood where applicable, and the EC’s and EMA’s related guidance including GMP for (investigational) ATMPs.



Under the above-described procedures, before granting the MA, the EMA makes an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.





30







Data and Marketing Exclusivity



Upon receiving a marketing authorization in the EEA, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator's pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EEA. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator's data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.



In the EEA, there is a special regime for biosimilars, or biological medicinal products that are similar to a reference medicinal product but that do not meet the definition of a generic medicinal product. For such products, the results of appropriate preclinical or clinical trials must be provided in support of an application for marketing authorization. Guidelines from the EMA detail the type of quantity of supplementary data to be provided for different types of biological product.



Pediatric Investigation Plan



In the EEA, Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 provides that all marketing authorization applications for new medicinal products must include the results of trials conducted in the pediatric population, in compliance with a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, agreed with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO. The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the medicinal product for which marketing authorization is being sought. The PDCO may grant a deferral of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures provided in the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults. Furthermore, the obligation to provide pediatric clinical trial data can be waived by the PDCO when these data are not needed or appropriate because the product is likely to be ineffective or unsafe in children, the disease or condition for which the product is intended occurs only in adult populations, or when the product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit over existing treatments for pediatric patients. Once study results are included in the product information, even when negative, the product is eligible for a six month extension to the Supplementary Protection Certificate or SPC if any is in effect at the time of authorization or, in the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of orphan market exclusivity. For other countries outside of the EEA, such as certain countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product approval, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials are to be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
Orphan Drug Designation



Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may designate a drug or biologic product as an orphan drug if it is intended to treat a rare disease or condition, defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States.



In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages, and application fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same drug for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient product quantity the orphan patient population.





31







In the EEA, a medicinal product can be designated as an orphan drug if its sponsor can establish that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition affecting not more than five in ten thousand persons in the European Union when the application is made, or that the product is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition in the European Community and that without incentives it is unlikely that the marketing of the drug in the EU would generate sufficient return to justify the necessary investment. For either of these conditions, the applicant must demonstrate that there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition in question that has been authorized in the EU or, if such method exists, the drug will be of significant benefit to those affected by that condition.



In the EEA, an application for designation as an orphan product can be made any time prior to the filing of an application for approval to market the product. Marketing authorization for an orphan drug leads to a ten-year period of market exclusivity. During this market exclusivity period, the EMA or the member state competent authorities, cannot accept another application for a marketing authorization, or grant a marketing authorization, for a similar medicinal product for the same indication. The period of market exclusivity is extended by two years for medicines that have also complied with an agreed PIP.



This period may, however, be reduced to six years if, at the end of the fifth year, it is established that the product no longer meets the criteria for orphan drug designation, for example because the product is sufficiently profitable not to justify market exclusivity. Market exclusivity can be revoked only in very selected cases, such as consent from the marketing authorization holder, inability to supply sufficient quantities of the product, demonstration of “clinical superiority” by a similar medicinal product, or, after a review by the Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products, requested by a member state in the fifth year of the marketing exclusivity period (if the designation criteria are believed to no longer apply). Medicinal products designated as orphan drugs pursuant are eligible for incentives made available by the European Union and its Member States to support research into, and the development and availability of, orphan drugs.



Regulatory Requirements after Marketing Authorization



Where a marketing authorization is granted in relation to a medicinal product in the EEA, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of regulatory requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products.



Similar to the United States, both marketing authorization holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the individual EU Member States. The holder of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.



All new marketing authorizations must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.



In the EEA, the advertising and promotion of medicinal products are subject to both EU level and EU Member States’ laws governing promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians and other healthcare professionals, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in individual EU Member States and can differ from one country to another. For example, applicable laws require that promotional materials and advertising in relation to medicinal products comply with the product’s Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, as approved by the competent authorities in connection with a marketing authorization. The SmPC is the document that provides information to physicians concerning the safe and effective use of the product. Promotional activity that does not comply with the SmPC is considered off-label and is prohibited in the EU. In general, direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicinal products is also prohibited in the EU.





32







Coverage, Pricing, and Reimbursement



In the European Union, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed. Some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of a particular product candidate to currently available therapies (so called health technology assessments) in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. EU Member States may approve a specific price for a product, or they may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the product on the market. Other EU Member States allow companies to fix their own prices for products but monitor and control prescription volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions. Recently, many countries in the EU have increased the amount of discounts required on pharmaceuticals and these efforts could continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures, especially in light of the severe fiscal and debt crises experienced by many countries in the EU. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription products, has become intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products. Political, economic, and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. Reference pricing used by various EU Member States, and parallel trade (arbitrage between low-priced and high-priced member states), can further reduce prices.



The Health Technology Assessment, or HTA process, which is currently governed by the national laws of the individual EU Member States, is the procedure according to which the assessment of the public health impact, therapeutic impact and the economic and societal impact of use of a given medicinal product in the national healthcare systems of the individual country is conducted. The outcome of HTA regarding specific medicinal products will often influence the pricing and reimbursement status granted to these medicinal products by the competent authorities of individual EU Member States. On January 31, 2018, the European Commission adopted a proposal for a regulation on health technologies assessment. The proposed regulation is intended to boost cooperation among EU Member States in assessing health technologies, including new medicinal products, and providing the basis for cooperation at EU level for joint clinical assessments in these areas. In December 2021 the HTA Regulation was adopted and entered into force on January 11, 2022. It will apply from 2025.



Brexit



The withdrawal of the United Kingdom, or the UK, from the EU on January 31, 2020, commonly referred to as Brexit, has created significant uncertainty concerning the future relationship between the UK and the EU. The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, is now the UK’s standalone regulator. On December 24, 2020, the EU and UK reached an agreement in principle on the framework for their future relationship, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement, or the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement primarily focuses on ensuring free trade between the EU and the UK in relation to goods, including medicinal products. Although the body of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement includes general terms which apply to medicinal products, greater detail on sector-specific issues is provided in an Annex to the Trade and Cooperation Agreement.



Among the changes that will now occur are that Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) are treated as a third country. Northern Ireland is, with regard to EU regulations on free movement, continue to follow the EU regulatory rules. As part of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, the EU and the UK will recognize GMP inspections carried out by the other party and the acceptance of official GMP documents issued by the other party. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement also encourages, although it does not oblige, the parties to consult one another on proposals to introduce significant changes to technical regulations or inspection procedures. Among the areas of absence of mutual recognition are batch testing and batch release. The UK has unilaterally agreed to accept EU batch testing and batch release. However, the EU continues to apply EU laws that require batch testing and batch release to take place in the EU territory. This means that medicinal products that are tested and released in the UK must be retested and re-released when entering the EU market for commercial use.





33







The UK regulatory framework in relation to clinical trials is derived from existing EU legislation (as implemented into UK law, through secondary legislation). However, it is currently unclear to what extent the UK will seek to align its regulations with the EU following entry into application of the Clinical Trials Regulation on January 31, 2022.



As regards marketing authorizations, Great Britain has a separate regulatory submission process, approval process and a national marketing authorization. Northern Ireland will, however, continue to be covered by the marketing authorizations granted by the European Commission. Since January 1, 2021, an applicant for a centralized procedure marketing authorization can no longer be established in the UK. Since this date, companies established in the UK cannot use the centralized procedure and instead must follow one of the UK national authorization procedures to obtain a marketing authorization to market products in the UK. Until December 31, 2023, MHRA may rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new centralized procedure marketing authorization when determining an application for a Great Britain marketing authorization; or use the MHRA’s decentralized or mutual recognition procedures which enable marketing authorizations approved in EU Member States to be granted in Great Britain. Post Brexit, the MHRA has been updating various aspects of the regulatory regime for medicinal products in the UK.



Orphan designation in Great Britain following Brexit is, unlike in the EU, not available pre-marketing authorization. Applications for orphan designation are made at the same time as an application for a marketing authorization. The criteria to be granted an orphan medicinal product designation or essentially identical to those in the EU but based on the prevalence of the condition in Great Britain. It is therefore possible that conditions that were or would have been designated as orphan conditions in Great Britain prior to the end of the Transition Period are or would no longer be and that conditions that were not or would not have been designated as orphan conditions in the EU will be designated as such in Great Britain.



It is currently unclear to what extent the UK will seek to align its regulations with the EU in the future. The UK regulatory framework in relation to clinical trials is derived from existing EU legislation (as implemented into UK law, through secondary legislation). However, the Retained EU Law (Revocation and Reform) Bill published in late 2022 which is intended to remove all EU-derived legislation from the UK statute book by the end of 2023, may result in a divergence of approach between the EU and the UK.



On January 17, 2022, the MHRA launched an eight-week consultation on reframing the UK legislation for clinical trials. The consultation closed on March 14, 2022 and aims to streamline clinical trials approvals, enable innovation, enhance clinical trials transparency, enable greater risk proportionality, and promote patient and public involvement in clinical trials. The outcome of the consultation will be closely watched and will determine whether the UK chooses to align with the regulation or diverge from it to maintain regulatory flexibility. A decision by the UK not to closely align its regulations with the new approach that will be adopted in the EU may have an effect on the cost of conducting clinical trials in the UK as opposed to other countries and/or make it harder to seek a marketing authorization in the EU for our product candidates on the basis of clinical trials conducted in the UK.



Privacy laws



We are subject to stringent and evolving United States and foreign laws, regulations, rules, contractual obligations, policies and other obligations related to data privacy and security, including the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, or EU GDPR. New privacy rules are being enacted in the United States and globally, and existing ones are being expanded, updated and strengthened. For example, the EU GDPR which went into effect in May 2018 introduced strict requirements regarding the processing of personal data, including health-related data.



The collection and use of personal health data in the EEA is governed by the EU GDPR, which became effective on May 25, 2018. The EU GDPR applies to any company established in the EEA and to companies established outside the EEA that process personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EEA or the monitoring of the behavior of data subjects in the EEA. The EU GDPR enhances data protection obligations for controllers and processors of personal data, including stringent requirements relating to the consent of data subjects, expanded disclosures about how personal data is used, requirements to conduct privacy impact assessments for high-risk processing, limitations on retention of personal data and mandatory data breach notification and privacy by design requirements, and creates direct obligations on service providers acting as data processors. The EU GDPR also imposes strict rules on the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA to countries that do not ensure an adequate level of protection, such as the United States. Failure to comply with the requirements of the EU GDPR and the related national data protection laws of the EEA countries may result in fines up to 20 million Euros or 4% of a company’s global annual revenues for the preceding financial year, whichever is higher. Moreover, the EU GDPR grants data subjects the right to claim compensation for damages resulting from infringement of the EU GDPR.





34







Further, the exit of the UK from the EU on January 1, 2020, often referred to as Brexit, has created uncertainty with regard to data protection regulation in the UK. Specifically, the UK exited the EU on January 1, 2020, subject to a transition period that ended December 31, 2020. The UK has implemented legislation similar to the EU GDPR, the UK GDPR, including the UK Data Protection Act, which provides for fines of up to the greater of 17.5 million British Pounds or 4% of a company’s worldwide turnover, whichever is higher. Additionally, the relationship between the UK and the EU in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear following Brexit, including with respect to regulation of data transfers between EU Member States and the UK. On June 28, 2021, the European Commission announced a decision of “adequacy” concluding that the UK ensures an equivalent level of data protection to the EU GDPR, which provides some relief regarding the legality of continued personal data flows from the European Economic Area, or EEA, to the UK. Some uncertainty remains, however, as this adequacy determination must be renewed after four years and may be modified or revoked in the interim. We cannot fully predict how the Data Protection Act, the UK GDPR, and other UK data protection laws or regulations may develop in the medium to longer term nor the effects of divergent laws and guidance regarding how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated.



Employees



As of December 31, 2022, we had 143 full-time employees and 3 part-time employees, 118 of whom are based in Israel and 28 of whom are based in the United States. Of these employees, 116 are primarily engaged in research and development activities and 30 are primarily engaged in general and administrative and commercialization matters. A total of 17 employees have an M.D. or Ph.D. degree. None of our employees is represented by a labor union. We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages and believe our relationships with our employees are good Israeli labor laws govern the length of the workday and workweek, minimum wages for employees, procedures for hiring and dismissing employees, determination of severance pay, annual leave, sick days, advance notice of termination, payments to the National Insurance Institute, and other conditions of employment and include equal opportunity and anti-discrimination laws. While none of our employees is party to any collective bargaining agreements, certain provisions of the collective bargaining agreements between the Histadrut (General Federation of Labor in Israel) and the Coordination Bureau of Economic Organizations (including the Industrialists’ Associations) are applicable to our employees in Israel by order of the Israeli Ministry of Economy and Industry. These provisions primarily concern pension fund benefits for all employees, insurance for work-related accidents, recuperation pay and travel expenses. We generally provide our employees with benefits and working conditions beyond the required minimums.



We are an equal opportunity employer that pledges to not discriminate against employees based on race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability or genetic information. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of equity-based compensation awards. We strive to create a diverse environment, and our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion begins with our leadership team of diverse backgrounds and experiences, including three women on the board of directors.



We are committed to the Environmental Health and Safety (EHS) safety of our employees. We continuously strive to maintain our strong safety performance as we continue to grow our business around the globe. The keys to our EHS success are a workforce that is engaged, a management team who supports and invests in employee safety, and the leadership of our skilled EHS team. In the last several years, the team has added dedicated EHS professionals to individual sites to train employees and ensure compliance with applicable safety standards and regulations. The team hosts regular meetings to share information and discuss best practices across plants.



We are also committed to developing our future leaders at every level. Our talent processes start with understanding what current and future talent is needed to deliver business goals, followed by a talent review process to assist managers with evaluating talent. Learning and development is a critical part of creating our culture of high performance, innovation, and inclusion. We believe on-the-job experience is an outstanding way to learn, and performance and development plans ensure that managers and employees have conversations about career aspirations, mobility, developmental goals and interests.



We are committed to creating an open and accountable workplace where employees feel empowered to speak up and raise issues. In an ongoing effort to understand our employees’ needs, and deliver on our values of trust, accountability and collaboration, we listen. We regularly host company-wide and business unit town halls to offer employees an opportunity to ask questions about Company activities and policies that impact them. We solicit and receive questions and feedback from our employees through this process. We also provide multiple channels to speak up, ask for guidance, and report concerns.

We are subject to extensive environmental, health and safety laws and regulations in a number of jurisdictions, primarily Israel, governing, among other things: the use, storage, registration, handling, emission and disposal of chemicals, waste materials and sewage; chemicals, air, water and ground contamination; air emissions and the cleanup of contaminated sites, including any contamination that results from spills due to our failure to properly dispose of chemicals, waste materials and sewage. Our operations use chemicals and produce waste materials and sewage and require permits from various governmental authorities including, local municipal authorities, the Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Ministry of Health. The Ministry of Environmental Protection and the Ministry of Health, local authorities and the municipal water and sewage company conduct periodic inspections in order to review and ensure our compliance with the various regulations. These laws, regulations and permits could potentially require the expenditure by us of significant amounts for compliance or remediation. If we fail to comply with such laws, regulations or permits, we may be subject to fines and other civil, administrative or criminal sanctions, including the revocation of permits and licenses necessary to continue our business activities. In addition, we may be required to pay damages or civil judgments in respect of third-party claims, including those relating to personal injury (including exposure to hazardous substances we use, store, handle, transport, manufacture or dispose of), property damage or contribution claims. Some environmental, health and safety laws allow for strict, joint and several liability for remediation costs, regardless of comparative fault. We may be identified as a responsible party under such laws. Such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, laws and regulations relating to environmental, health and safety matters are often subject to change. In the event of any changes or new laws or regulations, we could be subject to new compliance measures or to penalties for activities that were previously permitted.
