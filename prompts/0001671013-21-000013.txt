ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
Cardtronics plc, together with its wholly and majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively, “us,” “we,” “our,” “ours,” the “Company” or “Cardtronics”) is the trusted leader in financial self-service, enabling cash transactions at over approximately 285,000 automated teller machines and multi-function financial services kiosks (collectively referred to as “ATMs”) across 10 countries in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and Africa. The total number of ATMs that we service includes our estimate of ATMs that were temporarily closed as a result of the coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19" or the "Pandemic") as further described in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Key Operating Metrics. The total number of transacting ATMs we serviced as of December 31, 2020 was approximately 269,000. Leveraging our unmatched scale, expertise, and innovation, top-tier merchants and businesses of all sizes use our ATM solutions to drive growth, in-store traffic, and retail transactions. Financial services providers rely on Cardtronics to deliver superior service at their own ATMs, on Cardtronics ATMs where they place their brand, and through Cardtronics' Allpoint network, the world’s largest retail-based surcharge-free ATM network, with over 55,000 locations. As champions of cash, Cardtronics converts digital currency into physical cash, driving payments choice for businesses and consumers alike.
During 2020, approximately 70% of our revenues were derived from our operations in North America (including our ATM operations in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada, and Mexico), approximately 24% of our revenues were derived from our operations in Europe and Africa (including our ATM operations in the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), Ireland, Germany, Spain, and South Africa), and approximately 6% of our revenues were derived from our operations in Australia and New Zealand. 
We deliver financial-related services to cardholders through our networks. We also provide ATM management and ATM equipment-related services (typically under multi-year contracts) to large retail merchants, smaller retailers, and operators of facilities such as shopping malls, casinos, airports, and train stations. In doing so, we provide our retail partners with a compelling automated solution that helps attract and retain customers. In turn, it increases the likelihood that customers will utilize the ATMs placed at their facilities. We also partner with financial institutions and other consumer financial services providers to enable convenient and fee-free access to our ATMs via our surcharge-free solutions for their customers.
We generally operate ATMs under three arrangement types with our retail partners: Company-owned ATM placements, merchant-owned ATM placements, and managed services (which includes transaction processing services). Each of the arrangement types described below is attractive to us, and we plan to continue growing our revenues under each arrangement type.
Under Company-owned arrangements, we provide the physical ATM and are typically responsible for all aspects of the ATM’s operations, including transaction processing, managing cash and cash delivery, supplies, and telecommunications, as well as routine and technical maintenance. Under Merchant-owned arrangements, the retail merchant, financial institution, or an independent distributor owns the ATM and is usually responsible for providing cash and performing simple maintenance tasks, while we generally provide more complex maintenance services, transaction processing, and connection to the electronic funds transfer (or “EFT”) networks. 
We also provide processing only services or various managed services solutions to approximately 200,000 ATMs (including our estimate of ATMs that were temporarily closed closed as a result of the Pandemic). Under a managed services arrangement, retailers, financial institutions, and ATM distributors rely on us to handle some or all of the operational aspects associated with operating and maintaining ATMs, typically in exchange for a monthly service fee, a fee per transaction, or a fee per service provided. Each managed service arrangement is a customized ATM management solution that can include any combination of the following services: monitoring, maintenance, cash management, cash delivery, customer service, transaction processing, and other types of related services. 
The majority of our revenues (approximately 88%) are derived from our Company-owned arrangement type whereby we place ATMs, generally at well-known retailers such as Circle K, Costco, CVS, Kroger, Speedway, Target, and Walgreens in the U.S. and Co-op Food, McColls, Shell, and Waitrose in the U.K.

Besides our retail merchant relationships, we also partner with leading financial institutions to brand selected ATMs within our network. These institutions include, but are not limited to, BBVA Compass Bancshares, Inc., Citibank, N.A., Citizens Financial Group, Inc., Cullen/Frost Bankers, Inc., Discover Bank, PNC Bank, N.A., Santander Bank, N.A., TD Bank, N.A., United Services Automobile Association, and US Bank Corp in the U.S.; BMO Bank of Montreal, the Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Imperial Bank Commerce, and TD Bank, N.A. in Canada; the Bank of Queensland Limited and HSBC Holdings plc in Australia; and Capitec Bank, Mercantile Bank, and Old Mutual in South Africa. In Mexico, we partner with the Bank of Nova Scotia and Banco Multiva by putting their brands on our ATMs in exchange for certain services provided by them. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 27,000 of our ATMs were under contract with approximately 500 financial institutions to place their logos on the ATMs and provide convenient surcharge-free access to their banking customers. We also provide managed services offerings for financial institutions, including full outsourcing of a portion or all of the financial institution's ATMs.
We own and operate the Allpoint network (“Allpoint”), the world’s largest retail-based surcharge-free ATM network (based on the number of participating ATMs). Allpoint has over 55,000 participating ATMs and provides surcharge-free ATM access to approximately 1,200 participating credit unions, banks, financial technology companies with a primary focus on the retail consumer finance business (or "Fintechs"), and stored-value debit card issuers. For participants, Allpoint delivers the scale, density, and convenience of surcharge-free ATMs that surpasses the largest banks in the U.S. Under Allpoint, we typically earn either a fixed monthly fee per cardholder or a fixed fee per transaction paid by the consumer's financial institution or the card/benefit issuer. We also earn interchange revenues on each transaction performed at one of our participating Allpoint ATMs. Allpoint includes a majority of our Company-owned ATMs in the U.S. and certain ATMs in the U.K., Canada, Mexico, and Australia. Allpoint also provides services to organizations that manage stored-value debit card programs on behalf of corporate entities and governmental agencies, including general-purpose, payroll, and electronic benefits transfer (“EBT”) cards. Under these programs, the issuing organizations pay Allpoint a fee per issued stored-value debit card or transaction in return for allowing the users of those cards surcharge-free access to Allpoint’s participating ATM network.
We derive over half of our revenues from transaction-based fees, including convenience transaction fees (or “surcharge”) and interchange fees. Surcharge fees are paid by cardholders, while interchange fees are paid by the cardholder’s financial institution for the use of the ATMs serving their customers and connectivity to the applicable EFT network that transmits data between the ATM and the cardholder’s financial institution. Other revenue sources include: (i) fees from financial institutions that participate in Allpoint, (ii) fees for bank-branding ATMs and providing financial institution cardholders with surcharge-free access, (iii) revenues earned by providing managed services solutions and transaction processing services to retailers and financial institutions, (iv) fees earned from foreign currency exchange transactions at the ATM, known as dynamic currency conversion (“DCC”), and (v) revenues from the sale of ATMs, ATM-related equipment and other ancillary services.
Proposed Transaction with NCR Corporation
As previously announced, on January 25, 2021, we entered into a definitive agreement to be acquired by NCR Corporation (“NCR”) for $39.00 per share in cash. This announcement followed our delivery of a notice to terminate our previously announced definitive agreement with Catalyst Holdings Limited (“Catalyst”), an affiliate of Apollo Management, L.P. and Hudson Executive Capital, LP, dated as of December 15, 2020, pursuant to which we would have been acquired by Catalyst for $35.00 per share, in accordance with the terms of such agreement. In connection with such termination, NCR paid on our behalf a termination fee of approximately $32.6 million, which we must reimburse if our agreement with NCR is terminated under certain specified circumstances. The proposed transaction with NCR is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including approval by our shareholders and receipt of regulatory approvals. It is expected that, subject to shareholder approval and the satisfaction or waiver of all relevant conditions, the proposed transaction will be completed in mid-year 2021. For a discussion of certain risks related to the proposed transaction with NCR, including related to certain covenants with which we must comply during the pendency of the proposed transaction, see Item 1A. Risk Factors – Risks Associated with the Proposed Transaction with NCR Corporation. For more information, see our preliminary proxy statement filed with the SEC on February 17, 2021.
Our Strategy
Our strategy is to leverage the expertise, scale, and network we have built in our largest markets while continuing to expand our footprint in select markets. We believe there are significant growth opportunities for our business as the consumer financial services industry continues to transform, with new consumer payment options, changes in consumer behavior, and the evolution of retail banking. This industry transformation, along with changes in consumer behavior and trends are causing financial institutions to evaluate their physical banking services and branch strategies, making our ATMs more attractive as the digital to physical gateway for financial institutions, digital-based businesses, and consumers that need a way to enable cash-based transactions. With our significant network of ATM locations, comprehensive solutions, extensive expertise, and operating history, we believe we can provide value to consumer financial services organizations of all sizes and our retail partners.

We plan to drive additional transactions at our existing ATMs by making them increasingly attractive to use for banks and their customers by promoting our network’s convenience and offering other services and capabilities. We also intend to expand our capabilities and service offerings to financial institutions and digital financial service providers, with whom we are seeing increasing demand for the outsourcing of ATM-related services due to our convenient locations, cost efficiency advantages, and higher service levels. Furthermore, many start-up or challenger banks and providers of consumer financial services are increasingly valuing our convenient ATM network to provide physical cash-related services to their customers, as they seek a cost-effective physical access solution for their customers. We also seek to deploy additional products and services that will further incentivize consumers to utilize our network of ATMs. We plan to continue partnering with leading financial institutions, Fintechs, and retailers to enhance our network of conveniently located ATMs. In the future, we may seek to diversify our revenues beyond the services provided by our ATMs. We aim to capitalize on opportunities to expand our operations through the following efforts:
Broaden our relationships with leading financial institutions. Through our extensive ATM network and unique solutions, financial institutions can leverage our network and platform to continue to provide convenient, secure, and cost-effective cash services to their customers. Services currently offered to financial institutions include bank-branding, deposit solutions, surcharge-free access provided to their cardholders, managed services for their ATM portfolios, and on-screen marketing and content management. Our EFT transaction processing platforms and proprietary software enable us to provide customized control over the content appearing on the screens of our ATMs and ATMs we process for financial institutions, which increases the types of products and services we can offer to financial institutions. We also plan to continue growing the number of financial institutions participating in our Allpoint network, which drives higher transaction volumes and profitability on our existing ATMs and increases our value to the retailers where our ATMs are located through increased foot traffic at their stores. We are seeing increasing demand from financial institutions for the outsourcing of ATM-related services, as recent industry trends have led many banks to reduce their physical footprints and transform their existing branches to focus less on human tellers and increasingly utilize automation, through ATMs and other digital channels, for serving their customers.
Work with Fintechs and card issuers to further leverage our extensive ATM network. We believe there are opportunities to develop or expand relationships with Fintechs and card issuers, such as reloadable stored-value debit card issuers, digital-only balances held by consumers, and alternative payment networks, which are seeking an extensive and convenient ATM network to complement their card offerings and electronic-based accounts. Many leading Fintechs and challenger digital banks and providers of consumer financial services that lack a physical branch or ATM network of their own have partnered with us to provide their customers with convenient and surcharge-free access to ATM services. We have seen strong transaction growth with this customer type, as many of these businesses promote the convenience of our Allpoint network as a value point to their customers and an integral part of their solution. Additionally, we believe that many of the stored-value debit card issuers in the U.S. can benefit by providing their cardholders with access to our ATM network on a discounted or free-to-use basis. For example, through our Allpoint network, we have partnered with issuers of stored-value debit cards to provide convenient, surcharge-free access to cash for their cardholders. 
Increase transaction levels at our existing locations. We believe there are opportunities to increase the number of transactions that occur at our existing ATM locations. On average, only a small share of the individuals that enter our retail customers’ locations utilize our ATMs. In addition to our current initiatives that tend to drive additional transaction volumes to our ATMs, such as bank-branding and network-branding, we have developed and are continuing to develop new initiatives to drive incremental transactions to our existing ATM locations. We also operate and continue to develop programs to encourage cardholders of our existing financial institution partners and members of our Allpoint network to visit our ATMs in convenient retail locations. These programs may include incentives to cardholders, such as coupons and rewards, which influence customers to visit our ATMs. We also continue to invest in data analytics to better understand our ATM usage patterns to help us identify growth opportunities. We also include growth in transaction volumes as an incentive compensation metric for our relationship managers to help drive discussions with our existing financial institution partners to implement programs to drive their customers toward our ATMs. While we are in various stages of developing and implementing many of these programs, we believe that these programs, when properly structured, benefit multiple constituents (i.e., retailers, financial institutions, and cardholders), in addition to driving increased transaction volumes to our ATMs, creating a synergistic network.
Expand the number of deployed ATMs with existing and new merchant relationships. Some of our retail customers continue to expand the number of active store locations they operate through acquisitions or new store openings, providing us with additional ATM deployment opportunities. Additionally, we seek opportunities to deploy ATMs with new retailers, including retailers that currently do not have ATMs, and those that have existing ATM programs but are looking for a new ATM provider. We believe our expertise, broad geographic footprint, strong customer service record, and significant scale positions us to successfully market to and enter into long-term contracts with additional leading merchants.

Develop and provide additional services at our existing ATMs. The majority of our deployed ATMs currently offer only cash dispensing and other simple transactions, such as balance inquiries. We believe that there are opportunities to provide additional automated consumer financial services at our ATMs, such as cash and check deposit, cardless cash access, and other products which could provide a compelling and cost-effective solution for financial institutions and other businesses looking to provide convenient financial services to their customers at well-known retail locations. In 2020, we installed additional deposit-taking ATMs in select markets throughout the United States and reached agreements with several financial institutions to provide their customers with access to these deposit-taking ATMs. Through the development and deployment of our proprietary ATM operating software across our network, we believe that we can expand the transactional capabilities of our ATMs. We have developed a mobile application program interface (or “API”), enabling a direct connection to our ATM networks for either a cash-out or cash-in solution for various types of businesses utilizing a mobile phone. We have a small number of customers using this technology but believe we can grow transactions as businesses and consumers may benefit from our ATM network’s convenience and capabilities.
We also allow advertisers to place their messages on many of our ATMs, which are equipped with on-screen advertising software in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. Offering additional services at our ATMs allows us to create new revenue streams from assets that have already been deployed while providing value to our customers through beneficial offers and convenient services. We are focused on developing additional products and services that can be delivered through our existing ATM network.
Pursue additional managed services opportunities. Over the last several years, we have expanded the number of ATMs operated under managed services arrangements. Under these arrangements, retailers and financial institutions generally pay us a fixed monthly service fee, a fee per transaction, or a fee per service provided in exchange for handling some or all of the operational aspects associated with operating and maintaining ATMs. We have seen increased interest from financial institutions for effective outsourcing of a portion or all of their ATM estates to us, as our solutions are often cost-effective for the financial institution and help the financial institutions prioritize other initiatives. Under these arrangements, surcharge and interchange fees are generally earned by the retailer or the financial institution rather than by us. As a result, our revenues are partially protected from fluctuations in the transaction levels of these ATMs and changes in network interchange rates in this arrangement type. We continue to pursue additional managed services opportunities with leading merchants and financial institutions in the markets where we operate.
Other growth opportunities. Additionally, we may grow in different markets and potentially expand into new international markets over time to enhance our position as a leading global provider of automated consumer financial services. 
For additional information related to items that may impact our strategy, including the respiratory virus commonly known as COVID-19 (the "Pandemic"), see Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Developing Trends and Recent Events.
Our Products and Services
Under Company-owned arrangements, we provide the physical ATM and are typically responsible for all aspects of the ATM’s operations, including transaction processing, managing cash and cash delivery, supplies, and telecommunications, as well as routine and technical maintenance. We believe our customers, including our retail and financial institution customers, value our high level of service, industry expertise, and established operating history. In connection with the operation of our ATMs under our traditional ATM services model, we earn revenue on a per transaction basis from the surcharge fees charged to cardholders for the convenience of using our ATMs and from interchange fees charged to cardholders’ financial institutions for processing the transactions conducted on our ATMs. As further described below, we also earn revenues on these ATMs from branding with financial institutions and our retail-based surcharge-free network, Allpoint. The Company-owned arrangement currently accounts for approximately 88% of our total ATM operating revenues.
Under Merchant-owned arrangements, the retail merchant or an independent distributor owns the ATM and is usually responsible for providing cash and performing simple maintenance tasks. In contrast, we generally provide more complex maintenance services, transaction processing, and connection to the EFT networks. We generally earn interchange revenue on a per transaction basis in this arrangement. In some cases, the surcharge is earned entirely by the merchant, in which case our revenues are derived solely from interchange revenues. In other arrangements, we also share a portion of the surcharge revenues.
For ATMs under managed services arrangements (including transaction processing arrangements), we typically receive a fixed monthly service fee, a fee per transaction, or a fee per service provided in return for performing the agreed-upon service or suite of services. We generally do not receive surcharge and interchange fees in these arrangements, but rather our customer earns those amounts.

We also earn revenues from other services at our ATMs, such as DCC fees, on-screen advertising, and additional transaction-based fees across our various arrangement types.
The following table summarizes the number of transacting ATMs under our various arrangement types as of December 31, 2020:

 | ATM Operations 
 | Company - Owned | Merchant -Owned, Managed Services and Processing | Total 
Number of transacting ATMs at period end | 71,169 | 197,642 | 268,811
Percentage of total transacting ATMs | 26% | 74% | 100% 
Percentage of ATM Operating Revenue | 88% | 12% | 100% 

One of the primary factors affecting transaction volumes at a given ATM is its location. In deploying ATMs, particularly those placed under Company-owned arrangements, we seek to identify and deploy ATMs at locations that provide high visibility and high retail transaction volume. Our experience has demonstrated that the following locations often meet these criteria: convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, pharmacies, transportation hubs (e.g., airports and train stations), casinos, and other major regional and national retail outlets.
We have entered into multi-year agreements with many well-known merchant retailers, including Bi-Lo Holdings, LLC, Circle K Procurement and Brands Limited (“Couche-Tard”), Cumberland Farms, Inc., CVS Caremark Corporation (“CVS”), HEB Grocery Company, L.P., The Kroger Co., The Pantry, Inc., Rite Aid Corporation, Safeway, Inc., Speedway LLC (“Speedway”), Target Corporation, and Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (“Walgreens”) in the U.S.; BP p.l.c., BT Group plc, Co-operative Food (“Co-op Food”), Martin McColl Ltd., Royal Dutch Shell plc, Southern Railway Ltd., Tates Ltd., Waitrose Ltd., and Welcome Break Holdings Ltd. in the U.K.; 7-Eleven, Inc. in Canada and Australia as well as Coles Supermarket Australia Pty Ltd. in Australia; Massmart Holdings Ltd. and Shoprite Holdings Ltd. in South Africa; and Total in Germany.
We generally operate our ATMs under multi-year contracts that provide a recurring and stable revenue source and typically have an initial term of approximately five years. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our top five merchant customers were Co-op Food, Couche-Tard, CVS, Speedway, and Walgreens. No individual merchant customer accounted for more than 6% of the Company’s total revenue in 2020. Together these merchant customers accounted for about 23% of our total revenues and had a weighted average remaining contractual life of approximately 2.7 years. For additional information related to the risks associated with our customer mix, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from ATMs placed with a small number of merchants. The expiration, termination or renegotiation of any of these contracts with our top merchants, or if one or more of our top merchants were to cease doing business with us or substantially reduce its dealings with us, could cause our revenues to decline significantly and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Additionally, we enter into arrangements with financial institutions to brand selected Company-owned ATMs with their logos. These bank-branding arrangements allow a financial institution to expand its geographic presence for less than the cost of building a branch location or placing one of its own ATMs at a new location. Branding arrangements can also rapidly increase the bank's number of branded ATM sites and improve its competitive position. Under these arrangements, the financial institution’s customers have access to use the bank-branded ATMs without paying a surcharge fee to us. In return, we typically receive a fixed fee per branded ATM from the financial institution while retaining our standard fee schedule for other cardholders using the bank-branded ATMs. In addition, our bank-branded ATMs typically earn higher interchange revenue due to the increased usage of our ATMs by the branding financial institution’s customers and others who prefer to use a bank-branded ATM. In some instances, we have branded an ATM with more than one financial institution. We intend to continue pursuing additional bank-branding arrangements as part of our growth strategy.

In addition to our bank-branding arrangements, we offer credit unions, banks, digital banks, Fintechs, stored-value debit card issuers, and other consumer financial services providers another type of surcharge-free solution to their customers through our Allpoint retail-based surcharge-free ATM network. Allpoint members pay us a fixed monthly fee per cardholder and/or a fixed fee per transaction in exchange for our providing their cardholders with surcharge-free ATM access to approximately 55,000 participating ATMs, which includes ATMs throughout the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Mexico, and Australia. We also earn interchange revenues for each transaction paid to us by the consumer’s financial institution. We believe Allpoint is an attractive option for providers of consumer financial services of all sizes to provide convenient consumer ATM-related services.
For additional information related to the amount of revenue contributed by our various service offerings, see Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Components of Revenues, Costs of Revenues, and Expenses - Revenues.
Segment and Geographic Information
We operate in three segments: North America, Europe & Africa, and Australia & New Zealand. Our North America segment includes ATM operations in all 50 states in the U.S., Puerto Rico, Canada, and Mexico and accounted for approximately 70% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our Europe & Africa segment includes our ATM operations in the U.K., Ireland, Germany, Spain, and South Africa and accounted for approximately 24% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. Our Australia & New Zealand segment includes ATM operations in Australia and New Zealand and accounted for approximately 6% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020. While each of the reporting segments provides similar kiosk-based and/or ATM-related services, each segment is managed separately and requires different marketing and business strategies.
For financial information including revenues, earnings, and total assets of our reporting segments, see Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Note 22. Segment Information. For additional information related to the risks associated with our international operations, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We operate in many sovereign jurisdictions worldwide and expect to continue to grow our business in new regions. Operating in different countries involves special risks which could result in a reduction of our gross and net profits.
Sales and Marketing
We typically organize our sales and marketing teams by customer type across retail and financial customers. We have sales and marketing teams focused on developing and managing our relationships with national, regional, and local merchants. In addition, we have sales and marketing teams focused on developing and managing our relationships with financial institutions, financial technology companies, and stored-value debit card issuers as we look to expand the types of services that we offer to such organizations. Our sales and marketing teams also focus on identifying potential managed services opportunities with financial institutions and retailers. We maintain sales teams for each of the geographic markets in which we currently operate.
In addition to targeting new business opportunities, our sales and marketing teams support our customer retention and growth initiatives by building and maintaining relationships with our existing merchants and ATM distributors. We seek to identify growth opportunities within merchant accounts by analyzing ATM cardholder patterns and recommending programs that we expect to increase transaction volumes. We also analyze foot traffic and various demographic data to determine the best opportunities for new ATM placements and the potential drivers for increasing same-store ATM transactions that will positively impact merchants’ store sales. We typically compensate employees who focus on sales with a combination of incentive-based compensation and base salary.
Technology and Operations 
Our technology and operations platforms consist of ATMs, central transaction processing systems, ATM terminal software, network infrastructure components (including hardware, software, and telecommunication circuits used to provide real-time ATM monitoring, software distribution, and transaction processing services), cash management and forecasting software tools, customer service, information security, and ATM management infrastructure. In most of our markets, except for our U.K. operations, a portion of our operations are outsourced to other providers, particularly for physical cash delivery and physical maintenance services. Inclusive of our internal capabilities and partnerships, we offer end-to-end ATM service solutions for our retail and financial partners, which we believe is a competitive advantage.

Transaction processing. We place significant emphasis on providing quality service with a high level of security and minimal interruption. We have carefully selected support vendors and systems and developed internal professional staff to optimize the performance of our network. We operate our own EFT transaction processing platforms, which enables us to process and monitor transactions on our ATMs and to control the flow and content of information appearing on the screens of such ATMs. We have also implemented new products and services, such as dynamic currency conversion. 
Internal systems. Our internal systems, including our EFT transaction processing platforms, include multiple security layers to help protect the systems from unauthorized access. We use hardware-based and software-based security features to prevent and report unauthorized access attempts to our systems. We operate user authentication and security measures at multiple levels. Detailed security rules protect these systems, allowing only appropriate access to information based on the employee’s job responsibilities. Changes to systems are controlled by policies and procedures, with automatic prevention and reporting controls placed within our processes. Our real-time connections to the various financial institutions’ authorization systems that allow withdrawals, deposits, balance inquiries, transfers, and advanced functionality transactions are accomplished through gateway relationships or direct connections. We use commercially available and proprietary software that monitors the performance of the ATMs in our network, including details of transactions at each ATM and expenses relating to the ATMs, further allowing us to monitor our online availability and financial profitability at each location. We analyze transaction volume and profitability data to determine whether to continue operating at a given site, determine how to price various operating arrangements with merchants and bank-branding partners, and create a profile of successful locations to help us decide the best places for additional deployments.
Product development. In recent years, we have made investments in developing new technology which we anticipate will drive transaction volume at our ATMs. We have a product development team focused on improving existing products and services as well as delivering new capabilities that generally leverage our existing platform. Internal product development is an increasing focus for us, and we expect, over time, our product development will drive revenue growth. Examples of recent and continued product development include dynamic currency conversion at the ATM, promotional consumer offers, deposit enablement for multiple financial institutions, cardless cash access via a mobile phone, and the ability to convert stored-value digital currency into cash and cash into stored-value digital currency at the ATM. Several products are currently in various stages of development, pilot, and rollout. 
In 2020, we developed and implemented our own proprietary ATM operating software. This software, developed in-house, includes a suite of ATM applications that provides us greater control and speed to market while enhancing functionality and improved security. This bundle of applications, which includes our proprietary NeotermTM software, enables us to quickly integrate and scale mobile solutions and other products. The NeotermTM software and our other proprietary applications deliver enhanced operational and financial control over our ATM estate on a remote basis and we are already starting to realize lower operating costs through fewer physical maintenance visits, lower software maintenance costs and enhanced uptime. We are rolling the software out initially in the U.S. and Canada and plan to expand the development globally starting with the U.K. in 2021. This technology is now live on over 20,000 ATMs as of December 31, 2020, representing more than half of our U.S. owned ATM footprint.
ATM cash management. Our ATM cash management function uses commercially available software and proprietary analytical models to determine the necessary fill frequency and cash load amount for each ATM. We project vault cash requirements for our Company-owned and cash-serviced ATMs, taking into consideration the ATM's location, the day of the week, the timing of holidays, and other factors such as specific events occurring in the vicinity of the ATM. After receiving a cash order from us, the vault cash provider forwards the request to its vault location nearest to the applicable ATM. Personnel at the vault location then arrange for the requested amount of cash to be set aside and made available for the designated cash-in-transit provider to access and subsequently transport to the ATM. Our ATM cash management function utilizes data from the vault cash providers, internally produced data, and proprietary methodologies to confirm daily orders, audit delivery of cash to cash-in-transit providers and ATMs, monitor cash balances for cash shortages, coordinate and manage special cash orders, and audit costs from both cash-in-transit providers and vault cash providers. In the U.K., we operate our own cash-in-transit operation that services most of our ATMs in the U.K. 
Customer service. We believe factors that differentiate us from our competitors are our customer service and proactive approach to managing any downtime experienced by our ATMs. We use advanced software and skilled technicians that monitor our ATMs 24 hours a day for service interruptions and notify our maintenance engineers and vendors for the prompt dispatch of necessary service calls.
Finally, we use proprietary software systems to maintain a database of our ATMs’ transactions and performance metrics. We aggregate this data into individual merchant and financial institution customer profiles used by our customer service team. 

We believe our proprietary databases enable us to provide superior quality and reliable customer support, together with information on trends that is also valuable to our retail and financial institution partners.
Primary Vendor Relationships
To maintain an efficient and flexible operating structure, we outsource certain aspects of our operations, including cash supply and cash delivery, maintenance, and certain transaction processing services. Due to the large number of ATMs we operate, we believe we have obtained favorable pricing terms from most major vendors. We contract for the provision of the services described below in connection with our operations.
Transaction processing. We own and operate EFT transaction processing platforms that utilize proprietary as well as commercially-available software. We process a portion of our withdrawal transactions through third parties. We plan to convert transaction processing services to our internal EFT transaction processing platforms when economically advantageous to us or as these contracts expire or terminate.
EFT network services. Our transactions are routed over various EFT networks to obtain authorization for cash disbursements and provide account balances. EFT networks set the interchange fees that they charge to the financial institutions and the amount paid to us. We attempt to maximize the utility of our ATMs to cardholders by participating in as many EFT networks as practical. Additionally, we own and operate the Allpoint network, the world's largest retail-based surcharge-free ATM network. Having this network further enhances our ATM utility by providing certain cardholders surcharge-free access to our ATMs, as well as allowing us to receive network-related economic benefits such as receiving additional transaction-based revenue and setting interchange rates on transactions over this network.
Equipment. We purchase our ATMs from global ATM manufacturers, including, but not limited to, NCR Corporation, Hyosung America Inc., Triton Systems of Delaware, LLC, and Diebold Nixdorf Incorporated. The large quantity of ATMs that we purchase from these manufacturers enables us to receive favorable pricing and terms. In addition, we maintain close working relationships with these manufacturers, allowing us to stay informed about product updates and receive prompt attention for any technical problems with purchased ATM equipment. The favorable pricing we receive from these manufacturers also allows us to offer our customers an affordable solution to replace their ATMs with modern technology and be compliant with new regulatory requirements as they arise.
Maintenance. We generally contract with third-party service providers with national operations for on-site maintenance services in most of our markets. In the U.K., Australia, Canada, and South Africa, maintenance services are, to differing degrees, performed by in-house technicians.
ATM cash management. We obtain or use our own cash to fill our Company-owned ATMs, and in some cases, merchant-owned and managed services ATMs, under arrangements with various vault cash providers. We pay a monthly fee based on the average outstanding vault cash balances to our primary vault cash providers under a floating rate formula, which is generally based on various benchmark interest rates such as London Interbank Offered Rates (“LIBOR”). In virtually all cases, beneficial ownership of the cash is retained by the vault cash providers, and we have no right to the cash and no access except for the ATMs that are serviced by our wholly-owned cash-in-transit operations in the U.K. While our U.K. cash-in-transit operations have physical access to the cash loaded in the ATMs, beneficial ownership of that cash remains with the vault cash provider at all times. We also contract with third parties to provide us with certain cash management services, which vary by geography, including reporting, cash-in-transit coordination, cash ordering, cash insurance, reconciliation of ATM cash balances, and claims processing with cash-in-transit providers, financial institutions, and processors.
For the quarter ended December 31, 2020, we had an average outstanding vault cash balance of approximately $2.5 billion in our North America ATMs, approximately $1.2 billion in our Europe and Africa ATMs, and approximately $0.3 billion in our Australia and New Zealand ATMs. For additional information related to our vault cash agreements and the related risks, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We rely on third parties in the various regions where we operate to provide us with the cash we require to operate many of our ATMs. If these third parties were unable or unwilling to provide us with the necessary cash to operate our ATMs, we would need to identify alternative sources of cash to operate our ATMs or we would not be able to operate our business. Also, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - Changes in interest rates could increase our operating costs by increasing interest expense under our credit facilities and our vault cash rental costs.
The vault cash that we are contractually responsible for in all jurisdictions in which we operate is insured up to certain per location loss limits and subject to per-incident and annual aggregate deductibles through a syndicate of multiple underwriters.

Cash replenishment. We contract with cash-in-transit providers to transport and transfer most of the cash to our ATMs. We use leading third-party cash-in-transit providers in all of our jurisdictions except for in the U.K., where we primarily utilize our own cash-in-transit operations. Under these arrangements, the cash-in-transit providers pick up the cash in bulk using instructions from us and our vault cash providers to prepare the cash for delivery to each ATM on the designated fill day. Following a predetermined schedule, the cash-in-transit providers visit each location on the designated fill day, load cash into each ATM, and then balance each machine and provide cash reporting to the applicable vault cash provider.
Merchant Customers
In each of our markets, we typically deploy our Company-owned ATMs under long-term contracts with major national and regional merchants including convenience stores, gas stations, grocery stores, pharmacies, and other high-traffic locations. Our merchant-owned ATMs are typically deployed under arrangements with smaller independent merchants.
The terms of our merchant contracts vary as a result of negotiations at the time of execution. In the case of Company-owned ATMs, the contract terms vary but typically include the following:
•a multi-year term, typically approximately five years;
•exclusive deployment of ATMs at locations where we install an ATM;
•the right to increase surcharge fees, with merchant consent required in some cases;
•in the U.S., our right to terminate or remove ATMs or renegotiate the fees payable to the merchant if surcharge fees or interchange fees are reduced or eliminated as a result of regulatory action; and
•provisions that make the merchant’s fee dependent on the number of ATM transactions.
During the year ended December 31, 2020, we derived approximately 23% of our total revenues from ATMs placed at the locations of our top five merchant customers, including revenues from bank branding and Allpoint at these locations, none of which individually contributed more than approximately 6% of our total revenues for the year. The weighted average remaining contractual life of our top five merchant customers is approximately 2.7 years. For additional information related to the risks associated with our customer mix, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We derive a substantial portion of our revenue from ATMs placed with a small number of merchants. The expiration, termination or renegotiation of any of these contracts with our top merchants, or if one or more of our top merchants were to cease doing business with us or substantially reduce its dealings with us, could cause our revenues to decline significantly and could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.
Seasonality and Tourism
Our business is generally seasonal, with typically fewer transactions occurring in the first quarter of the year. Transaction volumes at our ATMs located in regions affected by strong winter weather patterns typically experience declines in volume during winter months due to decreases in the amount of consumer traffic through such locations. We usually see an increase in transactions in the warmer summer months, which are also aided by increased vacation and holiday travel. We expect these fluctuations in transaction volumes to continue in the future. In addition, other factors, such as a recessionary economic environment, extreme weather, natural disasters, or real or potential health emergencies such as the widespread outbreak of contagious diseases, could hinder travel, reduce the use of cash, and may have a negative impact on transaction levels. Specifically, the Pandemic has impacted our business, as further discussed in Part II. Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - COVID-19 Update. For additional information related to the risks associated with seasonality and other outside factors, see Item 1A. Risk Factors - We are subject to business cycles, seasonality, and other outside factors such as extreme weather, natural disasters or health emergencies, including the ongoing outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic ("COVID-19" or the "Pandemic") that has adversely affected our business, and that may in the future have a material adverse impact on our business.
Competition
Historically, we have competed with independent ATM deployers (commonly referred to as “IADs”) and financial institutions for ATM placements, new merchant accounts, bank-branding and network-branding relationships, and acquisitions. IADs compete with us for placement rights at merchant locations. Our ATMs compete with the ATMs owned and operated by financial institutions and other IADs for underlying consumer transactions. In certain locations with very high foot traffic, such as airports, major train stations, large arenas, and stadiums, we see competition from large financial institutions as they may utilize such locations for marketing and advertising purposes, and in some cases are willing to subsidize the operations of the ATM.

We have established relationships with leading regional and national financial institutions, digital banks, other consumer financial services operators, and stored-value debit card issuers through our bank-branding program and Allpoint. These programs can be cost-efficient alternatives to these organizations in place of operating branches and owning and operating extensive ATM networks. We believe the scale of our extensive network, our EFT transaction processing services, our comprehensive solutions, and our focus on customer service provide us with competitive advantages for providing services to leading financial institutions and newer providers of consumer financial services.
We continually develop the types of services that we provide to financial institutions and merchants. Regarding Allpoint, we encounter competition from other organizations’ surcharge-free networks seeking to sell access to their network to retail locations and offer surcharge-free ATM access to issuers of stored-value debit cards, as well as financial institutions that lack large ATM footprints. With respect to our managed services offering, we believe we are well positioned to offer a comprehensive ATM outsourcing solution with our breadth of services, in-house expertise, and network of existing locations that can leverage the economies of scale required to operate an ATM portfolio. There are several large financial services companies, ATM equipment manufacturers, and service providers that currently offer some of the services we provide, with whom we expect to compete. While we have direct competition for providing certain services, we believe that we have advantages that will allow us to offer various compelling solutions to financial institutions and retailers alike.
We believe that our ability to deliver comprehensive ATM solutions to financial institutions is a competitive service differentiator. Depending on the core objectives of the financial institution, we can deliver a cost-effective full ATM outsourcing solution, convenient surcharge-free ATM network access through Allpoint, or brand extension through our bank-branding offering. Increasingly, we are seeing financial institutions interested in our multiple solutions. Our ability to deliver additional customer traffic through our bank-branding and Allpoint solutions also provides value to our retail partners, and we believe this is a competitive advantage with respect to competition from other IADs.
Acquisitions have historically been a part of our strategy and may form part of our future strategy. Typically, competition for acquisitions is from other IADs, financial service or payments businesses, and/or private equity sponsors of ATM portfolios.
Finally, we face indirect competition from alternative payment mechanisms, such as card-based payments, including contactless, and other electronic forms of payment, including payment applications on mobile phones. While it has been difficult to specifically quantify the direct effects of alternative payment sources on our transaction volumes, cash-based payments have declined as a percentage of total payments in our primary geographic markets in recent years. Further adoption of electronic payment forms and the entry of new and less traditional competitors could reduce consumer demand for cash. We expect to continue to face competition from emerging payments technology in the future. See Item 1A. Risk Factors - The proliferation of payment options and increasingly frictionless methods of payment other than cash, including credit cards, debit cards, stored-value debit cards, contactless, and mobile payments options, could result in a reduced need for cash in the marketplace and a resulting decline in the usage of our ATMs, and The ATM industry is highly competitive and such competition may increase, which may adversely affect our profit margins.
Government and Industry Regulation
Our principal business, ATM network ownership and operation, is subject to government (federal, state, and/or local) and industry regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide our products and services in such jurisdictions, as well as the imposition of civil fines. For additional information related to recent regulatory matters that have impacted our operations or are expected to impact us in the future, see Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Developing Trends and Recent Events. See also Item 1A. Risk Factors - We operate in several jurisdictions and we could be adversely affected by violations of anti-bribery, sanctions and anti-money laundering laws and regulations, and Regulatory, legislative or self-regulatory/standard developments regarding privacy and data security matters could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business. 
Risk Management
We have adopted a formalized Enterprise Risk Management program to identify and manage the major risks we face. The major risks are prioritized and assigned to a management team member who develops mitigation plans, monitors the risk activity, and is responsible for implementing the mitigation plan, if necessary. The risks, plans, and activities are regularly monitored by our management team and overseen by our Board of Directors (the “Board”).
Human Capital Management
As of December 31, 2020, we had 2,027 employees, 241 of which were covered by a collective bargaining agreement. These employees occupy a wide range of positions in front line, back office, information technology, product, sales, operations, and many other types of roles. We currently believe our relationships with employees represented by the union are good and we have not experienced any work stoppages. 
We believe that how we do our work at Cardtronics is equally as important as what we do as a Company. We place a high value on ensuring the Company creates a positive, inclusive, and diverse work environment for its employees in which all have the opportunity to realize their potential as individuals and teams. We strive to ensure all employees understand and feel connected to the purpose-driven mission, vision, and values (the “PVV”) of the organization. To do so, we focus on fostering ongoing, two-way communication through many channels, including pulse and engagement surveys, town halls, and our corporate intranet. 
Our core values include One Team, Trust, Excellence, Ambitious, and Innovation. We purposefully defined these values to drive specific behaviors in the service of Cardtronics’ long-term success and desired culture, and we embed them in all we do. Since 2018, this has included a direct link between the demonstration of values-driven behaviors and compensation, through our performance management programs. Additionally, our values underpin our robust training, compliance, and development programs, which are designed to drive key talent engagement and retention, enable employees’ effective execution of company strategies, and reduce risk. 
Also aligned to the PVV was the elevation of our Inclusion & Diversity (“I&D”) strategy in 2020, with support and oversight from our Board. We formed an I&D Council, which has responsibility for executing on our goals of engendering employee pride, to attract, engage, and retain top talent; driving business results and positive impacts in the communities we serve; and making continued progress against established I&D metrics. The I&D Council is comprised of representatives from diverse functions, levels, locations, backgrounds, and experiences. We enhanced our diversity-focused recruitment efforts and partnerships, and refreshed our awareness and training programs related to inclusion, anti-discrimination and anti-harassment. We continue to focus our efforts on identifying and understanding the most relevant metrics to measure our progress over time.

Gender diversityas of 12/31/2020 | Female | | Male | | Total 
 | # of Employees | % of Total | | # of Employees | % of Total | # of Employees
Executive Leadership Team | 2 | 22% | | 7 | 78% | 9 
Other | 659 | 33% | | 1,359 | 67% | 2,018 
Total Employees | 661 | 33% | | 1,366 | 67% | 2,027 

Our employee engagement survey results indicate our employees have reacted positively to our I&D and broader cultural efforts. Since 2018, we have had consistent, year-over-year improvement in overall engagement scores, as well as employee connection to our PVV. In 2020, we saw double-digit improvements in nearly all engagement metrics, in spite of the significant impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and workforce. 
Employee health and safety was a top priority throughout 2020. A significant number of our employees shifted to working remotely beginning in mid-March 2020, and we implemented safety protocols for our essential workers (front line and facility-dependent) who were necessary to continue providing our services to the communities in which we operate. In addition, we enhanced our communication and training efforts to ensure we kept employees apprised of all developments, how to maintain health and safety, and how to operate optimally in these changing circumstances.
Organizational History and Additional Company Information
We were formed as a Texas corporation in 1993 and operated initially under the name of Cardpro, Inc. In June 2001, Cardtronics Group, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the state of Delaware and became the parent company for the existing business. In January 2004, Cardtronics Group, Inc. changed its name to Cardtronics, Inc. (“Cardtronics Delaware”), and in December 2007, we completed an initial public offering.

In July 2016, the location of incorporation of the parent company of the Cardtronics group of companies was changed from Delaware to the U.K., whereby Cardtronics plc, a public limited company organized under English law (“Cardtronics plc”), became the new publicly traded corporate parent of the Cardtronics group of companies following the completion of the merger between Cardtronics Delaware and one of its subsidiaries (the “Redomicile”). Upon completing the Redomicile, Cardtronics plc common shares were listed and began trading on the NASDAQ stock market under the symbol “CATM,” the same symbol under which common shares of Cardtronics Delaware were formerly listed and traded. The Redomicile transaction was accounted for as an internal reorganization of entities under common control, and therefore, Cardtronics Delaware’s assets and liabilities have been accounted for at their historical cost basis and not revalued in the transaction.
Acquisitions have driven a large portion of our growth throughout our operating history as we expanded our operations in the U.S. and into several other new geographic markets in North America, Europe, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. Our largest markets are currently the U.S. and the U.K. Over the past few years, our growth strategy has been primarily focused on organic growth.
