Item 1.    Business
Corporate History and Background
MultiPlan, formerly known as Churchill Capital Corp III (formerly known as Butler Acquisition Corp), was incorporated in Delaware on October 30, 2019 for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses. 
On July 12, 2020, Churchill entered into the Merger Agreement by and among First Merger Sub, Second Merger Sub, Holdings, and MultiPlan Parent. On October 8, 2020, the Merger Agreement was consummated and the Transactions were completed. In connection with the Transactions, Churchill changed its name to MultiPlan Corporation and The New York Stock Exchange ticker symbols for its Class A common stock and warrants to "MPLN" and "MPLN.WS", respectively.
The Transactions were accounted for as a reverse recapitalization, with no goodwill or other intangible assets recorded, in accordance with GAAP. Under this method of accounting, Churchill was treated as the "acquired" company for financial reporting purposes with MultiPlan Parent determined to be the accounting acquiror. This determination was primarily based on the existing MultiPlan Parent stockholders being the majority stockholders and holding majority voting power in the combined company, MultiPlan Parent's senior management comprising the majority of the senior management of the combined company, and the ongoing operations of MultiPlan Parent comprising the ongoing operations of the combined company. Accordingly, for accounting purposes, the Transactions were treated as the equivalent of MultiPlan Parent issuing shares for the net assets of Churchill, accompanied by a recapitalization. The net assets of Churchill were recognized at fair value (which were consistent with carrying value), with no goodwill or other intangibles recorded. See Note 4 The Transactions of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information on the Transactions.
Unless otherwise noted, "we," "us," "our", "MultiPlan", and the "Company" and similar terms refer to MultiPlan Parent or Polaris and its subsidiaries prior to the consummation of the Transactions, and MultiPlan and its subsidiaries after the Transactions. 
Recent Acquisitions of HST and Discovery Health Partners
On November 9, 2020 MultiPlan acquired HST, a healthcare technology company that enables value-driven health benefit plan designs featuring reference-based pricing and tools to engage health plan members and providers in making the best use of available benefits both before and after care delivery. The services are used in conjunction with, or in lieu of, a provider network and generally deliver lower overall cost of care for health plan sponsors and their members. As a result of the acquisition, MultiPlan renamed its Medical Reimbursement Services solution category to Reference-Based Pricing and also added Value-Driven Health Plan Services to the category.
On February 26, 2021, MultiPlan acquired DHP, an analytics and technology company offering healthcare payment and revenue integrity services to commercial and government healthcare payors. DHP extends MultiPlan’s payment integrity offerings by adding a number of services including post-payment services, as well as a line of services that improve the accuracy of revenue collected. As a result, following our acquisition of DHP, MultiPlan revised its Payment Integrity Services solution category to Payment and Revenue Integrity. The following discussion in this Item 1, Business, reflects these post-acquisition changes to our offerings. 
Business
MultiPlan is a leading value-added provider of data analytics and technology-enabled end-to-end cost management, payment and revenue integrity solutions to the U.S. healthcare industry. We are also one of the largest independent PPOs in the U.S., with contracted providers in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. We are committed to helping healthcare payors manage the cost of care, improve their competitiveness and inspire positive change. Leveraging sophisticated technology, data analytics and a team rich with industry experience, MultiPlan interprets clients' needs and customizes innovative solutions through the following offerings:
•Analytics-Based Services: data-driven algorithms which detect claims over-charges and recommend or negotiate fair reimbursement;
•Network-Based Services: contracted discounts with healthcare providers, including one of the largest independent preferred provider organizations in the United States, and outsourced network development and/or management services; and
•Payment and Revenue Integrity Services: data, technology, and clinical expertise deployed to identify and remove improper and unnecessary charges before or after claims are paid, or to identify and help restore and preserve underpaid premium dollars.
Our customers almost entirely are payors. We offer these payors a single electronic gateway to a comprehensive set of services in each of the three categories (Analytics-Based Services, Network-Based Services and Payment and Revenue Integrity Services) which are used in combination or individually to reduce the medical cost burden on healthcare payors and patients while fostering efficient payments to the providers. These offerings have enabled us to maintain long-term relationships with a number of our customers, including relationships of over 25 years with some of the nation's largest commercial payors. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our expansive network included access to over 1,200,000 healthcare providers and our comprehensive services identified approximately $18.8 billion in potential medical cost savings.
Payors generally aim to pay provider claims at a discount to reduce cost, to eliminate any improperly billed charges before payment is made, and to recover any incorrectly paid charges after payment is made. Our Analytics-Based Services discount claims using data-driven negotiation and/or re-pricing methodologies to support payments to providers with whom contractual discounts are not possible and are generally priced based on a percentage of savings achieved. Also included in this category are services that enable lower cost health plans that feature reference-based pricing either in conjunction with or in place of a provider network. These services are generally priced at a bundled PEPM rate. Our Network-Based Services offer payors a broad network of discounted rates for providers with whom payors do not have a contractual relationship, and are priced based on either a percentage of savings achieved or at a per employee/member per month fee. This service category also includes customized network development and management services for payors seeking to expand their network footprint using outsourced services. These build services are generally priced on a per contract or other project-based price. Our Payment and Revenue Integrity Services use data, technology and clinical expertise to assist payors in identifying improper, unnecessary and excessive charges before or after claims are paid, as well as issues with premiums paid by CMS for government health plans caused by discrepancies with enrollment-related data. Payment and Revenue Integrity Services are generally priced based on a percentage of savings achieved.
We believe that our solutions provide a strong value proposition to consumers, as well as to providers. Overall, our service offerings aim to reduce healthcare costs for payors and consumers in a manner that is orderly, efficient and fair to all parties. In addition, because the fee for our services is in most instances directly linked to the savings realized by our customers, our interests are aligned with the interests of our customers.
Industry
Healthcare Industry
According to CMS, healthcare expenditures will grow from $3.8 trillion, or 17.8% of U.S. GDP, in 2019 to represent 19.7% of GDP by 2028, representing a compounded annual growth rate of 5.5%. There are a multitude of factors driving this expected growth, including recent regulations and ongoing secular trends, such as the aging population and other demographic factors, which are driving expanded healthcare coverage and increased utilization. Additional growth in healthcare costs are driven by availability of new medical technologies, therapies and modalities. As expenditures continue to rise, stakeholders and especially payors are becoming increasingly focused on solutions that reduce medical costs and improve payment accuracy.
We believe cost management and revenue/payment integrity solutions will continue to be highly valuable to payors. We expect that growth in demand for these services will be driven by two major trends: (i) increasing costs per claim from medical inflation and technology enhancements and (ii) increasing treatment volume from an aging population and increases in the insured population. As medical activity rises as a result of an aging population and a focus on preventative healthcare and technological advances, medical claims volume and value are expected to increase significantly, which we believe will further increase utilization of our solutions. Furthermore, we benefit from medical cost inflation since the access fee we charge for use of our services is primarily based on a percentage of the savings achieved. We see opportunity in trying to counter the accelerating pace of medical cost inflation, leading to more savings for our customers, and associated revenues for us. For example, for those services priced in this manner, if the average charge per claim increases by 10%, we will have a 10% greater dollar value of claims from which to capture savings and revenue.
Cost Management Solutions
Payors of medical claims include large national insurance companies, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, provider-sponsored and independent health plans, TPAs, Taft-Hartley plans, property and casualty bill review vendors, and other entities that pay medical bills in the commercial healthcare, government, workers' compensation and auto medical markets. The government market comprises state and federal government programs such as Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, TRICARE and Veterans Administration. These payors attempt to manage and control the medical costs they face by addressing the price and the quantity of the procedures and products utilized. The chart below demonstrates the way in which payors employ several solutions and services to control medical costs.
Services
Analytics-Based Services.
The Company leverages its information technology platform to offer customers Analytics-Based Services to reduce medical costs. Our proprietary algorithms allow claims to be quickly and accurately compared against a library of the most updated and relevant pricing data. Our extensive nationwide network of providers and our list of payor customers provides us with deep insights into the latest pricing trends. Customers of our Analytics-Based Services are primarily large commercial insurers, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, provider-sponsored and independent health plans, TPAs, and property and casualty carriers through their bill review companies. Fees are generally based on a percentage of savings achieved. 
Reference Based Pricing. RBP provides payors with a recommended payment amount on claims using a variety of methodologies based on a reference point. The Company relies on data from public and private sources on a national and local level which are then analyzed using proprietary automated algorithms that deliver consistency and defensibility. The recommendations factor in key variables such as the provider's location, type and size; and where applicable, the severity and resource intensity of the procedures performed; costs/accepted reimbursements of other providers under the same circumstances; and/or Medicare-based price. Three approaches are used to arrive at these recommendations, which are then used by the payor during the adjudication and payment process. The first approach is a cost-based (facilities) or reimbursement-based (professionals) approach which determines a fair reimbursement by calculating the median cost incurred or payment amount accepted by a benchmark group of like providers to deliver the same service. The second approach is charge-based and arrives at the recommended amount based on analysis of charges from comparable facilities for a specific procedure. The third applies a mark up or down from the amount Medicare reimburses for the same service, with various methodologies deployed to determine the amount when a Medicare equivalent is not available. 
Financial Negotiation. Our Financial Negotiation services assist payors with claims from providers with whom neither they nor MultiPlan have been able to secure a contractual discount. The Company handles these claims on an individual basis and attempts to negotiate with the provider an acceptable payment amount for a specific claim. Approximately half of the successfully negotiated claims are completed in a fully automated manner. The claims include those in which the proposed negotiated amount is generated by algorithms and automatically transmitted to the provider’s office. Certain providers also choose to set up an arrangement with MultiPlan for pre-determined levels of discount to be automatically deducted on claims that would otherwise be individually negotiated. For those claims that are not automatically negotiated, MultiPlan negotiates directly with the provider's office through our negotiations staff that are aided by compiled statistics about the discounts typically received on these types of claims. 
Network-Based Services
Network-Based Services includes MultiPlan's Primary and Complementary Networks in which payors can utilize our extensive national network of over 1,200,000 contracted providers to process claims at a significant discount compared to billed fee-for-service rates, or increasingly, to build customized access for use by the customer's health plan. The establishment of a large and successful network of providers utilized by multiple payors creates a self-reinforcing network effect whereby, as more payors and their consumers access the network, participation in the network becomes more desirable to other providers. MultiPlan's large provider network allows payors to share the prohibitive costs of maintaining a large and complex network. In addition, providers that join MultiPlan's network gain access to a wide range of payors with the execution of a single contractual relationship. 
Primary Network. For customers without their own direct contractual discount arrangements with providers, our Primary Network serves as the network for the payor's commercial or government health plan in a given service area in exchange for a PEPM rate, or as the payor's out-of-area extended primary network in exchange for a percentage of the savings achieved. Increasingly, the network is also being used to configure custom-built access for a payor's Medicare Advantage plans. The Primary Network is NCQA accredited, which we believe provides assurances to payors regarding provider credentials and network compliance and provides consumers additional confidence regarding the quality of the providers in our network. Customers mainly include provider-sponsored and independent health plans; Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and other government-sponsored health plans; Taft-Hartley plans and TPAs as it is more cost effective for these payors to outsource this function than to incur the expense of developing and maintaining their own network of thousands of doctors and hospitals. 
Complementary Network. Our Complementary Network provides payor customers with access to our national network of healthcare providers that offer discounts under the health plan's out-of-network benefits, or otherwise can be accessed secondary to another network. Payors use the network to expand provider choice for consumers, and to achieve contracted reductions on more claims. Our customers pay us if they achieve savings from the Complementary Network; therefore, we believe that MultiPlan provides payors with an effective method to reduce costs. Our Complementary Network customers include large commercial insurers, property and casualty carriers via their bill review vendors, TPAs and provider-sponsored and independent health plans. 
Payment and Revenue Integrity Services
This category includes Payment Integrity Services, which we have offered since 2014, and Revenue Integrity Services, which we introduced in 2021 with the acquisition of DHP.
Our Payment Integrity Services use data, technology, and clinical expertise to identify improper, unnecessary and excessive charges before or after claims are paid. There are six services presently offered to a variety of payors. 
Clinical Negotiation (pre-payment). With Clinical Negotiation, payment integrity analytics score the claim, and then based on the score the claim is reviewed by a clinician and/or coder and routed to a negotiator to attempt to reach agreement for a lower reimbursement as a result of the identified billing issues. If successful, the payor reimburses under the negotiated agreement. This service targets non-contracted claims and is used by large commercial insurers and Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans. The service is also integrated into MultiPlan's network pricing, so is used by many of the customers of our primary and/or complementary networks. 
Claim Correction (pre-payment). With Claim Correction, payment integrity analytics and the clinician/coder review (if needed, based on the confidence level of the analytics findings) lead to a recommendation to remove certain charges which is factored into the payor's final adjudication of the claim. This service targets all claims, including the in-network claims of large commercial and Medicare Advantage insurers, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, provider-sponsored commercial and Medicare 
Advantage health plans, property and casualty carriers via their bill review vendors, and TPAs. It is also integrated into MultiPlan's network pricing, so is used by many of the customers of our primary and/or complementary networks.
Clinical Audits (pre- and post-payment). Clinical Audits deploys payment integrity analytics backed by expert clinical review to evaluate the cost and clinical appropriateness of inpatient and other facility charges before or after they are paid. Specific audits include itemized bill review, medical necessity short stays and hospital bill audits. This service is used by commercial, Medicare Advantage, Managed Medicaid and state Medicaid payors.
Data Mining (pre- and post-payment). Data Mining deploys artificial intelligence based payment integrity analytics combining industry-accepted rules and plan-specific policies to identify potential or actual overpayments associated with claim adjudication errors, billing errors and contract language, as well as their root causes. This service is used by commercial, Medicare Advantage, Managed Medicaid and state Medicaid payors.
Coordination of Benefits (pre- and post-payment). Coordination of Benefits identifies payments that should have been made by a health plan member's other health insurance coverage (for example, if the member's spouse has coverage through another employer-sponsored plan). Outcomes include validation of coverage status, recovery of claims paid in error, and updated eligibility data. This service is used by commercial, Medicare Advantage and Managed Medicaid payors.
Subrogation Services (post-payment). Subrogation Services identifies payments made related to an accident that are the responsibility of another responsible third party. Outcomes include case identification, validation, management and recovery of claims paid in error. Available as an outsourced service or inhouse technology, this service is used by at-risk commercial, Medicare Advantage and Managed Medicaid payors.
Our Revenue Integrity Services use data, technology, and clinical expertise to improve accuracy of premiums paid to Medicare Advantage plans by CMS. There are three services currently offered, each specific to Medicare Advantage payors. 
Medicare Secondary Payer. Medicare Secondary Payer interfaces with CMS to confirm member eligibility records, correct inaccuracies, and help restore and preserve underpaid premium dollars.
End Stage Renal Disease. ESRD identifies Medicare Advantage plan members with missing ESRD statuses at CMS, works with dialysis centers and CMS to correct the statuses and help restore and preserve underpaid premiums.
Part D OHI. Launched in late 2020, Part D OHI leverages analytics to identify Medicare Advantage plan members where the Part D Pharmacy Coverage on file with CMS is inaccurate. Updates correct information directly to the CMS source file to improve compliance, efficiencies and member satisfaction.
Strategy
MultiPlan operates in the healthcare market, which continues to grow each year as a result of aging, growth in services and technology. MultiPlan works on the front lines of these trends, working to reduce healthcare costs, and has established itself as a leader in the Payor Out-of-Network segment. With our decades-long strategic relationships with payors, we believe that we can further deepen our relationships with payors by providing new products and services that address additional cost savings opportunities. Further, with our proprietary data and algorithms, we have a growth opportunity to expand into services that support our payors, providers and consumers to service the healthcare market more completely. We intend to seize the opportunity to address a larger market and grow our revenues by executing our enhance, extend, and expand strategy.
The first part of our strategy is enhancing the platform by improving and innovating upon our existing core products through combining proprietary data with third party data, further deploying artificial intelligence and machine learning, and increasing cross selling activity with our payor customers.
The second element of the strategy is extending the platform by deepening penetration in under-performing customer segments. The initial target segments are the in-network cost management product segment, government programs such as Medicare Advantage and Managed Medicaid, TPAs and P&C. 
The third element of the strategy is to expand the platform by adding new business models to deliver value-added services for our providers and consumers. This strategy is a natural progression given the 1.2 million providers under contract and the more than 60 million consumers who have access to MultiPlan's services. Our data, algorithms and service components can be leveraged by MultiPlan, our payor customers, and partner software companies to tackle some of providers' and consumers' biggest pain points such as transparency of patient medical bills and consumer financing of medical expenses. 
Markets
Substantially all of MultiPlan's services are available in all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia. All services are available to all customers regardless of geographic location, company type or size.
Group Health
The rising cost of healthcare to employers and a focus on slowing the growth of healthcare expenditures are increasing the importance of cost management and payment integrity solutions such as those offered by MultiPlan. The demographic shifts caused by an aging population are expected to lead to more utilization while increased treatment sophistication will drive the cost of care. 
Government Programs
Government health programs with growing member bases increasingly require cost management and payment integrity services, and we have recently leveraged our network and payment integrity assets to compete in the Medicare, Managed Medicaid and other public sector markets. The Affordable Care Act, related regulations and administrative actions, and an aging population are driving increased membership in state and federal government funded health insurance programs. Membership in Medicare is growing by an estimated 10,000 people every day, and as of December 31, 2020, 39 states and the District of Columbia have committed to Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. With over 80% of Medicaid enrollees receiving services through managed care in 2018, Managed Medicaid penetration is also expected to increase as a result of Medicaid expansion.
Workers' Compensation
Workers' compensation insurers must pay both the indemnity costs and the medical costs associated with an injured worker. Recent trends in medical cost inflation have become a major driver in the overall cost growth for workers' compensation insurers. Medical services today constitute about 60% of workers' compensation claims costs, up from 40% in the early 1980s. Rising medical costs have increased focus on cost management measures for the medical portion of workers' compensation insurance claims through network and analytics-based cost reductions and improved payment accuracy.
Auto Medical
Auto insurance carriers face both costs from auto damage and medical claims. Economic losses for bodily injury liability claims increased 10% annually from 2012 – 2017, well above the 3% annual medical inflation rate, with medical expenses accounting for 79% of claimed losses. Given anticipated medical cost inflation, this trend is expected to continue into the future. Similar to the aforementioned markets, the increasing costs are driving auto insurance carriers to seek out cost management and payment accuracy solutions for the medical cost portion of auto insurance claims.
Customers
Our customers are payors, such as large national insurance companies, Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans, provider-sponsored and independent health plans, TPAs, bill review companies, Taft-Hartley plans and other entities that pay medical bills in the commercial healthcare, government, workers' compensation and auto medical markets. We believe that we have strong relationships with our customers, which include substantially all of the largest health plans. We have a diversified customer base and long-standing relationships with our top customers. Our two largest customers accounted for approximately 35% and 20%, respectively, of our full year 2020 revenues. Contract terms with larger customers are often three and as many as five years, while mid- to small-sized customer contracts are often annual and typically include automatic one year renewals. However, we continue to experience high renewal rates and our top ten customers based on full year 2020 revenues have been customers for an average of 25 years. Our customer relationships are further strengthened by high switching costs for our customers as MultiPlan is both electronically linked to customers in their time-sensitive claims processing functions and its logo is often featured on commercial customers' membership cards when networks are used.
Network
As of December 31, 2020, our network includes over 1,200,000 healthcare providers. MultiPlan's team of approximately 100 network development professionals manages these network relationships across our Primary and Complementary PPO Networks. For both networks, the team is responsible for strengthening our existing relationships with these providers. For existing providers, the goal of the network development team is to help providers maintain participation across products as well as increase the discounts the providers extend to our customers that utilize our provider networks.
In addition, the network development team is responsible for executing new contracts with providers that are not currently affiliated with our networks, either under our own contracts or on behalf of a payor that seeks to outsource its network development function. We strategically grow the number of providers that participate across all network product lines so we can continue to increase the value we provide to our customers. The network development team manages a sophisticated program of data mining, profiling, recruiting and ultimately contracting with new providers. An incentive driven pay-for-performance plan measures and rewards the success of our network development team.
Sales and Marketing
Our largest customers are serviced by a team of national account managers and senior executives responsible for continued growth of the relationship. The account team partners strategically with our customers, leveraging our Healthcare Economics unit to mine the customer's data and proactively present opportunities to the customer to improve performance and competitive position. This team also delivers account service, including daily claims management, requests for proposal, service inquiries and other marketing and operational support functions. The national account managers are compensated with a base salary plus bonus linked to customer retention.
The majority of our customers are serviced by a dedicated team of account managers and account service professionals organized into three market-focused departments — Commercial Health, Property and Casualty, and Government. These teams also include sales professionals responsible for new customer acquisition. The market-focused account managers are responsible for relationship management as well as for growing revenue through expanded use of services. They are compensated with a base salary plus a bonus and commission based on customer retention and revenue from upselling new products. The sales professionals are compensated with a base salary plus commission based on revenue from new customers. Sales and upselling efforts are supported by a marketing team which generates leads, builds brand awareness, implements and educates customers and develops proposals.
Information Technology
We believe that our IT platform provides us with a substantial competitive advantage. We have made significant investments in upgrading our IT infrastructure enabling us to automatically process significantly more transactions with greater accuracy and greatly improving our capacity to continuously serve our customers. Our IT is certified under HITRUST, NIST and AICPA SOC programs and in May 2020, we were rated at the top of our peer group by BitSight, an IT security rating organization. Our proprietary network repricing application is capable of returning approximately 99% of repriced claims to our payor customers on the same day. In 2020, our payment integrity and reference-based pricing services returned 99% and 97%, respectively, of claims within one day. Our proprietary negotiation application features portal technology with electronic signature acceptance, sophisticated claim distribution and prioritization algorithms enhanced with machine learning. We have implemented connectivity via EDI or direct integration using web services with all of our top customers. During 2020, nearly all of the claims processed in our system were received via EDI or direct web service integration. As we process more claims through EDI and direct web service integration, our substantial back office interconnectivity significantly reduces complexity and the number of processing errors. Because our IT platform is scalable, it is able to absorb substantial increases in volume at minimal marginal costs.
Competition
MultiPlan's competitors vary by service as follows.
Analytics-Based Services. MultiPlan competes with a variety of medical cost management companies for negotiation and reference-based pricing services. We compete for these services on the basis of savings effectiveness, provider acceptance, and plan member satisfaction. Workflow and claim processing technology, user interaction and analytic algorithms are key competitive advantages. MultiPlan's competitors for these services typically include Zelis and reference-based pricing services such as 6Degrees, AMPS, ClearHealth Strategies, ELAP Services, and PayerCompass.
Network-Based Services. We compete directly with other independent PPO networks, which are primarily regional, and with PPO network aggregators. We compete with independent PPO networks primarily on the basis of network discounts and access, but also on the basis of quality, independence and price. MultiPlan's nationwide Primary PPO Network is NCQA accredited, which we believe provides assurances to payors and consumers regarding the quality of the providers in our network. Because some independent PPO networks are owned by large commercial payers, our customers may prefer to purchase PPO network services from a fully independent vendor. PPO aggregators offer national access by patching together third-party networks, in some cases including MultiPlan's network. While aggregators rely on third-party networks, MultiPlan's 
network features direct contracts with 98% of its participating providers. MultiPlan's competitors for these services typically include First Health, TRPN, and Zelis. 
Payment and Revenue Integrity Services. We compete with a variety of larger and smaller vendors of payment and revenue integrity services. Our Payment Integrity solutions compete on the basis of analytic breadth and depth, human expertise and scope. Virtually all payment integrity competitors originated as post-payment specialists and to varying degrees have migrated services to a pre-payment modality, while our services were built to focus on examining claims before payment occurs and now, with the recent acquisition of DHP, we have a broader capability to address post-payment integrity. Our Revenue Integrity solutions compete on the basis of identification and assistance in restoration and preservation of underpaid premiums from CMS caused by member eligibility and status errors. MultiPlan's competitors for these services typically include Change Healthcare Inc., Conduent, Cotiviti, Inc., Optum, SCIO and The Rawlings Group.
Government Regulations 
We believe that each of MultiPlan's service offerings bears less risk than other healthcare businesses that bear insurance risk and bill federal healthcare programs or directly provide care. While we support our customers that are regulated entities, we generally are not directly regulated or face significantly lower levels of regulatory complexity. We function as a transaction processor and we believe we have limited risk for services or billing.
MultiPlan does not deliver health care services, provide or manage healthcare services, provide care or care management. We do not bear insurance, underwriting, payment, malpractice or reimbursement risks, nor do we adjudicate or pay claims. Our business is compensated directly by private payor customers, not by Medicare, Medicaid or other government healthcare programs. In some instances, we provide services to payors that contract directly with a federal or state agency. In those instances we may be subject to certain federal and state law requirements associated with those programs, and a failure to comply with those requirements could subject us to criminal or civil penalties, debarment or exclusion from government health care programs.
We are, however, subject, either directly or indirectly through our customer relationships, to federal and state laws and regulations governing privacy, security and breaches of patient information and the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions, including, for example, HIPAA, which imposes rules protecting individually identifiable health information and setting national standards for the security of electronic PHI. We are a "Business Associate" (as defined by HIPAA) of our customers. As such, we must comply with all applicable provisions of HIPAA, including the HIPAA Security Rule and applicable provisions of the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Breach Notification Rule.
In addition, we are subject to certain state licensure and/or certification laws and other state and federal laws and regulations governing our operations and our products. Among other examples, contracts governing our relationships with healthcare providers may be subject to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, federal False Claims Law and comparable state laws, as well as state laws prohibiting fee-splitting and the corporate practice of medicine and state and federal laws regarding transparency. Furthermore, we may be subject to some state laws regulating the ability of PPOs to allow broad access to their provider networks. We may directly or indirectly be subject to state and federal regulation regarding the payment of out of network claims, including regulations regarding the determination of payment amounts and what data and other factors are permitted to be used by commercial health payors and other payors in making such determinations, as well as regulations targeting surprise billing and requiring transparency. 
For example, the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, which was signed into law on December 27, 2020, included the No Surprises Act, which will necessitate new compliance efforts by group health plans and health insurance issuers offering group or health insurance coverage and may require changes to the conduct of our business or operations. The law requires such plans and issuers that provide benefits with respect to emergency services to provide coverage for emergency services provided by non-participating providers and emergency facilities without imposing prior authorization requirements, more restrictive coverage limitations or greater cost-sharing requirements than would apply if the emergency services were provided by participating providers or emergency facilities. The law enables non-participating providers or facilities and such plans and issuers to address payment disputes for certain claims through a 30-day open negotiation period or, if such negotiations fail through an independent dispute resolution process. The No Surprises Act will also require new compliance efforts by non-participating providers and facilities. For example, beginning in 2022, the law prohibits the imposition of cost-sharing requirements by non-participating providers providing items and services in participating facilities if certain notice and consent requirements are not satisfied, including the provision of information, such as a good faith estimate of potential charges, at least 72 hours before the individual receives out-of-network items or services. The law will be implemented through regulations that establish an independent dispute resolution process and a methodology for calculating median contract rates, which are referred to in the law as "qualifying payment amounts." Certified independent dispute resolution entities must consider these qualifying 
payment amounts (market adjusted for the Consumer Price Index) when making a determination as to which proposed payment amount (either provider's or payor's) to select. Regulations will also create a process for auditing group health plans and health insurance issuers to ensure that plans and coverage are in compliance with such requirements.
We may directly or indirectly be subject to regulation in some states regarding the application of payment integrity edits to claims, including regulations impacting what data and other factors are permitted to be used by commercial health payors and other payors in making such determinations. Our services may directly or indirectly be subject to state regulations specifically covering certain categories of clients, such as workers compensation insurers and auto medical insurers. We regularly monitor legislative and regulatory activity in all states and at the federal level that could impact any of the products we offer in all relevant market segments. In addition, we are committed to supporting our clients in meeting their regulatory obligations, so we work cooperatively with them in establishing processes and procedures that comply with applicable requirements.
While we believe that we are in compliance with such laws and regulations and we will undertake efforts to comply with new laws and regulations, once effective, a failure to comply with these laws and regulations could adversely affect our contractual relationships and possibly expose us to civil or criminal sanctions by federal or state authorities. Please see the section entitled "Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business and Operations."
Human Capital
We employed approximately 2,000 people as of December 31, 2020, substantially all of whom are full time employees and none of whom are covered by unions. We believe that we have a good relationship with our employees.
We strive to create a workplace that fosters mutual respect and collaboration, where talented individuals from all backgrounds, perspectives and abilities can participate and perform their best work. In 2020, we formed a Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging ("DIB") Governance Committee to establish, oversee and advance MultiPlan's DIB program. The committee seeks to champion and foster organizational changes with a dedicated focus on DIB priorities, to facilitate the integration of the DIB program with the Company's corporate objectives and values, to create accountability for program results and to engage and communicate with the MultiPlan community on all DIB efforts.
MultiPlan partners with America's Job Exchange, in the recruiting process, to ensure job postings are distributed to diversity websites to expand visibility to individuals seeking employment opportunities from a wide variety of backgrounds. We also partner with local CareerOneStop services for outreach and participate in job fairs.

We believe that education is essential to MultiPlan employees’ professional growth and our organization's success. To support this belief, our Corporate Education Department offers many learning opportunities beginning with our new employee orientation and continuing with our ongoing operational and compliance training plus a variety of optional courses to help employees further their career development on topics such as: business management, personal productivity and working with teams. 
We also believe that it is important to foster employee feedback and recognition. We utilize our MultiSTAR: MultiPlan Service Talent Achievement & Reward program to allow colleagues an opportunity to acknowledge co-workers for their great work and to recognize their professional accomplishments.
