OVERVIEW
Our Company
We are a leading U.S. Spanish-language media company serving the fast growing and highly attractive U.S. Hispanic and Latin American markets with broadcast and cable television networks and digital content platforms including five Spanish-language cable television networks distributed in the U.S., two Spanish-language cable television networks distributed in Latin America, the #1-rated broadcast television network in Puerto Rico, the #3-rated broadcast television network in Colombia, a Spanish-language over-the-top ("OTT") video subscription service distributed in the U.S. and a leading distributor of content to television and digital media platforms in Latin America.

Our Strategy
Our strategy in the U.S. is to provide unique programming focused on underserved but significant segments of the U.S. Hispanic population, allowing us to reach a deeper and broader U.S. Hispanic demographic than our competitors. Our networks allow many viewers in the U.S. to feel connected with their home countries, including high quality, differentiated local news, sports and entertainment content. For instance, WAPA America is the only nightly newscast from Puerto Rico created for U.S. Hispanics, which is a part of the network’s over 67 hours of weekly original news and entertainment programming. Additionally, as the highest rated telenovela cable network in primetime to offer unique and popular telenovelas from around the globe, Pasiones significantly out-rated the Univision Tlnovelas network in primetime in 2020, according to ComScore. By focusing on these specific Hispanic markets, we provide targeted, attractive and relevant content, while avoiding direct competition with channels such as Univision and Telemundo, which more acutely target the U.S. Mexican demographic.
WAPA has been the #1-rated broadcast television network in Puerto Rico since the start of Nielsen audience measurement eleven years ago and management believes it is highly valued by its viewers and cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers. WAPA is distributed by all pay-TV distributors in Puerto Rico and has been successfully growing affiliate revenue. WAPA’s primetime household rating in 2020 was nearly five times higher than the most highly rated English-language U.S. broadcast network in the U.S., CBS, and higher than the combined ratings of CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX and the CW. As a result of its ratings success since the start of Nielsen audience measurement, management believes WAPA is well positioned for future growth in affiliate revenue.
WAPA America, Cinelatino, Pasiones, Centroamerica TV and Television Dominicana occupy a valuable and unique position, as they are among the small group of Hispanic cable networks to have achieved broad distribution in the U.S. As a result, management believes our U.S. cable networks are well-positioned to benefit from growth in both the growing national advertising spend targeted at the highly sought-after U.S. Hispanic cable television audience, and growth in the U.S. Hispanic population, which is expected to continue its long-term upward trajectory. The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that nearly 60.5 million Hispanics resided in the United States in 2019, representing an increase of more than 25 million people between 2000 and 2019, and that number is projected to grow to 75 million by 2030. U.S. Hispanic television households grew by 36% during the period from 2010 to 2021, from 12.9 million households to 17.6 million households. Although our U.S. cable networks total subscribers declined during 2020, given the projected growth of the U.S. Hispanic population, we are optimistic that our U.S. cable networks total subscribers will see renewed long-term growth.

​
Our strategy in Latin America is to make similar strides as our networks in the U.S. Additionally, Canal 1 represents one of only three national broadcast television networks in Columbia, the second largest Latin American advertising market (excluding Brazil). We believe that Canal 1 can create a compelling, differentiated programming option in Colombia, similar to our experience with WAPA in Puerto Rico. At the same time, we are working to identify leading or underperforming media assets in attractive Latin American markets that can benefit from management’s television expertise. We believe that our business model is highly scalable and that we could drive profitable growth by replicating this model across Latin America.
We believe that our platform value is significant, allowing us to leverage content and distribution relationships across different geographies. We are able to use content that we own or have licensed across our media properties, giving us economies of scale.
Our objective is to maintain and improve our position as a leading U.S. Spanish-language media company serving the U.S. Hispanic and Latin American markets by, among other things:
Growing affiliate revenue—We believe our Networks are well-positioned to further grow our affiliate revenue, fueled by strong ratings, continued growth in our target demographic audiences and robust content portfolio. For example, WAPA entered into renewals with two of the largest Distributors in Puerto Rico on very favorable terms by virtue of its dominance in the Puerto Rico market, and these agreements will generate significant affiliate revenue growth for us. With no reverse compensation, our affiliate revenue has high margin flow through to income. We expect to continue to expand the distribution of our Networks in the U.S., and our two Latin American cable networks on additional systems in under-penetrated markets. For example, on April 1, 2019, Pasiones was launched by Charter Communications, Inc. across Spectrum’s systems nationally in the U.S. and, as a result, Pasiones is now available on all major Distributors nationwide. As U.S. cable television distributors become more focused on targeting the Hispanic audience, as a way to grow subscribers, we believe that our Networks will be well-positioned to capture the upside. In Latin America, Cinelatino and Pasiones are each currently distributed to only approximately 26% of pay-TV subscribers (excluding Brazil), creating an opportunity to expand distribution through new launches.
Driving growth in advertising sales—We continue to see a large opportunity to increase our advertising revenues. Our U.S. cable networks are well positioned to benefit from the advertising spend targeted at the highly sought-after U.S. Hispanic audience. We offer a unique and differentiated target audience for our advertisers, driven by our targeted demographic and our ability to segment the U.S. Hispanic population. The Latin American feed of Cinelatino remains commercial-free, presenting an opportunity to be converted to an ad-supported model in select robust advertising markets.
Investing in content for our Networks to build viewership—We have made substantial investment in our programming and marketing efforts in order to expand our distribution reach, increase our audience size, and increase our attractiveness to advertisers. We will continue to invest in programming in 2021. To date, we have successfully created a highly differentiated content strategy at WAPA and in doing so, have maintained a #1 ratings ranking in the Puerto Rico market for eleven consecutive years. Cinelatino, as the only buyer of scale that can cover both the U.S. and Latin American markets for television rights to Spanish-language films, is well-positioned to acquire the best content available at favorable terms and has built an expansive content library. Pasiones, which features a unique slate of telenovelas from Latin America, as well as Turkey, India and South Korea (dubbed into Spanish), delivered the highest ratings in the history of the channel in the year ended December 31, 2020, marking the fourth consecutive year of record ratings, and beat Univision’s Tlnovelas channel in primetime.
Develop and expand content licensing revenue—Presently, our two primary revenue streams are affiliate revenue and advertising revenue, but we believe an opportunity exists to grow our revenues from content licensing. We own and control all media rights for a vast majority of our content and we continue to produce original content for our channels. In November 2018, we acquired Snap Media, which provides us with the expertise and relationships to expand our content licensing business. Our strategy is to window content across our platforms and to license the content to third parties for exploitation on free-TV, pay-TV, OTT, SVOD and AVOD platforms in the U.S. and Latin America. We believe this high-margin revenue from content licensing will help drive our revenue growth and profitability.

8



Acquisition-driven growth—We continue to look for attractive opportunities to acquire assets of varying scale that we consider to be undervalued or fairly valued with attractive financial or strategic characteristics. We intend to take a long-term view and primarily seek opportunities which will expand our leadership position in the fast growing and highly desirable Spanish-language media market in the U.S. and Latin America. We intend to seek a variety of acquisition opportunities, including businesses where we believe a catalyst for value realization is already present, or where we can realize synergies with our existing businesses. These may include Spanish-language cable networks distributed in the U.S., Latin American broadcast and cable television networks, production companies and content libraries. We may also seek businesses that are in need of operational turnaround through our experienced and knowledgeable management team, which has a proven ability to develop and grow acquired assets. We believe our business model is highly scalable and that we can leverage our playbook and existing content to help improve these types of businesses. Consistent with this strategy, we are currently evaluating a number of acquisition opportunities, some of which could be material.
Well-positioned to capture growth from over-the-top distribution—We believe that the digital media opportunity has the potential of providing long-term growth and value, and that we are well-positioned to capture that upside. We own digital rights for the vast majority of our content and are distribution agnostic when it comes to capturing viewers wherever and however they choose to consume video content.
Furthermore, we own an expansive library of the best Spanish-language films and other content and are continually generating new content that can be distributed digitally or licensed to OTT platforms. Spanish-language content remains an underserved category among OTT platforms in the U.S. Seeing an opportunity, in partnership with Lionsgate, we created Pantaya, a Spanish-language OTT video subscription service that allows audiences to access many of the best and most current Spanish-language films and series. We believe Pantaya is uniquely positioned to be the leading player in the Spanish-language OTT space as it benefits from the collective content libraries and marketing infrastructure of its partners and the Starz, LLC technology platform.
Employees
At December 31, 2020, we and our subsidiaries employed 314 full-time persons. In the normal course of business, we use contract personnel to supplement our employee base to meet business needs. We or our subsidiaries may hire additional personnel in connection with the closing of future acquisitions. We believe that employee relations are generally satisfactory. Approximately 138 of our employees based in Puerto Rico are full-time unionized employees covered by two collective bargaining agreements (each, a “CBA” and collectively, the “CBAs”). Our main CBA expires on May 31, 2022 and covers all of our unionized employees except for two employees covered by the other CBA which expired on June 27, 2019 and we continue to operate under the terms of the expired CBA while we continue to engage in active and good faith negotiations on its renewal.
Revenue Sources
Our two primary sources of revenues are advertising revenue and affiliate revenue. All of our Networks derive revenues from advertising. Advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising time, which is typically sold pursuant to advertising orders with advertisers providing for an agreed upon advertising commitment and price per spot. Our advertising revenue is tied to the success of our programming, including the popularity of our programming with our target audience. Our advertising is variable in nature and tends to reflect seasonal patterns of our advertisers’ demand, which is generally greatest during the fourth quarter of each year, driven by the holiday buying season. In addition, Puerto Rico’s political election cycle occurs every four years and we benefit from increased advertising sales in an election year. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we experienced higher advertising sales as a result of political advertising spending during the 2020 gubernatorial elections in Puerto Rico. The next election in Puerto Rico will be in 2024.

All of our Networks receive fees paid by distributors, including cable, satellite and telecommunications service providers. These revenues are generally based on a per subscriber fee pursuant to multi-year contracts, commonly referred to as “affiliation agreements,” which typically provide for annual rate increases. The specific affiliate revenue we earn varies from period to period, distributor to distributor and also varies among our Networks, but is generally based upon the number of each distributor’s paying subscribers who receive our Networks. The terms of certain non-U.S. affiliation agreements provide for payment of a fixed contractual monthly fee. Changes in affiliate revenue are primarily derived from changes in contractual affiliation rates charged for our Networks and changes in the number of subscribers. Accordingly, we continually review the quality of our programming to ensure that it is maximizing our Networks’ viewership and giving our Networks’ subscribers a premium, high-value experience. The continued growth in our affiliate revenue will, to a certain extent, be dependent on the growth in subscribers of the cable, satellite and telecommunication service providers distributing our Networks, new system launches and continued carriage of our channels by our distribution partners. Our revenues also benefit from contractual rate increases stipulated in most of our affiliation agreements. Our Networks depend upon agreements with a limited number of Distributors. For the year ended December 31, 2020, one of our Distributors accounted for more than 10% of our total net revenues. We recognize affiliate revenue when it is accrued pursuant to the agreements we have entered into with respect to such revenue. We set forth our net revenues, total assets and operating income in “Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”
Over time, affiliate revenue has become an increasing portion of our total revenue. We believe that this development is a positive one for our business, given that affiliate revenue is contracted and recurring and provides greater visibility into future performance.
In 2020, we generated approximately 94% of our net revenues from the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we generated net revenues of $141.9 million and $137.7 million, respectively, from the United States. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we generated net revenues $9.3 million and $11.7 million, respectively, from outside the United States.

Our programming strategy for Cinelatino is specifically intended to provide the audience with the broadest selection of the most popular and highest-quality films across all popular genres, from Mexico and all other Latin American countries that have significant populations in the U.S., including Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Colombia and Peru. Consistent with its programming strategy, Cinelatino has licensed the rights to many of the highest grossing box office films in Mexico. Cinelatino has an expansive library of approximately 800 of the best Spanish-language titles from suppliers across the globe. In July 2015, Cinelatino introduced advertising on its network. Driven by the strength of its programming and distribution, Cinelatino is the highest rated Spanish-language original movie network in the U.S. Additionally, leveraging its expansive content library, which includes theatrical films, made-for-television movies, series and other content acquired or licensed from third party suppliers, as well as its own original productions, Cinelatino licenses content to OTT services in the U.S. and Latin America.

Snap Media is responsible for the distribution of content owned and/or controlled by our networks, as well as content to be produced by the production joint venture between Snap Media and MarVista.
Joint Ventures/Investments
On November 3, 2016, we formed a joint venture with Lionsgate, pursuant to which we own a 25% interest in Pantaya, a Spanish-language OTT subscription video on-demand service featuring movies and series. The service launched in the U.S. on August 1, 2017. The investment is deemed a Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”) that is accounted for under the equity method.
On November 30, 2016, we, in partnership with Colombian content producers, Radio Television Interamericana S.A., Compania de Medios de Informacion S.A.S. and NTC Nacional de Television y Comunicaciones S.A., were awarded a ten (10) year renewable television broadcast concession license for Canal 1 in Colombia. Canal 1 is one of only three national broadcast television networks in Colombia. The partnership began operating Canal 1 on May 1, 2017. In July 2019, the Colombian government enacted legislation resulting in the extension of the concession license for an additional ten years for no additional consideration. The concession is now due to expire on April 30, 2037 and is renewable for an additional 20-year period. Canal 1 is the #3-rated broadcast television network in Colombia. At December 31, 2020, we owned a 40% interest in the joint venture, which is deemed a VIE that is accounted for under the equity method.

OUR COMPETITION
We compete for the development and acquisition of programming, distribution of our Networks, selling of commercial time on our Networks, viewership of our Networks, and on-air and creative talent. Our Networks compete with other Spanish-language broadcast and cable television networks and digital media companies for the acquisition of programming, viewership, the sale of advertising and creative talent. Our ability to produce and acquire popular content impacts our viewership and the sale of advertising.
We also compete with both Spanish-language and English-language broadcast and cable television networks for distribution of our Networks and the fees paid by cable, satellite and telecommunication service providers. Our ability to retain and secure distribution agreements is necessary to maintain and grow affiliate revenue, and to attain viewership which drives advertising sales. Our contractual agreements with Distributors are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. The launch of new networks and consolidation within the cable and satellite distribution industry may adversely affect our ability to obtain and maintain distribution of our Networks.
Certain technological advances, including the increased deployment of fiber optic cable, are expected to allow cable and telecommunication video service providers to continue to expand both their channel and broadband distribution capacities and to increase transmission speeds. In addition, the ability to deliver content via new methods and devices is expected to increase substantially. The impact of such added capacities is hard to predict, but the development of new channels of content distribution could lead to increased competition for viewers by facilitating the emergence of 

13



additional channels and mobile and internet platforms through which viewers could view programming that is similar to that offered by our Networks.
WAPA competes with broadcast television networks and cable television networks in Puerto Rico for audience viewership, advertising sales, and programming. WAPA’s main competitors are broadcast television stations owned by Univision and Telemundo, which rely heavily on their U.S. parents for programming, consisting primarily of telenovelas produced in Mexico, the U.S. and Latin America. There are a few other local broadcasters, but they tend not to be competitive due to weak programming and/or poor signal quality. In addition, while all major English-language U.S. broadcast networks have local affiliates, they are, for the most part, low power stations with nominal ratings. Cable channels are generally not competitive, as they tend to be U.S.-based, English-language channels with little relevance to the Spanish-speaking Puerto Rican audience, and pay television is much less widely penetrated in Puerto Rico than the U.S. WAPA has effectively customized its programming for the viewing preferences of the Puerto Rican market with more local entertainment and news programming than its competitors, as well as blockbuster Hollywood movies and hit U.S. television series (dubbed into Spanish). As a result, since the start of Nielsen audience measurement, WAPA has been the ratings leader for the past eleven years. WAPA Deportes competes for viewership, advertising sales and programming with other channels offering similar sports programming in Puerto Rico. Competitors include U.S.-based cable networks, such as ESPN, TNT, and TBS, and certain satellite distributors who have acquired sports media rights for their owned channels. WAPA.TV, WAPA’s mobile-optimized website, directly competes with other local news, weather and entertainment sites for traffic and advertising sales. To some extent, WAPA.TV also competes with search engines and social networks, such as Google and Facebook, for digital advertising revenue.
Many of our competitors may possess greater resources than us, and our financial resources may be relatively limited when contrasted with many of these competitors.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
Our intellectual property assets principally include copyrights in television programming, websites and other content, trademarks in brands, names and logos, domain names and licenses of intellectual property rights of various kinds. The protection of our Networks’ brands and content is of primary importance to our success. To protect our intellectual property assets, we rely upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, trade secret and internet/domain name statutes, laws and contractual provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Policing unauthorized use of our products and services and related intellectual property is difficult and costly. We seek to limit unauthorized use of our intellectual property through a combination of approaches. However, the steps taken to prevent the infringement of our intellectual property by unauthorized third parties may not work.
Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of our intellectual property from time to time, and the success of any such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on our operations. In addition, piracy, which encompasses the theft of our signal, and unauthorized use of our content in the digital environment continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property.
INDUSTRY
U.S. Hispanic Market
The U.S. Census Bureau estimated that 60.5 million Hispanics resided in the United States in 2019, representing an increase of more than 25 million people between 2000 and 2019. Hispanics represent the largest minority group in the U.S. at 18% of the total U.S. population and accounted for 60% of the total U.S. population growth between 2000 and 2019. This trend is expected to continue as the U.S. Hispanic population is projected to grow to 75 million by 2030, an increase of 24% from 2019. As a result of this growth, the U.S. Hispanic market represents the eighth largest economy in the world. In addition, the Hispanic population on average is significantly younger than the overall population. For 

14



example, the median age of U.S. Hispanics is 30, which is 14 years younger than the median age for non-Hispanic whites.
Claritas estimates that as of January 1, 2021, about 62% of the U.S. Hispanic population was of Mexican origin, followed by Puerto Rican, the second largest Hispanic national group, at approximately 10%. There are more than 6.2 million Puerto Ricans and an additional 5.6 million Hispanics from other Caribbean countries residing in the mainland U.S., and together, Puerto Ricans and other Caribbean Hispanics represent approximately 19% of the total U.S. Hispanic population. The Puerto Rican population in the U.S. grew 84% from 2000 to 2021, while the overall Caribbean Hispanic population grew 99% during the same time period, including the Dominican population which grew 130% from 2000 to 2021.

Central Americans are the third largest U.S. Hispanic regional population group in the U.S. (behind Mexicans and Caribbean Hispanics), and represent the fastest growing segment of the U.S. Hispanic population. There are over 5 million Central Americans residing in the U.S., an increase of 218% since 2000. Central Americans comprise approximately 8% of the U.S. Hispanic population in 2021, compared to approximately 4% in 2000.

Hispanic Television and Pay-TV Landscape
Within the U.S. cable network industry, the U.S. Hispanic demographic is attractive for a number of reasons:

● | Growth in Hispanic TV households: U.S. Hispanic television households grew by 36% during the period from 2010 to 2021, from 12.9 million households to 17.6 million households, over six times the overall U.S. television household growth of only 5.3%. The continued long-term growth of Hispanic television households creates a significant opportunity to reach an attractive audience at a time when overall household growth in the U.S. is more modest.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hispanic pay-TV subscribers: Although Hispanic pay-TV subscribers declined during 2020, given the expected growth of Hispanic television households, we are optimistic that Hispanic pay-TV subscribers will see renewed long-term growth.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Television Viewing and Language Preferences

● | Hispanics Enjoy Movies: In 2019, the last year in which data is available, Hispanics made up only 18% of the U.S. population, yet they comprised 26% of the country’s frequent moviegoers (i.e., those who attend movies at least once per month). In fact, the President of the National Association of Theater Owners described Hispanics as “the most valuable component of moviegoers.” In 2019, Hispanics saw 4.7 movies per year, higher than any other ethnicity group.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Hispanics Prefer Television in Spanish: Spanish remains the most used language in the home by U.S. Hispanic adults, and this powerfully influences television viewing habits. According to Nielsen, 58% of Hispanics aged 18 and over speak Spanish as much as or more than English in their homes. Spanish-dominant or bilingual (Spanish/English Equal) homes comprise about 64% of U.S. Hispanic households, and these homes exhibit a strong preference to watch television in their native language. In 2020, Spanish-dominant adults in key marketing demographics viewed 64% of television in Spanish and bilingual adults viewed about 20% of television in Spanish.

Hispanic Advertising Market
Persons living in Hispanic television households represent 18% of the total U.S. television household population and 11% of the total U.S. buying power, but the aggregate media spend targeted at U.S. Hispanics significantly under-indexes both of these metrics. As a result, advertisers have been allocating a higher proportion of marketing dollars to the Hispanic market, but U.S. Hispanic cable advertising still under-indexes relative to its consumption.
Similar to the under-indexing of U.S. general market cable advertising relative to viewing share in the 1980’s and 1990’s, U.S. Hispanic cable advertising today significantly under-indexes relative to its share of the Spanish-language television audience. In 2018, the latest year in which U.S. Hispanic television advertising data is available, U.S. Hispanic cable networks garnered only 5% of total U.S. Hispanic national television advertising, while accounting for a 17% share of total Spanish-language television viewing in 2018. Viewing of Spanish-language cable networks as a percentage of total Spanish-language television viewing has grown dramatically from 11% in 2008 to 16% in 2020.
Latin American Market (excluding Brazil)
Pay-TV subscribers in Latin America grew by 17% from 2014 to 2020, and are projected to grow an additional 5 million from 55 million in 2020 to 60 million by 2025. Pay-TV penetration of television households has expanded from 46% in 2014 to 48% in 2020 and is projected to remain stable at 48% through 2025. In addition, investments in network infrastructure have improved service and performance, leading to increased penetration for pay-TV operators.
Colombia, where we own 40% of Canal 1, the #3-rated broadcast television network, is a large and appealing market for broadcast television. Colombia had a population of 51 million as of December 31, 2020, the second largest in Latin America (excluding Brazil). According to IBOPE, the three major broadcast networks in Colombia receive a 59% share of overall viewing. These factors result in an annual market for free-to-air television advertising of approximately $207 million (as converted utilizing the average foreign exchange rate during the period).
Puerto Rico Overview
The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory and has a U.S. dollar-based economy, U.S. rule of law and strong governmental ties to the United States. The broadcast television industry in Puerto Rico is regulated by the FCC, and the banking system is regulated under the U.S. system (Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation). Puerto Rico has a population of approximately 2.8 million, with an additional 6.2 million Puerto Ricans living in the mainland U.S. All Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens.

Economy
The Puerto Rican economy has been in a recession since 2006, and its gross national product (GNP) has contracted in real terms every year between fiscal year 2007 and fiscal year 2018 (except for growth of 0.5% in fiscal year 2012). The Puerto Rico Planning Board estimates real GNP increased approximately 1.5% in fiscal year 2019 due to the influx of federal funds and private insurance payments to repair damage caused by Hurricanes Irma and María, and that it decreased approximately 5.4% in fiscal year 2020 due primarily to the adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken by the government in response to the same. The Planning Board projected that the negative effects of COVID-19 would continue through fiscal year 2021, resulting in a contraction in real GNP of approximately -2% in the current fiscal year.
Puerto Rico has been burdened by limited economic activity, lower than estimated revenue collections, high government debt levels relative to the size of the economy and other fiscal challenges. On June 30, 2016, President Obama signed HR 5278 Bill, the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which, among other things, established a seven member planning board with broad powers over the finances of the Commonwealth and its instrumentalities and provides to the Commonwealth, its public corporations and municipalities, broad based restructuring authority, including through a bankruptcy type process similar to that of Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. The Commonwealth’s inability to access financing in the capital markets or from private lenders, has resulted in the Commonwealth and various public corporations defaulting on their public debt and entering into bankruptcy proceedings under PROMESA.
During the month of September 2017, Hurricanes Irma and Maria, two major hurricanes, caused extensive destruction in Puerto Rico. Hurricane Maria made landfall on September 20, 2017, and all of Puerto Rico was left without electrical power, and other basic infrastructure services (such as water, communications, ports and other transportation networks) were severely curtailed. Additionally, the hurricanes also accelerated the outmigration trends that Puerto Rico was experiencing, with increased numbers of residents moving to the mainland United States, either on a temporary or permanent basis. The hurricanes caused a significant disruption to the island’s economic activity and GNP.
On January 7, 2020, a 6.4 magnitude earthquake impacted the southwestern part of Puerto Rico, which caused island-wide power outages and significant damage to infrastructure and property in the southwest region of the island. The Commonwealth’s government estimates total earthquake-related damages at approximately $1 billion.
In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. On March 15, 2020, the Puerto Rico Governor issued an executive order declaring a health emergency, ordering residents to shelter in place, implementing a mandatory curfew, and requiring the closure of all businesses, except for businesses that provide essential services, including banking and financial institutions with respect to certain services. While many of the restrictions have been gradually lifted, a mandatory curfew is still in effect and most businesses have had to make significant adjustments to protect customers and employees, including transitioning to telework and suspending or modifying certain operations in compliance with health and safety guidelines.
Non-farm payroll on the island went from 882,500 in March 2020 to 775,500 in the month of April. This loss of 107,000 jobs, or 12% of the total, was followed by drastic drops in retail spending and overall economic activity. Retail sales for the month of April dropped by approximately 56% relative to the previous year; this represented $1.2 billion less in spending. Some industries, such as car sales, remained shut down, while others, such as restaurants, have been operating at a limited capacity since then.
While there has been a limited recovery in employment since then, it has been unevenly distributed. Some industries, such as manufacturing or construction, have recovered almost completely (in the case of manufacturing even surpassing pre-pandemic figures), while others, such as leisure and hospitality have struggled. Out of the 107,000 jobs lost in April, approximately 36,000 have been recovered by December. Employment is still down by 8.2% compared to the month of March.

17



 The tourism industry on the island, while still recovering from the dual impact of hurricanes Irma and Maria in 2017, had been showing signs of recovery prior to the pandemic. Employment in this industry totaled 83,000 in March. By April, this had gone down to 46,900, a reduction of 43%. Out of these 36,200 jobs that were lost, only half have been recovered. Airport arrivals on the island have gone down by more than 50%, and the cruise industry has been shut down since March.
Stimulus packages passed by Congress managed to contain some of the damage caused by the pandemic and saved many businesses from bankruptcy. The CARES act established the PUA (Pandemic Unemployment Assistance) and PPP (Pandemic Payroll Protection) programs. More than $16 billion in federal funds were assigned to the island. Combined with funds received due to damages from Irma and María, the past 4 years have seen more than $76 billion in federal funds assigned to the island, out of which approximately 43% have been disbursed. 
The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have an adverse effect on economic activity in Puerto Rico in the long-term will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and is difficult to predict, including the scope and duration of the pandemic, the restrictions imposed by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic and the amount of federal and local assistance offered to offset the impact of the pandemic. There can be no assurance that measures taken by governmental authorities will be sufficient to offset the pandemic’s economic impact.
Puerto Rico Broadcast Television Market
Puerto Rico has 1.3 million television households, comparable to that of a top 25 U.S. television market. Puerto Rico is the third largest U.S. Hispanic market behind Los Angeles and New York.
Puerto Rican television broadcasters capture the dominant share of viewership, which is unique relative to the U.S. The three primary broadcasters in Puerto Rico—WAPA, Univision and Telemundo—collectively garner approximately 75% of all television household viewership in primetime, distinguishing Puerto Rico from the U.S. television market, where the four major national broadcast networks (ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox) garner a collective primetime audience share of 26%. In fact, WAPA’s primetime household rating in 2020 was nearly five times higher than the most highly rated English-language U.S. broadcast network in the U.S., CBS, and higher than the combined ratings of CBS, NBC, ABC, FOX and the CW.
GOVERNMENT REGULATION
Our broadcast and cable network operations are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in the United States, Puerto Rico and other countries where they operate. The rules, regulations, policies and procedures affecting our Business are constantly subject to change. This section contains a summary of certain government regulations that may affect our operations. This information is summary in nature and does not purport to describe all present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our Business.

18



Introduction
Our Networks are subject to regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act of 1934, as amended (“Communications Act”). Under authority of the Communications Act, the FCC, among other things, assigns frequency bands for broadcast stations, including the WAPA stations, and other uses; determines the location, frequency and operating power of stations; grants permits and licenses to construct and operate television stations on particular frequencies; issues, revokes, modifies and renews television broadcast station licenses; regulates equipment used by stations; determines whether to approve changes in ownership or control of station licenses; and adopts and implements regulations and policies which directly or indirectly affect the ownership, operations and profitability of broadcasting stations.
The FCC has also adopted various rules that regulate the content of programming broadcast by television stations, including the WAPA station, and carried by cable networks, including our Cable Networks. These rules regulate, among other things, children’s programming, sponsorship identification disclosures, closed captioning of certain television programming, improper uses of the emergency alert system attention tone, and obscene, indecent and profane content. Additionally, the FCC’s rules require broadcast stations to implement equal employment opportunity outreach programs and maintain records relating to these programs and make filings with the FCC evidencing such efforts. The FCC could also adopt other regulations that affect cable networks, such as the requirement that the cable programming services be on an “á la carte” basis, which could affect their business operations.
The following is a brief summary of certain provisions of the Communications Act, and specific FCC rules and policies and certain other statutes and regulations. The summaries are not intended to describe all present and proposed statutes and FCC rules and regulations that impact broadcast television and cable network operations. Failure to observe the provisions of the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules and policies can result in the imposition of various sanctions, including monetary forfeitures, the grant of “short-term” (less than the maximum term) broadcast license renewals or, for particularly egregious violations, the denial of a broadcast license renewal application, the revocation of a broadcast license, or the withholding of approval for acquisition of additional broadcast properties.
FCC Licenses and Renewal
The Communications Act permits the operation of a broadcast station only in accordance with a license issued by the FCC upon a finding that the grant of a license would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity. The FCC grants broadcast licenses for specified periods of time and, upon application, may renew the licenses for additional terms (ordinarily for the full term of eight years). Generally, the FCC renews a broadcast license upon a finding that (i) the broadcast station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (ii) there have been no serious violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or the FCC’s rules; and (iii) there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or other FCC rules which, taken together, indicate a pattern of abuse. After considering these factors, the FCC may renew a broadcast station’s license, either with conditions or without, or it may designate the renewal application for hearing. The licensees of all television stations serving communities in Puerto Rico were required to file renewal applications by October 1, 2020. We filed renewal applications for our television stations on October 1, 2020. The renewal applications are pending, and we are not aware of any reason why our licenses would not be renewed for full eight-year terms.

Media Ownership Restrictions and FCC Proceedings
The FCC’s broadcast ownership rules affect the number, type and location of broadcast and newspaper properties that we are allowed to hold or acquire. The FCC is required by statute to review all of its broadcast ownership rules every four years to determine if such rules remain necessary in the public interest. The rules limit the common ownership, directly or by way of attribution, operation or control of television stations serving the same area. The rules also limit the aggregate national audience reach of television stations under common ownership, directly or by way of attribution. In 2017, the FCC relaxed certain ownership rules. In September 2019, the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit vacated the FCC’s 2017 decision. As a result of the Third Circuit’s decision, certain changes to the local television ownership rule, which had permitted the common ownership of two television stations in all markets as long as the commonly owned stations were not both among the top-four stations, based on audience share, were eliminated, and the newspaper-broadcast cross ownership and radio-television cross ownership rules were reinstated. In October 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to consider an appeal of the Third Circuit decision and a decision is expected during the Supreme Court's current term. In December 2018, the FCC released a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking to launch its statutorily mandated quadrennial review of multiple ownership rules. The 2018 review will likely remain pending until after the Supreme Court issues its decision The FCC’s rules also define the types of positions and interests that are considered attributable for purposes of the ownership limits. In general, officers, directors and stockholders holding 5% or more of the voting interests in Hemisphere are deemed to have attributable interests. The FCC’s ownership limits therefore apply to our principals and certain investors in our Company. Because we are controlled by a single stockholder holding a majority of the voting power of our capital stock, the FCC’s current rules do not treat other five percent or greater voting stockholders as attributable, and those ownership interests are not required to be reported to the FCC.
In December 2017, the FCC opened a notice of proposed rulemaking to review the national television audience reach cap and the 50% discount that is given to UHF stations in determining compliance with the national audience cap. That proposed rulemaking remains pending as of the date of this Annual Report.
Local Television Ownership Rule
Under the local television ownership rule, one party may own, operate, or control up to two television stations in a market, so long as at least one of the stations is not one of the top four rated stations (based on audience share) in the television market and at least eight independent owners of television stations would remain in the market following a combination. The rule also permits the ownership, operation or control of two television stations in a market as long as the stations’ Noise Limited Service contours do not overlap. Broadcast stations designated by the FCC as “satellite” stations are exempt from the local television ownership rule. WNJX TV and WTIN TV have been designated by the FCC as “satellite” stations of WAPA TV, a division of WAPA. An entity that has an attributable ownership interest in Hemisphere also has an attributable interest in television stations owned by Univision, including Station WSTE, licensed to Ponce, Puerto Rico. Because of this attributable interest, under the current local television ownership rule, without a waiver, we would not be permitted to acquire an attributable interest in any other full power television stations serving Puerto Rico. The FCC may waive its local television ownership rule to permit ownership, operation or control of two television stations in a market that would not otherwise be permissible if one of the stations is in involuntary bankruptcy, is a “failed” station, or is “failing” (i.e., stations with negative cash flow and less than a four share all day audience rating). Under the local television ownership rule, the licensee of a television station that provides more than 15% of another in market station’s weekly programming or advertising will be deemed to have an attributable interest in the other station.

20



Radio Television Cross Ownership Rule
The radio television cross ownership rule generally allows common ownership of one or two television stations and up to six radio stations, or, in certain circumstances, one television station and up to seven radio stations, in any market where at least 20 independent voices would remain after the combination; two television stations and up to four radio stations in a market where at least 10 independent voices would remain after the combination; and one television and one radio station notwithstanding the number of independent voices in the market. A “voice” generally includes independently owned, same market commercial and noncommercial broadcast television and radio stations, newspapers of certain minimum circulation, and one cable system per market.
Newspaper Broadcast Cross Ownership Rule.
Under the currently effective newspaper broadcast cross ownership rule, unless grandfathered or subject to waiver, no party can have an attributable interest in both a daily English-language newspaper and either a television or radio station in the same market.
Attribution of Ownership
Pursuant to FCC rules, the following relationships and interests are generally considered attributable for purposes of broadcast ownership restrictions: (i) all officers and directors of a corporate licensee and its direct or indirect parent(s); (ii) voting stock interests of at least five percent; (iii) voting stock interests of at least 20 percent, if the holder is a passive institutional investor (such as an investment company, bank, or insurance company); (iv) any equity interest in a limited partnership or limited liability company, unless properly “insulated” from management activities; (v) equity and/or debt interests that in the aggregate exceed 33 percent of a licensee’s total assets, if the interest holder supplies more than 15 percent of the station’s total weekly programming or is a same-market broadcast company or daily newspaper publisher; (vi) time brokerage of a broadcast station by a same-market broadcast company; and (vii) same-market radio joint sales agreements. Because we are controlled by a single stockholder holding a majority of the voting power of our capital stock, the FCC’s current rules do not treat other five percent or greater voting stockholders as attributable, and those ownership interests are not required to be reported to the FCC. Pending before the FCC is a proposal to eliminate the single majority shareholder exception. The FCC is also considering a proposal to require the disclosure in biennial ownership reports of information about five percent or greater voting shareholders, even if such interests are not attributable under the FCC’s ownership rules.
Management services agreements and other types of shared services arrangements between same-market stations that do not include attributable time brokerage components generally are not deemed attributable under the FCC’s current ownership rules. However, the FCC now requires that television stations make any shared services agreements available in a station’s public inspection file.
Commission Approval of Transfer of Control of FCC Licenses
The FCC’s prior approval is required for the transfer of control or assignment of FCC licenses. We are currently controlled by Gato Investments LP (“Gato”), which owns a majority of our Class B common Stock, par value $0.0001 per share (“Class B common stock”). The FCC’s prior consent would be required prior to any transaction that would result in a change in control of Hemisphere or Gato. An application for consent to a transfer of control or assignment of licenses would be subject to a formal public notice and comment period during which petitions to deny the applications would be accepted by the FCC.

21



A person or entity requesting the FCC’s consent to acquire or obtain control of our television station licenses must demonstrate that the acquisition complies with the FCC’s ownership rules or that a waiver of the rules is in the public interest. As discussed above, we own two television stations, WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV, which are operated as “satellite” stations of WAPA-TV. Stations granted satellite status are exempt from the FCC’s local television ownership rule. Thus, this status permits the common ownership of the three WAPA broadcast stations that would not otherwise be permitted. WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV were first accorded satellite status in 2001 due to the unique circumstances of the Puerto Rico market, including its topography and economic conditions, and the FCC has renewed this grant in subsequent transactions. We anticipate the FCC would continue to grant satellite status to WNJX-TV and WTIN-TV in future change-in-control transactions.
Foreign Ownership Restrictions
Under the Communications Act, a broadcast license may not be granted to or held by any corporation that has more than 20% of its capital stock owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities, whom the FCC refers to as “aliens,” or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations.
Furthermore, the Communications Act provides that no FCC broadcast license may be granted to or held by any corporation directly or indirectly controlled by any other corporation of which more than 25% of the capital stock is owned or voted by non-U.S. citizens or entities or their representatives, by foreign governments or their representatives, or by non-U.S. corporations, if the FCC finds the public interest will be served by the refusal or revocation of such license. These restrictions apply in modified form to other forms of business organizations, including partnerships and limited liability companies. The FCC has interpreted this provision of the Communications Act to require an affirmative public interest finding before a broadcast license may be granted to or held by any such entity. Prior to 2013, the FCC had made such an affirmative finding with respect to broadcast licenses only in highly limited circumstances. In 2013, however, the FCC concluded that it should begin considering on a case-by-case basis requests for approval of acquisitions by aliens of in excess of 25% of the capital stock of the parent of a broadcast licensee. In 2016, the FCC adopted rules to simplify the process for submitting a declaratory ruling and modifying the procedures for the foreign ownership approval process for broadcast station licensees. These rules also specify how public companies should monitor foreign ownership compliance and provide for remedial provisions in the event a public company determines that it has exceeded its foreign ownership limits.
In considering a request for declaratory ruling, the FCC coordinates with Executive Branch agencies on national security, law enforcement, foreign policy and trade policy issues. In October 2020, the FCC adopted rules to streamline the timing and improve the transparency of the required review of these requests by Executive Branch agencies. The FCC is also currently considering additional rules to further expedite this review process. 
On January 18, 2017, the FCC granted our request to allow non-U.S. investors to own up to 49.99% of our capital stock and hold 49.99% of our voting power. Subsequently, on September 18, 2018, the FCC granted approval of additional specific non-U.S. equity and/or voting ownership interests in excess of 5%. On November 19, 2019, the FCC approved up to 100% aggregate non-U.S. ownership of our equity and voting interests and approved the ownership of up to 49.99% of our capital stock and/or voting power by any one of several specifically approved non-U.S. investors. However, we remain subject to the requirement to obtain specific approval from the FCC before any other alien, in addition to the non U.S. investors that the FCC has previously approved in the series of declaratory ruling identified above, acquires more than 5% of our capital stock or more than 5% voting rights. We are also required to notify the FCC and take remedial actions as necessary, if we determine that an unapproved alien has acquired more than 5% of our capital stock or voting rights, and we may be subject to FCC enforcement action, including monetary forfeitures, if such a circumstance occurs.

22



To the extent necessary to comply with the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, and the declaratory rulings, our board of directors may (i) prohibit the ownership, voting or transfer of any portion of our outstanding capital stock to the extent the ownership, voting or transfer of such portion would cause us to violate or would otherwise result in violation of any provision of the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, or the FCC’s declaratory ruling; (ii) convert shares of our Class B common stock into shares of our Class A common stock to the extent necessary to bring us into compliance with the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, or the FCC’s declaratory rulings; and (iii) redeem capital stock to the extent necessary to bring us into compliance with the Communications Act, FCC rules and policies, or the FCC’s declaratory rulings or to prevent the loss or impairment of any of our FCC licenses.
Digital Television
As of June 12, 2009, all full-power broadcast television stations were required to cease broadcasting analog programming and convert to all digital broadcasts. Digital broadcasting allows stations to offer digital channels for a wide variety of services such as high definition video programming, multiple channels of standard definition video programming, such as WAPA Deportes, data, and other types of communications. Each station is required to provide at least one free over-the-air video program signal.
To the extent a station has “excess” digital capacity (i.e., digital capacity not used to transmit free, over-the-air video programming), it may elect to use that capacity in any manner consistent with FCC technical requirements, including for data transmission, interactive or subscription video services, or paging and information services. If a station uses its digital capacity to provide any such “ancillary or supplementary” services on a subscription or otherwise “feeable” basis, it must pay the FCC an annual fee equal to 5% of the gross revenues realized from such services.
In 2017, the FCC adopted rules authorizing the deployment of the Next Generation broadcast television transmission standard, also called ATSC 3.0. ATSC 3.0 is an Internet Protocol-based broadcast transmission platform that merges the capabilities of over-the-air broadcasting with the broadband viewing and information delivery methods of the Internet, using the same 6 MHz channels presently allocated for digital television service. Stations are not obligated to use ATSC 3.0; use of the new standard is voluntary. However, any station that decides to deploy the new standard will also be required to simulcast its primary program stream in the currently-used ATSC 1.0 format for a period of time as determined by the FCC. We cannot predict what impact the new standard will have on our Business.
MVPD Retransmission of Local Television Signals
A number of provisions of the Communications Act and FCC rules govern aspects of the relationship between broadcast television stations and distributors of multiple channels of video programming such as cable, satellite and telecommunications companies (referred to as “MVPDs”). The rules generally provide certain protections for local broadcast stations, for which MVPDs are an important means of distribution and a provider of competing program channels.
To ensure that every local television station can be received in its local market without requiring a cable subscriber to switch between cable and off-air signals, the FCC allows every full-power television broadcast station to require that all local cable systems and direct broadcast satellite operators transmit that station’s primary digital channel to their subscribers within the station’s market (the so-called “must-carry” rule). Alternatively, a station may elect to forego its must-carry rights and seek a negotiated agreement to establish the terms of its carriage by a local MVPD—referred to as “retransmission consent.” A station electing retransmission consent assumes the risk that it will not be able to strike a deal with the MVPD and will not be carried. A station has the opportunity to elect must-carry or retransmission consent every three years. Elections were made in October 2020 for the 2021-2023 three-year period. WAPA elected retransmission consent and has entered into retransmission consent contracts with all MVPD systems serving Puerto Rico.
MVPDs are not required to carry any programming streams other than a station’s primary video programming channel. Consequently, WAPA’s multicast channel WAPA Deportes is not entitled to mandatory carriage under the FCC’s must-carry rules. However, we are free to negotiate with MVPDs for the carriage of additional programming streams.

In 2014, the FCC adopted rules prohibiting a television broadcast station that is ranked among the top four stations to negotiate retransmission consent jointly with another station, if the stations are not commonly owned and serve the same geographic market. Congress tightened this restriction to prohibit joint negotiation with any television station in the same market unless the stations are under common de jure control as part of the STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 enacted in December 2019 made permanent the statutory requirement that broadcasters and MVPDs negotiate retransmission agreements in good faith, which had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2019. In December 2014, the FCC issued a NPRM requesting comment on whether the definition of MVPD should be expanded to include providers that make multiple linear streams of video programming available for purchase, regardless of the technology used to distribute the programming (e.g. entities providing video programming to subscribers through internet connections). We cannot predict what impact, if any, this proceeding will have on our negotiations with video programming distributors.
Repurposing of Broadcast Spectrum for Other Uses
Federal legislation was enacted in February 2012 that, among other things, authorized the FCC to conduct voluntary “incentive auctions” in order to reallocate certain spectrum currently occupied by television broadcast stations to mobile wireless broadband services, to “repack” television stations into a smaller portion of the existing television spectrum band, and to require television stations that did not relinquish spectrum in the auction to modify their transmission facilities, subject to reimbursement for reasonable relocation costs up to an industry-wide total of $1.75 billion.
The FCC adopted rules concerning the incentive auction and the repacking of the television band and conducted the auction. The incentive auction concluded in the first half of 2017. The FCC is now completing the process of “repacking” the remaining television broadcast spectrum, which requires that certain television stations that did not relinquish spectrum in the auction modify their transmission facilities, including requiring such stations to operate on other channel designations. The FCC is reimbursing stations for reasonable relocation costs. The original reimbursement limit across all stations was $1.75 billion. In March 2018, Congress authorized an additional $1 billion to be used for reimbursements related to repacking. Stations WNJX TV and WTIN TV were reassigned new channels as a result of the incentive auction. WNJX TV and WTIN TV transitioned to their new channels on August 1, 2018 and are currently operating with temporary facilities while construction of their permanent facilities is completed.
The outcome of the repacking of broadcast television spectrum and the impact of such on WAPA’s business, cannot be predicted. Nevertheless, we do not believe that the auction will have a material negative impact on our Business, because with post-auction channel assignments our stations will remain in the more desirable UHF band; our three television stations have overlapping coverage areas, so it is unlikely that we will lose service to a significant portion of the households that we serve. If the FCC is unable to reimburse all of our repacking expenses, the amount of the shortfall is unlikely to be material to our Business as a whole.
EEO Rules
The FCC’s Equal Employment Opportunity (“EEO”) rules impose job information dissemination, recruitment, documentation and reporting requirements on broadcast television stations. Broadcasters are also subject to random audits to ensure compliance with the FCC’s EEO rules and may be sanctioned for noncompliance.
Recordkeeping
The FCC rules require broadcast television stations to maintain various records regarding operations, including equipment performance records and a log of the station’s operating parameters. Television stations must also maintain a public inspection file, which is hosted on an FCC maintained website and is therefore widely accessible by members of the public and the FCC. The FCC has recently increased enforcement of requirements regarding online public inspection files.

Programming and Operations
Rules and policies of the FCC and other federal agencies regulate certain programming practices and other areas affecting the business or operations of broadcast stations, including WAPA, and cable networks, including our U.S. Networks.
Obscenity, Indecency and Profanity. Federal statutes prohibit the broadcast or transmission of obscene material at any time by broadcast television stations and on cable networks, including our U.S. Networks. The FCC’s rules also prohibit television stations, including the WAPA station, from broadcasting indecent or profane material between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. In recent years, the FCC has intensified its enforcement activities with respect to programming it considers indecent and has issued numerous fines to licensees found to have violated the indecency rules.
In 2019, the FCC implemented increased forfeiture amounts for indecency violations that were enacted by Congress. The maximum permitted fine for an indecency violation is $419,353 per incident and $3,870,946 for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act.
Because the FCC may investigate indecency complaints on an ex parte basis, a licensee may not have knowledge of an indecency complaint unless and until the complaint results in the issuance of a formal FCC letter of inquiry or notice of apparent liability for forfeiture. The FCC has advised that it will continue to pursue enforcement actions in egregious cases while it conducts a review of its indecency policy generally.
Children’s Programming. Federal statutes and FCC rules require broadcast television stations, including the WAPA station, to broadcast three hours per week of educational and informational programming (“E/I programming”) designed for children 16 years of age and younger. In July 2019, the FCC adopted revisions to the children’s television programming rules, including the elimination of the requirement to air children’s programming on multicast programming streams, the expansion of the time period during which such programming can air, and requiring reporting to the FCC of such programming on an annual rather than a quarterly basis.
Federal statutes and FCC rules also limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be included in programming primarily produced and carried for children 12 years and younger by broadcast television stations and cable networks, including our U.S. Networks. The FCC’s rules also limit the display, during children’s programming on broadcast stations and cable networks, of Internet addresses of websites that contain or link to commercial material or that use program characters to sell products.
Commercial Loudness. The 2010 Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation Act (“CALM Act”) and the FCC rules implementing the CALM Act, require television stations, cable television operators, satellite television providers, and other pay television providers to limit the average volume of commercials, including promotional announcements, to the same average volume as the programming it accompanies. The FCC rules do not specifically require video programming providers, such as our U.S. Networks, to comply with the rules regarding the loudness of commercials. However, video programming distributors may request or require by contract that programming providers certify compliance with those rules for commercials embedded in programming.
Closed Captioning. FCC rules require the majority of programming broadcast by television stations and carried on cable networks to contain closed captions. In January 2012, the FCC adopted rules to require that television programming broadcast by television stations or transmitted by cable, including on our U.S. Networks, with captioning include captioning if subsequently made available online, for example, by streaming on WAPA.TV. Clips of programming carried on television are required to be captioned if subsequently distributed over the internet. Additionally, beginning in March 2015, new FCC rules became effective that require programming captions to adhere to more stringent quality standards. In 2016, rules became effective requiring certain clips of programming made available online to be captioned if the underlying programming aired on television with captions.

Sponsorship Identification. Both the Communications Act and the FCC’s rules generally require that, when payment or other consideration has been received or promised to a broadcast television station for the airing of program material, the station must disclose that fact and identify who paid or promised to provide the consideration at the time of broadcast. Cable systems are subject to the same requirement when the system is originating programming, also known as cablecasting. The FCC has recently increased enforcement of violations of its sponsorship identification requirements. Fines for such violations can be substantial because they are dependent on the number of times a particular advertisement is broadcast.
Program Access Restrictions
Under the Communications Act, vertically integrated cable programmers are generally prohibited from offering different prices, terms, or conditions to competing multichannel video programming distributors unless the differential is justified by certain permissible factors set forth in the FCC’s regulations. A cable programmer is considered to be vertically integrated if it owns or is owned by a cable television operator, in whole or in part, under the FCC’s program access attribution rules. Cable television operators for this purpose may include telephone companies that provide video programming directly to subscribers. In November 2020, the FCC revised certain of its rules governing the resolution of complaints under the program access rules. Because certain of our directors are also directors of cable companies, we are considered to be a vertically integrated cable programmer and are subject to the program access rules.
Regulation of the Internet
Internet services, including WAPA.TV, CINELATINO.COM, TVPASIONES.COM, CENTROAMERICATV.TV, TELEVISIONDOMINICANA.TV and SNAPTV.TV, are subject to regulation in the U.S. relating to the privacy and security of personally identifiable user information and acquisition of personal information from children under 13, including the federal Child Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) and the federal Controlling the Assault of Non-Solicited Pornography and Marketing Act (CAN-SPAM). In addition, a majority of states have enacted laws that impose data security and security breach obligations. Additional federal, state, territorial laws and regulations may be adopted with respect to the Internet or other online services, covering such issues as user privacy, child safety, data security, advertising, pricing, content, copyrights and trademarks, access by persons with disabilities, distribution, taxation and characteristics and quality of products and services.
Other Regulations
In addition to the regulations applicable to the broadcast, cable television and Internet industries in general, we are also subject to other federal, state, territorial, and local regulations, including, without limitation, regulations promulgated by federal, state, and territorial environmental, health and labor agencies. Cinelatino is also subject to laws and regulations that may be adopted or promulgated by the governments of other jurisdictions in which it operates.
