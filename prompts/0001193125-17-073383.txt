Overview 
 We are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a proprietary technology platform focused on discovering and developing peptide-based new chemical entities (NCEs ) to address significant unmet medical needs. Our primary focus is on developing first-in-class oral peptide drugs that specifically target the same biological pathways also targeted by currently marketed injectable antibody drugs. Compared to injectable antibody drugs, our oral peptides offer targeted delivery to the gastrointestinal (GI) tissue compartment, potential for improved safety due to minimal exposure in the blood, improved convenience and compliance due to oral delivery and the opportunity for earlier introduction of targeted therapy for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Our initial lead product candidates, PTG-100 and PTG-200, are based on this approach and we believe they have the potential to transform the existing treatment paradigm for IBD, a GI disease consisting primarily of ulcerative colitis (UC), and Crohns disease (CD). 
 PTG-100 and PTG-200 are derived from our proprietary peptide technology platform. Peptide therapeutics represent a substantial and growing therapeutic class with more than 60 U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved drugs. Our platform enables us to discover novel, structurally constrained peptides that retain certain key advantages of both oral and small molecule and injectable antibody drugs, while overcoming many of their limitations as therapeutic agents. Constrained peptides are rigid, well-folded structures typically formed by disulfide bonds that alleviate the fundamental instability inherent in traditional peptides, which cannot be delivered orally. Further, these constrained peptides are designed to bind to biological targets, including protein-protein interactions (PPI) targets, which are typically approached by antibodies since small molecules cannot bind effectively to these targets. It is estimated that up to 80% of all potential disease targets are not amenable to drug development by small molecules and have therefore traditionally been approached by injectable antibody drugs. 
 Our novel peptides have potential applicability in a wide range of therapeutic areas in addition to GI diseases. Our first product candidate beyond IBD is PTG-300, an injectable hepcidin mimetic, which is currently in pre-clinical development with completion of Investigational New Drug (IND) enabling studies expected by the end of the first half of 2017. A hepcidin mimetic is a peptide that mimics the function of the natural hormone, hepcidin. PTG-300 has potential utility for the treatment of iron overload disorders, such as b-Thalassemia, hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) and sickle cell disease (SCD), each of which may qualify PTG-300 for orphan drug designation.

 Our Product Candidates 
 PTG-100 
 PTG-100 has first-in-class potential as an oral, alpha-4-beta-7 (a4b7) integrin-specific antagonist for the treatment of IBD. The a4b7 integrin is considered to be one of the most GI-specific biological targets for IBD. It is a cell surface protein present on T cells that plays an important role in the trafficking of T cells to the GI tissue compartment by binding to MAdCAM-1, an extracellular protein that resides mostly in the GI vasculature. 
 We are leveraging several factors to inform and guide the clinical development of PTG-100 for the treatment of IBD. First, PTG-100 shares the same a4b7 integrin target as the injectable antibody drug vedolizumab, marketed as Entyvio®, for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC and CD. Second, we utilized pharmacodynamic (PD) biomarker assays similar to those described in scientific publications used with Entyvio® and other antibodies in development as indicators of target engagement to establish proof-of-concept (POC) in our Phase 1 clinical trial with PTG-100. These PD data include increases in receptor occupancy and decreases in receptor expression. We believe that we can utilize published information describing the development and regulatory path of Entyvio® and other approved antibody drugs for IBD to help inform the design of our clinical development studies. 
 We have completed extensive pre-clinical studies of PTG-100 in which we established pharmacological POC, including effects on T cell trafficking and mucosal healing similar to comparator a4b7 rodent antibody, DATK-32. Following the submission and approval of a Clinical Trial Notification (CTN) in Australia in December 2015, we initiated a Phase 1 clinical trial, comprised of three components: a single ascending dose (SAD) and multiple ascending dose (MAD) component, each of which evaluated safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and PD-based POC in healthy subjects, using an oral liquid formulation of PTG-100. The Phase 1 clinical trial was completed in June 2016. Dose escalation proceeded up to 1,000 mg, the highest dose tested in the study for both single and multiple dosing. There were no serious adverse events reported in the Phase 1 clinical trial, and no dose-limiting toxicities were observed. All reported adverse events were of mild to moderate severity. There were no dose-dependent increases observed for any adverse events. The most frequent adverse events reported by subjects on PTG-100 were headache and upper respiratory tract infection. These events were also observed in subjects who took placebo. 
 We initiated a global Phase 2b randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled dose-finding clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2016 to assess safety and efficacy of PTG-100 in moderate-to-severe UC patients. We anticipate that the trial will enroll approximately 240 subjects at approximately 100 sites in the United States, Canada, Europe (Western, Central, and Eastern), Asia, Australia, and New Zealand. The primary objectives of our Phase 2b clinical trial are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of PTG-100 and its efficacy in the induction of remission in subjects with moderate-to-severe UC. Secondary objectives are to select PTG-100 induction doses for continued development, to characterize PTG-100 plasma concentrations and pharmacodynamic responses, and to evaluate any immunogenicity over 12 weeks. The trial will include subjects who have had prior exposure to tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) inhibitors and subjects who have not been treated with biologics. Subjects will be randomized to one of four dose arms (150mg/300mg/900mg PTG-100 or placebo) for 12 weeks of once-daily oral dosing, followed by four weeks of safety follow-up. An interim futility analysis is expected to be performed in the second half of 2017, and if futility criteria are not met, one or two PTG-100 doses will be selected for continued randomization of the remaining subjects. We expect to complete the study and report top-line data in the second half of 2018. We expect that this trial will support end-of-Phase 2 meetings with global health authorities and enable the initiation of a Phase 3 pivotal program. 
 The primary endpoints are consistent with those used in the clinical development of previously approved drugs for UC. The trial is statistically powered to detect a clinically meaningful difference in induction of remission in subjects with moderate-to-severe UC who are treated with PTG-100 compared to placebo. The evaluation of clinical remission is based on the Mayo Score, which is a well-established composite assessment that utilizes patient-reported outcomes and endoscopic improvement. Secondary efficacy endpoints will include

  endoscopic response, clinical response, endoscopic remission, change in endoscopic subscore, change in stool frequency and rectal bleeding subscores, change in fecal calprotectin, change in the IBD questionnaire, change in Mayo score and change in partial Mayo score, from baseline to multiple points during the induction period. 
 We plan to develop PTG-100 initially for the treatment of moderate-to-severe UC, potentially followed by mild-to-moderate UC, CD, and pediatric IBD, the latter being an orphan indication. 
 PTG-200 
 Our second oral, GI-restricted peptide product candidate is PTG-200, a potential first-in-class Interleukin-23 receptor (IL-23R) specific antagonist for the treatment of IBD. Interleukin-23 (IL-23) is a member of the IL-12 family of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and is a protein that regulates inflammatory and immune function and plays a key role in the development of IBD. By blocking the IL-23 receptor with PTG-200 in the GI tissue compartment, we expect to reduce inflammation while potentially minimizing the risk of systemic side effects due to its GI-restricted nature. The IL-23 pathway is targeted by the IL-12 and IL-23 antagonist infused antibody drug ustekinumab, marketed as Stelara®, for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and moderate-to-severe CD. 
 We have completed pre-clinical POC studies for PTG-200, started IND-enabling studies, and plan to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2017. We plan to develop PTG-200 initially for the treatment of moderate-to-severe CD, potentially followed by UC and pediatric IBD, the latter being an orphan indication. 
 PTG-300 
 PTG-300 is an injectable hepcidin mimetic peptide that we are developing for the treatment of iron overload disorders, such as b-Thalassemia, HH and SCD, each of which may qualify for orphan drug designation. Hepcidin is a peptide hormone critical for regulating iron homeostasis. However, hepcidin has significant stability, potency and solubility limitations. We have discovered and developed PTG-300 as a stable, soluble hepcidin mimetic that can potentially be more potent and more amenable for weekly or less frequent subcutaneous delivery compared to hepcidin. We plan to complete IND-enabling studies by the end of the first half of 2017 and complete a Phase 1 clinical trial that will evaluate safety/ tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic proof-of-concept by the end of 2017. 
 Additional Product Candidates. We are currently researching potential oral and injectable peptide-based product candidates for a range of conditions including, but not restricted to GI diseases. 
 The Evolution of Antibody Drugs for Targeted Therapy and Their Limitations 
 Before the FDA approval of antibody drugs, chemically synthesized oral small molecules were the standard-of-care for the treatment of many diseases. However, small molecules are not capable of blocking most PPIs that underpin cellular processes frequently involved in numerous diseases. It is estimated that small molecules cannot be developed as drugs for the treatment of up to 80% of all identified potential disease targets. With the availability of antibody drugs, targeted therapy for many PPI-driven diseases became feasible. 
 In 2015, six of the top ten selling U.S. drugs were antibody drugs. In 2013, all approved antibody drugs together generated approximately $75 billion in sales. More than 30 antibody drugs have now been approved by the FDA, including the IBD targeted therapy drugs Humira®, Remicade®, and Entyvio®. 
 Despite their growing use, antibody drugs present several limitations for patients including, but not limited to, the following: 
 

 | Injections or infusions are associated with significant patient burden. Antibody drugs are large proteins that are not stable in the GI tissue compartment. As a consequence, antibody based therapies are administered primarily by injection or infusion into systemic circulation. Injections or infusions as a mode of delivery can increase patient burden, including site reactions and systemic hypersensitivity, inconvenience, and needle anxiety and phobia, each of which may negatively affect patient compliance.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | Antibody drugs may have significant safety issues. Antibody drugs are typically administered at high concentrations in order to attain appropriate therapeutic levels at distal sites of a disease. High systemic exposure of immunomodulatory agents can increase the risks of use for patients:
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Elevated risk of serious or opportunistic infection, malignancy and severe hypersensitivity events. Many antibody drugs are immunosuppressive, which may lead to increased risk of serious or opportunistic infection, such as tuberculosis, histoplasmosis and hepatitis B, or malignancy. Further, injection or infusion may increase the risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions including anaphylaxis.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Long half-life resulting in delayed clearance from the bloodstream. Antibody drugs are large molecules engineered to have long half-lives and to circulate in the bloodstream for extended periods of time. This longevity can be potentially problematic for patients who experience adverse reactions and cannot readily eliminate the drug from their systems.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Immunogenicity reactions can lead to loss of response or possible safety risks. Antibody drugs may induce natural immunogenic responses from the body including the introduction of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). These ADAs can neutralize the action of the therapeutic antibody either by enhancing its clearance or blocking its function, either of which can result in loss of therapeutic response. ADAs can cause immunogenic reactions in patients leading to possible adverse events, frequently necessitating drug withdrawal.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Antibody drugs are expensive. Compared to other classes of therapeutics, the complexity and size of antibody drugs can result in high manufacturing, storage and administration costs. To date, these costs have not been significantly reduced through the introduction of biosimilar drugs.

 Our Solution for IBD: Oral, GI-Restricted Peptides 
 Our novel peptide therapeutics platform may provide important benefits over existing non-targeted small molecule, injectable antibody, and conventional peptide therapeutics. In addition, our platform represents a major step forward in the evolution of peptides as therapeutics. Most of the more than 60 currently FDA approved peptides have unstructured shapes, leading to chemical and biological stability limitations, which confine their use to injectable drugs. In contrast, our peptide technology platform allows us to identify constrained peptides that can serve as a starting point for discovery and development of oral, selective, and potent peptides. The well-folded conformation in our constrained peptides is typically derived by disulfide bonds, a structural feature inherent in many naturally occurring peptides. For the IBD targets of interest, the size and nature of our peptides is carefully selected and modified so as to acquire the desired potency and specificity, and also to restrict their presence to the GI tissue compartment when administered orally. These features translate to oral, GI-restricted, selective and potent peptide drug candidates with specific advantages compared to antibody drugs: 
 

 | Oral administration. We are developing our peptide therapeutics in a convenient capsule or tablet form intended for oral administration. We believe oral administration may reduce many of the problems and limitations associated with injections or infusions, including injection site pain and local reactions, inconvenience, anxiety, high rates of immunogenicity and potential safety risks.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potential for improved safety and tolerability compared to antibody drugs.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Oral and GI-restricted delivery minimizes systemic exposure in the blood. Oral GI-restricted delivery results in lower drug levels in the blood that may provide the potential for an enhanced safety profile over antibody drugs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Peptides can be cleared more quickly from systemic circulation. Small molecules and peptides below a size threshold can be rapidly cleared from blood circulation by kidney filtration and excretion. Rapid clearance may be beneficial especially if patients need to discontinue therapy. In contrast, antibody drugs, because of their long plasma half-life, may take months to clear from blood circulation leaving patients exposed to continued or increased safety risk.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 | The likelihood of much lower immunogenicity of small stable peptides compared to antibody drugs reduces the risk of loss of response. We believe that ADAs are less likely to be elicited against constrained peptides, due to their small size, lack of epitope density, resistance to proteolysis, oral tolerance, and minimal systemic absorption.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potential for localized delivery to site of disease. We believe oral dosing of GI-restricted peptides results in substantially higher drug concentrations in the diseased GI tissue compartment compared to injectable antibody drugs. This targeted delivery to the site of action may lead to more immediate and significant target engagement at the site of active disease in the GI tissue compartment.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Cost-effective and less complex manufacturing. Because of their size and stability, we believe that our oral, GI-restricted peptide product candidates can be produced, stored and shipped in a more cost-effective manner than many antibody drugs.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In chronic GI diseases such as IBD, we believe that our oral, GI-restricted peptide product candidates may offer improved delivery, the potential for improved safety and tolerability, and cost efficiencies that may provide an overall benefit to patients, payers, and physicians. 
 Overview of Inflammatory Bowel Disease 
 Inflammatory bowel disease is a group of chronic autoimmune and inflammatory conditions of the colon and small intestine, consisting primarily of UC and CD, and characterized by abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue and anemia. In UC, inflammation starts in the rectum and generally extends proximally in a continuous manner through the entire colon. In CD, the disease most commonly affects the small intestine and the proximal large intestine. Both UC and CD have periods of various intensity and severity, and when a patient is symptomatic, the disease is considered to be in an active or flare stage. Approximately 25% of UC cases occur in persons before the age of 20. Furthermore, pediatric IBD is considered an orphan indication. 
Market Overview 
 According to the Crohns & Colitis Foundation of America, there were an estimated 1.6 million IBD patients in the United States in 2013, an increase of approximately 200,000 patients since 2011. As many as 70,000 new cases of IBD are diagnosed in the United States each year. As of 2008, annual direct treatment costs for patients with IBD in the United States were estimated to exceed $6.3 billion, while indirect costs such as missed work days were estimated to cost an additional $5.5 billion. In 2012, GlobalData estimated that the UC market reached approximately $4.2 billion and the CD market reached approximately $3.2 billion, in each case across ten major markets: the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Japan, Canada, China, and India. According to Global Data estimates, these markets are expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of approximately 3% to 5% over the ten years from 2012 to 2022. 
 History of IBD Treatments 
 Non-Targeted Therapies 
 Sulfasalazine was discovered as the first non-targeted therapy for treatment of UC. Non-targeted therapies continued to evolve, including the introduction of corticosteroids for treatment of moderate UC in the 1950s. Subsequently, the immunosuppressive drug mercaptopurine was identified for UC in the 1960s, azathiopurine was developed in the 1970s, followed by 5-aminosalicylic acid. While these oral, non-targeted broad-spectrum anti-inflammatory agents and non-specific immunomodulators continue to be part of the IBD treatment paradigm, especially in mild-to-moderate IBD, these drugs are often ineffective, and corticosteroid and oral immunosuppressive drugs may have significant and disabling adverse effects that limit their use.

 TNF- a and a4b7 Integrin Targeted Antibody Drugs
Recent advances in molecular biology and genomics ushered in the development of the potent and highly targeted biologic drugs. TNF-a was identified as a cytokine, a protein involved in cell signaling, that plays an important role in the inflammatory processes associated with IBD. In developing therapies against TNF-a, small molecule antagonists that directly bind TNF-a and other PPI targets have yet to be discovered and approved as therapeutics for the treatment of IBD. Thus, monoclonal antibody drugs emerged as a new class of therapeutics that can inhibit TNF-a activiy. There are currently five TNF-a antibody drugs (Humira®, Remicade®, Cimzia®, Simponi® and Inflectra® (infliximab biosimilar)) approved for the treatment of UC and/or CD. In 2014, Entyvio®, an intravenously administered antibody that selectively targets the a4b7 integrin, was approved for the treatment of adult patients with moderate-to-severe UC or CD where one or more standard therapies have not resulted in an adequate response. Entyvio® sales were approximately $530 million in 2015 and are projected to peak at approximately $2 billion. 
 While antibody drugs have greatly improved the treatment of IBD, they generally serve as the last-line of treatment before surgery due to their potential for severe adverse effects, diminishing efficacy over time, inherent limitations as injectable-based therapies, and high costs of therapy. 
 The Evolving IBD Treatment Paradigm 
 Inducing and maintaining clinical remission is the primary goal of treatment for IBD patients. The current treatment paradigm for IBD is considered a step-up approach. It involves a sequential step-up in treatment to more potent but higher risk therapies according to the level of severity of the patients disease. Thus, targeted biologic therapies are generally reserved for patients with moderate-to-severe disease who have failed to respond to non-targeted oral therapies including 5-ASA agents, corticosteroids and non-specific immunomodulators. As a result, only a portion of IBD patients currently receive a targeted antibody therapy. 
 For moderate-to-severe IBD patients, physicians may prescribe TNF-a antibody drugs (e.g. Remicade® or Humira®) or Entyvio®, an antibody drug inhibiting a4b7 integrin, to induce and maintain clinical remission. Patients who are transitioned to these targeted antibody drugs may fail to respond to treatment or lose response to some or all of these agents over time and may ultimately require surgery. Approximately 50% to 73% of CD and 65% of UC patients fail to reach remission with TNF-a antibodies. Furthermore, 30% to 40% of UC patients and approximately 40% of CD patients treated with TNF-a antibody drugs stop responding to these agents over time (secondary non-responders) at a rate of approximately 10% to 13% per year. Of the CD patients who initially benefit from TNF-a antibody drugs, 25% to 40% of these patients develop intolerable or serious adverse events or lose their response within the first year of therapy. Currently, a common approach for IBD patients with lack of efficacy or loss of response to TNF-a antibody drugs is to switch such patients to other TNF-a antibody drugs. Although this is initially successful in 40% to 60% of patients, there remains a lack of treatment options for patients who lose responses to multiple TNF-a antibody drugs. Further, patient non-adherence with TNF-a antibody drugs in IBD has been reported to be between approximately 30% to 45% resulting in a greater need for hospitalization. 
 The development of new, potent and targeted therapies for IBD with oral delivery may potentially offer more effective treatment options for moderate-to-severe IBD patients. Furthermore, many clinicians are already advocating for an earlier introduction of targeted therapeutics in IBD to reduce, replace or delay the use of corticosteroids and non-specific oral immunomodulators. This treatment approach is often referred to as a top-down approach as therapeutics that are currently at the top of the step-up pyramid are moved down to earlier in the treatment paradigm (see Figure 1). We believe we are well-positioned to be leaders in this shift from step-up to top-down therapy. Our oral, GI-restricted, and targeted peptide drugs work on the same specific targets as injectable antibody drugs and have the potential to offer improved patient safety, improved compliance and convenience and reduced immunogenicity as compared to antibody drugs. In addition, key opinion leaders are increasingly viewing the a4b7 integrin antagonist Entyvio® as a preferable alternative to TNF-a blockers for the

  treatment of IBD due to its improved safety profile. Taken together, we believe that these trends may result in our product candidates, if approved, being used more broadly than antibody drugs in moderate-to-severe IBD patients and potentially being used for the treatment of mild-to-moderate disease. 
Figure 1: Transforming the Existing IBD Treatment Paradigm with Oral Targeted Therapy Drugs 
 

PTG-100: AN ORAL a4b7 INTEGRIN ANTAGONIST
PTG-100 was discovered through our peptide technology platform and is being developed as a potential first-in-class oral, GI-restricted a4b7 integrin-specific antagonist initially for patients with moderate-to-severe UC. 
 Mechanism of Action 
 Integrins, such as a4b7, are transmembrane proteins that regulate cellular movement into extravascular tissue and play an important role in modulating the inflammatory reaction in the gut. The a4b7 integrin is expressed on the surface of T cells, immune cells that help defend against foreign and potentially harmful substances that enter the body. The development of UC is driven by the migration of a4b7 T cells into the GI tissue compartment and their subsequent activation within the GI tissue compartment. The entry of a4b7 T cells into the GI tissue compartment is facilitated by the PPI between the a4b7 integrin and its corresponding ligand, MAdCAM-1, which is primarily expressed in the GI tissue compartment. Hence, the binding of a4b7 to MAdCAM-1 can be categorized as a GI-specific interaction and has been identified as an IBD-specific targeted therapeutic approach. By blocking the binding of a4b7 integrin to MAdCAM-1, PTG-100 may prevent T cells from entering the GI tissue compartment, thereby reducing inflammation that leads to the clinical manifestations of UC. 
 a4b7 for IBD is targeted by FDA-approved Entyvio® (vedolizumab), which has demonstrated safety and efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe UC and CD. Since PTG-100 targets the same biological pathway as Entyvio®, we can utilize similar PD-based POC as early as in our pre-clinical studies and Phase 1 clinical trial to inform and guide our Phase 2b development program. We sourced these PD biomarker assays from public scientific publications and do not maintain any contractual arrangement providing access to this information with the makers of these marketed products. 
 Translating PTG-100s Pre-Clinical POC to Clinical POC 
 We have established a potentially efficacious dose range of PTG-100 in mice by demonstrating similar pharmacologic activity between oral PTG-100 and an injectable a4b7 antibody in mouse models of IBD. From this 
 
7 
 
Index to Financial Statements
  efficacious dose range in mice, approximately 6-50 mg/kg per day, we are able to directly estimate a potentially efficacious dose range in humans through allometric scaling based on whole body surface areas, which we determined to be approximately 33-300 mg per day. 
 Concurrently, we employed a complementary approach for establishing a potentially efficacious human dose range and early POC through specific blood PD response markers that reflect a4b7 integrin target engagement of PTG-100 in the GI tissue compartment and correlated those PD measurements with efficacy responses in mouse colitis models. Target engagement is a critical feature for demonstrating that PTG-100 can reach its intended target, thus inhibiting the trafficking of T cells into the GI tissue compartment. Our PD markers were monitored in mice and cynomolgus monkeys (cyno), which were similarly evaluated in normal healthy volunteers in our Phase 1 clinical trial. These blood PD responses demonstrated that PTG-100 engaged its intended a4
b7 target and helped guide human dosing for our Phase 2b clinical trial. 
 PTG-100s Pre-Clinical Proof-of-Concept Studies 
 Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that PTG-100 is a potent and highly selective a4b7 antagonist with minimal systemic absorption. Mouse colitis models have further demonstrated that PTG-100 can inhibit T cell trafficking in the gut similar to the actions of the mouse a4b7 antagonist antibody. 
 PTG-100 potently inhibited binding of a4
b7 to MAdCAM-1 in several human biochemical enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and cell adhesion (transformed and primary cells) assays in a low nanomolar concentration range sufficient to inhibit 50% of binding (IC50) comparable to vedolizumab. PTG-100 exhibited greater than a 100,000-fold selectivity against other structurally similar integrins, a4b1 and aLb2, in cell adhesion assays which is comparable to the selectivity of vedolizumab. PTG-100 was stable in in vitro assays simulating the GI tissue compartment, such as the small intestine and gastric stomach, with half-lives exceeding 12 hours and in human liver microsomes suggesting strong oral stability and the potential for once daily dosing in humans. PTG-100 did not affect the growth of and was not metabolized by common members of the human intestinal microflora. In total, these drug properties provide evidence to characterize PTG-100 as a potential first-in-class orally stable a4b7-specific antagonist. Furthermore, these drug properties allowed us to demonstrate proof-of-concept in animal colitis studies. 
 Non-clinical metabolism and PK studies demonstrated that much greater amounts of PTG-100 as measured by the maximum concentration (Cmax) as a percentage of total drug amount dosed orally, were present in the GI compartments, such as the small intestine, colon and feces compared to the systemic plasma and urine compartments of mice, rats, and cyno, thus confirming its GI-restricted properties. Further, PTG-100 has an oral systemic bioavailability of less than 0.5%. 
 We designed mouse colitis studies similar to those used for antibody drugs targeting this pathway to specifically monitor T cell trafficking to and from the GI tissue compartment (Figure 2). PTG-100 reduced a4b7 memory T cells migrating to the gut lymphoid tissues, including the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) and Peyers patches (PP), under inflammatory conditions in the GI tissue compartment. Another example of the ability of PTG-100 to inhibit T cell trafficking was demonstrated by the reduction in the number of a4b7 cells in colon lesions in colitis mice. Furthermore, treatment benefit was demonstrated through blinded video endoscopy analysis for mucosal damage, and assessment of the incidence of bloody feces, which represent symptoms and measurements of UC in humans. In all studies in mouse models of colitis, the effects of oral PTG-100 were comparable to those of an injection of high doses of a positive control a4b7 antibody. This allows us to define the efficacious dose in mice with potential translation to the efficacious dose in humans.

Establishing Blood Pharmacodynamic Readouts of Target Engagement 
 We have used pre-clinical blood PD response markers that reflect target engagement in the GI tissue compartment and correlate with efficacy responses in mouse colitis studies to guide our dosing in human studies. Furthermore, we believe these pre-clinical blood PD responses, specifically receptor occupancy (RO) increases reflecting target engagement and receptor expression (RE) decreases reflecting subsequent pharmacologic activity, can be compared to the PD responses we observed in our Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers and ultimately can help to guide the dosing for evaluating clinical benefit in UC patients in the Phase 2b clinical trial. In the mouse colitis model, RO and RE were correlated with in vivo efficacy that can be extrapolated to the blood RO and RE observed in healthy mice and cyno. These PD markers from mice and cyno have specifically demonstrated increases in RO that peak at approximately 4 hours following a single dose and multiple doses (Figure 3A), and decreases in RE after multiple doses in healthy mice (Figure 3B) and colitis mice. In translating the pre-clinical observations into a clinical setting, we are focused on evaluating dose- and time-dependent trends in RO and RE in our Phase 1 clinical trial that can be benchmarked to the animal data to give us greater confidence in progressing PTG-100 in clinical trials. Emphasis is placed on trends and not on absolute numbers owing to differences in GI transit times in different species and absence of absolute scaling methods from animals to humans for GI-restricted drugs.

PTG-100s Non-GLP and GLP Safety Pharmacology and Toxicology Studies 
 To date, all toxicology and safety pharmacology studies have not identified any safety issues. Good Laboratory Practices (GLP) toxicology studies in rats and cyno over 42 days and 12 weeks of dosing showed that PTG-100 was well-tolerated at all dose levels with no dose-limiting toxicities. GLP are those procedural and operational requirements specified by FDA regulation to ensure the validity and reliability of nonclinical studies. No adverse effects were seen in either rat or cyno studies at all doses tested. Standard safety pharmacology and genotoxicity studies were similarly negative. We are currently conducting chronic GLP toxicology studies to support our anticipated Phase 3 program. 
PTG-100s Phase 1 Clinical Trial Overview 
 Following the submission and approval of a CTN, we initiated a Phase 1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of PTG-100 in 78 normal healthy male volunteers in Australia, which was completed in June 2016. The Phase 1 SAD and MAD components were conducted with a solution-based liquid formulation of PTG-100. In the formulation bridging component of the trial, we compared the relative bioavailability of the liquid formulation to the capsule formulation that is being used in Phase 2b. In addition to determining the safety and tolerability and PK of PTG-100, the SAD and MAD components of the trial evaluated PD-based POC through the assessment of a4b7 receptor occupancy that indicates target engagement and a4b7 target expression on peripheral blood memory T cells similar to what was done in the pre-clinical studies. 
 Safety and Tolerability 
 In both the SAD and MAD portions of the clinical trial, dose escalation proceeded from 100 mg up to the planned 1,000 mg dose level. There were no dose-limiting toxicities. There were no deaths or serious adverse events (SAEs) reported in the trial. All reported adverse events were of mild to moderate severity. There were no dose-dependent increases observed for any adverse events. The most frequent adverse events reported by subjects on PTG-100 were headache and upper respiratory tract infection. These events were also observed in subjects who took placebo. 
Pharmacokinetics 
 PTG-100 plasma levels increased in a dose-dependent manner in both single and multiple dosing cohorts. Consistent with the pre-clinical data in mice, rats, and cyno, the blood levels of PTG-100 were extremely low as

  determined by the Area Under the Curve (AUC, which is a pharmacokinetic measurement of drug exposure in blood plasma against time) and Cmax (maximum concentration), thus demonstrating the GI-restricted nature of the drug. There was no apparent evidence of drug accumulation at Day 14 in the MAD cohorts perhaps related to the relatively short half-life (T1/2) in the blood. 
 PTG-100 fecal levels increased in a dose-dependent manner in the multiple dosing cohorts. Minimum drug levels of PTG-100 were observed in urine samples, as expected, based on its characteristics as a GI-restricted drug with minimal systemic exposure. 
 Establishing Pharmacodynamic POC in Humans 
 Data from our mouse colitis studies support our conclusion that blood receptor occupancy is a correlate of target engagement in the GI tissue compartment in the dose ranges studied. In our Phase 1 clinical trial, blood receptor occupancy on CD4+ memory a4b7+T cells increased in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. For receptor occupancy in the SAD cohorts, treatment groups were significant compared to placebo at 100 mg (p£0.05), 300 mg (p£0.005) and 1,000 mg (p£0.0001). In the MAD cohorts, treatment groups were significant compared to placebo at 100 mg (p<0.0005), 300 mg (p<0.0001) and 1,000 mg (p<0.0001) four hours post dose on Day 14. 
 An additional parameter of pharmacologic activity that we measured was the change in a4b7 expression on the blood memory T cells. Based on in vitro studies comparing vedolizumab and PTG-100, we expected that a4b7 expression would be reduced over time due to the internalization of the a4b7 receptor. Following single and multiple dose administration in the Phase 1 clinical trial, a dose-dependent and time-dependent reduction in a4b7 expression was observed, and it appears that the reduction in target expression may become saturated at 300 mg since a similar response was observed in the 1,000 mg cohort following both single and multiple dosing. For a4b7, downregulation of expression was significant in treatment groups, compared to placebo at 300 mg and 1,000 mg (p£0.01). 
 The single dose 300 mg cohort was evaluated under fasted and fed (standard high fat diet) conditions. Blood drug levels and blood receptor occupancy of PTG-100 were compared under both conditions. Based on data from this SAD component and previous pre-clinical studies, the MAD component of the clinical trial was conducted under fed conditions. 
 Thus, we observed dose-dependent and time-dependent target engagement and pharmacologic activity of PTG-100 following single- and multiple-dose administration in healthy volunteers consistent with observations in the animal studies. 
 Formulation Change from Phase 1 Clinical Trial to Phase 2b Clinical Trial 
 We utilized a liquid formulation in the SAD and MAD components of the Phase 1 clinical trial. To support the use of a capsule formulation in the Phase 2b study, we compared the PK in a single dose cross-over evaluation of the liquid and capsule formulation in normal healthy volunteers and observed that the plasma exposure of the capsule formulation was lower than that of the liquid formulation at the same dose level. The PD effects were highly similar between the capsule and liquid formulations, despite the lower plasma exposure of the capsule formulation. 
PTG-200: AN ORAL IL-23R ANTAGONIST 
 PTG-200 was discovered through our peptide technology platform and is being developed as a potential first-in-class oral, GI-restricted antagonist that binds to the IL-23R and specifically blocks its interaction with the IL-23 cytokine. PTG-200 will be initially studied in patients with moderate-to-severe CD potentially followed by UC and pediatric IBD.

 Mechanism of Action and Rationale 
 IL-23 is a member of the IL-12 family of cytokines with pro-inflammatory and autoimmune properties. Cytokines are cell signaling proteins that are released by cells and affect the behavior of other cells. Binding of the IL-23 ligand to the IL-23R receptor leads to an expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in the mucosal autocrine cascade that is an important pathway of many inflammatory diseases, including IBD. Furthermore, genetic analyses of IBD patients have implicated IL-23R mutations as a risk factor associated with susceptibility to IBD. The antagonist infused antibody drug ustekinumab (marketed as Stelara® for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, and moderate-to-severe CD) is a p40 antagonist antibody that inhibits both the IL-23 and IL-12 pathways. Next-generation IBD antibody drugs, such as guselkumab, target the p19 subunit of the IL-23 ligand and are specific to the IL-23 pathway, which is believed to be an important driver of IBD pathology, while not blockading the IL-12 pathway. IL-12 is believed to be important in immune surveillance against the development of infections and malignancies. 
 We believe that the oral, GI-restricted nature of PTG-200 will allow PTG-200 to be a potent inhibitor of the IL-23 pathway for the treatment of IBD. By targeting IL-23R with our GI-restricted oral IL-23R antagonist PTG-200, we believe PTG-200 will restore proper immune function in the GI tissue compartment where there is active disease while minimizing the risk of systemic side effects. Several key cell types that reside in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT), including T cells, innate lymphoid cells, and natural killer cells, increase their expression of IL-23R during the progression of IBD. Therefore, the high concentrations of PTG-200 in GALT will facilitate access and binding to IL-23R expressed in the same tissue. 
 PTG-200s Pre-Clinical Proof-of-Concept Studies 
 PTG-200 potently inhibited binding of IL-23 to the IL-23 receptor in several biochemical (ELISA) and cell (transformed and primary) signaling assays in a subnanomolar to low nanomolar concentration range sufficient to inhibit 50% of binding. PTG-200 exhibited greater than a 50,000-fold selectivity against other structurally similar receptors (IL-12Rb1 and IL-6R) thereby potentially reducing the risk of off target interactions. In total, these drug properties provide evidence to characterize PTG-200 as a potential first-in-class orally stable IL-23R-specific antagonist. 
 In PK studies in rats and cyno, PTG-200 was GI-restricted with less than 0.5% oral systemic bioavailability in plasma or urine and principal exposure in the small intestine, colon, and feces. Similar results were observed in cyno. 
 We have also completed pre-clinical POC studies in rat 2, 4, 6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) colitis models demonstrating that oral delivery of PTG-200 and other prototype antagonists significantly improved disease outcomes, such as reducing body weight loss, reducing the increased colon weight/length ratio, and reducing the increased colon macroscopic score which is comprised of assessments of colon adhesions, strictures, ulcers, and wall thickness in a dose dependent manner (Figure 4). Furthermore, PTG-200 was found to reduce the increased histopathology summary score, which is comprised of assessments of mucosal and transmural inflammation, gland loss, and erosion parameters. Finally, PTG-200 was able to reduce the expression of the pro-inflammatory IL-23 induced cytokines in the colon and the IBD disease biomarker lipocalin (LCN2) in the serum and feces (Figure 4).

 The efficacy of oral PTG-200 seen in this IBD model was comparable to that of a positive control antibody against the rat IL-23p19 subunit which was injected and therefore present in the systemic blood compartment. This allows us to define the efficacious dose range in rats (approximately 28-61 mg/kg per day) with potential translation to the efficacious dose in humans. 
PTG-200s Preliminary Pre-Clinical Safety Studies 
 In preliminary non-GLP toxicity studies in rats, PTG-200 was well-tolerated with no adverse events at the highest dose level tested. We have initiated 3 month GLP toxicology, safety pharmacology, genotoxicity, and current good manufacturing practice (cGMP) manufacturing studies in support of starting a Phase 1 clinical trial in 2017. 
Proposed Clinical Plans 
 We plan to complete IND-enabling studies and to initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial of PTG-200 in 2017 to evaluate safety, tolerability, and PK. Following completion of the Phase 1 clinical trial, we plan to initiate a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 POC clinical trial in patients with moderate-to-severe CD. 
PTG-300: AN INJECTABLE HEPCIDIN MIMETIC 
 PTG-300 was discovered through our peptide technology platform and is being developed as a novel mimetic of hepcidin to potentially treat iron overload disorders such as b-Thalassemia, HH and SCD, each of which may qualify for orphan designation. Hepcidin is a naturally-occurring hormone involved in the transport and utilization of iron in the human body. Hepcidin has significant stability, potency, and solubility limitations. In order to effectively treat iron overload disorders in the body, we designed PTG-300 as a stable, soluble, hepcidin mimetic that can potentially be more potent and more amenable for weekly or less frequent subcutaneous delivery compared to hepcidin. We believe PTG-300 has the potential to improve disease symptoms and provide better safety by reducing the need for blood transfusions and chelator use in b-Thalassemia patients by treating both the underlying anemia and iron overload associated with the disease. We have achieved POC in pre-clinical studies and have demonstrated that PTG-300 has the potential for greater potency, stability, and in vivo efficacy compared to natural hepcidin. 
 Mechanism of Action 
 The molecular target of hepcidin is the cellular trans-membrane protein ferroportin, which functions as an export channel for intracellular iron in macrophages, liver hepatocytes, and duodenal enterocytes. Upon binding to the extracellular domain of ferroportin, hepcidin decreases the delivery of iron to the blood circulation needed for the production of red blood cells. 
 Overview of b-Thalassemia and Current Therapies
b-Thalassemia is potentially our first clinical indication for PTG-300. Due to repeat transfusions and/ or increased absorption of iron, patients with b-Thalassemia frequently suffer from iron overload which can lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This iron overload is exacerbated in those b-Thalassemia patients who require chronic blood transfusions for survival. A hepcidin mimetic such as PTG-300 will potentially be able to correct the anemia caused by the genetic mutation underlying b-Thalassemia, thus giving it a dual benefit of increasing the production of red blood cells, reducing excess circulating iron, and reducing splenomegaly. 
 Globally, prevalence of b-Thalassemia is estimated to be approximately 200,000, with at least 60,000 patients born each year with the disease. In 2010, the b-Thalassemia market was estimated to be greater than $500 million, based largely on drugs consisting of chelating agents used to treat iron overload disorders. The 
 
14 
 
Index to Financial Statements
  market is expected to grow to nearly $1 billion by 2018. b-Thalassemia has low prevalence in the Americas, with an estimated 2,750 patients and with approximately 300 patients born each year with the disease. Therefore, b-Thalassemia may qualify for FDA orphan designation. 
 PTG-300s Pre-clinical Proof-of-Concept Studies 
 In pre-clinical studies, we demonstrated that PTG-300 can lower serum iron more effectively than hepcidin and maintain such lowered serum iron levels for at least 24 hours following a single subcutaneous injection (Figure 5). We have also demonstrated that PTG-300 in a dose dependent manner can reduce serum iron in healthy mice, rats, and cyno. 
Figure 5: PTG-300 is More Effective Than Hepcidin in Lowering Serum Iron in Healthy Mice 
 

PTG-300 was also able to address the underlying anemia present in a mouse genetic model of b-Thalassemia, as shown most prominently by the significant increase in red blood cell number (RBC) and hemoglobin (HGB) with the corresponding decrease in reticulocyte content (Figure 6). As a consequence we also observed a significant reduction in the pathological increases in spleen weight (splenomegaly) by addressing the underlying ineffective erythropoiesis. Furthermore, PTG-300 was effective in reducing the increase in liver iron content. In contrast the oral iron chelator deferiprone (DFP) did not correct the anemia or the splenomegaly.

 PTG-300s Development Program 
 PTG-300 is being manufactured and formulated to support completion of pre-clinical GLP toxicology, genotoxicity, and safety pharmacology studies, which will enable us to complete a single ascending dose Phase 1 clinical trial in normal healthy volunteers in 2017. This study will evaluate safety/ tolerability, PK and PD-based POC through the evaluation of PTG-300s effect on serum iron levels. 
OUR PEPTIDE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM 
 Our proprietary technology platform has been successfully applied to a diverse set of biological targets that has led to several pre-clinical and clinical-stage peptide-based NCEs, including our only clinical-stage product candidate PTG-100, and our other product candidates in pre-clinical studies PTG-200 and PTG-300, for a variety of clinical indications. Our platform is comprised of a series of tools and methods, including a combination of molecular design, phage display, oral stability, medicinal chemistry, and in vivo pharmacology approaches. 
 The platform is used to develop potential drug candidates: (i) using the structure of a target, when available, (ii) when no target structure exists, or (iii) from publically disclosed peptide starting points. In a structure-based approach, our proprietary molecular design software and structural database of several thousand constrained peptides, termed VectrixTM, are screened to identify suitable scaffolds which form the basis of designing and constructing the first set of phage or chemical libraries. The initial hits are identified by either panning or screening such libraries, respectively. When structural information is unavailable for a target, hits are identified by panning a set of 34 proprietary cluster-based phage libraries consisting of millions of constrained peptides. Once the hits are identified, they are optimized using a set of peptide, peptide mimetic and medicinal chemistry techniques that include the incorporation of new or manipulation of existing cyclization-constraints, as well as natural or unnatural amino acids and chemical conjugation or acylation techniques. These techniques are applied to optimize potency, selectivity, stability, exposure and ultimately efficacy. For oral stability, a series of in vitro and ex vivo oral-stability assays that portray the chemical and metabolic barriers a peptide will encounter as it transits the GI tract are used to identify metabolically labile spots in the peptides. Such sites form the focus of medicinal-chemistry based optimization to engineer oral stability. Finally, various in vivo pharmacology tools are then used to quantify peptide exposure in relevant GI organs and tissues. The data can then be used to optimize required GI exposure and ultimately in vivo efficacy. 
 The key foundations of the platform include: 
 Molecular design tools and large database of constrained scaffolds 
 Through advances in genomics, molecular biology and structural genomic initiatives there has been an explosion in the number of known structures of potential new drug targets, including PPI targets. In particular, constrained peptides have the required surface complexity to match or complement the large flat surfaces of PPI targets to provide potent and selective drug candidates. We believe existing commercial molecular design software is not suitable, as it has been developed to identify small molecules that plug cavities of enzymes and do not bind to PPI targets. 
 We have developed a database of all known structures of a sub-class of constrained peptides, known as disulfide-rich peptides (DRPs). We have collected approximately 4,500 DRP scaffolds that are found throughout nature, ranging from single cell organisms to humans. We have created a proprietary molecular design environment, called VectrixTM. A pattern matching algorithm within VectrixTM allows the selection of an appropriately stable DRP scaffold using the structure of the target of interest. This molecular design process is used to identify constrained peptides as starting points for hit discovery, which are ultimately optimized into potent, selective peptides against targets which are not amenable to small molecule drug discovery. 
 Phage display techniques and cluster libraries 
 Phage display may be used to discover the original hit based on VectrixTM-derived scaffolds, optimize existing hits, or to identify hits against those targets in which no structural information exists. For the latter 
 
17 
 
Index to Financial Statements
  targets, a series of pre-existing phage libraries, termed cluster libraries, are used for hit discovery. This includes 20 proprietary libraries of structurally diverse DRPs that sample greater than 85% of their known structural diversity and 14 proprietary libraries that sample different protein loop geometries. Collectively these libraries provide immense potential for discovering hits at diverse targets as they are based on natural-DRP scaffolds with these characteristics. 
 Oral stability and in vitro and ex vivo assays 
 The GI tract provides a set of chemical and metabolic barriers that hinder the development of oral therapeutic agents. We have developed numerous in vitro and ex vivo systems that profile peptide candidates for their stability features needed for oral delivery, GI restriction, and transit through the entire GI tract. This includes profiling for chemical stability, specifically pH and redox stability, and metabolic stability against proteases and other enzymes that are either of human or microbial origin. 
 These in vitro assays identify metabolic weak spots of peptides, which can then be stabilized by peptidic and peptidomimetic modifications without losing potency. 
 Medicinal peptide chemistry 
 We have significant expertise in optimizing potency, selectivity, oral stability and exposure of constrained peptides using a combination of peptide-cyclization, natural and unnatural amino acids, and various conjugation and acylation techniques. With respect to PTG-300, hit discovery and optimization relies exclusively on medicinal chemistry, with no phage display, to develop potent and selective injectable candidates with enhanced exposure in blood. For other targets, such as the discovery of PTG-100 and PTG-200, phage display is tightly coupled to medicinal chemistry and oral stability techniques to develop potent, selective and oral molecules that are GI-restricted. 
 In vivo pharmacology tools for GI restriction 
 When developing oral, GI-restricted constrained peptides, we correlate efficacy with potency and level of GI tissue compartment exposure. We have developed the required expertise and know-how to build PK and PD relationships to optimize physicochemical features of constrained peptides such that they are minimally absorbed and have the required degree of GI tissue compartment exposure over the required duration of time to achieve efficacy. This involves examining constrained peptide concentrations in various GI tissue compartments, blood, urine, and feces when delivered orally in rodents. In this fashion, we can understand the degree of tissue targeting, GI restriction and oral stability that is required to achieve efficacy. 
 Future Applications of our Platform 
 We believe we have built a versatile, well-validated and unique discovery platform. For example, this peptide technology platform has been used to develop product candidates for diverse target classes including G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), ion channels, transporters and cytokines for a variety of therapeutic areas. In the future we may tackle other GI diseases and expand our delivery techniques to include other organ/tissue systems, such as the lung and eye, which will provide potential opportunities to pursue a variety of diseases. In addition, the gut may communicate with the immune, central nervous, and endocrine systems, providing the potential of our GI-restricted approach to treat metabolic, cancer and cardiovascular diseases. Lastly, we intend to progress our platform to achieve systemic bioavailability with peptides, thereby enabling us to address systemic diseases.

 Material Agreements 
 Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Zealand Pharma A/S 
 In June 2012, we entered into a Research Collaboration and License Agreement with Zealand Pharma A/S (Zealand) to identify, optimize and develop novel DRPs to discover a hepcidin mimetic. Under the terms of the agreement, Zealand made an upfront payment and also funded the collaboration. 
 In October 2013, Zealand decided to abandon the collaboration program and, pursuant to the terms of the agreement, we elected to assume the responsibility for the development and commercialization of the product. Upon Zealands abandonment, Zealand assigned to us certain intellectual property arising from the collaboration and also granted us an exclusive license to certain background intellectual property rights of Zealand that relate to the products assumed by us. Upon the nomination of PTG-300 as a development candidate, we owed Zealand a payment of $250,000. If we initiate a Phase 1 clinical trial for PTG-300, we will pay Zealand an additional $250,000. We have the right, but not the obligation, to further develop and commercialize the products and, if we successfully develop and commercialize PTG-300 without a partner, we will pay to Zealand up to an additional aggregate of $128.5 million for the achievement of certain development, regulatory and sales milestone events. In addition, we will pay to Zealand a low single digit royalty on worldwide net sales of the product until the later of ten years from the first commercial sale of the product or the expiration of the last patent covering the product. Due to Zealands abandonment of the collaboration program and our assumption of the responsibility for the development and commercialization of the product, the agreement has terminated other than with respect to our potential milestone payments and royalty to Zealand. 
 Letter Agreement with Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation 
 In May 2013, in connection with our sale of Series B Stock, we entered into a letter agreement with Johnson & Johnson Development Corporation (JJDC), as amended on April 19, 2016, pursuant to which we granted JJDC a right of first negotiation with respect to the consummation of any proposed sale, transfer, license, commercialization or distribution arrangement (each, a Transaction) of our inventions, developments, patents, patent applications, know-how or other proprietary rights or products controlled by us that are necessary for the research, development or commercialization of the PTG-100, PTG-200 and IL-13 programs (each, a Program) other than an acquisition, merger, consolidation, or sale of substantially all of our assets. The letter agreement does not apply with respect to the PTG-300 program. The term of JJDCs right of first negotiation commenced in May 2014 and terminates, with respect to any Program, 60 days after our filing of an IND (or the foreign equivalent), with respect to each Program (such right of first negotiation period, the ROFN Period). On November 1, 2015, JJDC waived their right of first negotiation with respect to PTG-100. Neither we, nor JJDC, have an obligation to enter into a Transaction during the ROFN Period. We are not currently pursuing an IL-13 Program. 
 In the event that we receive a bona fide term sheet for a Program, we are obligated to notify JJDC of such offer (but not the terms thereof) and JJDC has a period of 30 days to notify us of exercise of its right to negotiate for a Transaction with JJDC. Following expiration of the ROFN Period with respect to any remaining Program, we are required to deliver to JJDC certain information relating to such Program, including pre-clinical results, manufacturing protocols and other information relevant to the evaluation of such Program, as determined by us. For a period of 60 days following delivery of such information (the Exclusive Negotiation Period), we are required to negotiate in good faith and exclusively with JJDC to enter into a Transaction with JJDC with respect to such Program and we are not permitted to enter into negotiations with any third party with respect to a Transaction involving such Program that would impair the ability of JJDC to exercise its rights under the letter agreement. 
 Finally, for a period of 180 days following expiration of an Exclusive Negotiation Period for a Program (the Tail Period), we are not permitted to enter into a Transaction with respect to such Program with a third party on terms that contain upfront payments and pre-launch milestones (valued on a risk-adjusted basis) that are inferior in total economic value to those that JJDC and its affiliates last offered to us, to the extent any such offer was previously made by JJDC or its affiliates to us.

 JJDCs right of first negotiation with respect to any Program that has not earlier expired or been waived by JJDC will terminate upon the sale, transfer or other disposition by us of all or substantially all of our assets, our consummation of a merger or consolidation with or into another entity, or the transfer (whether by merger, consolidation, equity financing, or otherwise), in one transaction or a series of related transactions, to a person or group of affiliated persons a majority or more of our outstanding voting stock (or the surviving or acquiring entity). 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. While we believe that our product candidates, technology, knowledge and experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face competition from established and emerging pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions, among others. There are no approved oral peptide-based a4b7 integrins and IL-23 based product candidates for IBD. 
 We believe our principal competition in the treatment of IBD will come from companies with approved agents in the following therapeutic classes, among others: 
 

 | Infused a4ß7 antibody: Takeda Pharmaceutical Company
--+-----------------------------------------------------


 | Infused IL-23 and IL-12 antibody: Johnson & Johnson
--+----------------------------------------------------


 | Injectable or infused TNF-a antibody: AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson, Amgen, Pfizer, UCB S.A.

 We are also aware of several companies developing therapeutic product candidates for the treatment of IBD, including, but not limited to AbbVie, Allergan, Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., AstraZeneca, Biogen, Boehringer Ingelheim (adalimumab biosimilar in Pre-Registration), Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene (mongersen sodium and ozanimod hydrochloride in Phase 3 clinical trials), Eli Lilly and Company, Galapagos, Gilead, Lycera Corp., Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation, Pfizer (tofacitinib citrate in a Phase 3 clinical trial), Roche/Genentech (etrolizumab in a Phase 3 clinical trial), Samsung Bioepis (adalimumab biosimilar in Pre-Registration), Sandoz (adalimumab biosimilar in Phase 3), Shire, and UCB S.A. 
 We believe our principal competition in the treatment of iron overload disorders, such as ß-Thalassemia, HH and SCD, will come from other pipeline products being developed by companies such as Acceleron (luspatercept in a Phase 3 clinical trial), bluebird bio (LentiGlobin in a Phase 3 clinical trial), Bristol-Myers Squibb, Emmaus Medical (glutamine in pre-registration), Gilead, Global Blood Therapeutics, Inc., La Jolla Pharmaceutical, and Novartis AG, among others. We believe competition will also include approved iron chelation therapies that have been developed by Novartis AG and Apotex, among others.

Patent applications directed to PTG-300 composition of matter and uses thereof, if issued from the pending patent applications and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity or other governmental fees are paid, are expected to expire in March 2034 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions). We expect other patents and patent applications in this portfolio, if issued, and if the appropriate maintenance, renewal, annuity, or other governmental fees are paid, to expire from March 2034 to December 2036 (worldwide, excluding possible patent term extensions). 
Other 
 We also license patents and patent applications directed to processes and methods related to our technology platform. These patents have issued in the United States and other major jurisdictions, including Australia and Europe and are expected to expire between September 2019 and February 2023. Material aspects of our technology platform are protected by trade secrets and confidentiality agreements. 
 In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of pre-clinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We believe that our focus and expertise will help us develop products based on our proprietary intellectual property. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patents term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. 
 The term of a patent that covers an FDA approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple products, it can only be extended based on one product. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a new drug application (NDA), we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use. 
 Trade Secrets 
 We rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology, particularly in relation to our technology platform. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our

  consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. For more information, please see Item 1A Risk FactorsRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property. 
Manufacturing 
 We contract with third parties for the manufacturing of all of our product candidates, including PTG-100, PTG-200, and PTG-300, for pre-clinical and clinical studies, and intend to continue to do so in the future. We do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and we have no plans to build any owned clinical or commercial scale manufacturing capabilities. We believe that the use of contract manufacturing organization (CMOs) eliminates the need for us to directly invest in manufacturing facilities, equipment and additional staff. Although we rely on contract manufacturers, our personnel and consultants have extensive manufacturing experience overseeing CMOs. We regularly consider second source or back-up manufacturers for both active pharmaceutical ingredient and drug product manufacturing. To date, our third-party manufacturers have met the manufacturing requirements for the product candidates in a timely manner. We expect third-party manufacturers to be capable of providing sufficient quantities of our product candidates to meet anticipated full-scale commercial demands but we have not assessed these capabilities beyond the supply of clinical materials to date. We currently engage CMOs on a fee for services basis based on our current development plans. We plan to identify CMOs and enter into longer term contracts or commitments as we move our product candidates into Phase 3 clinical trials. We believe there are alternate sources of manufacturing that have been and could be engaged and enabled to satisfy its clinical and commercial requirements, however we cannot guarantee that identifying and establishing alternative relationships with such sources will be successful, cost effective, or completed on a timely basis without significant delay in the development or commercialization of our product candidates. 
Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates. 
U.S. Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDAs refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

 | completion of pre-clinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDAs GLP regulations;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
23 
 
Index to Financial Statements
 
 | approval by an independent institutional review board (IRB) at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drugs identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | FDA review and approval of the NDA.
--+------------------------------------

Pre-clinical Studies 
 Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some pre-clinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND (or equivalent submission ex-US). In addition, an IRB or ethics committee (EC) at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
 

 | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
24 
 
Index to Financial Statements
 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB or EC can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRBs requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
Marketing Approval 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the pre-clinical and clinical studies, together with detailed information relating to the products chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of filing of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a filing decision. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003 (PREA), as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the products continued safety, quality and purity. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
 
25 
 
Index to Financial Statements
 After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or pre-clinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDAs satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drugs safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 Orphan Designation 
 The FDA may grant orphan designation to drugs or biologics intended to treat a rare disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or if it affects more than 200,000 individuals in the United States, there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and marketing the product for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States. Orphan designation must be requested before submitting a NDA or Biologics License Application (BLA). After the FDA grants orphan designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 In the United States, orphan designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. In addition, if a product receives the first FDA approval for the indication for which it has orphan designation, the product is entitled to orphan exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other application to market the same product for the same indication for a period of seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority over the product with orphan exclusivity or where the manufacturer with orphan exclusivity is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the approved orphan designated product. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitors product for the same indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling 
 
26 
 
Index to Financial Statements
  claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the products safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
 

 | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of our product candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which the cost of such products will be covered and adequately reimbursed by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed health care organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage and/or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services by challenging the prices and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other therapies, they may not cover our products after approval as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products on a profitable basis. 
 
27 
 
Index to Financial Statements
 There is no uniform policy requirement for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. The coverage determination process can be a time-consuming and costly process that may require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained or applied consistently. Even if reimbursement is provided, market acceptance of our products may be adversely affected if the amount of payment for our products proves to be unprofitable for health care providers or less profitable than alternative treatments, or if administrative burdens make our products less desirable to use. 
 In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, collectively referred to as the ACA, enacted in March 2010, has had and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the health care industry. The ACA, among other things, imposes a significant annual fee on certain companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The ACA also increased the Medicaid rebate rate and expanded the rebate program to include Medicaid managed care organizations. It also contains substantial new provisions intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of health care spending, enhance remedies against health care fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for the health care industry, impose new taxes and fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers, and impose additional health policy reforms, any or all of which may affect our business. Since its enactment, there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, and there may be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future. The ACA is likely to continue the downward pressure on pharmaceutical pricing, and may also increase our regulatory burdens and operating costs. 
 Other legislative changes have also been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 resulted in aggregate reductions in Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in 2013 and, following passage of the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, will stay in effect through 2025 unless additional Congressional action is taken. Additionally, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several types of providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other health care funding. 
 It is uncertain whether and how future legislation, whether domestic or foreign, could affect prospects for our product candidates or what actions foreign, federal, state, or private payors for health care treatment and services may take in response to any such health care reform proposals or legislation. Adoption of price controls and other cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures reforms may prevent or limit our ability to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates. 
 Other Health Care Laws and Compliance Requirements 
 We will also be subject to health care regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business once our products are approved. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic health care transactions and protects the 
 
28 
 
Index to Financial Statements
  security and privacy of protected health information. Criminal health care fraud statutes under HIPAA also prohibits persons and entities from knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any health care benefit program, including private payors, or knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for health care benefits, items or services; the federal health care programs Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal health care programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalties laws that prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to have a false claim paid; and the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or Childrens Health Insurance Program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. 
 The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the aforementioned federal anti-kickback and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. We may be subject to state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts. In addition, we may be subject to reporting requirements under state transparency laws, as well as state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the industrys voluntary compliance guidelines and the applicable compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government that otherwise restricts certain payments that may be made to health care providers and entities. 
 Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of available statutory and regulatory exceptions, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. If we or our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, individual imprisonment, disgorgement, exclusion of products from reimbursement under U.S. federal or state health care programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. 
 Government Regulation Outside of the United States 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and any commercial sales and distribution of our products. 
 Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. 
 The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
 If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

 The requirements for conducting clinical trials in Australia, where we anticipate conducting Phase 1 trials for PTG-200 and PTG-300, are as follows: 
 Conducting clinical trials for therapeutic drug candidates in Australia is subject to regulation by Australian governmental entities. Approval for inclusion in the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods (ARTG) is required before a pharmaceutical drug product may be marketed in Australia. 
 Typically, the process of obtaining approval of a new therapeutic drug product for inclusion in the ARTG requires compilation of clinical trial data. Clinical trials conducted using unapproved therapeutic goods in Australia, being those which have not yet been evaluated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) for quality, safety and efficacy must occur pursuant to either the CTN or Clinical Trial Exemption (CTX), process. 
 The CTN process broadly involves: 
 

 | completion of pre-clinical laboratory and animal testing;
--+----------------------------------------------------------


 | submission to a Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) of all material relating to the proposed clinical trial, including the trial protocol. The TGA does not review any data relating to the clinical trial;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | final approval for the conduct of the clinical trial by the institution or organization at which the clinical trial will be conducted (Approving Authority), having due regard to the advice from the HREC; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | notification of the clinical trial to the TGA.
--+-----------------------------------------------

 The CTX process broadly involves: 
 

 | submission of an application to conduct a clinical trial to the TGA for evaluation and comment;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | a sponsor cannot commence a CTX trial until written advice has been received from the TGA regarding the application and approval for the conduct of the trial has been obtained from an ethics committee and the institution at which the trial will be conducted; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | receipt of written advice from the TGA regarding the application.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


 | receipt of approval for the conduct of the trial from an ethics committee and the institution at which the trial will be conducted.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In each case, it is required that: 
 

 | adequate and well-controlled clinical trials demonstrate the quality, safety and efficacy of the therapeutic product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | evidence is compiled which demonstrates that the manufacture of the therapeutic drug product complies with the principles of cGMP;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | manufacturing and clinical data is derived to submit to the Australian Committee on Prescription Medicines, which makes recommendations to the TGA as to whether or not to grant approval to include the therapeutic drug product in the ARTG; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | an ultimate decision is made by the TGA whether to include the therapeutic drug product in the ARTG.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Pre-clinical studies include laboratory evaluation of the therapeutic drug product as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the drug. The results of the pre-clinical studies form part of the materials submitted to the HREC in the case of a CTN trial and part of the application to the TGA in the case of a CTX trial. 
 Clinical trials involve administering the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of a qualified principal investigator. The TGA has developed guidelines for a CTN. Under the CTN process, all material relating to the proposed trial is submitted directly to the HREC of each institution at which the trial is to be conducted. An HREC is an independent review committee set up under guidelines of the 
 
30 
 
Index to Financial Statements
  Australian National Health and Medical Research Council. The role of an HREC is to ensure the protection of rights, safety and wellbeing of human subjects involved in a clinical trial by, among other things, reviewing, approving and providing continuing review of trial protocols and amendments, and of the methods and material to be used in obtaining and documenting informed consent of the trial subjects. The TGA is formally notified by submission of a CTN application but does not review the safety of the drug or any aspect of the proposed clinical trial. The approving authority of each institution gives the final approval for the conduct of the clinical trial, having due regard to advice from the HREC.

 The standards for clinical research in Australia are set by the TGA and the National Health and Medical Research Council, and compliance with GCP is mandatory. Guidelines, such as those promulgated by the International Conference on Harmonization of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH), are required across all fields, including those related to pharmaceutical quality, nonclinical and clinical data requirements and study designs. The basic requirements for preclinical data to support a first-in-human study under ICH guidelines are applicable in Australia. Requirements related to adverse event reporting in Australia are similar to those required in other major jurisdictions.
