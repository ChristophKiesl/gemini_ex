ITEM 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------

Development of Business
 Suburban Propane Partners, L.P. (the “Partnership”), a publicly traded Delaware limited partnership, is a nationwide marketer and distributor of a diverse array of products meeting the energy needs of our customers.  We specialize in the distribution of propane, renewable propane, fuel oil and refined fuels, as well as the marketing of natural gas and electricity in deregulated markets and are an investor in low carbon fuel alternatives.  In support of our core marketing and distribution operations, we install and service a variety of home comfort equipment, particularly in the areas of heating and ventilation.  We believe, based on LP/Gas Magazine dated February 2021, that we are the third-largest retail marketer of propane in the United States, measured by retail gallons sold in the calendar year 2020.  As of September 25, 2021, we were serving the energy needs of approximately 1.0 million residential, commercial, industrial and agricultural customers through approximately 700 locations in 41 states with operations principally concentrated in the east and west coast regions of the United States, as well as portions of the midwest region of the United States and Alaska.  We sold approximately 419.8 million gallons of propane and 24.0 million gallons of fuel oil and refined fuels to retail customers during the year ended September 25, 2021. Together with our predecessor companies, we have been continuously engaged in the retail propane business since 1928.
 We conduct our business principally through Suburban Propane, L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, which operates our propane business and assets (the “Operating Partnership”), and its direct and indirect subsidiaries.  Our general partner, and the general partner of our Operating Partnership, is Suburban Energy Services Group LLC (the “General Partner”), a Delaware limited liability company whose sole member is the Chief Executive Officer of the Partnership.  Since October 19, 2006, the General Partner has no economic interest in either the Partnership or the Operating Partnership (which means that the General Partner is not entitled to any cash distributions of either partnership, nor to any cash payment upon the liquidation of either partnership, nor any other economic rights in either partnership) other than as a holder of 784 Common Units of the Partnership.  Additionally, under the Third Amended and Restated Agreement of Limited Partnership (the “Partnership Agreement”) of the Partnership, there are no incentive distribution rights for the benefit of the General Partner.  The Partnership owns (directly and indirectly) all of the limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership.  The Common Units represent 100% of the limited partner interests in the Partnership.
 Direct and indirect subsidiaries of the Operating Partnership include Suburban Heating Oil Partners, LLC, which owns and operates the assets of our fuel oil and refined fuels business; Agway Energy Services, LLC, which owns and operates the assets of our natural gas and electricity business; and Suburban Sales and Service, Inc., which conducts a portion of our service work and appliance and parts business.  Our fuel oil and refined fuels, natural gas and electricity and services businesses are structured as either limited liability companies that are treated as corporations or corporate entities (collectively referred to as “Corporate Entities”) and, as such, are subject to corporate level income tax.
 During fiscal 2020, our Operating Partnership acquired a 39% equity interest in Oberon Fuels, Inc. (“Oberon”), which is a development-stage producer of an innovative, low carbon renewable dimethyl ether (“rDME”) transportation fuel.  Oberon is focused on the research and development of practical and affordable pathways to zero-emission transportation through its proprietary production process. Oberon's rDME fuel is a cost-effective, low-carbon, zero-soot alternative to petroleum diesel, and when blended with propane can significantly reduce its carbon intensity.  In addition, rDME is also a cost-effective carrier for hydrogen, making it easy to deliver this renewable fuel for the growing hydrogen fuel cell industry.
 Suburban Energy Finance Corp., a direct 100%-owned subsidiary of the Partnership, was formed on November 26, 2003 to serve as co-issuer, jointly and severally with the Partnership, of the Partnership’s senior notes. Suburban Energy Finance Corp. has nominal assets and conducts no business operations.
 In this Annual Report, unless otherwise indicated, the terms “Partnership,” “Suburban,” “we,” “us,” and “our” are used to refer to Suburban Propane Partners, L.P. and its consolidated subsidiaries, including the Operating Partnership. The Partnership and the Operating Partnership commenced operations in March 1996 in connection with the Partnership’s initial public offering of Common Units.

 Our Strategy
 Our business strategy is to deliver increasing value to our unitholders through initiatives, both internal and external, that are geared toward achieving sustainable profitable growth. In advancing this strategy, we consider the interests of our employees, customers and the communities in which we operate, as exemplified by our three corporate pillars; Go Green with Suburban Propane, SuburbanCares, and Suburban Commitment to Excellence. The following are key elements of our strategy:
 Strategic Investments in the Continued Build Out of Our Renewable Energy Platform. The economy-wide energy transition to a low carbon world offers an opportunity for us to realize top-line organic growth through advancing the significant air quality and climate benefits of traditional propane, and through continued investments in the next generation of even cleaner and lower carbon renewable energy products. This dual approach has driven our engagement in particularly hard to abate segments, including heavy duty transportation and rural heating and cooking; and our investments in renewable propane and renewable dimethyl ether, and our ongoing pursuit of additional emerging renewable energy technologies. Through our minority-owned subsidiary, Oberon, we are also supporting research into the development of a renewable hydrogen solution given the exceptional hydrogen carrier characteristics of rDME and our ability to leverage existing assets for the safe storage and transportation of our current product offerings. As a company with a more than 90-year legacy of being a trusted and reliable provider of energy and exceptional customer service, our goal is to lead the propane industry in the transition to a renewable energy future that provides value to our customers, unitholders, employees, and the communities we serve in a way that ensures we can thrive in a carbon constrained world for the next 90 years.
 Growing Our Customer Base by Improving Customer Retention and Acquiring New Customers. We set clear objectives to focus our employees on seeking new customers and retaining existing customers by providing highly responsive customer service. We believe that customer satisfaction is a critical factor in the growth and success of our operations. “Our Business is Customer Satisfaction” is one of our core operating philosophies. We measure and reward our customer service centers based on a combination of profitability of the individual customer service center and net customer growth. We have made investments in training our people both on techniques to provide exceptional customer service to our existing customer base, as well as advanced sales training focused on growing our customer base.
 Selective Acquisitions of Complementary Businesses or Assets. We supplement our organic customer base growth and retention initiatives with selective acquisitions of high-quality propane businesses in strategic markets, as well as identifying and fostering new market expansion efforts to establish or extend our presence and expand market share.  Our acquisition strategy is to focus on businesses with a relatively steady or predictable cash flow that will extend our presence in strategically attractive markets, complement our existing business segments or provide an opportunity to diversify our operations. We are very patient, disciplined and deliberate in evaluating both traditional and renewable energy acquisition opportunities.
 Internal Focus on Driving Operating Efficiencies, Right-Sizing Our Cost Structure and Enhancing Our Customer Mix. We focus internally on improving the efficiency of our existing operations, customer support, managing our cost structure, improving our customer mix, and hardening our cybersecurity defenses. Through investments in our technology infrastructure, we continue to seek to improve operating efficiencies and the return on assets employed. We have developed a streamlined operating footprint and management structure to facilitate effective resource planning and decision making. Our internal efforts are particularly focused in the areas of route optimization, forecasting customer usage, customer onboarding and support, inventory control, cash management and customer tracking. We will continue to pursue operational efficiencies while staying focused on providing exceptional service to our customer base. Our systems platform is advanced and scalable and we will seek to leverage that technology for enhanced routing, forecasting and customer relationship management.
 Selective Disposition of Non-Strategic Assets. We continuously evaluate our existing facilities to identify opportunities to optimize our return on assets by selectively divesting operations in slower growing markets, generating proceeds that can be reinvested in markets that present greater opportunities for growth. Our objective is to maximize the growth and profit potential of all of our assets.
 The Three Pillars of the Suburban Propane Experience. We execute the foregoing strategy with support from our three corporate pillars:

Business Segments
 As described below, we manage and evaluate our operations in four operating segments, three of which are reportable segments: Propane, Fuel Oil and Refined Fuels and Natural Gas and Electricity.  See the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report for financial information about our business segments.
Propane
 Propane is a by‑product of natural gas processing and petroleum refining.  It is a clean burning energy source recognized for its transportability and ease of use relative to alternative forms of stand‑alone energy sources.  Propane use falls into three broad categories:

• | residential and commercial applications;
--+-----------------------------------------


• | industrial applications; and
--+-----------------------------


• | agricultural uses.
--+-------------------

 In the residential and commercial markets, propane is used primarily for space heating, water heating, clothes drying and cooking.  Industrial customers use propane generally as a motor fuel to power over‑the‑road vehicles, forklifts and stationary engines, to fire furnaces, as a cutting gas and in other process applications.  In the agricultural market, propane is primarily used for tobacco curing, crop drying, poultry brooding and weed control.
 Propane is extracted from natural gas or oil wellhead gas at processing plants or separated from crude oil during the refining process.  It is normally transported and stored in a liquid state under moderate pressure or refrigeration for ease of handling in shipping and distribution.  When the pressure is released or the temperature is increased, propane becomes a flammable gas that is colorless and odorless, although an odorant is added to allow its detection.  Propane is non-toxic, clean burning and, when consumed, produces virtually no particulate matter or sulfur dioxide (contributors to climate change).
 Product Distribution and Marketing
 We distribute propane through a nationwide retail distribution network consisting of approximately 700 locations in 41 states as of September 25, 2021.  Our operations are principally concentrated in the east and west coast regions of the United States, as well as portions of the midwest region of the United States and Alaska.  As of September 25, 2021, we serviced approximately 855,000 propane customers.  Typically, our customer service centers are located in suburban and rural areas where natural gas is not readily available. Generally, these customer service centers consist of an office, appliance showroom, warehouse and service facilities, with one or more 18,000 to 30,000 gallon storage tanks on the premises.  Approximately 60% of our residential customers receive their propane supply through an automatic delivery system.  These deliveries are scheduled through proprietary computer technology, based upon each customer’s historical consumption patterns and prevailing weather conditions.  Additionally, we offer our customers a budget payment plan whereby the customer’s estimated annual propane purchases and service contracts are paid for in a series of estimated equal monthly payments over a twelve-month period.  From our customer service centers, we also sell, install and service heating and cooking appliances to customers who purchase propane from us and, at some locations, propane fuel systems for motor vehicles.
 We sell propane primarily to seven customer markets: residential, commercial, industrial (including engine fuel), government, agricultural, other retail users and wholesale.  Approximately 91% of the propane gallons sold by us in fiscal 2021 was to retail customers: 44% of those propane gallons to residential customers, 36% to commercial customers, 9% to industrial customers, 4% to government customers, 4% to agricultural customers and 3% to other retail users.  The balance of approximately 9% of the propane 
 
3


gallons sold by us in fiscal 2021 were for risk management activities and wholesale customers.  No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our propane revenues during fiscal 2021.
 Retail deliveries of propane are usually made to customers by means of bobtail and rack trucks.  Propane is pumped from bobtail trucks, which have capacities typically ranging from 2,400 gallons to 3,500 gallons of propane, into a stationary storage tank on the customers’ premises.  The capacity of these storage tanks ranges from approximately 100 gallons to approximately 1,200 gallons, with a typical tank having a capacity of 300 to 400 gallons.  As is common in the propane industry, we own a significant portion of the storage tanks located on our customers’ premises.  We also deliver propane to retail customers in portable cylinders, which typically have a capacity of 5 to 35 gallons.  When these cylinders are delivered to customers, empty cylinders are refilled in place or transported for replenishment at our distribution locations.  We also deliver propane to certain other bulk end users in larger trucks known as transports, which have an average capacity of approximately 9,000 gallons.  End users receiving transport deliveries include industrial customers, large‑scale heating accounts, such as local gas utilities that use propane as a supplemental fuel to meet peak load delivery requirements, and large agricultural accounts that use propane for crop drying.
 Supply
 Our propane supply is purchased from approximately 40 wholesalers at approximately 160 supply points located throughout the United States and Canada.  We make purchases primarily under one-year agreements that are subject to annual renewal, and also purchase propane on the spot market.  Supply contracts generally provide for pricing in accordance with posted prices at the time of delivery or the current prices established at major storage points, and some contracts include a pricing formula that typically is based on prevailing market prices.  Some of these agreements provide maximum and minimum seasonal purchase guidelines. Propane is generally transported from refineries, pipeline terminals, storage facilities (including our storage facility in Elk Grove, California) and coastal terminals to our customer service centers by a combination of common carriers, owner‑operators and railroad tank cars.  See Item 2 of this Annual Report.
 Historically, supplies of propane have been readily available from our supply sources. Although we make no assurance regarding the availability of supplies of propane in the future, we currently expect to be able to secure adequate supplies during fiscal 2022.  During fiscal 2021, Crestwood Equity Partners L.P. (“Crestwood”) and Targa Liquids Marketing and Trade LLC (“Targa”) provided approximately 29% and 16% of our total propane purchases, respectively.  No other single supplier accounted for 10% or more of our propane purchases in fiscal 2021.  The availability of our propane supply is dependent on several factors, including the severity of winter weather, the magnitude of competing demands for available supply (e.g., crop drying and exports), the availability of transportation and storage infrastructure and the price and availability of competing fuels, such as natural gas and fuel oil.  We believe that if supplies from Crestwood or Targa were interrupted, we would be able to secure adequate propane supplies from other sources without a material disruption of our operations.  Nevertheless, the cost of acquiring and transporting such propane might be higher and, at least on a short-term basis, our margins could be affected.  Approximately 85% of our total propane purchases were from domestic suppliers in fiscal 2021.
 We seek to reduce the effect of propane price volatility on our product costs and to help ensure the availability of propane during periods of short supply.  We enter into propane forward options and swap agreements with third parties to purchase and sell propane at fixed prices in the future.  These activities are monitored by our senior management through enforcement of our Hedging and Risk Management Policy.  See Items 7 and 7A of this Annual Report.
 We own and operate a large propane storage facility in Elk Grove, California.  We also operate smaller storage facilities in other locations throughout the Unites States and have rights to use storage facilities in additional locations. These storage facilities enable us to buy and store large quantities of propane particularly during periods of low demand, which generally occur during the summer months.  This practice helps ensure a more secure supply of propane during periods of intense demand or price instability.  As of September 25, 2021, the majority of the storage capacity at our facility in Elk Grove, California was leased to third parties.
 Competition
 According to the US Census Bureau’s 2019 American Community Survey, propane ranks as the third most important source of residential energy in the nation, with about 5% of all households using propane as their primary space heating fuel.  This level has not changed materially over the previous two decades.  As an energy source, propane competes primarily with natural gas, electricity and fuel oil, principally on the basis of price, availability and portability.
 Propane is more expensive than natural gas on an equivalent British Thermal Unit (“BTU”) basis in locations serviced by natural gas, but it is an alternative or supplement to natural gas in rural and suburban areas where natural gas is unavailable or portability of product is required.  Historically, the expansion of natural gas into traditional propane markets has been inhibited by the 
 
4


capital costs required to expand pipeline and retail distribution systems, and in some territories, geological and activist challenges.  The increasing availability of natural gas extracted from shale deposits in the United States may accelerate the extension of natural gas pipelines in the future.  Although the extension of natural gas pipelines to previously unserved geographic areas tends to displace propane distribution in those areas, we believe new opportunities for propane sales may arise as new neighborhoods are developed in geographically remote areas.  
 Propane has some relative advantages over other energy sources.  For example, in certain geographic areas, propane is generally less expensive to use than electricity for space heating, water heating, clothes drying and cooking.  Utilization of fuel oil is geographically limited (primarily in the northeast), and even in that region, propane and fuel oil are not significant competitors because of the cost of converting from one source to the other.
 In addition to competing with suppliers of other energy sources, our propane operations compete with other retail propane distributors. The retail propane industry is highly fragmented and competition generally occurs on a local basis with other large full-service multi-state propane marketers, thousands of smaller local independent marketers and farm cooperatives. Based on industry statistics contained in the 2019 Annual Retail Propane Sales Report, as published by the Propane Education & Research Council in December 2020, and LP/Gas Magazine dated February 2020, the ten largest retailers, including us, account for approximately 31% of total retail sales of propane in the United States. Each of our customer service centers operates in its own competitive environment because retail marketers tend to locate in close proximity to customers in order to lower the cost of providing service.  Our typical customer service center has an effective marketing radius of approximately 50 miles, although in certain areas the marketing radius may be extended by one or more satellite offices.  Most of our customer service centers compete with five or more marketers or distributors at any point in time.
 Fuel Oil and Refined Fuels
 Product Distribution and Marketing
 We market and distribute fuel oil, kerosene, diesel fuel and gasoline to approximately 35,000 residential and commercial customers primarily in the northeast region of the United States.  Sales of fuel oil and refined fuels for fiscal 2021 amounted to 24.0 million gallons. Approximately 67% of the fuel oil and refined fuels gallons sold by us in fiscal 2021 were to residential customers, principally for home heating, 7% were to commercial customers, and 7% to other users.  Sales of diesel and gasoline accounted for the remaining 19% of total volumes sold in this segment during fiscal 2021.  Fuel oil has a more limited use, compared to propane, and is used almost exclusively for space and water heating in residential and commercial buildings.  We sell diesel fuel and gasoline to commercial and industrial customers for use primarily to operate motor vehicles.
 Approximately 45% of our fuel oil customers receive their fuel oil under an automatic delivery system.  These deliveries are scheduled through proprietary computer technology, based upon each customer’s historical consumption patterns and prevailing weather conditions.  Additionally, we offer our customers a budget payment plan whereby the customer’s estimated annual fuel oil purchases are paid for in a series of estimated equal monthly payments over a twelve-month period.  From our customer service centers, we also sell, install and service heating equipment to customers who purchase fuel oil from us.
 Deliveries of fuel oil are usually made to customers by means of tankwagon trucks, which have capacities ranging from 2,500 gallons to 3,000 gallons.  Fuel oil is pumped from the tankwagon truck into a stationary storage tank that is located on the customer’s premises, which is owned by the customer.  The capacity of customer storage tanks ranges from approximately 275 gallons to approximately 1,000 gallons. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our fuel oil and refined fuels revenues during fiscal 2021.
 Supply
 We obtain fuel oil and other refined fuels in pipeline, truckload or tankwagon quantities, and have contracts with certain pipeline and terminal operators for the right to temporarily store fuel oil at 13 terminal facilities that we do not own.  We have arrangements with certain suppliers of fuel oil, which provide open access to fuel oil at specific terminals throughout the northeast.  Additionally, a portion of our purchases of fuel oil are made at local wholesale terminal racks.  In most cases, the supply contracts do not establish the price of fuel oil in advance; rather, prices are typically established based upon market prices at the time of delivery, plus or minus a differential for transportation and volume discounts.  We purchase fuel oil from approximately 20 suppliers at approximately 45 supply points.  While fuel oil supply is more susceptible to longer periods of supply constraint than propane, we believe that our supply arrangements will provide us with sufficient supply sources.  Although we make no assurance regarding the availability of supplies of fuel oil in the future, we currently expect to be able to secure adequate supplies during fiscal 2022.

Competition
 The fuel oil industry is a mature industry with total demand expected to remain relatively flat to moderately declining. The fuel oil industry is highly fragmented, characterized by a large number of relatively small, independently owned and operated local distributors.  We compete with other fuel oil distributors offering a broad range of services and prices, from full service distributors to those that solely offer the delivery service. We are a full-service energy provider and have developed a wide range of sales programs and service offerings for our fuel oil customer base that are intended to build customer loyalty. For instance, we provide home heating equipment repair service to our fuel oil customers on a 24-hour a day basis. The fuel oil business unit also competes for retail customers with suppliers of alternative energy sources, principally natural gas, propane and electricity.
Natural Gas and Electricity
 We market natural gas and electricity through our 100%-owned subsidiary, Agway Energy Services, LLC (“AES”), in the deregulated markets of New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland, primarily to residential and small commercial customers. Historically, local utility companies provided their customers with all three aspects of electric and natural gas service: generation, transmission and distribution.  However, under deregulation, public utility commissions in several states are licensing energy service companies, such as AES, to act as alternative suppliers of the commodity to end consumers.  In essence, the local utility companies distribute electricity and natural gas on their distribution systems and we arrange for the supply of electricity or natural gas to specific delivery points. The business strategy of this segment is to expand its market share by concentrating on growth in the customer base and expansion into other deregulated markets that are considered strategic markets.
 We serve approximately 39,000 natural gas and electricity customers in New York, Pennsylvania and Maryland.  An Order from the New York Public Service Commission (“NY PSC“) regarding low income consumers went into effect in 2018 and required that all energy service companies (“ESCOs”) stop serving certain low-income consumers. As a result, AES returned approximately 7,900 of our customers to local utility service. A second order (“Reset Order”) issued by the NY PSC in 2016 attempted to impose rules that would have allowed the NY PSC to regulate ESCO pricing, which was subsequently challenged and struck down by the New York Supreme Court. On appeal, the New York State Court of Appeals issued a ruling in 2019 that held that the NY PSC cannot regulate ESCO pricing, but does have the ability to restrict an ESCO’s access to the utility distribution system if the NY PSC determines that an ESCO’s pricing is not “just and reasonable.”  In December 2019, the NY PSC issued an Order that imposed product, pricing, and other requirements on ESCOs (“Second Reset Order”).  AES was specifically and solely exempted from complying with the criteria concerning product offerings during the pendency of further rulemaking proceedings.  In September 2020, the NY PSC issued another Order reaffirming the Second Reset Order, including the exemption that allows AES to maintain its existing business model in New York while rulemaking proceedings continue. Separately, the State of New York issued a State of Emergency Order in March of 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While the New York State of Emergency Order for COVID-19 ended in June 2021, other state of emergency orders were issued in July 2021 and remain in effect. Under New York laws, telemarketers are prevented from making sales calls during states of emergency.  As a result, AES halted all telemarketing sales efforts in New York in March 2020, and this condition continues to remain in effect as of the date of this Annual Report.  
 During fiscal 2021, we sold approximately 1.7 million dekatherms of natural gas and 214.9 million kilowatt hours of electricity through the natural gas and electricity segment. Approximately 87% of our customers were residential households and the remainder were small commercial and industrial customers.  New accounts are obtained through numerous marketing and advertising programs, including telemarketing and direct mail initiatives.  Most local utility companies have established billing service arrangements whereby customers receive a single bill from the local utility company, which includes distribution charges from the local utility company, as well as product charges for the amount of natural gas or electricity provided by AES and utilized by the customer.  We have arrangements with several local utility companies that provide billing and collection services for a fee.  Under these arrangements, we are paid by the local utility company for all or a portion of customer billings after a specified number of days following the customer billing with no further recourse to AES.
 Supply of natural gas is arranged through annual supply agreements with major national wholesale suppliers.  Pricing under the annual natural gas supply contracts is based on posted market prices at the time of delivery, and some contracts include a pricing formula that typically is based on prevailing market prices.  The majority of our electricity requirements are purchased through the New York Independent System Operator (“NYISO”) and PJM Interconnection (“PJM”) under annual supply agreements, as well as purchase arrangements through other national wholesale suppliers on the open market.  Electricity pricing under the NYISO and PJM agreements are based on local market indices at the time of delivery.  Competition is primarily with local utility companies, as well as other marketers of natural gas and electricity providing similar alternatives as AES.
 All Other
 We sell, install and service various types of whole-house heating products, air cleaners, humidifiers and space heaters to the customers of our propane, fuel oil, natural gas and electricity businesses.  Our supply needs are filled through supply arrangements 
 
6


with several large regional equipment manufacturers and distribution companies.  Competition in this business is primarily with small, local heating and ventilation providers and contractors, as well as, to a lesser extent, other regional service providers.  The focus of our ongoing service offerings are in support of the service needs of our existing customer base within our propane, refined fuels and natural gas and electricity business segments.  Additionally, we have entered into arrangements with third-party service providers to complement and, in certain instances, supplement our existing service capabilities.
 Seasonality
 The retail propane and fuel oil distribution businesses, as well as the natural gas marketing business, are seasonal because the primary use of these fuels is for heating residential and commercial buildings.  Historically, approximately two‑thirds of our retail propane volume is sold during the six-month peak heating season from October through March.  The fuel oil business tends to experience greater seasonality given its more limited use for space heating, and approximately three-fourths of our fuel oil volumes are sold between October and March.  Consequently, sales and operating profits are concentrated in our first and second fiscal quarters.  Cash flows from operations, therefore, are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for product purchased during the winter heating season.  We expect lower operating profits and either net losses or lower net income during the period from April through September (our third and fourth fiscal quarters).
 Weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products, in particular propane, fuel oil and natural gas, for both heating and agricultural purposes.  Many of our customers rely on propane, fuel oil or natural gas primarily as a heating source.  Accordingly, the volume sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in our service areas, which can vary substantially from year to year.  In any given area, sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane, fuel oil and natural gas consumption, while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater consumption.
 Trademarks and Tradenames
 We rely primarily on a combination of trademark, trade secret and copyright laws, as well as contractual provisions with employees and third parties, to establish and protect our intellectual property rights.  We utilize a variety of trademarks and tradenames owned by us, including “Suburban Propane,” and “Agway Energy Services” and related marks or designs incorporating such related logos such as “Go Green with Suburban Propane” and “Energy Guard.”  All of the trademarks and tradenames used by Suburban Propane and Agway Energy Services are registered (or have applications pending for registration) with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.  We regard our trademarks, tradenames and other proprietary rights as valuable assets and believe that they have significant value in the marketing of our products and services.Government Regulation; Environmental, Health and Safety Matters
 Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Generally, these laws and regulations impose limitations on the discharge of hazardous materials and pollutants and establish standards for the handling, transportation, distribution, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous materials and solid and hazardous wastes, which may require the investigation, assessment, cleanup, or monitoring of, or compensation for, environmental impacts, including natural resource damages. Notably, these laws include the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”); Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”); Clean Air Act; Clean Water Act; National Environmental Policy Act, and their implementing regulations, as well as comparable state laws and regulations. Additionally, there are environmental laws and regulations specific to the sale of electricity and natural gas in the retail energy market by our wholly owned subsidiary Agway Energy Services, LLC. Under the various laws and regulations to which we are subject, we must maintain various permits and comply with various monitoring and reporting requirements.
 We own real property at locations where hazardous materials may be or may have been present as a result of prior activities.  We expect that we will be required to expend funds to participate in the remediation of certain sites, including sites where we have been designated as a potentially responsible party under applicable laws and at sites with aboveground and underground fuel storage tanks.  We will also incur other expenses associated with environmental compliance.  We continually monitor our operations with respect to potential environmental issues, including changes in legal requirements and remediation technologies.  As of September 25, 2021, we had accrued environmental liabilities of $1.9 million representing the total estimated future liability for remediation and monitoring of all of our properties.
 Estimating the extent of our responsibility at a particular site, and the method and ultimate cost of remediation and monitoring of that site, requires making numerous assumptions.  As a result, the ultimate cost to remediate and monitor any site may differ from current estimates, and will depend, in part, on whether there is additional contamination, not currently known to us, relating to that site. However, we believe that our past experience provides a reasonable basis for estimating these liabilities.  As additional information becomes available, estimates are adjusted as necessary.  While we do not anticipate that any such adjustment would be material to our financial statements, the result of ongoing or future environmental studies or other factors could alter this expectation 
 
7


and require recording additional liabilities.  We currently cannot determine whether we will incur additional environmental liabilities or the extent or amount of any such liabilities, or the extent to which such additional liabilities would be subject to any contractual indemnification protections.
 Certain rules and procedures imposed by the National Fire Protection Association (“NFPA”), as well as comparable state laws and regulations, govern the safe handling of propane and establish industry standards for propane storage, distribution and equipment installation and operation in all of the states in which we operate.  In some states, these laws and regulations are administered by state agencies, and in others they are administered on a municipal level. 
 The NFPA’s rules and procedures, as well as comparable state laws and regulations govern the safe handling of distillates (fuel oil, kerosene and diesel fuel) and gasoline and establish industry standards for fuel oil, kerosene, diesel fuel and gasoline storage, distribution and equipment installation and operation in all of the states in which we sell those products.  In some states these laws and regulations are administered by state agencies and in others they are administered on a municipal level. 
 With respect to the transportation of propane, distillates and gasoline by truck, we are subject to laws and regulations that cover the transportation of hazardous materials and are administered, respectively, by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration and the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), or comparable state agencies.  We conduct ongoing training programs to help ensure that our operations are in compliance with these and other applicable safety laws and regulations.  We maintain various permits that are necessary to operate our equipment and facilities, some of which may be material to our operations.  In compliance with the DOT’s pipeline safety regulations for “jurisdictional” propane systems that serve multiple customers, we provide training and written instruction for our employees, provide customers with periodic awareness notices and safety information, have established written procedures to minimize the hazards resulting from gas pipeline emergencies and keep records of inspections.  
 Our operations are subject to workplace safety standards under the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (“OSHA”) and comparable state laws that regulate the protection of worker health and safety.  Compliance with these standards is monitored through required workplace injury and illness recordkeeping, and reporting.  We believe that our operations are in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable worker health and safety standards.  We are also subject to laws and regulations governing the security of hazardous materials, including propane, under the Federal Homeland Security Act of 2002, as administered by the Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”).  The DHS promulgated the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards (“CFATS”) to identify and secure chemical facilities that present the greatest security risk using a risk-based tiering structure.  We have a number of facilities registered with the DHS.  Currently, we have submitted all required Top-Screens as defined by DHS and have developed approved Site Security Plans for our regulated or “tiered” facilities. Less than 5% of our facilities are designated as tiered facilities. We expect to continue to incur minor costs associated with administrative controls and enhanced physical security measures for those tiered facilities that are subject to ongoing compliance activity.
 The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued an Endangerment Finding under the Clean Air Act, determining that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and four other greenhouse gases (“GHGs”) threaten the public health and welfare of current and future generations. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs from certain industries and require reporting by certain regulated facilities.  While propane itself is not considered a greenhouse gas, these regulations impact both our core business, as well as the retail sale of electricity and natural gas by AES. The EPA’s authority to regulate GHGs has been upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.  Changes in the EPA administration may result in the prioritization of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures and a push for significant reduction in GHG emissions.  We may incur costs associated with operational changes required to comply with any such new regulations over the coming years.
 Both Houses of the United States Congress have considered adopting legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs.  While the bipartisan infrastructure bill that was signed into law in November 2021 does not impose GHG emissions reductions, it provides measures of protection against climate change disasters, including investments in clean energy. At this time, we cannot speculate as to the extent or impact of the new infrastructure law, the development of alternative energy sources or any future climate change legislation may have on our business or results of operations.
 Regardless of what happens at the national level, numerous states and municipalities have begun to adopt laws and policies to regulate GHG emissions.  These regulatory actions could require us to incur increased expenses or lost revenue. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, additional climate change laws and regulations will be enacted, and what effect such laws and regulations may have on our business, financial condition or operations in the future. These local, state, and prospective national laws and regulations have sparked a shift in our industry toward the next generation of clean energy. We are an industry leader in this regard by making strategic investments so we can be positioned to have an adequate clean energy supply as these laws and regulations become operative. For example, we have taken a 39% equity stake in Oberon, a development-stage producer of low carbon, renewable dimethyl ether (“rDME”) transportation fuel, with the goal of commercializing an rDME+propane blended product. We have also executed agreements to purchase and distribute renewable propane, which offers a low carbon emissions alternative compared to 
 
8


traditional propane, gasoline or diesel.  We are committed to increasing the availability of both rDME blended propane and renewable propane in the coming years.
 The adoption of federal, state or local climate change legislation or regulatory programs to reduce emissions of GHGs could require us to incur increased capital and operating costs, with resulting impact on product price. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, climate change legislation provisions and renewable energy standards may be enacted, and what effect such regulation may have on our business, financial condition or operations in the future. In addition, a consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. It is difficult to predict how the market for our products will be affected by increased temperature volatility, or increased temperatures generally, although if there is an overall trend of unseasonably warmer temperatures in the winter months, it could adversely affect our business.
 Future developments, such as stricter environmental, health or safety laws and regulations, could affect our operations. We do not anticipate that the cost of our compliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including RCRA and CERCLA, as currently in effect and applicable to known sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.  However, there can be no assurance that our financial condition or operations will not be materially adversely affected by future discovery of presently unknown, environmental liabilities or future environmental regulations.
 Many of the states in which we do business have passed laws prohibiting “unfair or deceptive practices” in transactions between consumers and sellers of products used for residential purposes, which give the Attorney General or other officials of that state the authority to investigate alleged violations of those laws.  From time to time, we receive inquiries or requests for additional information under these laws from the offices of Attorneys General or other government officials in connection with the sale of our products to residential customers.  Based on information to date, and because our policies and business practices are designed to comply with all applicable laws, we do not believe that the costs or liabilities associated with such inquiries or requests will result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations; however, there can be no assurance that our financial condition or results of operations may not be materially and adversely affected as a result of current or future government investigations or civil litigation derived therefrom.
 See the Risk Factor entitled “The ability of AES to acquire and retain retail natural gas and electricity customers is highly competitive, price sensitive and may be impacted by changes in state regulations” for a description of certain regulatory and litigation impacts on our AES business.  
 ESG Strategy and Initiatives
 We are committed to delivering safe, reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy solutions to our customers and local communities, and have made significant progress on our environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) initiatives, which accelerated with the launch of our Three Pillars of the Suburban Propane Experience in June 2019.  The three essential pillars are: i) Go Green with Suburban Propane, ii) SuburbanCares, and iii) Suburban Commitment to Excellence.  We launched this corporate initiative to emphasize our commitment to excellence for the comfort and safety of our customers, our devotion to our dedicated employees to provide for their safety and career development, our philanthropic efforts to give back to the communities we serve, our work to advocate for the inherent environmental benefits of using propane as a clean energy solution, our focus on supporting the sustainability needs of our customers and our strategic vision to invest in and develop innovative solutions to help pave the way to lowering greenhouse gas emissions.  We are committed to implementing business strategies using a holistic approach to doing what is best for our customers, employees, investors, our business and the community at large.  Effective ESG management for us supports our goal to create long-term value for our Unitholders and to support the interests of our other stakeholders.  Our Board of Supervisors takes an active role in overseeing the management of risks facing Suburban, including those impacted by ESG issues.
 In support of our efforts to successfully manage and grow our business, we will continue to identify ways to include more ESG initiatives in our strategies that support our customers, employees, investors, and the communities in which we serve, including initiatives that support our three-pillars strategic plan.  Advancing our focus on ESG initiatives will allow for increased engagement across our business and help us to continue to identify and meet the evolving expectations of our customers, employees, investors, and other stakeholders.  
 Environmental Initiatives
 Our Go Green with Suburban Propane corporate pillar encompasses our commitment and efforts to promote the versatile, affordable and clean-burning attributes of propane as one solution that can contribute to our customers achieving their sustainability goals and our efforts to contribute to the overall goals of reducing the nation’s carbon footprint, lowering greenhouse gas emissions and having a positive effect on climate change.  This pillar is supported by the tagline, “Serving communities today, leading the way to a sustainable tomorrow.”  Recognized for its low environmental impact by the Clean Air Act Amendments, propane can offer immediate opportunities to reduce carbon emissions over other traditional fuels, particularly in the transportation sector.  Propane is non-toxic, does 
 
9


not produce sulfur dioxide (a primary cause of the greenhouse effect) and emits 60% to 70% fewer smog producing hydrocarbons than gasoline and diesel.  Several states have implemented low carbon fuel standards that recognize the environmental benefits of using propane to power over-the-road vehicles and forklifts.  Through our dedicated sales efforts, we are actively promoting the use of propane in the transportation sector to replace diesel, and for each of the last three fiscal years, we sold more than 2.7 million gallons of propane annually to the over-the-road vehicle market, which helped reduce carbon emissions annually by approximately 19 million pounds, or 55%, compared to diesel.
 With advancements in new technologies for the production of propane from renewable sources, as well as other technological advances to reduce the carbon intensity of traditional propane, our Go Green with Suburban Propane corporate pillar also underscores our commitment to invest in innovative solutions that can contribute to a sustainable energy future.  Starting in fiscal year 2020, the Partnership made great strides in advancing our strategic growth initiatives through our Go Green with Suburban Propane corporate pillar.   Specifically, we contracted for the supply and distribution of approximately 1.0 million gallons annually of renewable propane, produced from waste fats and oils, to meet customer demand for a renewable energy source.  In support of our long-term strategic growth initiatives to begin to build out a renewable energy platform, we acquired a 39% equity stake in Oberon Fuels, Inc. (“Oberon”), a development-stage producer of a low carbon renewable dimethyl either (“rDME”) transportation fuel, which can be produced from renewable sources such as timber waste from the paper and pulp industry or dairy manure from the farming industry.  The Partnership will have the exclusive rights to market and sell rDME in North America, and is collaborating with the Oberon management team to commercialize rDME as a solution toward a pathway to zero emission transportation in one of three applications for rDME, either as: (i) a diesel replacement, (ii) a hydrogen carrier, or (iii) a blend with propane, or renewable propane, to reduce its carbon intensity.
 In further support of the Partnership’s efforts to advance its Go Green with Suburban Propane corporate initiative, we have officially registered the Go Green with Suburban Propane logo with the United States Patent and Trademark office.  As part of our commitment to innovating for a sustainable energy future, and in support of our strategic growth initiatives to build out a renewable energy platform, the Partnership also created a new executive-level position (reporting directly to our President and Chief Executive Officer) entitled Vice President, Strategic Initiatives – Renewable Energy.  This new position focuses on identifying, analyzing and developing opportunities within the renewable energy space for potential future acquisitions, partnerships or collaborative arrangements that support the Partnership’s efforts to grow its overall business through investment in, and development of, innovative solutions that will help pave the way to lowering greenhouse gas emissions.  
 We present information about our commitment to sustainable and environmentally sound practices on the “Go Green” page on our website, which may be accessed at www.suburbanpropane.com/suburban-propane-experience/go-green.  The information included on our “Go Green” page is not intended to be incorporated by reference into this Form 10-K Annual Report.
 Social Initiatives
 The Partnership has a more than 90-year legacy of an unwavering commitment to the highest standards for safety and outstanding customer service.  From our origins as a family-owned business in 1928, we have maintained a family-oriented culture with deep roots in each of the local communities we serve.  Our SuburbanCares corporate pillar highlights our continued dedication to philanthropic endeavors through the Partnership’s national partnership with the American Red Cross and countless local community sponsorships and events, as well as the many employee-focused initiatives that differentiate the Partnership as a great place to work.  This pillar is supported by the tagline, “Suburban cares about our people and the communities we serve.”
 During the fiscal year ended September 25, 2021, the Partnership placed a specific focus on partnering with organizations that provide much needed assistance to women and children in underserved communities throughout our operating footprint with food, shelter, educational supplies and many other essential items.  We also entered into a partnership with the United States Army’s Partnership for Youth Success (“PaYS”) program, which guarantees soldiers an interview and possible employment within the Partnership upon completion of their service, and includes the Partnership in recruiting functions, community events and various outreach initiatives undertaken through the PaYS program.   This year, our SuburbanCares activities were recognized by NJ Biz as a finalist for Corporate Citizen of the Year. We also expanded our efforts to support the American Red Cross, especially given the need for blood donations during the pandemic.
 Safety
 Embedded in our culture and the Partnership’s mission statement is our commitment to safety.  We believe that the safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and communities is of the utmost importance.  Safety is the top priority for our business and we continue to invest in programs, technology, and training to improve safety throughout our operations.  We believe that the achievement of superior safety performance is both an important short-term and long-term strategic initiative in supporting our business and managing our operations.

Human Capital Management
 Our Board, and our management, consider effective talent development and human capital management to be critical components to the Partnership’s continued success.  Our Board is involved in leadership development and actively oversees the Partnership’s succession planning, which includes periodic reviews of our talent management strategies, leadership pipeline and succession planning for key executive positions.  Our Board oversees the process of succession planning and the Compensation Committee of our Board implements programs to compensate, retain and motivate key talent.
 In further support of our SuburbanCares corporate pillar, and our commitment to building a diverse and inclusive culture, we have developed many employee-focused initiatives to support employee career development and hiring, such as our “Steer Your Career” program, which encourages and supports employees to further their education and enhance their knowledge and skills to prepare them for expanded opportunities and responsibilities; our “Heroes Hired Here” program, in which we take pride in our efforts to attract and employ military veterans in recognition and appreciation for the values, leadership, dedication and unique skills that they bring to the Partnership, and support provided to their family members; and our “Apprentice Program,” which provides company-paid, on-the-job training for apprentices to develop their careers and provide them the necessary skills and tools to prepare them for a successful career within the Partnership.
 Governance Initiatives
 The Board believes that sound corporate governance practices and policies provide an important framework to assist the Board in fulfilling its duty to Unitholders. Our corporate governance practices and policies, which are periodically reassessed, are reflected in our committee charters, Code of Business Conduct and Ethics, and our Corporate Governance Guidelines & Principles.  A copy of each is available from our website at www.suburbanpropane.com.
 The Partnership was one of the first publicly traded partnerships to eliminate the “incentive distribution rights” of its general partner, which we completed in 2006.  This removed the potential for conflicts of interest between our general partner and limited partners, and simplified our capital structure.  The general partner of both the Partnership and our Operating Partnership is Suburban Energy Services Group LLC (the “General Partner”), a Delaware limited liability company, the sole member of which is the Partnership’s Chief Executive Officer.  Other than as a holder of 784 Common Units that will remain in the General Partner, the General Partner does not have any economic interest in us or our Operating Partnership.  Accordingly, and unlike many publicly traded partnerships, the Partnership is controlled by our Unitholders through the independently elected Board.

 Safety and Ethics Hotline
 It is the Partnership’s policy to encourage the communication of bona fide concerns relating to the lawful and ethical conduct of its business, and its audit and accounting procedures or related matters.  It is also the policy of the Partnership to protect those who communicate their bona fide concerns from any retaliation for such reporting.  All employees, customers, vendors and other stakeholders can communicate concerns by calling our Safety and Ethics Hotline, which is hosted by a third party to maintain confidentiality and anonymity when requested.  Our senior leadership team, along with our Audit Committee, review matters reported through the Safety and Ethics Hotline.  Confidential and anonymous mechanisms for reporting concerns are also available and described in our Code of Business Conduct and Ethics.  
Cybersecurity
 The Partnership’s cybersecurity program is based upon the National Institute of Standards of Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework.  Our program is comprehensive in scope and covers all of the Partnership’s general corporate Information Technology (IT) systems, as well as operational technology systems supporting our business.  Our senior leadership team, along with our Audit Committee, receive regular and recurring program updates, metrics, and roadmaps to promote the effectiveness of the program and the
