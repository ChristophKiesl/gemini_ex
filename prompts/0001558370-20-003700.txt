ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General 
We are a leading omni-channel specialty retailer of menswear, including suits, formalwear and a broad selection of polished and business casual offerings. We help our customers look and feel their best by delivering personalized products and services through our convenient network of over 1,400 stores in the United States (“U.S.”) and Canada as well as our branded e-commerce websites at www.menswearhouse.com and www.josbank.com. Our brands include Men’s Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank, Moores Clothing for Men (“Moores”) and K&G.
Recent Strategic Changes
We believe structural and strategic changes are necessary to compete in the changing and challenging retail environment. Our goal is to transform the Company with a focus on being anchored in and obsessed with the customer, by: (1) investing for long-term and sustainable value creation, (2) focused execution that allows us to continue to generate cash and meet our financial commitments, (3) using data and analysis to guide decisions, and (4) moving with an urgency that reflects our conviction and confidence in our ability to own the customers’ loyalty and advocacy. To that end, during fiscal 2019 and the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we announced the following significant actions in support of our transformation: 

● | On January 16, 2020, we entered into an agreement with WHP Global to sell the Joseph Abboud trademarks for a total of $115.0 million in cash consideration. The transaction closed on March 4, 2020 and upon closing, we entered into a license agreement with WHP Global granting the Company the exclusive right and license to sell and rent Joseph Abboud branded apparel and related merchandise in the U.S. and Canada.

​

● | On December 11, 2019, we announced the creation of a new Chief Customer Officer role providing common leadership for our Men’s Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank and Moores brands, and we eliminated the brand president position for these brands. Carrie Ask, then brand president of Men’s Wearhouse and Moores, was appointed as Chief Customer Officer. We believe this new structure heightens our focus and ability to unlock value across our brand portfolio and will enable us to show up for our customers in more effective and efficient ways. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

​

● | On September 11, 2019, after extensive review, we announced an update to the Company’s capital allocation strategy. Effective in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, our quarterly cash dividend was suspended and redeployed for accelerated debt reduction and opportunistic share repurchases. Suspending the quarterly cash dividend of $0.18 per share is expected to make available approximately $36.5 million of cash on an annualized basis. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | On August 16, 2019, we completed the sale of MWUK Limited, our UK corporate apparel operations conducted by Dimensions, Alexandra, and Yaffy to Project Dart Bidco Limited, pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement entered into on that same date. In addition, we also completed the sale of Twin Hill Acquisition Company, Inc. (“Twin Hill”), to TH Holding Company, pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement entered into on August 16, 2019. The aggregate consideration for all of the outstanding equity of MWUK Limited and Twin Hill (collectively, the “corporate apparel business”) was approximately $62 million, subject to certain working capital adjustments. After consideration of working capital adjustments and other related items, we received $49.3 million in cash during 2019 and approximately $6.0 million will be received in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We determined that the sale of the corporate apparel business represented a strategic shift that will have a major effect on our results of operations and, as a result, we have presented the disposal as discontinued operations in our financial statements. Unless noted otherwise, discussion in this Annual Report on Form 10-K pertains to our continuing operations. 
In addition, as a result of this change in our organizational structure, we reassessed our segment reporting presentation. We determined that the results from our four retail brands: Men’s Wearhouse/Men’s Wearhouse and Tux, Jos. A. Bank, K&G and Moores represent separate operating segments that should continue to be aggregated into a reportable segment and, as a result, we have only one reportable segment.

Overview
We offer our products and services through our retail brands—Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux, Jos. A. Bank and K&G in the United States and Moores in Canada—and through the internet at www.menswearhouse.com and www.josbank.com. Men’s Wearhouse, Moores and K&G each operate as a house of brands carrying a wide selection of exclusive and non-exclusive merchandise brands. Jos. A. Bank is a branded house where substantially all merchandise is sold under the exclusive Jos. A. Bank label. 
As of February 1, 2020, we operated 1,450 stores in the U.S. and Canada. We also own and operate a factory located in New Bedford, Massachusetts that manufactures quality U.S. made tailored clothing consisting of designer suits (including custom suits), tuxedos, sport coats and slacks.
Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux and Moores
Men’s Wearhouse and Moores target the male consumer (18 to 65 years old) by providing superior, personalized customer service and offering a broad selection of exclusive and non-exclusive merchandise brands at regular and sale prices that we believe are competitive with specialty retailers and traditional department stores. Our merchandise includes suits, suit separates, sport coats, slacks, formalwear, polished casual, denim, sportswear, outerwear, dress shirts, shoes and accessories in classic, modern, slim and ultra-slim fits and in a wide range of sizes including a selection of “Big and Tall” product.
Although basic styles comprise our core offerings, each season’s merchandise reflects current fit, fabric style and color trends. The inventory mix at our Men’s Wearhouse and Moores stores primarily consists of business, formalwear and polished casual merchandise designed to meet the demand of our customers. Based on our experience, we believe that our assortment styling, breadth, quality and price, coupled with our in-store service, provide us with an advantage over our competitors with our target customer.
During fiscal 2016, we introduced a new collection of custom apparel consisting of suits, sport coats, slacks, shirts, tuxedos and vests, which are personalized according to a customer’s selection from a variety of attribute-value combinations. From fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2019, we experienced significant growth in sales for custom clothing. See “Business Strategy” for additional information on our custom clothing business and other strategic initiatives for 2020 and beyond.
We also offer a full selection of special occasion offerings including tuxedo and suit rental product (collectively, “rental product”). We believe our rental product broadens our customer base by drawing first-time and younger customers into our stores. We also offer our customers the opportunity to purchase suits for special occasions instead of renting product. Regardless of whether our customer chooses to purchase or rent, we believe we are well-positioned to meet our customers’ special occasion needs.
At February 1, 2020, we operated 716 Men’s Wearhouse retail apparel stores in 50 states and the District of Columbia. These stores offer a full selection of retail merchandise and rental product. Men’s Wearhouse stores are primarily located in regional strip and specialty retail shopping centers or in freestanding buildings that enable our customers to park near the entrance of the store as we believe that men prefer direct and easy store access.
At February 1, 2020, we also operated another 44 stores in 20 states branded as Men’s Wearhouse and Tux. These stores are referred to as “rental stores” and offer a full selection of rental product and a limited selection of retail merchandise, and are located primarily in regional malls and lifestyle centers. Over the last five years, we have closed over 110 Men’s Wearhouse and Tux stores, consistent with our strategy to serve special occasion customers primarily through our Men’s Wearhouse stores.
At February 1, 2020, we operated 126 Moores retail apparel stores in 10 Canadian provinces. Moores stores are primarily located in regional strip and specialty retail shopping centers and offer a full selection of retail merchandise and rental product.

Jos. A. Bank
Jos. A. Bank targets the male consumer (25 to 65 years old) emphasizing superior, personalized customer service and offering high quality business, formalwear and business casual merchandise, substantially all of which is Jos. A. Bank branded product featuring our Reserve, Traveler and 1905 labels. Jos. A. Bank merchandise consists of suits, suit separates, sport coats, slacks, formalwear, business casual, denim, sportswear, outerwear, dress shirts, shoes and accessories in classic, modern, slim and ultra-slim fits and in a wide range of sizes including a selection of “Big and Tall” product. Although the target gender and age of the Jos. A. Bank customer are similar to Men’s Wearhouse, we believe the Jos. A. Bank customer and the Men’s Wearhouse customer are differentiated by their style preferences. 
Our merchandising strategy is focused on classic styling with attention to detail in quality materials and workmanship. Based on our experience, we believe that our assortment styling, breadth, quality and price coupled with our in-store service, provides us with an advantage over our competitors with our target customer.
During fiscal 2016, we introduced custom apparel at Jos. A. Bank consisting of suits, sport coats, slacks, shirts, tuxedos and vests, which are personalized according to a customer’s selection from a variety of attribute-value combinations. Similar to Men’s Wearhouse and Moores, we experienced significant growth in sales for custom clothing in fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2019. See “Business Strategy” for additional information on our custom clothing business and other strategic initiatives for 2020 and beyond.
We also offer a full selection of special occasion rental product at Jos. A. Bank and believe our rental product offering provides the opportunity to broaden our customer base by drawing first-time and younger customers into our stores. As is the case at Men’s Wearhouse, we believe Jos. A. Bank is well-positioned to meet its customers’ special occasion needs, through retail clothing offerings, rental product or custom offerings.
At February 1, 2020, we operated 474 Jos. A. Bank retail apparel stores in 42 states and the District of Columbia. Jos. A. Bank stores are primarily located in specialty retail centers. In addition, as of February 1, 2020, there are 14 franchise stores. 
K&G
K&G stores offer a value-oriented superstore approach that we believe appeals to the more price-sensitive customer in the apparel market. K&G offers apparel and accessories comparable in quality to that of value-oriented department stores, at prices we believe are typically up to 60% below the regular prices charged by traditional department stores. K&G’s merchandising strategy emphasizes broad assortments across all major categories of both men’s and women’s career and casual apparel in a wide range of sizes including “Big and Tall” and “Women’s plus sizes” as well as tailored clothing, dress furnishings, sportswear, accessories, shoes and children’s apparel. This merchandise selection, which includes exclusive and non-exclusive merchandise brands, positions K&G to attract a wide range of customers in each of its markets.
At February 1, 2020, we operated 89 K&G stores in 27 states, 85 of which offer women’s career apparel, sportswear, accessories, shoes and children’s apparel. K&G stores are “destination” stores located primarily in second generation strip shopping centers that are easily accessible from major highways and thoroughfares.

Business Strategy
To fulfill our mission of helping men feel and look their best, we believe we need to:

● | Offer personalized products and services;
--+------------------------------------------


● | Provide inspiring and seamless experiences in and across every channel; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Tell the stories of our brands in the digital channels where our customers are increasingly spending their time.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Offer Personalized Products and Services
In 2019, our custom clothing business increased to $276 million, or approximately 12% of retail clothing product net sales, compared to over $220 million in fiscal 2018. Our custom clothing offerings are available at all Men’s Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank and Moores locations with two initial price points: an entry-level offering and a premium offering. 
Our focus for the custom business has been on three key aspects that we believe are crucial to the customer: speed, selection and service. We believe we have significant competitive advantages in these areas because we have: (1) supply chain advantages with our owned factory that manufactures our premium custom clothing in the U.S. and strong relationships and scale advantages with foreign manufacturers for our entry level custom clothing, (2) a wide assortment of custom suit fabrics to create high-quality and unique products for our customers and (3) a convenient U.S. and Canada store footprint staffed by expert wardrobe consultants and tailors.
Further expanding our offerings of personalized products and services, in 2019, we announced partnerships with the National Football League and National Hockey League that enable us to offer fans the ability to customize their suits and sport coats with linings depicting their favorite team(s). 
Delivering personalized products and services extends beyond our custom clothing offerings. Given the continuing trend in casualization of workplace and special occasion attire, we have accelerated and plan to continue to accelerate the evolution of our assortments to a mix that better reflects the way men dress for moments that matter. For example, in 2020, we plan to expand our polished casual assortments with outfit completers to build head-to-toe looks for our customers, including spring sweaters and layering pieces, as well as grow our denim, casual fashion chino and performance pants business. 
Provide Inspiring and Seamless Experiences In and Across Every Channel
We want our customers to be able to shop whenever, wherever and however they choose, and to have inspiring and seamless experiences in and across every channel. 
Our convenient U.S. and Canada store footprint continues to be a significant asset, yet we believe that the location, look, feel and functioning of our stores has not kept up with the evolving customer’s expectations. As a result, we intend to make select investments in our store fleet to improve the customer experience. For example, through the end of 2018, we installed 580 custom clothing fixtures across the Men’s Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank and Moores stores to provide a better custom suit buying experience. In 2019, we tested the impact of enhanced fixtures, in-store graphics and product presentation across our store fleet and are in the process of rolling out elements of these items to certain stores. In 2020, we are testing the next-generation of store design with a new more modernized version of Men’s Wearhouse, featuring an open concept floorplan with less merchandise on the floor, distinct merchandising zones for polished casual and tailored clothing, an elevated rental and custom experience, a new shirt wall and cutting-edge technology to enable the sales process.
We continue to invest in initiatives that support our omni-channel strategies. In recent years, the Company has implemented ‘virtualized inventory’ that enables our customers to order items through our websites when not available at the store. We also ship online purchases from our stores to further enhance our customer’s online shopping experience and reduce delivery times. In addition, we offer a guided shopping experience called “Look Finder” that provides customers with product recommendations. In 2019, we focused on growing our e-commerce sales through a combination of traffic gains, feature enhancements and elevated merchandising and we saw accelerating growth throughout the year. We plan to build on that success in 2020 with continued focus on improving the customer experience, elevating the assortment and 

6




leveraging marketing to drive more visitors to our sites. In addition, we believe we have the potential to significantly increase our online penetration, which is well below the general apparel industry.  
Beyond our store and e-commerce channels, we believe that marketing is an important element of the omni-channel experience. In recent years, we began evolving our marketing mix, dedicating a greater share of our marketing mix to digital channels to target a broader customer segment. We believe this advertising strategy is the most effective means of both attracting potential new customers as well as reinforcing the positive attributes of our various brands with our existing customer base. In 2019, we continued to shift our marketing mix away from traditional broadcast television and into broad-reach digital channels that are more relevant, more easily personalized, and whose performance is more easily measured. 
​
Telling the Stories of our Brands Primarily Through Digital Channels
Historically, our advertising strategy was primarily focused on promotional messaging using channels such as television, email, digital (including social media), mobile and direct mail. We believe that our target customers increasingly want to do business with brands that stand for more than just price. 
We expect to deploy marketing strategies to tell the stories of our brands with a focus on our offerings and customer service. This approach focuses on our in-store experience to promote a more engaged, personalized shopping experience that features our wardrobe consultants who help men create their personal style.  We intend to build customer loyalty by gaining a greater understanding of our customer’s needs, helping him meet those needs, and giving him confidence in the way he looks. In addition, we expect to strengthen our company reputation for social responsibility and grow brand affinity through various initiatives including merchandise donations and social cause campaigns that resonate with our target customers. 
Customer Service and Loyalty
Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux, Jos. A. Bank and Moores sales teams are trained as consultants to provide customers with assistance and advice on their apparel needs, including product style, color coordination, fabric choice and garment fit. Wardrobe consultants are encouraged to offer guidance to the customer at each stage of the decision-making process, making every effort to earn the customer’s confidence and to create a professional relationship that will continue beyond the initial visit.
K&G stores are designed to allow customers to select and purchase apparel by themselves. For example, each merchandise category is clearly marked and organized by size, and suits are specifically tagged as a means of further assisting customers to easily select their styles and sizes. K&G employees are also available to assist customers with merchandise selection, including correct sizing.
Substantially all of our retail apparel stores offer tailoring services to facilitate timely alterations at a reasonable cost to customers. In addition, we utilize our regional tailor shops, which receive merchandise from stores, to perform tailoring services and return the merchandise to the store for customer pickup.
We offer our “Perfect Fit” loyalty program to our Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux and Moores customers and our “Bank Account” loyalty program for Jos. A. Bank customers. Under these loyalty programs, customers receive points for purchases. Points are generally equivalent to dollars spent on a one-for-one basis. Upon reaching 500 points, customers are issued a $50 rewards certificate that they may use to make purchases at our stores or online. All customers who register for our loyalty programs are eligible to participate and earn points for purchases. We believe that the loyalty programs facilitate our ability to cultivate long-term relationships with our customers.
Purchasing and Distribution
For the Men’s Wearhouse, Jos. A. Bank and Moores brands and, to a lesser extent, our K&G brand, our vertical direct sourcing model with third-party manufacturers covers design, product development, manufacturing, testing, quality control, and all necessary logistics required to get merchandise from the factory to the sales floor. We purchase merchandise and rental product from a broad base of manufacturers and do not believe that the loss of any manufacturer would cause a significant negative impact to us. We have no material long-term merchandise manufacturing contracts and typically transact business on a purchase order-by-purchase order basis either directly with manufacturers and fabric mills or with trading companies. We have developed long term and reliable relationships with most of our direct manufacturers 

7




and fabric mills, which we believe provides stability, quality and price leverage. Furthermore, we work with trading companies that support our relationships with manufacturers for our direct-sourced merchandise and contract agent offices that provide administrative functions on our behalf. The agent offices provide all quality control inspections and ensure that our operating procedures manuals are adhered to by our manufacturers.
We are committed to corporate social responsibility and have long supported the work of international agencies and organizations that seek to implement internationally recognized standards for labor practices. We have developed and implemented a Supplier Code of Conduct that sets forth the compliance requirements that all suppliers must agree to in order to do business with us. Our risk management department oversees our factory compliance efforts, and we also use the services of an outside audit company to conduct regular audits of factories we use. We strive to work collaboratively with factories to positively influence them to embed compliance into their daily operations. We also maintain standards and guidelines to prevent human trafficking and slavery, and our managers with direct responsibility for supply chain management have attended training, particularly with respect to mitigating these risks within the supply chain. For additional information regarding our commitment to improving factory working conditions, please review our latest Sustainability Report, which is available on our website at ir.tailoredbrands.com/responsibility.
For fiscal 2019, approximately 66% of direct sourced merchandise for our retail brands was from Asia (18% from China) while 13% was sourced in the U.S. (primarily from our U.S. factory), 7% was sourced in Mexico and 14% was sourced in other regions. By comparison, in fiscal 2018, approximately 72% of direct sourced merchandise was from Asia (23% from China) while 9% was sourced in Mexico, 8% was sourced in the U.S. (primarily from our U.S. factory) and 11% was sourced in other regions. Substantially all of our foreign purchases are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars. 
​
We use a regional distribution center approach to leverage the geographic locations of our main distribution centers in Texas and Maryland, as well as the facilities described below. Merchandise received into these regional distribution centers is either placed in back-stock or allocated to a store for shipping. In the majority of our larger markets, we also have separate hub distribution facilities or space within certain stores used as redistribution facilities for their respective areas. Merchandise for Moores is distributed to the stores from our distribution center in Cambridge, Ontario. The majority of merchandise for our K&G stores is direct shipped by suppliers to the stores with the remainder of K&G merchandise being managed via a third-party logistics firm. 
Our rental product is located in six distribution facilities: our Houston, Texas distribution center and five additional distribution facilities located in the U.S. (four) and Canada (one). The five additional distribution facilities also receive limited quantities of retail product, primarily formalwear accessories, that is sold in our Men’s Wearhouse, Men’s Wearhouse and Tux, Jos. A. Bank and Moores stores.
All retail merchandise and new rental product transported from suppliers to our distribution facilities is done so via common carrier or on a dedicated fleet of long-haul vehicles. This dedicated fleet is also used to transport product from our distribution centers to the hub facilities and a fleet of leased or owned smaller vehicles is used to transport product from the hub facilities to our stores within a given geographic region.
Competition
We compete against a broad spectrum of men’s clothing retailers and rental product providers. Our primary competitors include traditional department stores, other specialty men’s clothing stores, online retailers, online formalwear rental providers, off-price retailers, manufacturer-owned and independently-owned outlet stores, independently-owned formalwear rental stores, and all of their respective e-commerce channels. We believe that the principal competitive factors in the men’s apparel market are merchandise assortment, quality, value, garment fit, merchandise presentation, store location, seamless omni-channel experience and customer service, including on-site tailoring.
We believe that our merchandise offerings, including exclusive brands and custom clothing, and emphasis on customer service distinguish us from other retailers. Certain of our competitors (principally department stores) are larger and have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have and, therefore, they may have certain competitive advantages over us.

Seasonality
Our sales and net earnings are subject to seasonal fluctuations and may vary by brand. Typically, our rental product revenues are heavily concentrated in the second and third quarters (prom and wedding season) while the fourth quarter is the seasonal low point. Because of these fluctuations, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full year.
Trademarks and Service Marks
We are the owner in the U.S. and selected other countries of the numerous trademarks and service marks we use including, without limitation, MEN’S WEARHOUSE, MW MEN’S WEARHOUSE (and design) and JOS. A. BANK, and of U.S. and foreign registrations for such marks. Our rights in the MEN’S WEARHOUSE, JOS. A. BANK and other marks and their respective variations are a significant part of our business, as the marks have become well known through our use of the marks in connection with our retail and formalwear rental services and products (both in store and online) and our advertising campaigns. We are also the owner of various other trademarks and service marks, and corresponding trademark registrations in the U.S., Canada and abroad under which our stores operate or which are used to label the products we sell or rent. We intend to maintain and protect our marks and the related registrations.
We are the licensee for certain designer labels on various products such as men’s suits, men’s formalwear or men’s shirts. We generally pay a royalty for the use of the label, based on cost for the relevant product or a percentage of related sales. We monitor the performance of these licensed labels compared to their cost and may elect to selectively terminate any license, as provided in the particular agreement. 
Employees
At February 1, 2020, we had approximately 19,300 employees, consisting of approximately 17,600 in the U.S. and 1,700 in Canada, of which approximately 13,700 were full-time employees. Seasonality affects the number of part-time employees as well as the number of hours worked by full-time and part-time employees.
At February 1, 2020, approximately 650 of our employees at the factory located in New Bedford, Massachusetts are members of Unite Here, a New England based labor union. Our most recent collective bargaining agreement covering these employees expires in April 2022. 
Also, approximately 180 employees working in the Jos. A. Bank Hampstead, Maryland tailoring overflow shop and distribution centers are represented by the Mid-Atlantic Regional Joint Board, Local 806. The current union contract is scheduled to expire in February 2023. Lastly, approximately 90 Jos. A. Bank sales associates in New York City and four surrounding New York counties are represented by Local 340, New York New Jersey Regional Joint Board, Workers United. The current union contract is scheduled to expire in April 2020. 
We believe our relationship with our union and non-union employees is good and we have no reason to believe that we will experience any interruption in our business upon the expiration of these collective bargaining agreements. At Tailored Brands, we strive every day to create a safe and inclusive workplace and work to create a culture that fosters the needs of our diverse employee family.
Sustainability
We recognize that our business operations rely heavily on people and impact the communities around us and our planet. We are committed to social responsibility and environmental stewardship throughout the Company and endeavor to provide an inclusive workspace where everyone is treated with respect, nurture the communities in which we operate and be good citizens of our planet. Our latest Sustainability Report is available on our website at ir.tailoredbrands.com/responsibility.
