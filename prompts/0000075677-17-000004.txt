Item 1. | BUSINESS

Packaging Corporation of America ("we," "us," "our," "PCA," or the "Company") is the fourth largest producer of containerboard products and the third largest producer of uncoated freesheet in the United States, based on production capacity. We operate five containerboard mills, three paper mills and 94 corrugated products manufacturing plants. We are headquartered in Lake Forest, Illinois and operate primarily in the United States. 
We report in three reportable segments: Packaging, Paper and Corporate and Other. For segment financial information see Note 17, Segment Information, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in "Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" of this Form 10-K.
During 2016, we made two acquisitions in our corrugated products business: Tim-Bar Corporation ("TimBar") and Columbus Container, Inc. ("Columbus Container"). On August 29, 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets of TimBar, a large independent corrugated products producer with six corrugated products production facilities for a purchase price of $386 million. To finance the acquisition, we borrowed $385 million under a new five-year term loan facility. TimBar provides solutions to customers in the higher-margin retail, industrial packaging and display and fulfillment markets with a focus on multi-color graphics and technical innovation. On November 30, 2016, we acquired substantially all of the assets of Columbus Container for a purchase price of $100 million. Columbus Container is a full-service provider of corrugated packaging products, with a full-line corrugated products plant, warehousing facilities, and other related operations located in Indiana and Illinois. We used available cash on hand to purchase Columbus Container. The operating results of TimBar and Columbus Container are included in our results and reported in the Packaging segment from and after the respective dates of acquisition. These acquisitions will accelerate the growth strategy and increase the containerboard integration level in our Packaging segment.

Facilities
We manufacture our Packaging products at five containerboard mills, one containerboard machine (at our Wallula, Washington white paper mill), corrugated manufacturing operations, and protective packaging operations. The following provides more details of our operations:
Counce. Our Counce, Tennessee mill produces kraft linerboard. The year-end 2016 annual estimated production capacity, as reported to the American Forest and Paper Association (AF&PA), was 1,104,000 tons. In 2016, the mill produced 1,103,000 tons of kraft linerboard on two paper machines. The mill can produce basis weights from 26 lb. to 90 lb. The mill also produces a variety of performance and specialty grades of linerboard. 
DeRidder. Our DeRidder, Louisiana mill produces kraft linerboard on its No. 1 machine and linerboard and semi-chemical corrugating medium on its No. 3 machine. The year-end 2016 annual estimated capacity reported to the AF&PA, on the two machines, was 994,000 tons. The No. 1 machine produced 645,000 tons of kraft linerboard during 2016. The No. 3 machine produced 180,000 tons of linerboard and 168,000 tons of medium. The No. 3 machine was converted from a newsprint machine to a containerboard machine in 2014. The mill can produce linerboard in basis weights of 26 lb. to 69 lb. and medium in basis weights of 23 lb. to 33 lb. 
Valdosta. Our Valdosta, Georgia mill produces kraft linerboard. Its year-end 2016 annual estimated production capacity, as reported to the AF&PA, was 604,000 tons. In 2016, our single paper machine at Valdosta produced 599,000 tons of kraft linerboard. The mill can produce basis weights from 35 lb. to 96 lb. 
Tomahawk. Our Tomahawk, Wisconsin mill produces semi-chemical corrugating medium. Its year-end 2016 annual estimated production capacity, as reported to the AF&PA, was 556,000 tons. In 2016, the mill produced 500,000 tons on two paper machines. The Tomahawk mill can produce basis weights from 23 lb. to 47 lb. and a variety of performance and specialty grades of corrugating medium. 
Filer City. Our Filer City, Michigan mill produces semi-chemical corrugating medium. Its year-end 2016 annual estimated production capacity, as reported to the AF&PA, was 445,000 tons. In 2016, the mill produced 408,000 tons on three paper machines. Filer City can produce corrugating medium in basis weights from 20 lb. to 47 lb. 
Wallula. Our Wallula, Washington mill primarily produces white paper, but also produces semi-chemical corrugating medium on one of its paper machines. Its year-end 2016 annual estimated production capacity of medium, as reported to the AF&PA, was 147,000 tons. In 2016, the mill produced 133,000 tons of semi-chemical corrugating medium. Wallula can produce corrugating medium in basis weights from 23 lb. to 45 lb.
We operate 94 corrugated manufacturing operations, a technical and development center, eight regional design centers, a rotogravure printing operation, and a complement of packaging supplies and distribution centers. Of the 94 manufacturing facilities, 59 operate as combining operations, commonly called corrugated plants, which manufacture corrugated sheets and finished corrugated packaging products, 34 are sheet plants, which procure combined sheets and manufacture finished corrugated packaging products, and one is a corrugated sheet-only manufacturer.
Corrugated products plants tend to be located in close proximity to customers to minimize freight costs. Each of our plants serve a market radius of around 150 miles. Our sheet plants are generally located in close proximity to our larger corrugated plants, which enables us to offer additional services and converting capabilities such as small volume and quick turnaround items.

Major Raw Materials Used
Fiber supply. Fiber is the largest raw material cost to manufacture containerboard. We consume both wood fiber and recycled fiber in our containerboard mills. We have no 100% recycled mills, or mills whose fiber consumption consists solely of recycled fiber. To reduce our fiber costs, we have invested in processes and equipment to ensure a high degree of fiber flexibility. Our mill system has the capability to shift a portion of its fiber consumption between softwood, hardwood, and recycled sources. All of our mills, other than the Valdosta mill, can utilize some recycled fiber in their containerboard production. Our ability to use various types of virgin and recycled fiber helps mitigate the impact of changes in the prices of various fibers. Our corrugated manufacturing operations generate recycled fiber as a by-product from the manufacturing process, which is consumed by our mills. In 2016, our usage of recycled fiber, net of internal generation, represents 17% of our containerboard production.
We procure wood fiber through leases of cutting rights, long-term supply agreements, and market purchases. We currently lease the cutting rights to approximately 75,000 acres of timberland located near our Counce, Tennessee and Valdosta, Georgia mills. Virtually all of the acres under cutting rights agreements are located within 100 miles of these two mills which results in lower wood transportation costs and provides a secure source of wood fiber. These leased cutting rights agreements have terms with about 14 years remaining, on average.
We participate in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI) and we are certified under the SFI sourcing standards. These standards are aimed at ensuring the long-term health and conservation of forestry resources. We are committed to sourcing wood fiber through environmentally, socially, and economically sustainable practices and promoting resource and conservation stewardship ethics.
Energy supply. Energy at our packaging mills is obtained through purchased or self-generated fuels and electricity. Fuel sources include natural gas, by-products of the containerboard manufacturing and pulping process (including black liquor and wood waste), purchased wood waste, and other purchased fuels. Each of our mills self-generates process steam requirements from by-products (black liquor and wood waste), as well as from the various purchased fuels. The process steam is used throughout the production process and also to generate electricity.
In 2016, our packaging mills consumed about 60 million MMBTU’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity. Of the 60 million MMBTU’s consumed, about 61% was from mill generated by-products and 39% was from purchased fuels. Of the 39% in purchased fuels, 69% was from natural gas, 26% was from purchased wood waste and 5% was from other purchased fuels.
Chemical supply. We consume various chemicals in the production of containerboard, including caustic soda and sulfuric acid. Most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts, which are bid or negotiated periodically. 
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
Our corrugated products are sold through a direct sales and marketing organization, independent brokers, and distribution partners. We have sales representatives and a sales manager at most of our corrugated manufacturing operations and also have corporate account managers who serve customer accounts with a national presence. Additionally, our design centers maintain an on-site dedicated graphics sales force. In addition to direct sales and marketing personnel, we utilize new product development engineers and product graphics and design specialists. These individuals are located at both the corrugated plants and the design centers. General marketing support is located at our corporate headquarters.
Our containerboard sales group is responsible for the coordination of linerboard and corrugating medium sales to our corrugated plants, to outside domestic customers, and to export customers. This group handles order processing for all shipments of containerboard from our mills to our corrugated plants. These personnel also coordinate and execute all containerboard trade agreements with other containerboard manufacturers.
Containerboard produced in our mills is shipped by rail or truck. Our corrugated products are delivered by truck due to our large number of customers and their demand for timely service. Our corrugated manufacturing operations typically serve customers within a 150-mile radius. We sometimes use third-party warehouses for short-term storage of corrugated products. 
 4

Customers
We sell corrugated products to over 17,000 customers in over 34,000 locations. About three-quarters of our corrugated products sales are to regional and local accounts, which are broadly diversified across industries and geographic locations. The remaining one-quarter of our customer base consists primarily of national accounts that have multiple locations and are served by a number of PCA plants. No single customer exceeds 10% of segment sales.
The primary end-use markets in the United States for corrugated products are shown below as reported in the 2015 Fibre Box Association annual report:

Food, beverages, and agricultural products | 45 | %
Retail and wholesale trade | 19 | %
Miscellaneous manufacturing | 15 | %
Paper and other products | 11 | %
Chemical, plastic, and rubber products | 10 | %

Competition
As of December 31, 2016, we were the fourth largest producer of containerboard products in the United States, according to industry sources and our own estimates. According to industry sources, corrugated products are produced by about 500 U.S. companies operating approximately 1,200 plants. The primary basis for competition for most of our packaging products includes quality, service, price, product design, and innovation. Most corrugated products are manufactured to the customer’s specifications. Corrugated producers generally sell within a 150-mile radius of their plants and compete with other corrugated producers in their local region. Competition in our corrugated products operations tends to be regional, although we also face competition from large competitors with significant national account presence.
On a national level, our primary competitors are International Paper Company, WestRock Company, Georgia-Pacific LLC, KapStone Paper and Packaging Corporation, and Pratt Industries. However, with our strategic focus on regional and local accounts, we also compete with the smaller, independent producers. 
Paper
We are the third largest manufacturer of uncoated freesheet in the United States, according to industry sources and our own estimates. We manufacture and sell white papers, including both commodity and specialty papers, which may have custom or specialized features such as colors, coatings, high brightness, and recycled content. White papers consist of communication papers (cut-size office papers and printing and converting papers) and pressure sensitive papers, including release liners, which our customers use to produce labels for use in consumer and commercially-packaged products. Effective December 1, 2016, we ceased softwood market pulp production at our Wallula, Washington mill and permanently shut down the No.1 machine, with pulp capacity of approximately 100,000 tons. 
Facilities
We have three white paper mills located in the United States. The following paragraphs describe our white paper mills:
Jackson. Our Jackson, Alabama mill produces both commodity and specialty papers. Its year-end 2016 annual estimated production capacity of white papers on two paper machines, as reported to the AF&PA, was 470,000 tons. In 2016, the mill produced 465,000 tons of white papers. 
International Falls. Our International Falls, Minnesota mill produces both commodity and specialty papers. Its year-end 2016 annual estimated production capacity of white papers on two paper machines, as reported to the AF&PA, was 465,000 tons. In 2016, the mill produced 475,000 tons of white papers. 
Wallula. Our Wallula, Washington mill has the ability, on one machine, to switch production between pressure sensitive papers and a variety of white paper grades. The mill also produces corrugating medium. Its year-end 2016 annual estimated production capacity of white paper grades, as reported to the AF&PA, was 190,000 tons. The semi-chemical corrugating medium produced at Wallula is included in our Packaging segment as discussed above. In 2016, the mill produced 187,000 tons of white papers and 45,000 tons of market pulp. We ceased market pulp production in December 2016.

Major Raw Materials Used
Fiber supply. Fiber is our principal raw material in this segment, including wood fiber, recycled fiber, and purchased pulp. We purchase both whole logs and wood chips, which are a byproduct of lumber and plywood production. At our mill in Jackson, Alabama, we also purchase recycled fiber to produce our line of recycled office papers. Our Jackson and International Falls paper mills also purchase pulp from third parties pursuant to contractual arrangements. We purchase wood fiber through contracts and open-market purchases. 
We participate in the Sustainable Forestry Initiative® (SFI) and the Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC) and are certified under the SFI sourcing standards. We procure all wood fiber for our white paper mills through our certified systems that are managed in accordance with the SFI and FSC standards. These standards are aimed at ensuring the long-term health and conservation of forestry resources. 
Energy supply. We obtain energy through purchased or self-generated fuels and electricity. Fuel sources include natural gas, electricity, by-products of the manufacturing and pulping process (including black liquor and wood waste), and purchased wood waste. Each of the paper mills self-generates process steam requirements from by-products (black liquor and wood waste), as well as from the various purchased fuels. The process steam is used throughout the production process and to generate electricity.
In 2016, our white paper mills consumed about 30 million MMBTU’s of fuel to produce both steam and electricity. Of the 30 million MMBTU’s consumed, about 62% was from mill generated by-products and 38% was from purchased fuels. Of the 38% in purchased fuels, 85% was from natural gas and 15% from purchased wood waste. 
Chemical supply. We consume various chemicals in the production of white papers and pulp, including starch, precipitated calcium carbonate, caustic soda, sodium chlorate, dyestuffs, and optical brighteners. Most of our chemicals are purchased under contracts, which are bid or negotiated periodically. 
Sales, Marketing, and Distribution
Our white papers are sold primarily by our own sales personnel. We ship to customers both directly from our mills and through distribution centers and a network of outside warehouses by rail or truck. This allows us to respond quickly to customer requirements. 
Customers
We have over 200 customers in approximately 500 locations. These customers include paper merchants, commercial and financial printers, envelope converters, and customers who use our pressure sensitive paper for specialty applications such as consumer and commercial product labels. We have established long-term relationships with many of our customers. Office Depot, Inc. is our largest customer in the Paper segment. We have an agreement with Office Depot in which we will supply at least 50% of Office Depot's requirements for commodity office papers through December 2017. The agreement will renew automatically through December 2018; however, there are circumstances that could cause the agreement to terminate in 2017. If this were to occur, Office Depot's purchase obligations under the agreement would phase out over two years. In 2016, our sales revenue to Office Depot represented 42% of our Paper segment sales revenue. 
Competition
The markets in which our Paper segment competes are large and highly competitive. Commodity grades of white paper are globally traded, with numerous worldwide manufacturers, and as a result, these products compete primarily on the basis of price. All of our paper manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, and although we compete primarily in the domestic market, we do face competition from foreign producers and have experienced increased foreign competition in recent years. The level of this competition varies depending on domestic and foreign demand and foreign currency exchange rates. In general, paper production does not rely on proprietary processes or formulas, except in highly specialized or custom grades.
Our largest competitors include Domtar Corporation, International Paper Company, and Georgia-Pacific LLC. We also face competition from overseas producers. Although price is the primary basis for competition in most of our paper grades, quality and service are also important competitive determinants. Our white papers compete with electronic data transmission, e-readers, electronic document storage alternatives, and paper grades we do not produce. Increasing shifts to these alternatives 
 6

have had, and are likely to continue to have, an adverse effect on traditional print media and paper usage and lower demand for communication papers.
Corporate and Other
Our Corporate and Other segment includes corporate support staff services and related assets and liabilities. This segment also includes transportation assets, such as rail cars and trucks, which we use to transport some of our products from our manufacturing sites, and assets related to a 50% owned variable interest entity, Louisiana Timber Procurement Company, L.L.C. (LTP). 
Employees
As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately 14,000 employees, including 4,200 salaried and 9,800 hourly employees. Approximately 70% of our hourly employees worked pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. The majority of our unionized employees are represented by the United Steel Workers (USW), the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), the International Association of Machinists (IAM), and the Association of Western Pulp and Paper Workers (AWPPW). We are currently in negotiations to renew or extend any union contracts that have recently expired or are expiring in the near future, including the agreement at our Wallula, Washington paper mill with the AWPPW union, which expires on March 14, 2017. During 2016, we experienced no work stoppages, and we believe we have satisfactory labor relations with our employees.
