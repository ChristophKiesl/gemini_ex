ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
We are a commercial-stage company engaged in the discovery and development of drugs to treat severe metabolic, oncologic and psychiatric disorders by modulating the effects of the steroid hormone cortisol.
Cortisol plays a significant role in the body’s response to stress and is essential for survival. Cortisol influences metabolism and the immune system and contributes to emotional stability. Cortisol levels follow a diurnal rhythm that is essential to health, peaking upon awakening and decreasing during the day. Insufficient cortisol activity may lead to dehydration, hypotension, shock, fatigue and hypoglycemia. Excessive cortisol activity, known as hypercortisolism, may lead to a suppressed immune response, impaired glucose tolerance, diabetes, obesity, fatty liver disease, depressed mood, psychosis, wasting of the arms and legs, edema, fatigue, hypertension and other problems.
In addition, pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that cortisol reduces a patient’s immune response to oncogenesis, shields certain cancer cells from the apoptotic effects of chemotherapy and facilitates the growth of others. Pre-clinical and clinical data also indicate that modulating cortisol activity may improve outcomes in patients suffering from weight gain caused by antipsychotic medications (“AIWG”) and in patients with fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (“NASH”), precursors of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis.
Since 2012, we have marketed the cortisol modulator Korlym in the United States for the treatment of patients with a form of hypercortisolism known as endogenous Cushing’s syndrome. The challenge in treating a patient with Cushing’s syndrome is modulating cortisol’s effects without suppressing them below normal levels or disrupting cortisol’s normal diurnal rhythm. Simply reducing or destroying the ability of the body to make cortisol can cause serious harm. Cortisol activity can be modulated effectively by a drug that competes with cortisol as it attempts to bind to the glucocorticoid receptor (“GR”). We do not sell Korlym internationally.
Because Korlym’s active ingredient, mifepristone, reduces the binding of excess cortisol to GR, it can modulate the effects of abnormal levels and release patterns of cortisol without compromising cortisol’s healthy functions and rhythms. However, mifepristone also binds to the progesterone receptor (“PR”), thereby terminating pregnancy and causing other adverse effects, including endometrial thickening and vaginal bleeding, a debilitating condition suffered by a significant portion of women who take Korlym.
We have discovered more than 1,000 proprietary cortisol modulators that bind to GR but have no affinity for PR and so do not cause Korlym’s PR-related side effects. These novel molecules share Korlym’s affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor GR, but, unlike Korlym, do not bind to the PR and therefore do not cause effects arising from antagonism of progesterone activity, such as termination of pregnancy, endometrial thickening and vaginal bleeding. They are “selective” cortisol modulators. The composition of these compounds and their methods of use in a wide range of indications are covered by U.S. and foreign patents.
Our lead compounds have entered the clinic as potential treatments for a variety of serious disorders – Cushing’s syndrome, solid tumors (i.e., advanced, high-grade serous ovarian cancer, metastatic pancreatic cancer, castration-resistant prostate cancer and adrenocortical cancer with cortisol excess), AIWG and NASH.
COVID-19 Pandemic
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, much of the world is subject to public health orders of varying degrees of stringency, including in California, where our headquarters are located, and the states where most of our clinical specialists and medical science liaisons live. Restrictions have also been implemented in the jurisdictions where our clinical trial sites are located. We are exempt from some of these restrictions in some jurisdictions because pharmaceutical companies are often deemed “essential businesses” that are allowed wider freedom to operate. Nonetheless, to protect the public health and the health of our employees, we are conducting a significant portion of our business by means of video and teleconferences and e-mail. Most of our third-party manufacturers, distributors (including the specialty pharmacy that dispenses Korlym), information technology service providers, law and accounting firms, clinical research organizations and others are also subject to pandemic-related restrictions. 
Public health restrictions, as well as measures taken by patients, physicians, hospitals and medical clinics to reduce the risk of coronavirus infection have reduced our sales and made it difficult to grow our Korlym business. Many hospitals and medical practices have suspended or severely restricted visits by pharmaceutical company representatives, which has reduced the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts. When educating physicians about Cushing’s syndrome and Korlym’s potential to benefit their patients, close contact with our clinical specialists is important, especially for physicians who are new to the medication. While we have implemented a program of teleconference and video meetings, which are useful, they are not as effective as meeting in-person. Many physicians and patients have reduced the frequency of office visits, which, together with pandemic-related closures of laboratory facilities and imaging centers and the reluctance of many patients to leave their homes, has made diagnosing and optimally treating patients with Cushing’s syndrome difficult. All of these factors make it difficult to increase the number of patients who receive Korlym, which has reduced our sales, even though there remain many patients who could benefit from the medication but have not received it.
The pandemic’s impact on the pace of our clinical development programs has been variable. Enrollment has slowed significantly in trials of indications not considered immediately life-threatening, such as Cushing’s syndrome, CRPC, AIWG and NASH. In addition, to reduce the risk of COVID-19 transmission and preserve medical resources for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, some clinical sites have stopped enrolling new patients or have reduced the frequency with which physicians see study participants. Some sites have suspended or halted the initiation of new clinical trials. These changes have lengthened the time it will take to complete most of our development programs, although trials in patients with immediately life-threatening diseases, such as advanced pancreatic and ovarian cancer, have experienced many fewer disruptions and delays. 
Please see the risk factor under Item 1A of this Annual Report, “The COVID-19 pandemic or other public health emergencies, natural disasters, terrorism or other catastrophes could disrupt our activities and render our own or our vendors’ facilities and equipment inoperable or inaccessible and require us to curtail or cease operations.”
Cushing’s Syndrome
Background. Cushing’s syndrome is the clinical manifestation of hypercortisolism. An estimated 10 to 15 of every one million people are diagnosed with Cushing’s syndrome each year, resulting in approximately 3,000 new patients and a patient population in the United States of about 20,000, approximately half of whom are cured by surgery. Cushing’s syndrome most often affects adults between the ages of 20 and 50.
Most people with Cushing’s syndrome have one or more of the following symptoms: high blood sugar, diabetes, high blood pressure, upper body obesity, rounded face, increased fat around the neck, thinning arms and legs, severe fatigue and weak muscles. Irritability, anxiety, cognitive disturbances and depression are also common. Cushing’s syndrome can affect every organ system in the body and can be lethal if not treated. The preferred treatment is surgery, which, if successful, can cure the disease. In approximately half of patients, surgery is not successful because the tumor cannot be located or removed completely. Depending on the type of tumor, surgery can also result in a range of complications.
Korlym to Treat Patients with Cushing’s Syndrome. We sell Korlym in the United States, using experienced sales representatives to call on physicians caring for patients with endogenous Cushing’s syndrome (hypercortisolism). Because many people who suffer from Cushing’s syndrome are undiagnosed or inadequately treated, we have developed and continue to refine and expand programs to educate physicians and patients about screening for hypercortisolism and the role Korlym can play in treating the disorder. We also have a field-based force of medical science liaisons.
We use one specialty pharmacy and one specialty distributor to distribute Korlym and provide logistical support to physicians and patients. Our policy is that no patient with Cushing’s syndrome will be denied access to Korlym for financial reasons. To help us achieve that goal, we fund our own patient support programs and donate money to independent charitable foundations that help patients pay for all aspects of their Cushing’s syndrome care, whether or not that care includes taking Korlym.
Relacorilant to Treat Patients with Cushing’s Syndrome. We are conducting two Phase 3 trials of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulator, relacorilant, as a potential treatment for hypercortisolism. Relacorilant was well-tolerated in its Phase 1 and Phase 2 trials. Patients in the Phase 2 trial exhibited meaningful improvements in glucose control and hypertension, as well as weight loss, improved liver function, coagulopathy, cognition, mood, insulin resistance and quality of life. Importantly, relacorilant shares Korlym’s affinity for GR, but unlike Korlym, has no affinity for PR and so does not cause the effects associated with PR affinity, including termination of pregnancy, endometrial thickening and vaginal bleeding. Relacorilant also does not appear to cause hypokalemia (low potassium), a potentially serious adverse event that is the leading cause of patients stopping treatment with Korlym. Forty-four percent of patients in Korlym’s pivotal trial experienced hypokalemia.
Our Phase 3 “GRACE” trial has a planned enrollment of 130 patients at sites in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel. Each patient in GRACE will receive relacorilant for 22 weeks. Those who exhibit pre-specified improvements in hypertension or glucose metabolism will enter a 12-week, double-blind, “randomized withdrawal” phase, in which half of the patients will continue receiving relacorilant and the rest will receive placebo. GRACE’s primary endpoints are the rate and degree of relapse in patients receiving placebo compared to those continuing treatment with relacorilant. If successful, we expect GRACE to provide the basis for a new drug application (“NDA”) for relacorilant to treat patients with all etiologies of Cushing’s syndrome.
Last year, we initiated our double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 3 “GRADIENT” trial to evaluate relacorilant as a potential treatment for patients whose Cushing’s syndrome is caused by an adrenal tumor. Patients with this etiology of Cushing’s syndrome typically have a more indolent course of disease, although their health outcomes are poor. This etiology of Cushing’s syndrome has not been rigorously studied. Patients with adrenal Cushing’s syndrome would benefit from an improved understanding of the role cortisol modulation may play in their treatment.
GRADIENT has a planned enrollment of 130 patients, half of whom will receive relacorilant and half of whom will receive placebo for 26 weeks. GRADIENT’s primary endpoints are improvements in hypertension and glucose metabolism. Many of the clinical sites in GRACE are participating in GRADIENT. Pandemic-related restrictions and disruptions have slowed enrollment in these trials.
The United States Food and Drug Association (“FDA”) and the European Commission (“EC”) have designated relacorilant as an orphan drug for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome. In the United States, relacorilant’s orphan designation confers tax credits, reduced regulatory fees and, provided we obtain approval for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome, seven years of exclusive marketing rights for the treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome. Benefits of orphan drug designation by the EC are similar, but also include protocol assistance from the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”), access to the EU’s centralized marketing authorization procedure and, if we obtain approval, ten years of exclusive marketing rights in the 
European Union (“EU”) for the treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome. The EC based its orphan designation on its finding that there was plausible evidence of relacorilant’s efficacy and potential to confer significant clinical benefit compared to already approved treatments.
In neither the United States nor the EU does orphan drug designation shorten the drug approval process, make approval more likely or prevent competitors from marketing other drugs for the treatment of Cushing’s syndrome.
FKBP5 Gene Expression Assay. The tests used to diagnose patients with hypercortisolism and optimize their treatment are imprecise and often fail to identify patients with less severe manifestations of the disease. We have developed an assay to measure expression of the gene FKBP5, which is stimulated by cortisol activity, and have completed analytical validation pursuant to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (“CLIA”). Clinical data indicate that FKBP5 levels are high in patients suffering from hypercortisolism (i.e., excess cortisol activity), but subside when they are successfully treated. We are testing this hypothesis in the GRACE trial. We believe successful development of this assay will enable physicians to identify new patients with hypercortisolism more easily and to better treat those already in their care.
Oncology
There is substantial in vitro, in vivo and clinical evidence that cortisol’s activity allows certain solid tumors to resist treatment. In some cancers, cortisol activity promotes tumor growth. In other cancers, cortisol stimulates genes that retard cellular apoptosis. Cortisol also suppresses the body’s immune response. However, activating, not suppressing, the immune system is beneficial in fighting certain cancers. Adding a cortisol modulator to a treatment regimen may help the patient’s immune system combat the disease. Many types of solid tumors express GR and are potential targets for cortisol modulation therapy, among them pancreatic, ovarian, castration-resistant prostate and adrenocortical cancer. We own, or have exclusively licensed, several patents covering the use of cortisol modulators to treat pancreatic, cervical, breast and prostate cancers.
Relacorilant in Patients with Solid Tumors. In July 2020, we completed enrollment in our 178-patient, controlled, Phase 2 trial of relacorilant in combination with nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced, high-grade serous ovarian tumors. We randomized two-thirds of the patients to receive relacorilant plus nab-paclitaxel, while the rest receive nab-paclitaxel alone. The trial’s primary endpoint is progression-free survival, as measured using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. Secondary endpoints include overall response rate, duration of response, best overall response and overall survival. We expect data from this trial to be available in the first half of 2021.
We are also conducting a Phase 3 trial (“RELIANT”) of relacorilant plus nab-paclitaxel to treat patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer. RELIANT is expected to enroll 80 patients, all of whom will receive relacorilant plus nab-paclitaxel. We plan to perform an interim analysis of data from the first 43 patients (the last of which enrolled in January 2021) in the first half of 2021.
We have initiated an open-label, Phase 1b trial of relacorilant plus the PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab in 20 patients with advanced adrenocortical cancer with cortisol excess. Because adrenocortical tumors produce cortisol, these patients suffer from both cancer and Cushing’s syndrome. Our trial will evaluate whether relacorilant can, by reducing the effects of excess cortisol activity, treat these patients’ Cushing’s syndrome and, by reversing cortisol-induced immune suppression, help pembrolizumab achieve its maximum tumor-killing effect.
Cortisol Modulators to Treat Patients with CRPC. Because androgens stimulate prostate tumor growth, androgen deprivation is a common treatment for metastatic prostate cancer. Tumors eventually escape androgen deprivation therapy through the proliferation of cells for which cortisol’s stimulation of GR and cortisol’s stimulation of mutated androgen receptors are primary growth factors. Combining a cortisol modulator with an androgen modulator such as Xtandi (enzalutamide) may block this escape route.
We are conducting a dose-finding trial of our proprietary, selective cortisol modulator exicorilant in combination with Xtandi in patients with metastatic CRPC. Independently, investigators at the University of Chicago are conducting a dose-finding trial of relacorilant combined with Xtandi in the same patient population. We are providing relacorilant.
Relacorilant has been designated an orphan drug in both the United States and the EU for the treatment of pancreatic cancer. In addition, we hold U.S. and international patents covering relacorilant’s composition of matter and U.S. patents covering its use to treat patients with pancreatic and ovarian cancer. In addition, we own or have exclusively licensed U.S. and European patents covering relacorilant’s composition of matter and its use to treat a variety of disorders, including pancreatic cancer, castration-resistance prostate cancer (“CRPC”) and other solid tumors.
Metabolic Disorders
Antipsychotic-Induced Weight Gain (“AIWG”). In animal models, our proprietary selective cortisol modulator miricorilant prevents and reverses the weight gain caused by the antipsychotic medication olanzapine. These findings are similar to the results generated with mifepristone in the same animal models and from placebo-controlled clinical trials in which mifepristone significantly reduced the weight gain and adverse metabolic effects experienced by healthy subjects administered olanzapine or the antipsychotic medication risperidone. The results of these trials were published in the journals Advances in Therapy, Gross et al (2009) and Obesity, Gross et al (2010).
Extensive pre-clinical and clinical data suggest that our propriety, selective cortisol modulator miricorilant can prevent weight gain and other metabolic side-effects caused by antipsychotic medications such as olanzapine. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1b trial, 96 healthy subjects received daily doses of olanzapine (10 mg) and either miricorilant (600 mg or 900 mg) or placebo for 14 days. Study participants who received miricorilant gained less weight than subjects receiving placebo. In addition, markers of liver damage that rise temporarily at the start of olanzapine therapy increased less sharply in subjects receiving miricorilant, suggesting that miricorilant may have protective effects in the liver.
We are conducting two Phase 2, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of miricorilant in the reversal of AIWG – “GRATITUDE” and “GRATITUDE II.”
GRATITUDE has a planned enrollment of 100 patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder with recent weight gain at 30 sites in the United States. Study participants will receive their established antipsychotic medication and either miricorilant (600 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks. GRATITUDE II has a planned enrollment of 150 patients with schizophrenia and long-standing AIWG at 35 centers in the United States. The primary endpoint in both trials is reduction in body weight.
NASH. Miricorilant is potent in animal models of fatty liver and liver fibrosis, which are precursors of cirrhosis. We are conducting a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 2 trial that is expected to enroll 150 patients with NASH, as determined by MRI, at 15 sites in the United States. Patients will receive a daily dose of miricorilant (600 mg or 900 mg) or placebo for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint is reduction in liver fat content.
Development of our Other Selective Cortisol Modulators
Our portfolio of proprietary selective cortisol modulators consists of four structurally distinct series totaling more than 1,000 compounds, including relacorilant, exicorilant and miricorilant. These compounds potently bind to GR but not the progesterone, estrogen or androgen receptors. We hold U.S. and foreign patents covering these compounds and their methods of use in a wide range of indications. We have applied, and will continue to apply, for patents covering the composition and method of use of our products and product candidates. See “Business – Intellectual Property.”
Many of our proprietary compounds have demonstrated positive results in animal or in vitro models of cortisol modulation. One such molecule, CORT113176, has shown promise in animal models of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”). It has completed Phase 1 and we plan to advance it to Phase 2 as a potential treatment for that disease. We plan to continue identifying selective cortisol modulators and advancing the most promising of them towards the clinic.
Studies by Independent Investigators
For many years we have advanced our understanding of cortisol modulation by supporting the work of independent academic investigators. These researchers have studied the potential utility of mifepristone or our proprietary selective cortisol modulators in a wide range of disorders, including central serous retinopathy, post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, alcoholism, cocaine addiction, Alzheimer’s disease, ALS, Cushing’s syndrome, metabolic syndrome, atherosclerosis, fatty liver disease and solid tumors, including triple-negative breast, prostate, ovarian and non-small cell lung cancers, as well as sarcoma and melanoma.
Clinical Trial Agreements
We typically conduct our clinical trials with the assistance of clinical research organizations (“CROs”). ICON plc is helping us conduct our GRACE and GRADIENT trials. IQVIA Inc. is helping us conduct our Phase 2 trial of relacorilant to treat patients with metastatic ovarian cancer and our dose-finding trial of exicorilant to treat patients with CRPC. Medpace, Inc. is helping us conduct our GRATITUDE, GRATITUDE II and RELIANT trials. We may terminate our agreements with ICON and IQVIA on 60 days’ written notice. Our agreement with Medpace may be terminated by us without cause at any time.
Research and Development Spending
We incurred $114.8 million, $89.0 million and $75.2 million of research and development expenses in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, which accounted for 51 percent, 46 percent and 47 percent, respectively, of our total operating expenses in those years.
Manufacturing Korlym
We rely on contract manufacturers to produce Korlym and our product candidates. In March 2014, we entered into an agreement with Produits Chimiques Auxiliaires et de Synthese SA (“PCAS”) to produce mifepristone, the active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) in Korlym. In 2018, we amended this agreement and extended its term to December 31, 2021, with two one-year renewals that will occur automatically unless either party gives 12 months advance written notice of its intent not to renew. The amendment also provides for exclusivity between PCAS and Corcept, unless PCAS is unable to meet our requirements, in which case we may purchase mifepristone from another supplier.
We have agreements with two third-party manufacturers to produce and bottle Korlym tablets.
Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (“FDCA”)
The FDCA establishes an approval process for generic versions of already approved (or “Innovator”) drugs through the submission of an Abbreviated New Drug Application (“ANDA”). The proposed generic drug must have the same active ingredients, dosage form, strength, route of administration, labeling, performance characteristics and intended use, among other things, as the Innovator drug. ANDAs are termed “abbreviated” because they need not include data establishing safety or efficacy. Generally, generic applicants must only demonstrate that their product is bioequivalent to, or performs in the same manner as, the Innovator drug.
ANDA applicants must certify that any patents listed by the owner of the Innovator drug in the Orange Book are expired, invalid or will not be infringed by the manufacture, use or sale of the proposed generic product. This is known as a “Paragraph IV certification.” If the owner of the Innovator drug sues the ANDA applicant for infringement of one or more Orange Book patents within 45-days of receiving notice of a Paragraph IV certification, the FDA approval of the ANDA application is automatically stayed until the earlier of (i) 30 months from the receipt of the Paragraph IV certification or (ii) a trial court decision finding the asserted Orange Book patents are invalid, unenforceable or not infringed. This prohibition is commonly referred to as the “30-month stay.” Owners of Innovator drugs regularly challenge paragraph IV certifications and trigger 30-month stays.
We are engaged in ANDA litigation with Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (“Teva”) and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited (“Sun Ltd.”) with respect to their proposed generic versions of Korlym. In addition, Teva challenged the validity of one of our patents in a post grant review (“PGR”) proceeding before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (“PTAB”). In November 2020, the PTAB decided all of Teva’s claims in this PGR in Corcept’s favor. Teva has until March 12, 2021 to file its appeal brief with Federal Circuit Court of Appeals. In addition, on February 1, 2021, we received a Paragraph IV Notice Letter advising that Hikma Pharmaceuticals USA Inc. (“Hikma”) submitted an ANDA to the FDA seeking authorization from the FDA to manufacture, use or sell a generic version of Korlym in the United States. Under the terms of the Hatch Waxman Act, we have until March 15, 2021 to bring suit against Hikma.
See “Part I, Item 3, Legal Proceedings.”
Competition for Korlym
Korlym competes with established treatments, including surgery, radiation and other medications, including “off-label” uses of drugs such as ketoconazole, an anti-fungal medication. Korlym also competes with Signifor® (pasireotide) Injection and Isturisa® (osilodrostat). Both drugs are sold by the Italian pharmaceutical company Recordati S.p.A. (“Recordati”). Both drugs are approved by the FDA for the treatment of adult patients with Cushing’s disease who are not candidates for pituitary surgery or for whom surgery did not work. Cushing’s disease is a subset of Cushing’s syndrome. In the EU, Isturisa is also approved as a treatment for Cushing’s syndrome.
The orphan drug marketing exclusivity period for Korlym ended in February 2019, which means a competitor that receives FDA approval for a generic equivalent of Korlym may market its drug to patients with Cushing’s syndrome, provided doing so would not infringe any of our patents. Korlym may also experience competition from new compounds. Strongbridge Biopharma plc is seeking approval in the United States and Europe to market levoketoconazole, a chiral form of the commonly-prescribed cortisol synthesis inhibitor ketoconazole, as a treatment for patients with Cushing’s syndrome.
Intellectual Property
Patents and other proprietary rights are important to our business. We own ten U.S. composition of matter patents covering our selective cortisol modulators and 55 U.S. patents covering the use of cortisol modulators to treat a variety of serious disorders, including Cushing’s syndrome and own an extensive portfolio of patents in countries around the world. We have applied, and will continue to apply, for U.S. and foreign patents covering the composition and method of use of our products and product candidates.
Korlym. The composition of matter patent covering Korlym’s active ingredient, mifepristone, has expired. The only other FDA-approved use of mifepristone is to terminate pregnancy. We hold 16 U.S. method of use patents listed in the FDA Orange Book covering various uses of Korlym in the treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome, with additional patent applications that may be suitable for listing in the Orange Book under examination at the USPTO. Our current Orange Book patents have expiration dates ranging from 2028 to 2038.
To protect our market for Korlym we rely on (1) our method of use patents, (2) the significant restrictions imposed by the FDA on the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy and (3) the different patient populations, administering physicians and treatment settings between the use of mifepristone to terminate pregnancy and to treat Cushing’s syndrome.
Oncology. We have exclusively licensed eight U.S. method of use patents from the University of Chicago covering the use of glucocorticoid receptor antagonists, including mifepristone, in the treatment of castration-resistant prostate cancer in combination with androgen deprivation agents and triple-negative breast cancer in combination with anti-cancer agents. This license also covers related applications in countries around the world. See “Business - License Agreements.”
Other Method of Use Patents. In addition to our patents relating to Cushing’s syndrome, we own U.S. and foreign patents for the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, weight gain caused by antipsychotic medications, mild cognitive impairment, delirium, catatonia, psychosis induced by interferon-alpha therapy, migraine headaches, gastroesophageal reflux disease, neurological damage in premature infants and in the treatment of diseases using combination steroid and GR antagonist therapy. We own patents covering the optimization of mifepristone plasma levels in the treatment of patients suffering from disorders, including Cushing’s syndrome, amenable to treatment with mifepristone. We also own patents covering prevention and treatment of stress disorders, improvement of therapeutic response to electroconvulsive therapy and inhibition of cognitive deterioration in adults with Down’s Syndrome. The expiration dates of these patents and their foreign counterparts range from 2020 to 2039.
Composition of Matter Patents Covering Our Proprietary, Selective Cortisol Modulators. We have ten U.S. composition of matter patents containing claims relating to our next-generation cortisol modulators. Foreign counterparts of five of these patents have issued in Europe. The expiration dates of these patents and their foreign counterparts range from 2025 to 2034.
We have filed, in appropriate jurisdictions, foreign patent applications corresponding to our U.S. patents and applications. We cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of patents, that any issued patent will include claims of the breadth we are seeking, or that competitors or other third-parties will not successfully challenge or circumvent our patents if they are issued.
We believe our patents are valid and do not infringe the patents or other proprietary rights of others. Accordingly, we believe we are not obligated to pay royalties relating to the use of intellectual property to any third parties except the University of Chicago, from which we have licensed certain patents.
License Agreements
We have exclusively licensed from the University of Chicago eight U.S. patents for (a) the use of cortisol modulators in the treatment of triple-negative breast cancer, and (b) the use of cortisol modulators to treat castration-resistant prostate cancer. We are required to pay the University of Chicago customary milestone fees and royalties on revenue from products commercialized under the issued patents or patents that may issue pursuant to the pending applications. Our license will end upon expiration of the licensed patents in 2031 and 2033 or upon notification by us to the University of Chicago. Three patents that were licensed from Stanford University expired in October 2018. See “Business – Intellectual Property.”
Government Regulation
Prescription pharmaceutical products are subject to extensive pre- and post-approval regulation governing the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising and promotion of the products under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. All of our product candidates require regulatory approval by government agencies prior to commercialization and are subject to continued regulatory oversight thereafter. Before a new drug may be marketed in the United States the FDA generally requires completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing, performance of adequate and 
well-controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug’s intended use and approval by the FDA. Complying with these and other federal and state statutes and regulations involves significant time and expense.
If the FDA approves the marketing of a new drug, physicians may prescribe it to patients in the United States. The FDA may withdraw its approval at any time if compliance with regulatory standards is not maintained. The drug developer must submit periodic reports to the FDA, including reports of adverse patient experiences, which could cause the FDA to impose marketing restrictions through labeling changes or remove the drug from the market. The FDA may also require post-approval studies, referred to as “Phase 4 studies,” to monitor or further explore the effect of approved products, and may limit marketing of the drug based on the results of such studies.
The FDA imposes complex regulations regarding the promotion and sale of pharmaceuticals, including standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, off-label promotion, and industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Failure to abide by these regulations can result in penalties including the issuance of a warning letter directing a company to correct deviations from FDA regulations, mandated modification of promotional materials and labeling and the issuance of corrective information in addition to state and federal civil and criminal penalties.
Facilities involved in the manufacture of drugs must comply with FDA-mandated current Good Manufacturing Practices regulations (“cGMP”) and are subject to periodic inspection by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Failure to comply with statutory and regulatory requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, including suspension of manufacturing or a product recall.
Marketing Approvals Outside the United States
If we choose to distribute our product candidates outside the United States, we (or our potential future partners) will have to complete an approval process similar to the one imposed by the FDA. The approval procedure and the time required for approval vary from country to country and may involve additional preclinical and clinical trials. Foreign approvals may not be granted on a timely basis, or at all. Regulatory approval of pricing is required in most countries other than the United States, which pricing may be too low to generate an acceptable return. We are not seeking regulatory approval to market Korlym outside the United States.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which they will be covered by government health care programs and commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. Third-party payers are increasingly limiting coverage and reducing reimbursements for medical products and services, although this trend has not to-date had a material impact on the amount or timing of our revenues. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures could limit our revenue. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our products or a decision by a third-party payer to not cover our products could reduce our sales and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.
Other Healthcare Laws
We are subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states where we conduct business. These laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physicians’ sunshine laws and regulations. Foreign governments have comparable regulations.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person from knowingly and willfully offering, soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The Anti-Kickback Statute is subject to evolving interpretations. In the past, the government has enforced the Anti-Kickback Statute to reach large settlements with healthcare companies based on sham consulting and other financial arrangements with physicians. Further, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of these statutes or specific intent to violate them to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
Additionally, the civil False Claims Act prohibits knowingly presenting or causing the presentation of a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to the U.S. government. Actions under the False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a qui tam action by a private individual in the name of the government. In addition, the government may assert 
that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act. Violations of the False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. The federal government is using the False Claims Act, and the accompanying threat of significant liability, in its investigation and prosecution of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies in connection with the promotion of products for unapproved uses and other sales and marketing practices. The government has obtained multi-billion dollar settlements under the False Claims Act in addition to individual criminal convictions under applicable criminal statutes. We expect that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program. In addition, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates who conduct certain activities for or on their behalf involving protected health information on their behalf. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, or the FTCA, 15 U.S.C § 45(a). The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. The FTC’s guidance for appropriately securing consumers’ personal information is similar to what is required by the HIPAA Security Rule.
In addition, there has been increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and other healthcare providers. The Patent Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”), among other things, imposes new reporting requirements on drug manufacturers for payments made by them to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain health care professionals beginning in 2022 and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Failure to submit required information may result in significant civil monetary penalties for any payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission. Drug manufacturers must report such payments to the government by the 90th day of each calendar year. Certain states also mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, impose restrictions on drug manufacturer marketing practices and/or require the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians.
State and foreign laws and regulations restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry and complicate our compliance efforts. For example, some states require companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the federal government’s compliance guidance or otherwise restrict payments to healthcare providers and other potential referral sources. Some states require manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information. Some state and local governments require the public registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives.
Certain state and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in ways that differ significantly from one another and are not preempted by HIPAA. For example, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for “protected health information” maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect in May 2018 and imposes stringent data protection requirements for controllers and processors of personal data of persons within the EU. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EU as well as to those outside the EU if they collect and use personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to individuals in the EU or the monitoring of their behavior. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. In addition, the United Kingdom leaving the EU could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. It remains unclear how the United Kingdom data protection laws or regulations will develop in the medium to longer term and how data transfer to the United Kingdom from the EU will be regulated, especially following the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU on January 31, 2020. However, the United Kingdom has transposed the GDPR into domestic law with the Data Protection Act 2018, which remains in force following the United Kingdom’s departure from the EU.
The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.
Data Privacy and Security
Numerous state, federal and foreign laws and regulations govern the collection of, disclosure of, use of, access to, transfer of, and confidentiality and security of health-related and other personal information, and could apply now or in the future to our operations or the operations of our partners. For example, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and their implementing regulations, imposes requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of protected health information on HIPAA covered entities, which include certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, and their business associates who conduct certain activities for or on their behalf involving protected health information on their behalf. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Further, entities that knowingly receive individually identifiable health information from a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA may be subject to criminal penalties. 
Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure constitutes unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities. Individually identifiable health information is considered sensitive data that merits stronger safeguards. 
Certain state and foreign laws also govern the privacy and security of health information in ways that differ significantly from one another and are not preempted by HIPAA. For example, California recently enacted legislation, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020. The CCPA, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for health-related information, including clinical trial data, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), recently passed in California. The CPRA will impose additional data protection obligations on covered businesses, including additional consumer rights processes, limitations on data uses, new audit requirements for higher risk data, and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It will also create a new California data protection agency authorized to issue substantive regulations and could result in increased privacy and information security enforcement. The majority of the provisions will go into effect on January 1, 2023, and additional compliance investment and potential business process changes may be required.
In Europe, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, went into effect in May 2018 and imposes stringent data protection requirements for controllers and processors of personal data of persons within the EU. The GDPR applies to any company established in the EU or the EEA as well as to those outside the EU or the EEA if they collect and use personal data in connection with the offering of goods or services to individuals in the EU or the monitoring of their behavior. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the EC does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws; in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States by invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield and imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses, which could increase our costs and our ability to efficiently process personal data from the EEA. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. In addition, the United Kingdom leaving the EU could also lead to further legislative and regulatory changes. Relatedly, following the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the European Economic Area and the European Union, and the expiry of the transition period, companies have to comply with both the GDPR and the GDPR 
as incorporated into United Kingdom national law, the latter regime having the ability to separately fine up to the greater of £17.5 million or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, for example around how data can lawfully be transferred between each jurisdiction, which may expose us to further compliance risk.
