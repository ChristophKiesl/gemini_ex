ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

On July 27, 2020 (the Closing Date), we entered into a Share Exchange Agreement (the Exchange Agreement) by and among (i) the Company, (ii) Zhi Yuan Limited, a Cayman Islands company (Cayman Company), and (iii) the three beneficial shareholders of Cayman Company (each, a Cayman Company Shareholder and collectively, the Cayman Company Shareholders).

Pursuant to the terms of the Exchange Agreement, the Cayman Company Shareholders agreed to sell to Cang Bao, and Cang Bao agreed to purchase, all shares of Cayman Company held by them, which shares represent 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of Cayman Company. In exchange, Cang Bao agreed to issue to the Cayman Company Shareholders an aggregate of 75,000,000 shares of Cang Bao common stock, representing approximately 67.98% of Cang Baos total issued and outstanding common stock (the Share Exchange).

Our directors approved the Exchange Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. Simultaneously, the directors of Cayman Company also approved the Exchange Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. The Share Exchange closed on July 27, 2020. Both Yaqin Fu, who is the wife of one of our directors, and Mr. Xingtao Zhou, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, Chairman of the Board and principal shareholder, were Cayman Company Shareholders who exchanged their Cayman Company shares for shares of the Company. After giving effect to the Share Exchange, Mr. Zhou owns 59,839,271 shares of our common stock, which represents 54.24% of our outstanding common stock, and 100% of our issued and outstanding preferred shares.

As a result of the Share Exchange, Cayman Company became our wholly owned subsidiary and we are its public holding company. After giving effect to the Share Exchange, the Company acquired 100% of the assets and operations of Cayman Company and its subsidiaries, the business and operations of which now constitutes our primary business and operations. After giving effect to the Share Exchange, we own 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Cayman Company. Cayman Company is a holding company that owns Cangyun (Hong Kong) Limited (Hong Kong Company), which in turn owns and controls Shanghai Cangyun Management Consulting Co., Ltd. (Management Consulting), which has entered into contractual agreements to control Hainan Cangbao Tianxia Cultural Relic Co., Ltd. (Hainan) and Cangbao Tianxia (Shanghai) Cultural Relic Co., Ltd. (Tianxia Cultural Relic, and together with Hainan, the Target Companies or VIEs). 

The Exchange Agreement contains customary representations, warranties, covenants and conditions for a transaction of this type for the benefit of the parties.

For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Share Exchange qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the Code). However, we did not obtain any tax opinion and there can be no assurance that our intent that the Share Exchange qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a) of the Code is correct. Cayman Company is considered the acquirer for accounting and financial reporting purposes. The assets and liabilities of Cayman Company have been brought forward at their book value and no goodwill has been recognized. As a result of the acquisition of all the issued and outstanding shares of Cayman Company, we have now assumed Cayman Companys business operations as our own. 

The description of the Exchange Agreement and the transactions contemplated by the Exchange Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Exchange Agreement filed as Exhibit 2.1 to our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on July 27, 2020, and incorporated herein by reference.

Immediately prior to the closing of the Share Exchange described above pursuant to which Cayman Company became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, the Company was a shell company, as such term is defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Item 2.01(f) of Form 8-K states that if the registrant was a shell company, such as the Company was immediately before the Share Exchange, then the registrant must disclose on a Current Report on Form 8-K the information that would be required if the registrant were filing a general form for registration of securities on Form 10. Accordingly, this Current Report on Form 8-K includes all of the information that would be included in a Form 10.

The Share Exchange was accounted as a business combination under common control, in which all of the combining entities or businesses are ultimately controlled by the same party or parties, both before and after the business combination, and that control is not transitory. The business combination under common control of accounting is based on the historical consolidated financial statements of the Company and Cayman Company. In accordance with ASC 805-50-45-5, for transactions between entities under common control, financial statements and financial information presented for prior periods have been retroactively adjusted to furnish comparative information. The financial statements are presented retrospectively, as though the Share Exchange Agreement between the Company and Cayman Company occurred at the beginning of the first period presented.

Corporate History

Cang Bao

Cang Bao was incorporated in the State of Nevada on March 13, 2002, as Equicap, Inc. (Equicap), for the purpose of entering into a merger with and re-domiciling its predecessor, Equicap, Inc., a California corporation ("Equicap California"). Effective January 25, 2005, Equicap California was merged with and into Equicap in a statutory merger based on management's belief that Nevada law is more advantageous to a corporation than California law. Equicap was considered a blank check company until its March 2007 acquisition of Usunco Automotive Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (Usunco). Equicap, Inc. changed its name to Zhongchai Machinery, Inc. (Zhongchai or the Company) on May 21, 2010.
 
Zhongchai, a Nevada corporation, was a manufacturer and distributor of gears and gearboxes and drive axles that were marketed and sold to equipment manufacturers in China.
 
On July 6, 2007, the Board of Directors of Zhejiang Zhongchai Machinery Co., Ltd. (Zhejiang Zhongchai), the China based and 75% owned subsidiary of the Company, approved and finalized an Exchange Agreement (Exchange Agreement) with Xinchang Keyi Machinery Co., Ltd., (Keyi) a corporation incorporated in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC). Pursuant to the Exchange Agreement, Zhejiang Zhongchai purchased all the outstanding equity of Zhejiang Shengte Transmission Co., Ltd. (Shengte) from Keyi, the sole owner of Shengte, for approximately $3.7 million.
 
On March 7, 2007, the Company and Usunco Automotive, Ltd. (Usunco), a British Virgin Islands company, entered into an agreement (the Usunco Agreement) which was consummated on March 9, 2007. Under the terms of the Usunco Agreement, the Company acquired all of the outstanding equity securities of Usunco in exchange for 18,323,944 shares of the Companys common stock.
 
Because the Company had been a public shell company prior to the Usunco Agreement, that share exchange was treated as a recapitalization of the Company. As such, the historical financial information prior to that share exchange was that of Usunco and its subsidiaries. Historical share amounts were restated to reflect the effect of that share exchange.

On June 18, 2006, Usunco acquired 100% of IBC Automotive Products Inc (IBC), a California Corporation as of May 14, 2004 (date of inception), through the issuance of 28% of Usuncos shares. IBC was considered a predecessor business to Usunco as its operations constituted the business activities of Usunco formed to consummate the acquisition of IBC. The consolidated financial statements reflected all predecessor statements of income and cash flow activities from the inception of IBC in May 2004.
 
On June 15, 2009, IBC was sold to certain management persons of IBC in exchange for the following: (i) the cancellation of an aggregate of 555,994 shares of common stock of the Company which those individuals owned, and (ii) the payment of $60,000 in installments pursuant to the terms of an unsecured promissory note, the final payment of which was made on November 15, 2010. As part of the transaction, the Company cancelled $428,261 through the closing date, of inter-company debt which funds had been used in the business of IBC prior to the transaction.
 
On September 22, 2009, Xinchang Xian Lisheng Machinery Co., Ltd. (Lisheng) was incorporated by Zhejiang Zhongchai and two individual investors. The total registered capital of Lisheng was RMB 5 million, of which Zhejiang Zhongchai accounted for 60%. The Company started production of die casting products in 2010 for use in gearboxes, diesel engines and other machinery products.

On December 16, 2009, Zhongchai Machinery and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Usunco and Zhongchai Holding (Hong Kong) Limited, a Hong Kong company (Zhongchai Holding), took action to approve transfer of the shares of Zhejiang Zhongchai Machinery Co., from Usunco to Zhongchai Holding. The transfer was completed on December 23, 2009. The purpose of the transfer was to take advantage of the tax treaty between the PRC and the Special Administrative Region of Hong Kong which reduces the withholding tax rate of the PRC on payments to entities outside of China. Usunco, which no longer had any assets after transferring all of them to Zhongchai Holding, was subsequently dissolved. The consolidated financial statements accounted for Zhejiang Zhongchai Machinery Co., in the same manner as before the transfer of the ownership. Shareholder approval by the shareholders of Zhongchai Machinery was not required under Nevada law, as there was no sale of all or substantially all the assets of the Company. The shareholder ownership and shareholder rights of Zhongchai Machinery remained the same as before the transaction.
 
On April 26, 2010, Zhongchai Holding (Hong Kong) Limited. (Zhongchai Holding), which owned 75% of the equity in Zhejiang Zhongchai Machinery Co., Ltd. (Zhejiang Zhongchai), executed an agreement (the Zhejiang Agreement) with Xinchang Keyi Machinery Co., Ltd., (Keyi) a corporation incorporated in the PRC. Pursuant to the Zhegiang Agreement, Zhongchai Holding purchased the residual 25% equity of Zhejiang Zhongchai Machinery Co., Ltd. (Zhejiang Zhongchai) from Keyi, for $2.6 million. The Zhegiang Agreement was approved by the local government agency and a new business license was issued as a Wholly Foreign Owned Enterprise.
 
On July 26, 2011, the Company held a Special Meeting of Shareholders. At the Special Meeting, the Companys shareholders approved the termination the Companys periodic reporting obligations under the Exchange Act, thereby foregoing many of the expenses associates with operating as a public company subject to SEC reporting obligations. Three days later, the Company terminated its registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Following such termination, the Company became dormant.

On July 27, 2011, the Company approved a 1-for-120 reverse stock split of its then outstanding shares of the Companys Common Stock.
 
On May 11, 2018, the Eighth Judicial District Court of Nevada appointed Custodian Ventures, LLC as custodian for Zhongchai Machinery, Inc., proper notice having been given to the officers and directors of Zhongchai Machinery, Inc. There was no opposition.
 
On May 16, 2018, the Company filed a Certificate of Revival with the State of Nevada, appointing David Lazar as President, Secretary, Treasurer and sole Director. On June 19, 2018, the Company issued 3,096,200 shares of common stock to David Lazar, at par value of $0.001, for services valued at $3,096.20, and issued 10,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock to David Lazar, at par value of $0.001, for services valued at $4,000,000.
 
On December 28, 2018, a change of control of the Company took place. Mr. Xingtao Zhou acquired all 10,000,000 shares of Series A Preferred Stock previously owned by Mr. Lazar; and Mr. Zhou and Yaqin Fu acquired, respectively, 2,432,351 and 663,849 common shares previously owned by Mr. Lazar, who resigned as an officer and director and appointed Mr. Zhou as a director, CEO and CFO, and appointed Ms. Fus husband, Liang Tan, as a director.

On January 8, 2019, by majority consent of its principal shareholders, the Company changed its corporate name in Nevada from Zhongchai Machinery, Inc. to Cang Bao Tian Xia International Art Trade Center, Inc., its current name; and shortly thereafter, the Companys trading symbol was changed to TXCB.

At the closing of the Share Exchange on July 27, 2020, Cayman Company became our wholly owned subsidiary and we are its public holding company. Prior to the Share Exchange, we were a shell, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We had no active business, and virtually no assets. 

After giving effect to the Share Exchange, the Company acquired 100% of the assets and operations of Cayman Company and its subsidiaries, the business and operations of which now constitute our primary business and operations. After giving effect to the Share Exchange, we own 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Cayman Company. Cayman Company is a holding company that owns Hong Kong Company, which in turn owns and controls Management Consulting, which has entered into contractual agreements to control the Target Companies.

Variable Interest Entity Arrangements 
 
In establishing our business, we have used a variable interest entity (VIE) structure. In the PRC, investment activities by foreign investors are principally governed by the Guidance Catalog of Industries for Foreign Investment, which was promulgated and is amended from time to time by the PRC Ministry of Commerce (MOC), and the PRC National Development and Reform Commission (the NDRC). In June 2018, the Guidance Catalog of Industries for Foreign Investment was replaced by the Special Administrative Measures (Negative List) for Foreign Investment Access (2018 Version) (the Negative List). The Negative List divides industries into two categories: restricted and prohibited. Industries not listed in the Negative List are generally open to foreign investment unless specifically restricted by other PRC regulations. Our Company and Management Consulting are considered as foreign investors or foreign invested enterprises under PRC law.
 
Although the business we conduct or will conduct through each VIE is not within the category in which foreign investment is currently restricted under the Negative List or other PRC Laws, we expect that in the future, the Target Companies will engage in marketing survey services for online marketplaces. Marketing survey services are within the category in which foreign investment is restricted pursuant to the Negative List. In addition, we intend to centralize our management and operation in the PRC to avoid being restricted in conducting certain business activities which are important for our current or future business but are currently restricted or might be restricted in the future. As such, we believe the agreements between Management Consulting and each VIE are necessary and essential for our business operation. These contractual arrangements with each VIE and its shareholders enable us to exercise effective control over the VIEs and hence consolidate their financial results as our VIE.

In our case, Management Consulting effectively assumed management of the business activities of each our VIEs through a series of agreements which are referred to as the VIE Agreements. The VIE Agreements are comprised of a series of agreements, including the Management Consultation Service Agreement, dated August 8, 2019, by and among Management Consulting, the VIEs and the three Cayman Company Shareholders, (the Management Agreement), the Equity Pledge Agreement, dated August 8, 2019, by and among Management Consulting, the Target Companies and the three Cayman Company Shareholders (the Pledge Agreement), the Call Option Agreement, dated August 8, 2019, by and among Management Consulting, the Target Companies and the three Cayman Company Shareholders (the Option Agreement) and the Proxy Agreement , dated August 8, 2019, by and among Management Company, the Target Companies and the three Cayman Company Shareholders, (the Proxy Agreement). Through the VIE Agreements, Management Consulting has the right to advise, consult, manage and operate the VIEs for an annual consulting service fee in the amount of 100% of the VIEs net profit. The shareholders of the VIEs have pledged all of their right, title and equity interest in the VIEs as security for Management Consulting to collect consulting services fees provided to the VIEs through the Pledge Agreement. In order to further reinforce Management Consultings right to control and operate the VIEs, the VIEs shareholders have granted Management Consulting an exclusive right and option to acquire all of their equity interests in the VIE through the Pledge Agreement. 

Management Consulting has entered into a series of VIE agreements with the Target Companies shareholders, upon the same material terms as described above. The material terms of the VIE Agreements with the Target Companies are as follows:
 
Management Consultation Service Agreement. Pursuant to the Management Consultation Service Agreement between (a) Management Consulting, and (b) Hainan Cangbao Tianxia Cultural Relic Co., Ltd. and Cangbao Tianxia (Shanghai) Cultural Relic Co. (the Target Companies or VIEs), dated August 8, 2019, Management Consulting has the exclusive right to provide consultation and services to the Target Companies in the areas of funding, human resources, technology and intellectual property rights. For such services, the Target Companies have agreed to pay service fees in the amount of 100% of their net income, and also have the obligation to absorb 100% of their own losses. Management Consulting exclusively owns any intellectual property rights arising from the performance of this Management Consultation Service Agreement. The Management Consultation Service Agreement terminates at the same time as the Equity Pledge Agreement, described in the next paragraph.

Equity Pledge Agreement. Pursuant to the Equity Pledge Agreement dated August 8, 2019, among Management Consulting, the Target Companies, the Target Companies shareholders, who are our CEO Mr. Zhou, Yaqin Fu (the wife of Liang Tan, a director of the Company), and Wei Wang (also, the Pledgors), each of three persons pledged all of their equity interests in the Target Companies to Management Consulting to guarantee the Target Companies performance of relevant obligations and indebtedness under the Management Consultation Service Agreement and the other control agreements (collectively, the Control Agreements). If the Pledgors breach their obligations under the Control Agreements, Management Consulting, as pledgee, will be entitled to certain rights, including the right to dispose of the pledged equity interests in order to recover the damages associated with such breaches. The Pledgors obligations shall be continuously valid until all of the Pledgors are no longer shareholders of the Target Companies, or until the satisfaction of all of the Pledgors obligations under the Control Agreements.
Call Option Agreement. Pursuant to the Call Option Agreement among Management Consulting, the Target Companies and the Pledgors, dated August 8, 2019, Management Consulting has the exclusive right to require that the Pledgors fulfill and complete all approval and registration procedures required under PRC laws for Management Consulting to purchase, or designate one or more persons to purchase, such shareholders equity interests in the Target Companies , in one or multiple transactions, at any time or from time to time, at Management Consultings sole and absolute discretion. The purchase price shall be the lowest price allowed by PRC laws. The Equity Option Agreements shall remain effective until all the equity interests in the Target Companies owned by the Pledgors have been legally transferred to Management Consulting or its designee(s).
Proxy Agreement. Pursuant to the Proxy Agreement among Management Consulting, the Pledgors and the Target Companies, dated August 8, 2019, the Pledgors irrevocably appointed Management Consulting or Management Consultings designee to exercise all of their rights as a shareholder of the Target Companies, including but not limited to the power to exercise all such shareholders voting rights with respect to all matters to be discussed and voted in shareholder meetings of the Target Companies. The Proxy Agreement remains effective until all equity interests in the Target Companies owned by the Pledgors have been legally transferred to Management Consulting or its designee(s).
Business Model 

Operation Description
 .
 The operation team defined the unique operation mode of "3+1" of Cangbao Tian Xia as the core orientation of the project. The closed loop of project operation was achieved through interlocking organic logic, and the revenue generation prospect of the project is being realized through the close combination of financial means and member ports. Since its inception, Cang Bao Tian Xia has developed from a single offline product line to rapidly growing product diversification in multiple regions in mainland China. The Treasure World-created online App is geared to the needs of the market, as a new window to be multiplied by the rapid development of Internet and the Internet of things change, to the developing trend of our brand platform, thus effectively expanding the flow ports and enhancing the capacity of solid flow, i.e., the flow "member", "collection flow" and "capital flow." At the same time, with the help of cooperative insurance guarantee social credibility behind the brand influence, our professional appraisal team identifies trading opportunities, eventually to form an "objects, people, gold" ideal situation of the inner loop.

We believe that the characteristics and style of the Chinese consumer market will directly determine the treasure of the Treasure World, and will create the financial services needed to get the full extent of the consumer market acceptance and highest market sense of affinity, loan products and financial services within the Chinese consumer market demand in the global consumer market. 

Becoming a member of the Treasure World is a very low threshold for consumer groups in the market to access the Treasure Circle. We believe that the lowering of entry standards will not have an impact on industry or brand endorsements, and instead, it will introduce our Company as the most professional collection appraisal agency providing appraisal services for collections on the platform and world-class insurance companies providing high-quality assessment guarantees for collections and transactions on the platform. Therefore, with the people-friendly standards of the Treasure World, stronger brand endorsements and market recognition and satisfaction will grow. And at the same time, with our appraisals, transactions and other links performed inside our brand platform, our membership will continue to grow and reflect the significance of the Treasure World.

We believe that the advantages of membership creation are reflected in several aspects:

·
 First, the new online app and offline access port makes it easier for unfamiliar persons in the market to become members, and the simple and convenient operation process enhances the members' experience and identity multiples.

·
 Second, with the credibility of world-class insurance brands behind the Treasure World, the pure collection appraisal trading platform service will become a world-class professional collection comprehensive ecosystem. Through professional guarantees, any member, any collection and any transaction can be carried out in a safe, just and strong environment, increase membership, collections and capital market behavior from hierarchy to another level, to enhance the experience and guarantee protection.

·
 Third, members can make financial investments in any collection in the platform built by the brand, avoiding the situation of collection value-added income that can only be achieved by owning a collection independently. Membership broadens the traditional restrictions of the industry, and allow any member to effectively invest in any collection in which the member is interested, and receive the corresponding benefits brought by the increase in the value of the collection in the market;

·
 Fourth, transactions of all collections in which all members of the brand platform to which they belong will be conducted under the effective supervision of the platform, which enhances the protection of member transactions, and at the same time, carries out effective regular flow of capital within the platform. The effective flow of collections under the platform can bring non-member consumer groups in the market organically into the platform, and thus become effective registered members of the platform. At the same time, members in the platform display their collections to the platform, thereby forming the mutual promotional effect of "members pulling new collections, collections carrying new members" positively guiding the organic cycle.

·
 Fifth, the effective expansion of new members will be guided by the platform's active policy during the operation of the platform, encouraging new members to actively join, thus rapidly growing and changing the platform as currently established. The platform's evaluation of the number of final members is unpredictable, because the openness of the platform will determine that the port to enter the platform is infinite, because the professionalism of the platform will determine that the endorsement of the platform will occupy the mainstream position in the market, and because the circulation of the platform will determine that the amount of resources lost by the platform will be minimal. Therefore, in terms of the acquisition of new members and the reciprocating operation of various links within the platform, we believe that the operation mechanism of Booty World will make it a leading brand in the global consumer market. 

Professional Appraisal

Behind the brand, there are national and internationally recognized professional appraisal experts to ensure that each piece of collection is well-documented and real, after passing the treasure appraisal, and are responsible for each piece of art collection. 
Professional Team

Treasure World has what it believes is a very professional appraisal team. We have retained domestic and international talents in the process of forming the team, so that Treasure World is filled with world-class talents in all fields and positions. In terms of warehousing and storage, financial services, operation planning, cross-industry cooperation, etc., high-quality talents have formed an outstanding team. In 2018, the Treasure World section of the treasure track recorded by Treasure World began broadcasting on 9 Chinese TV stations across the country, premiering on Saturdays throughout the year and rebroadcasting on Sundays,

In 2019, Treasure World launched this section on television stations in various provinces across the country to better serve global collectors.

The industry's first to adopt VR 2.0 technology, "3 60 ° + 720 °" display collections, global collections online "touch" collection textures, effectively captures the eyes of global collection experts, collection enthusiasts and outsiders, through offline promotion. This unique model for the industry has effectively reduced the industry threshold for the collection industry. At the same time, we use VR 2.0 technology to achieve part of the transparency of the collection information. The most professional technology products of the society at this stage are used in the Treasure World industry. Psychology collects a large number of new treasure enthusiasts and effectively increases market share.

Competition 

The art e-commerce market is highly competitive and many traditional art galleries and auction houses may provide a platform for artwork owners to sell their collections. However, we believe that their trading model is substantially different from ours. As of August 31, 2020, we believe that there were at least five active art e-commerce platforms operating nationwide in China. These trading service providers compete with each other for customers and trading volume based on factors including brand, technology, research and customer services.
 
Although some of our competitors have greater financial resources or larger customer bases than we do, we believe that our proprietary technology platform, our comprehensive customer services and strong brand recognition in the industry will enable us to compete effectively in the fast evolving art e-commerce trading industry in the PRC.

Government Regulation 

All of our operations are located in China. Accordingly, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations are influenced to a significant degree by political, economic and social conditions in China generally and by continued economic growth in China as a whole, as to which there can be no assurance. 
Intellectual Property

The Company owns the intellectual property of an APP and a customized tablet, which enable our customers to communicate and list artworks to trade, as well as to facilitate membership enrollment and artworks trade. The Company also owns the domain name of www.txcb.com.
Research and Development

In the fiscal year ended September 30, 2019, we spent $-0- on research and development of our APP and tablet. Our APP was launched on January 3, 2020, and was purchased from a third party, after research and development had been completed. The third party also provides ongoing technical support and maintenance services. 
Marketing Strategy 

Our ability to establish effective marketing campaigns is the key to our success. Our advertisements promote our corporate image and our services. We believe that effectively developing and maintaining awareness of our brand is critical to attracting new and retaining existing clients. Successful promotion of our brand and our ability to attract quality clients depends largely on the effectiveness of our marketing efforts and the success of the channels we use to promote our services. Our efforts to build our brand have caused us to incur marketing and advertising expenses in the amount of approximately $1,600,000 in 2019, which was reduced to approximately $20,000 in the first three months of 2020, the reduction being due to the Chinese New Year and COVID-19. 

It is likely that our future marketing efforts will require us to incur significant additional expenses as we expand our business.
