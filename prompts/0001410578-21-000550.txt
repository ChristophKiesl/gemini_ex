ITEM 1. BUSINESS
The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and other financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Corporate Overview
Arch Therapeutics, Inc., (together with its subsidiary, the “Company” or “Arch”) was incorporated under the laws of the State of Nevada on September 16, 2009, under the name “Almah, Inc.”. Effective June 26, 2013, the Company completed a merger (the “Merger”) with Arch Biosurgery, Inc. (formerly known as Arch Therapeutics, Inc.), a Massachusetts corporation (“ABS”), and Arch Acquisition Corporation (“Merger Sub”), the Company’s wholly owned subsidiary formed for the purpose of the transaction, pursuant to which Merger Sub merged with and into ABS and ABS thereby became the wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. As a result of the acquisition of ABS, the Company abandoned its prior business plan and changed its operations to the business of a biotechnology company. Our principal offices are located in Framingham, Massachusetts.
ABS was incorporated under the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts on March 6, 2006 as Clear Nano Solutions, Inc. On April 7, 2008, ABS changed its name from Clear Nano Solutions, Inc. to Arch Therapeutics, Inc. Effective upon the closing of the Merger, ABS changed its name from Arch Therapeutics, Inc. to Arch Biosurgery, Inc.
The Company only recently commenced commercial sales of our first product, AC5® Advanced Wound System, and has devoted substantially all of our operational effort to the research, development and regulatory programs necessary to turn our core technology into commercial products. To date, the Company has principally raised capital through debt borrowings, the issuance of convertible debt, and the issuance of units consisting of common stock and warrants.
The Company expects to incur substantial expenses for the foreseeable future relating to research, development and commercialization of its potential products. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be successful in securing additional resources when needed, on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all. Therefore, there exists substantial doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability of assets that might be necessary despite this uncertainty.
Current Business
We are a biotechnology company marketing and developing a number of products based on our innovative AC5® self-assembling technology platform. We believe these products can be important advances in the field of stasis and barrier applications, which includes stopping bleeding (“hemostasis”), controlling leaking (“sealant”) and managing wounds created during surgery, trauma or interventional care or from disease. We have only recently commenced commercial sales of our first product, AC5® Advanced Wound System, and have devoted substantially all of our operational effort to the research, development and regulatory programs necessary to turn our core technology into commercial products. Our goal is to make care faster and safer for patients with products for use in external wounds, which we refer to as Dermal Sciences applications, and products for use inside the body, which we refer to as Biosurgery applications.
Core Technology
Our flagship products and product candidates are derived from our AC5® self-assembling peptide (“SAP”) technology platform and are sometimes referred to as AC5® or the “AC5® Devices.” These include AC5® Advanced Wound System and AC5 Topical Hemostat, which have received marketing authorization as medical devices in the United States and Europe, respectively, and which are intended for skin applications, such as management of complicated chronic wounds or acute surgical wounds. Other products are in development for use in minimally invasive or open surgical procedures and include, for example, AC5-GTM for gastrointestinal endoscopic procedures and AC5-V® and AC5® Surgical Hemostat for hemostasis inside the body, all of which are currently investigational devices limited by law to investigational use.

Products based on the AC5® platform contain a biocompatible peptide that is synthesized from proteogenic, naturally occurring L-amino acids. Unlike products that contain traditional peptide sequences, when applied to a wound, AC5®-based products intercalate into the interstices of the connective tissue and self-assemble into a protective physical-mechanical nanoscale structure that can provide a barrier to leaking substances, such as blood, while also acting as a biodegradable scaffold that enables healing. Self-assembly is a central component of the mechanism of action of our technology. Individual AC5® peptide units readily build themselves, or self-assemble, into an ordered network of nanofibrils when in aqueous solution by the following process:

● | Peptide strands line up with neighboring peptide strands, interacting via hydrogen bonds (non-covalent bonds) to form a ribbon-like structure called a beta sheet
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | This process continues such that hundreds of strands organize with charged and polar side chains oriented on one face and non-polar side chains oriented on the opposite face of the beta sheets.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Interactions of the resulting structure with water molecules and ions results in formation nanofibrils, which extend in length and can join together to form larger nanofibers.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | This network of AC5® peptide nanofibers forms the physical-mechanical barrier that is responsible for sealant, hemostatic and other properties, regardless of the presence of antithrombotic agents, and which subsequently becomes the scaffold that supports the repair and regeneration of damaged tissue.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Based on the intended application, we believe that the underlying AC5® SAP technology can impart important features and benefits to our products that may include, for instance, stopping bleeding (hemostasis), mitigating contamination, modulating inflammation, donating moisture, and enabling an appropriate wound microenvironment conducive to healing. For instance, AC5® Advanced Wound System, which is indicated for the management of partial and full-thickness wounds, such as pressure sores, leg ulcers, diabetic ulcers, and surgical wounds, is shipped and stored at room temperature, is applied directly as a liquid, can conform to irregular wound geometry, and does not possess sticky or glue-like handling characteristics. We believe these properties enhance its utility in several settings and contribute to its user-friendly profile.
We believe that our technology lends itself to a range of potential applications in which there is a wound inside or on the body, and in which there is need for a hemostatic agent or sealant. For instance, the results of certain preclinical and clinical investigations that either we have conducted, or others have conducted on our behalf have shown quick and effective hemostasis with the use of AC5® SAP technology, and that time to hemostasis (“TTH”) is comparable among test subjects regardless of whether such test subject had or had not been treated with therapeutic doses of anticoagulant or antiplatelet medications, commonly called “blood thinners.” Furthermore, the transparency and physical properties of certain AC5® Devices may enable a surgeon to operate through it in order to maintain a clearer field of vision and prophylactically stop or lessen bleeding as surgery starts, a concept that we call Crystal Clear Surgery™. An example of a product that contains related features and benefits is AC5® Topical Hemostat, which is indicated for use as a dressing and to control mild to moderate bleeding, each during the management of injured skin and the micro-environment of an acute surgical wound.
Operations
Much of our operational efforts to date, which we often perform in collaboration with partners, have included selecting compositions and formulations for our initial products; conducting preclinical studies, including safety and other tests; conducting a human trial for safety and performance of AC5®; developing and conducting a human safety study to assess for irritation and sensitization potential; securing marketing authorization for our first product in the United States and in Europe; developing, optimizing, and validating manufacturing methods and formulations, which are particularly important components of self-assembling peptide development; developing methods for manufacturing scale-up, reproducibility, and validation; engaging with regulatory authorities to seek early regulatory guidance as well as marketing authorization for our products; sourcing and evaluating commercial partnering opportunities in the United States and abroad; and developing and protecting the intellectual property rights underlying our technology platform.
Our long-term business plan includes the following goals:

● | conducting biocompatibility, pre-clinical, and clinical studies on our products and product candidates;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | obtaining additional marketing authorization for products in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions as we may determine;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5




● | continuing to develop third party relationships to manufacture, distribute, market and otherwise commercialize our products;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continuing to develop academic, scientific and institutional relationships to collaborate on product research and development;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | expanding and maintaining protection of our intellectual property portfolio; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | developing additional product candidates in Dermal Sciences, Biosurgery, and other areas.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In furtherance of our long-term business goals, we expect to continue to focus on the following activities during the next twelve months:

● | seek additional funding as required to support the milestones described previously and our operations generally;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | work with our manufacturing partners to scale up production of product compliant with current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), which activities will be ongoing and tied to our development and commercialization needs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | further clinical development of our product platform;
--+------------------------------------------------------


● | assess our technology platform in order to identify and select product candidates for potential advancement into development;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | seek regulatory input to guide activities related to expanded and new product marketing authorizations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | continue to expand and enhance our financial and operational reporting and controls;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pursue commercial partnerships; and
--+------------------------------------


● | expand and enhance our intellectual property portfolio by filing new patent applications, obtaining allowances on currently filed patent applications, and/or adding to our trade secrets in self-assembly, manufacturing, analytical methods and formulation, which activities will be ongoing as we seek to expand our product candidate portfolio.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In addition to capital required for operating expenses, depending upon additional input from EU and US regulatory authorities, as well as the potential for additional regulatory filings and approvals during the next 2 years, additional capital will be required.
We have no commitments for any future capital. As indicated above, we will require significant additional financing to fund our planned operations, including further research and development relating to AC5®, seeking regulatory approval of that or any other product we may choose to develop, commercializing any product for which we are able to obtain regulatory approval or certification, seeking to license or acquire new assets or business, and maintaining our intellectual property rights, pursuing new technologies and for financing the investor relations and incremental administrative costs associated with being a public corporation. We do not presently have, nor do we expect in the near future to have, sufficient revenue to fund our business from operations, and we will need to obtain substantially all of our necessary funding from external sources for the foreseeable future. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable or acceptable terms when needed, or at all. If we cannot raise the money that we need in order to continue to develop our business, we will be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our proposed operations. If any of these were to occur, there is a substantial risk that our business would fail and our stockholders could lose all of their investment.
Since inception, we have funded our operations primarily through debt borrowings, the issuance of convertible debt and the issuance of units consisting of Common Stock and warrants, and we may continue to seek to do so in the future. If we obtain additional financing by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders’ ownership will be diluted. The terms of securities we may issue in future capital-raising transactions may be more favorable for our new investors. Further, newly issued securities may include preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have additional dilutive effects. If we obtain additional financing by incurring debt, we may become subject to significant limitations and restrictions on our operations pursuant to the terms of any loan or credit agreement governing the debt. Further, obtaining any loan, assuming a loan would be available when needed on acceptable terms, would increase our liabilities and future cash commitments. We may also seek funding from additional collaboration or licensing arrangements in the future, which may require that we relinquish potentially valuable rights to our product candidates or proprietary technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Moreover, regardless of the manner in which we seek to raise capital, we may incur substantial costs in those pursuits, including investment-banking fees, legal fees, accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other related costs.

Research and Development
Preclinical and clinical testing of our product candidates is required in order to receive regulatory marketing authorizations and to support products upon commercialization, and we anticipate that such testing will continue as deemed appropriate.
Preclinical Testing
We have engaged and continue to engage third parties in the United States and abroad to advise on and perform certain preclinical bench-top and animal research and development studies, typically with assistance from our team. These third parties include contract research organizations, academic institutions, consultants, advisors, scientists, clinicians, and other collaborators.
We have conducted and anticipate continuing to conduct in vivo and in vitro research and development studies on our products and product candidates. A co-founding inventor of certain of our technology, Dr. Rutledge Ellis-Behnke, performed a significant portion of the early preclinical animal experiments conducted with our technology. Some of the most significant findings from Dr. Ellis-Behnke’s studies have been published. Additionally, through collaborations with the National University of Ireland system and related parties, preclinical bench-top and animal research and development studies were performed in Dublin, Cork and Galway, Ireland over an approximately eight-year period that concluded in the third quarter of fiscal 2018.
Before initiating our clinical trials and submitting marketing applications for a given product in most jurisdictions, we are required to have completed a biocompatibility assessment, which typically consists of a battery of in vitro and in vivo tests. Standard biocompatibility tests, as set forth in ISO 10993 issued by the International Organization for Standardization, may include:

● | in vitro cytotoxicity;
--+-----------------------


● | in vitro blood compatibility;
--+------------------------------


● | in vitro Ames assay (mutagenic activity);
--+------------------------------------------


● | irritation/intracutaneous reactivity;
--+--------------------------------------


● | sensitization (allergenic reaction);
--+-------------------------------------


● | implantation (performed on devices that contact the body’s interior);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | pyrogenicity (causing fever or inflammation);
--+----------------------------------------------


● | systemic toxicity; and
--+-----------------------


● | in vitro chromosome aberration assay (structural chromosome changes).
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------

We completed the biocompatibility studies required to receive marketing authorizations for AC5 Advanced Wound System in the United States and AC5 Topical Hemostat in Europe, and such test results support that the products are biocompatible. We will perform further biocompatibility testing that we deem necessary for additional indications, classifications, jurisdictions, and/or as required by regulatory authorities.
Acute and survival animal studies assessing safety and performance of our technology have also demonstrated favorable outcomes in Dermal Sciences and Biosurgical applications.
Porcine studies, also known as swine or pig studies, are often selected due to the morphological, physiological, and biochemical similarities between porcine skin and human skin and are very useful to assess the performance of AC5 Advanced Wound System or AC5 Topical Hemostat as a barrier and advanced wound dressing, as well as their safety and effects on healing.
In an assessment versus saline in a porcine partial thickness excision wound model, tissue response to AC5 Advanced Wound System over a 28 day follow-up period was consistent with normal wound healing and included complete re-epithelialization, normal collagen organization, and minimal inflammation and TTH was faster.
In an assessment versus both a market leading skin substitute and saline in a porcine full thickness 10 mm punch biopsy wound model, AC5 Advanced Wound System was solely associated with complete epithelialization by the end of the 11 day study.
In an assessment versus each a market leading antimicrobial burn dressing, a hydrogel, and saline in a porcine second degree burn wound model, AC5 Advanced Wound System was associated with less progression of thermal damage and less inflammation over three days.

Arch Therapeutics’ technology has also demonstrated hemostasis in liver and other organs in in vivo surgical models, including rapid hemostasis within 15 seconds. In a range of small and large animal models, our compositions have been shown to stop bleeding, seal leaking, allow for normal healing, and mitigate inflammation while being biocompatible.
AC5 Surgical Hemostat demonstrated rapid average TTH when applied to a range of animal tissues. Certain surgical procedure studies have assessed TTH when using AC5 Surgical Hemostat as well as using an active control, a saline control, a peptide control, and a cautery control. The results of those tests have shown a TTH of approximately 10 – 30 seconds when AC5 Surgical Hemostat was applied, compared to 80 seconds to significantly more than 300 seconds when various control substances were applied, depending on the nature of the control substance and procedure performed. In several studies comparing AC5 Surgical Hemostat to popular commercially available branded hemostatic agents (absorbable cellulose, flowable gelatin with and without thrombin, and fibrin) applied to stop the bleeding from full thickness penetrating wounds surgically created in rat livers, AC5 Surgical Hemostat achieved hemostasis in significantly less than 30 seconds, whereas control products took from over 50% - 400% longer to achieve hemostasis.
AC5 Surgical Hemostat was also demonstrated in preclinical tests to stop surgically induced liver bleeding in animals that had been treated with therapeutic amounts of anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications, collectively known as antithrombotic medications and commonly called “blood thinners.” In one preclinical study, an independent third-party research group obtained positive data assessing the use of AC5 Surgical Hemostat in animals that had been treated with therapeutic doses of the antiplatelet medications Plavix® (clopidogrel) and aspirin, alone and in combination. The results of the study were consistent with data obtained from two prior preclinical studies, in which AC5 Surgical Hemostat quickly stopped bleeding from surgical wounds created in rats following treatment with clinically relevant doses of the anticoagulant medication heparin. In these studies, the average TTH after AC5 Surgical Hemostat was applied to bleeding liver wounds in animals that had received anticoagulant medication was comparable to the average TTH as measured in their non-anticoagulated counterparts. Similar results were obtained in independent third-party studies assessing the use of AC5 Surgical Hemostat in patients on the anticoagulant heparin and in patients on the anti-platelet medication, ticagrelor (Brilinta® in the US, Brilique® in Europe).
AC5-V was assessed for its ability to provide hemostasis after bleeding was intentionally created at vascular reconstruction sites in preclinical studies. In an acute study in swine that had been premedicated with therapeutic doses of heparin before undergoing end-to-end femoral artery anastomosis and synthetic graft to vessel anastomosis in carotid and femoral arteries, AC5-V promoted effective hemostasis at the vascular anastomotic site and allowed for clear visualization of the surgical site.
In a 14-day survival study in sheep that had been premedicated with therapeutic doses of heparin before undergoing end-to-side anastomosis between synthetic vascular grafts and carotid arteries, AC5-V promoted effective hemostasis at the vascular anastomotic site, the graft remained patent during the study as assessed by angiography and ultrasound, clinical observations were normal during the study, and tissue response as assessed by histopathological examination at the end of the study was consistent with expectations for a biodegrading implant.
AC5-G was studied in swine to assess visualization, submucosal lift generation and durability, and hemostatic and sealant performance when used during endoscopic mucosal resections and endoscopic submucosal dissections as well as hemostatic performance during endoscopic management of gastrointestinal bleeding. AC5-G was easily delivered through a 25G endoscopic injection needle into the tissue and provided a durable submucosal lift in the gastric antrum that lasted beyond 2 hours. When delivered with the visualizing agent prior to tissue dissection, AC5-G allowed for easy visualization with both snare and electrosurgical knives, and no visible bleeding was observed following polyp removal. AC5-G was also shown to provide hemostasis in actively bleeding lesions when applied with or without the visualizing agent either topically to a bleeding site or when injected into the nearby mucosa. AC5-G was found to be useful in conjunction with clips as a potential sealant when applied following application of clips to a post-polypectomy site for the purpose of mitigating leaks and potentially enabling healing.
The AC5 self-assembling peptide was studied in an experimental intraocular inflammation model of injected Lipopolysaccharide (“LPS”), in which an intraocular application of the peptide with LPS was associated with a marked reduction in retinal inflammation. The density of activated retinal microglial cells was significantly lower in the eyes of the study animals with LPS and AC5 than in the eyes of the LPS-only control group. The results suggest that the AC5 self-assembling peptide may reduce inflammation and may represent a new class of devices that act as anti-inflammatory agents to control ocular inflammation.

Clinical Testing
We have engaged and continue to engage third parties in the United States and abroad to advise on and perform certain clinical studies and related activities, typically with assistance from our team. These third parties can include contract research organizations, academic institutions, consultants, advisors, scientists, clinicians, and other collaborators.
In order to complete a clinical trial, we are required to enroll a sufficient number of patients to conduct the trial after obtaining each patient’s informed consent in a form and substance that complies with FDA and/or other regulatory authority requirements as well as state and federal privacy and human subject protection regulations. Many factors could lead to delays or inefficiencies in conducting clinical trials, some of which are discussed under the heading “RISK FACTORS” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further, we, the FDA or an institutional review board (“IRB”) could suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons, including a belief that the risks to the subjects of the trial outweigh the anticipated benefits. Even if a trial is completed, the results of clinical testing may not adequately demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the device or may otherwise not be sufficient to obtain FDA clearance or approval to market the product in the U.S.
We have completed two clinical studies to date. The first study, which met its primary and secondary endpoints, assessed the safety and performance of AC5 Advanced Wound System in 46 patients with bleeding skin wounds that resulted from excision of skin lesions and followed for 30 days. The second study assessed AC5 Advanced Wound System on skin, determining that it was neither an irritant nor a sensitizer, and no immunogenic response or serious or other adverse events attributable to this product were reported in any of the approximately 50 enrolled volunteers. The AC5 Advanced Wound System subsequently received FDA marketing clearance in March 2020 and CE Mark in Europe in April 2020 for the AC5 Topical Hemostat, as it is known in Europe.
Regulatory
We have engaged and continue to engage third parties in the United States (“U.S.”) and abroad to advise on and perform certain regulatory activities, typically with assistance from our team. These third parties can include contract research organizations, academic institutions, consultants, advisors, scientists, clinicians, and/or other collaborators.
Our research, development and clinical programs, as well as our manufacturing and marketing operations that may be performed by us or third party service providers on our behalf, are subject to extensive regulation in the United States and other countries. Notably, for example, AC5 Advanced Wound System is subject to regulation as a medical device under the U.S. Food Drug and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) as implemented and enforced by the FDA and equivalent regulations that are enforced by foreign agencies in any other countries in which we pursue commercialization. The FDA and its foreign counterparts generally govern the following activities that we do or will perform or that will be performed on our behalf, as well as potentially additional activities, to ensure that products we may manufacture, promote and distribute domestically or export internationally are safe and effective for their intended uses:

● | product design, preclinical and clinical development and manufacture;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | product premarket clearance and approval;
--+------------------------------------------


● | product safety, testing, labeling and storage;
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | certain supply chain changes;
--+------------------------------


● | record keeping procedures;
--+---------------------------


● | product marketing, sales and distribution; and
--+-----------------------------------------------


● | post-marketing surveillance, complaint handling, medical device reporting, reporting of deaths, serious injuries or device malfunctions and repair or recall of products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Medical Device Classification in the United States and Europe
AC5 Advanced Wound System in the United States and AC5 Topical Hemostat in Europe are classified as medical devices. Generally, a product is a medical device if it requires neither metabolic nor chemical activity to achieve the desired effect. Furthermore, a medical device can achieve its desired effects without requiring a body (animal/human), whereas a drug or a biologic requires a body in order to operate. Self-assembly, which is the desired effect and which can occur outside of a body, is accordingly consistent with the medical device definition.
Medical devices in the United States and Europe are classified along a spectrum on the basis of the amount of risk to the patient associated with the medical device and the controls deemed necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness. Class III status, which is the higher-level classification for devices compared to Classes II and I, involves additional procedures and regulatory 

9



scrutiny of the product candidate to obtain approvals. Class III devices are those that are deemed to pose the greatest risks, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices, or that have a new intended use or that use advanced technology not substantially equivalent to that of a legally marketed device.
As a result of the intended use of and the novel technology on which our products and product candidates are based, in general, we anticipate that they would typically be regulated as either Class II or Class III medical device in these jurisdictions, depending upon the intended use. Specifically, AC5 Advanced Wound System is a Class II medical device in the United States, and AC5 Topical Hemostat is a Class IIb medical device in Europe.
In the United States, the FDA recognizes these classes of medical devices:

● | Class I, requiring general controls, including labeling, device listing, reporting and, for some products, adherence to good manufacturing practices through the FDA’s quality system regulations and pre-market notification;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class II, requiring general controls and special controls, which may include performance standards and post-market surveillance; or
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class III, requiring general controls and approval of a premarket approval application (“PMA”), which may include post-market approval conditions and post-market surveillance.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

European regulatory authorities, likewise, recognize several classes of medical devices. Classification involves rules found in the European Union Medical Device Directive and is driven in part by the device’s degree of contact with the patient, invasiveness, active nature, and indications for use. The medical device classes recognized in the EU are:

● | Class IIa, which are considered low-medium risk devices and require certification by a notified body;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class IIb, which are considered medium-high risk devices and require certification by a notified body; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Class III, which are considered high-risk devices and require certification by a notified body.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

United States Class III and certain Class II medical device approvals and European Union Class III and certain Class IIa and IIb medical device approvals may require the successful completion of human clinical trials.
U.S. Regulatory Marketing Authorization Process
Products that are regulated as medical devices and that require review by the FDA are subject to either a premarket notification, also known as a 510(k), which must be submitted to the FDA for clearance, or a PMA application, which the FDA must approve prior to marketing in the United States. The FDA ultimately determines the appropriate regulatory path. For purposes herein, references to regulatory approval and marketing authorization may be used interchangeably.
We believe that the products we are currently pursuing for internal use will require a PMA approval prior to commercialization. However, we are commercializing an initial product for external use that has been cleared through the 510(k) process. To obtain 510(k) marketing clearance for a medical device, an applicant must submit a premarket notification to the FDA demonstrating that the device is "substantially equivalent" to a predicate device or devices, which is typically a legally marketed Class II device in the United States. A device is substantially equivalent to a predicate device if it has the same intended use and (i) the same technological characteristics, or (ii) has different technological characteristics and the information submitted demonstrates that the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise different questions of safety or effectiveness. In some cases, the submission must include data from human clinical studies. Marketing may commence when the FDA issues a clearance letter finding substantial equivalence. Depending upon a product’s underlying technology and intended use, as well as on FDA processes and procedures, seeking and obtaining a 510(k) can be a lengthy process.
A PMA, which is required for most Class III medical devices, must be submitted to the FDA if a device cannot be cleared through another approval process or is not otherwise exempt from the FDA’s premarket clearance requirements. The PMA approval process can be lengthy and expensive. A PMA must generally be supported by extensive data, including without limitation technical, preclinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data, to demonstrate to the FDA’s satisfaction the safety and efficacy of the device for its intended use. Clinical trials for a Class III medical device typically require an application for an investigational device exemption (“IDE”), which would need to be approved in advance by the FDA for a specified number of patients and study sites. Clinical trials are subject to extensive monitoring, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and must be conducted under the oversight of an institutional review board (“IRB”) for the relevant clinical trial sites and comply with applicable FDA regulations, including those relating to good clinical practices (“GCP”).

10



The PMA process is estimated to take from one to three years or longer from the time the PMA application is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained. During the review period, the FDA will typically request additional information or clarification of the information previously provided. Also, experts from outside the FDA may be convened to review and evaluate the PMA and provide recommendations to the FDA as to the approvability of the device, although the FDA may or may not accept any such recommendations. In addition, the FDA will generally conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities involved with producing the device to ensure compliance with the cGMP regulations. Upon approval of a PMA, the FDA may require that certain conditions of approval, such as conducting a post-market approval clinical trial, be met.
Further, if post-approval modifications are made, including, for example, certain types of modifications to the device’s indication for use, manufacturing process, labeling or design, then new PMAs or PMA supplements would be required. PMA supplements often require submission of the same type of information as a PMA, except that the supplement is typically limited to information needed to support the changes from the device covered by the original PMA and accordingly may not require as extensive clinical and other data.
We have not submitted to the FDA a PMA or commenced the required clinical trials for an internal use product. Even if we conduct successful preclinical and clinical studies and submit a PMA for an approval or premarket application for clearance, the FDA may not permit commercialization of our product candidate for the desired internal use indications, on a timely basis, or at all. Our inability to achieve regulatory approval for AC5 in the United States for an internal use product, a large market for hemostatic products, would materially adversely affect our ability to grow our business.
European Union Marketing Authorization (CE Mark) Process
A notified body is a private commercial entity designated by the national government of a European Union (“EU”) member state as being competent to make independent judgments about whether a medical device complies with applicable regulatory requirements in the EU. Our notified body is The British Standards Institution (“BSI”).
The EU has adopted numerous directives and standards regulating the design, manufacture, clinical trials, labeling, and adverse event reporting for medical devices, and it has further revised its rules and regulations with increasingly stringent requirements. Each EU member state has implemented legislation applying these directives and standards at a national level. Many countries outside of the EU have also voluntarily adopted laws and regulations that mirror those of the EU with respect to medical devices, potentially increasing the time and cost necessary to potentially achieve an approval in different jurisdictions.
Devices that comply with the requirements of the laws of the selected member state applying the applicable EU directive are entitled to bear a CE (Conformité Européenne) mark and can be distributed throughout the member states of the EU, as well as in other countries that have mutual recognition agreements with the EU or have adopted the EU’s regulatory standards.
Under applicable European Medical Device Directives (“MDD”), a CE mark is a symbol placed on a product that declares that the product is compliant with the essential requirements of applicable EU health, safety and environmental protection legislation. In order to receive a CE mark for a product candidate, the company producing the product candidate must select a country in which to apply. Each country in the EU has one competent authority (“CA”) that implements the national regulations by interpreting the EU directives. CAs also designate and regulate Notified Bodies. An assessment by a notified body in the selected country within the EU is required in order to commercially distribute the device. In addition, compliance with ISO 13485 issued by the International Organization for Standardization, among other standards, establishes the presumption of conformity with the essential requirements for CE mark. Certification to the ISO 13485 standard demonstrates the presence of a quality management system that can be used by a manufacturer for design and development, production, installation and servicing of medical devices and the design, development and provision of related services.
While there are many similarities between the processes required to obtain marketing authorization in the United States and Europe, there are several key differences between the jurisdictions, as well. Obtaining a CE mark is not equivalent to obtaining FDA clearance or approval. For instance, FDA requirements for products typically vary based on whether the submission is for a premarket notification (510(k)) or a premarket approval (PMA) whereas EU requirements for product submissions are primarily based on class. Furthermore, EU submissions must meet precise essential requirements, although the data demonstrating such compliance can vary by class of device. Additionally, a CE mark affixed to a product serves as a declaration by the responsible party that the product conforms to applicable provisions and that relevant conformity assessment procedures have been completed with respect to the product.
In 2017, the European Union regulatory bodies implemented a new Medical Device Regulation (“MDR”). The MDR changes several aspects of the existing regulatory framework, such as clinical data requirements, and introduces new ones, such as Unique Device 

11



Identification (“UDI”). We, and the Notified Bodies who will oversee compliance to the new MDR, face uncertainties in the upcoming years as the MDR is rolled out and enforced, creating risks in several areas, including the CE mark process, data transparency and application review timetables. 
Post-Approval Regulation
After a medical device obtains approval from the applicable regulatory agency and is launched in the market, numerous post-approval regulatory requirements would apply. Many of those requirements are similar among the United States and EU member states and include:

● | product listing and establishment registration;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | requirements that manufacturers, including third-party manufacturers, follow stringent design, testing, control, documentation and other quality assurance procedures during all aspects of the design and manufacturing process;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | labeling and other advertising regulations, including prohibitions against the promotion of products for uncleared, unapproved or off-label use or indication;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | approval of product modifications that affect the safety or effectiveness of any of our devices that may achieve approval;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-approval restrictions or conditions, including post-approval study commitments;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | post-market surveillance regulations, which apply, when necessary, to protect the public health or to provide additional safety and effectiveness data for the device;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | the recall authority of the applicable government agency and regulations pertaining to voluntary recalls; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | reporting requirements, including reports of incidents in which a product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which a product malfunctioned, and notices of corrections or removals.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Failure by us, our third-party manufacturers or our other suppliers to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by various regulatory authorities, which may result in monetary fines, the imposition of operating restrictions, product recalls, criminal prosecution or other sanctions.
Regulation by Other Foreign Agencies
International sales of medical devices outside the EU may be subject to government regulations in each country in which the device is marketed and sold, which vary substantially from country to country. The time required to obtain approval by a non-EU foreign country may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA or CE mark clearance or approval, and the requirements may substantially differ.
Marketing Authorization (510k) for AC5 Advanced Wound System in the United States
On July 25, 2017, we announced that we had made a 510(k) submission to the FDA for AC5 Topical Gel. On December 18, 2017, we voluntarily withdrew the application after receiving questions from the FDA for which an adequately comprehensive response could not be provided within the FDA’s congressionally-mandated 90-day review period. On October 1, 2018, we announced that we both completed the necessary steps required to file a new 510(k) submission to the FDA for AC5 Topical Gel and filed that 510(k) submission during the third calendar quarter. As previously disclosed, these steps included developing a required study protocol and submitting it to the FDA in a pre-submission letter in the first calendar quarter, completing the pre-submission process, initiating the study in the second calendar quarter of 2018 and completing the study. On December 17, 2018, we announced that the 510(k) premarket notification for AC5 Topical Gel had been reviewed and cleared by the FDA, allowing for the product to be marketed.
In line with plans to better harmonize our United States and European product supply chains by using an additional supplier and additional manufacturing processes in the production of AC5 Topical Gel, Arch filed documentation with the FDA seeking such clearance in the United States for these additions, each of which had been incorporated into the technical documentation for the European CE mark filing. On March 23, 2020, we announced that the 510(k) premarket notification for AC5 Topical Gel had been reviewed and cleared by the FDA, allowing for the product to be marketed in the United States with the aforementioned additions. AC5 Topical Gel was subsequently renamed to AC5 Advanced Wound System in the United States.

Marketing Authorization (CE mark) for AC5 Topical Hemostat in Europe
During November 2018 we submitted the required documents for AC5 Topical Hemostat to its notified body seeking a CE mark. During August 2019 we received and responded to customary written and verbal questions related to the technical file, and that BSI had recently indicated that the responses provided and assessed during the review period were acceptable so far. In that announcement, we further expressed our belief that the delay by the regulatory authority in completing the CE mark technical file review appeared to be due to a backlog of work for EU notified bodies related to both Brexit and the implementation of the new EU Medical Devices Regulation.
During April 2020 we received CE (Conformité Européenne) mark for AC5 Topical Hemostat, allowing for commercialization in Europe as a dressing and to control bleeding in external skin wounds in both out-patient and in-patient settings.
Commercialization Strategy
Our commercialization efforts are currently focused on our Dermal Sciences products, AC5 Advanced Wound System in the United States and AC5 Topical Hemostat in Europe. The indication for use, or purpose, for each product follows:

● | Under the supervision of a health care professional, AC5 Advanced Wound System is a topical dressing used for the management of partial and full-thickness wounds, such as pressure sores, leg ulcers, diabetic ulcers, and surgical wounds.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | AC5 Topical Hemostat is intended for use locally as a dressing and to control mild to moderate bleeding, each during the management of injured skin and the micro-environment of an acute surgical wound.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We received the CE mark for AC5 Topical Hemostat in April 2020. We received 510(k) premarket notification clearances for AC5 Advanced Wound System in December 2018, providing marketing authorization, and on March 23, 2020, clearing use of an additional supplier and additional manufacturing processes.
The Covid-19 pandemic environment has introduced new challenges related to product launch, marketing and sales, as clinicians and facilities are increasingly focused on managing resources, the disease, or its potential spread. We believe that these challenges may present an opportunity for our new technology to address certain poorly met needs. We have observed that:

● | the volume of elective surgical procedures has been constrained, with many institutions indefinitely suspending or eliminating such procedures, as the United States and Europe appear to be heading into a worsening phase of the pandemic;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | healthcare facilities often have been required to ration staff and resources, including ventilators, personal protective equipment (“PPE”), and operating rooms, thereby negatively impacting the focus on wound care;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | clinicians often have been required to divert their time and resources to urgent Covid-19 needs;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | clinicians often have been required to quarantine due to exposure to a Covid-19 positive individual or isolate because of contracting symptomatic or asymptomatic Covid-19 disease;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | some institutions have been periodically designated “Covid Hospitals”;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | administrators who may be required to facilitate or approve new product intake are constrained by new and other pressing priorities; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | both clinicians and patients often try to minimize possible Covid-19 exposure, resulting in reduced access to healthcare system and essential care treatments and services.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Wound interventions are too often considered to be elective procedures instead of being treated essentially or emergently as National Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel guidelines and others recommend, resulting in a projected increased risk to limb and life while elective procedures are delayed and not prioritized. Furthermore, the implications of these delays are a growing backlog of chronic wounds awaiting care and a worsening of such wounds, leading to greater morbidity, such as infection, necrosis, and amputation, and potentially mortality.
While highlighted by the Covid-19 pandemic, we also believe that these challenges reveal an underlying problem in the healthcare system–clinicians and other providers are being asked to accomplish more in less time with fewer resources. These resources may include higher acuity settings, such as operating rooms; expensive wound care products that may not work as well as desired; nursing time to change wound dressings; and surgeon time for managing wounds during debridement; repeat patient visits over months and often years, and others. Our discussions with surgeons, economic stakeholders and other decision-making personnel often include whether AC5 Advanced Wound System may enable them to accomplish more for their patients while deploying overall fewer resources and achieving desired outcomes.

We expect our Dermal Sciences product commercialization to be gradual, initially, and moderately accelerate into new market channels. In addition to identifying and encouraging product use by key opinion leaders and early adopters, we will prioritize our focus on private and government facilities. Hospitals in the Veterans Health Administration (“VA Hospitals”), for example, tend to have many patients whose needs we believe we can help address. We have prioritized the launch of AC5 Advanced Wound System in the United States over that of AC5 Topical Hemostat in Europe to maximize operational efficiencies in light of the Covid-19 pandemic.
We have engaged and continue to engage third parties in the United States and abroad to advise on and perform certain sales and marketing activities, typically with assistance from our team. These third parties can include contract organizations, consultants, advisors, scientists, clinicians, and/or other collaborators.
While our core team oversees initial inventory distribution from the warehouse to the customer, our sales and marketing plans include entering into collaboration agreements with contract sales partners and/or strategic partners to commercialize our products in both domestic and international markets
We are committed to continuous improvement processes. We will collect feedback and data when feasible and appropriate to develop and commercialize products that serve patients and doctors; to develop our marketing messages; to learn about product use; to evaluate product performance in different settings; to improve our products; to address reimbursement needs, and to support collaborations that we may have or may establish. Data has been and will continue to be collected by informal feedback, observational case reports and/or clinical trials. We anticipate seeking reimbursement via codes based upon Current Procedural Terminology (CPT), hospital Diagnosis-related Groups (DRG) and Ambulatory Payment Classifications (APC).
We envision adding additional resources to our team to help commercialize the Dermal Sciences products. Our Biosurgery products for internal use will require additional preclinical and clinical testing before we seek marketing authorization to commercialize them.
Manufacturing
We work with contract manufacturing and related organizations, including those operating under current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”), as is required by applicable regulatory agencies for production of product that can be used for preclinical and human testing as well as for commercial use. We also have engaged and continue to engage other third parties in the United States and abroad to advise on and perform certain manufacturing and related activities, typically with assistance from our team. These third parties include academic institutions, consultants, advisors, scientists, and/or other collaborators. The activities include development of our primary product candidates, as well as generation of appropriate analytical methods, scale-up, and other procedures for use by manufacturers and/or other members of our supply chain to produce or process our products at current and/or larger scale quantities for preclinical and clinical testing and ultimately, as required marketing authorizations are obtained, commercialization.
Our products are regulated as medical devices, and as such, many of our activities have focused on optimizing traditional parameters to target specifications, biocompatibility, physical appearance, stability, and handling characteristics, among other metrics, in order to achieve the desired product. We and our partners intend to continue to monitor manufacturing processes and formulation methods closely, as success or failure in establishing and maintaining appropriate specifications may directly impact our ability to conduct additional preclinical and clinical trials and/or deliver commercial product.
We believe that the manufacturing methods used for a product, including the type and source of ingredients and the burden of waste byproduct elimination, are important determinants of its opportunity for profitability. Industry participants are keenly aware of the downsides of products that rely on expensive biotechnology techniques and facilities for manufacture, onerous and expensive programs to eliminate complex materials, or ingredients that are sourced from the complicated process of human or other animal plasma separation, since those products typically are expensive, burdensome to produce, and at greater risk for failing regulatory oversight.
The manufacturing methods that we use and intend to use to produce our current products and potential future product candidates rely on detailed, complex and difficult to manage synthetic organic chemistry processes. Although use of those methods requires that we engage manufacturers that possess the expertise, skill and know-how involved with those methods, the required equipment to use those methods is widely available. Furthermore, improvements in relevant synthetic manufacturing techniques over the past two decades have reduced their complexity and cost, while increasing large-scale cGMP capacity. Moreover, our current products and currently planned product candidates will be synthesized from naturally occurring ingredients that are not sourced from humans or other animals but do exist in their natural state in humans. That type of ingredient may be more likely to be categorized as “generally recognized as safe”, or “GRAS”, by the FDA.

Industry and Competition
Arch is developing technology for Dermal Sciences and Biosurgery applications, including wound care, surgical procedures on and in the body, and endoscopic gastrointestinal procedures. We seek to provide a product set with broad utility in external and internal applications. Features of the technology highlight its potential utility in a range of settings, including traditional open procedures and the often more challenging minimally invasive surgeries.
Common features of our current and planned products, as described herein, are driven by the mechanism of action, which itself is derived from the underlying physicochemical properties or our self-assembling peptide technology and our product safety and performance specifications. Those features, which include, among others, that they possess barrier properties and can create an environment permissive to healing, can deliver a benefit in the treatment of external and internal wounds that are open, exposed, bleeding, leaking, and/or at risk for excessive inflammation or contamination.
Dermal Sciences
We have received marketing authorizations for AC5 Advanced Wound System in the United States and AC5 Topical Hemostat in Europe. Compared to most other advanced wound dressings on the market, ours can be used throughout all phases of wound healing (i.e., inflammatory, proliferative, and remodeling).
Wounds can vary widely in terms of degree of bleeding and oozing, chronicity, acuity, complications, anatomic location, biochemistry, micromilieu, bioburden and other factors that may inhibit an ideal response. Patients can also vary widely in terms of co-morbidities, compliance, setting of their care, ability to contribute to their own care, and other risk factors. And the approach by surgeons to clinical practice can vary widely in terms of debridement strategy, timing and or use of advanced modalities, choice and use of consumables, follow-up and dressing change frequency, and more. Our products are designed to self-assemble on the wound site despite these diverse situations in order to provide greater utility to clinicians and enable better outcomes for patients.
According to a 2018 report produced by iData Research, in the United States, advanced wound dressings account for approximately $2 billion in annual revenues. The true cost to care for wounds, including chronic wounds, such as venous leg ulcers, diabetic foot ulcers, and pressure ulcers, remains unknown. However, a 2018 report by Nussbaum et al., data from calendar year 2014 estimates that total Medicare spending for all wound types ranges from $28.1 to $96.8 billion and that 14.5% (8.2 million) of Medicare beneficiaries were diagnosed with at least one type of wound or wound-related infection. Many surgeons believe that chronic wounds are essentially chronic infections that must be aggressively debrided in order to heal. Furthermore, a 2017 report by Chan et al., indicates that the mean one year cost of care from a health-care public payer perspective was $44,200 for a diabetic foot ulcer, $15,400 for a pressure ulcer and $11,000 for a leg ulcer. The Agency for Healthcare Research & Quality estimates that 2.5 million Americans develop pressure ulcers annually.
We believe that these disease and economic burdens highlight potential needs and opportunities for our products.
While the wound care opportunity is large for safe, efficacious, and novel products, the competitive landscape is also crowded and challenging. For instance, while many of the commercially marketed advanced wound dressing provide some utility and possess some novel features, surgeons often describe an inability to differentiate them from one another. Additionally, many advanced products are both expensive and require other interventions to the wound plus a passage of time for the wound bed to adequately be prepared before they can be used, adding additional burden to their use.
We believe that our product is sufficiently differentiated to replace certain products, complement other products by potentially enabling the wound bed to be ready sooner, and by enabling more procedures to be done sooner and/or in settings where they could not be performed easily before.
Biosurgery
We are developing Biosurgery products for internal use, including for hemostasis and sealant applications, gastrointestinal endoscopic mucosal resections and endoscopic submucosal dissections, and others.
According to a 2012 report produced by MedMarket Diligence, LLC, approximately 114 million surgical and procedure-based wounds occur annually worldwide, including 36 million from surgery in the United States. Available data indicates that there may be increased pressure to perform more complex surgeries at reduced costs, including conducting operations in less expensive outpatient settings. Although accurate current statistics are difficult to obtain, a National Health Statistics Report from 2006 and updated in 2009 

15



indicates that outpatient surgery volume was increasing by approximately 5% annually, and a 2009 report covering surgical procedures in the United States suggests that inpatient surgery volume was declining 1% per year. We believe that a motivating factor of this trend may be the increased costs associated with hospital inpatient procedures performed in operating rooms, which, according to MedMarket Diligence, have been estimated to cost between $2,000 and $10,000 per hour. These costs likely drive the desire for increased operating room throughput and increased volume of procedures performed in outpatient settings. Both of those trends highlight the need for highly effective products that can decrease operating room time for inpatient procedures and help to increase the safety of performing more types of procedures in less expensive outpatient settings.
Since the early days of modern minimally invasive surgery (“MIS”) in the 1990s, the percent of surgeries performed minimally invasively has increased significantly, such that it is now widespread and common. Laparoscopic surgery is among the most commonly recognized types of MIS, although there are many additional types. Advantages of MIS tends to include less scarring, less post-operative pain, less need for pain medications, shorter recovery times, and faster discharge times. However, such procedures often present the surgeon with less margin for error and less capacity to deal with certain risks, such as excessive bleeding, without converting the surgery to a traditional open procedure.
A fairly recent trend to make traditional minimally invasive surgery even less invasive is known as Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery, commonly referred to as NOTES. In NOTES procedures, an endoscope is passed through a natural orifice, such as the mouth, urethra, anus, or vagina, and then through an internal incision in the stomach, vagina, bladder or colon. NOTES advantages include those of MIS to a potentially even greater degree, as well as the lack of external incisions and external scars, improved visibility, and the possibility to avoid managing potential obstacles to surgery, such as extensive adhesions from prior procedures. However, compared to MIS, margin for error in NOTES is even less. NOTES may be performed by surgeons or endoscopists, yet the techniques can be challenging to learn and are in their early stages of development. Practitioners seek additional tools, including Biosurgery products where relevant, to enable them to operate efficiently, effectively, and safely.
We believe that our technology will be useful in addressing the constant demand for better performance and safety in MIS, traditional surgery, NOTES, and other procedures. Additional general long term trends that may support a demand for products include:

● | increasing surgical procedure volume growth, including ambulatory same day procedures;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | efforts to reduce operating room use and time; and
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | increased use of anticoagulants, which predispose patients to bleeding.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the course of developing our products, we engaged commercial strategy and marketing consultants and communicated directly with care providers to understand the needs of potential customers and to assess product feature preferences. Surgeons, operating room managers, sales representatives and hospital decision-makers identified a number of characteristics deemed desirable, including that a product is:

● | reliable;
--+----------


● | able to protect the wounds in tissues and organs where used;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


● | laparoscopic friendly;
--+-----------------------


● | easily handled and applied;
--+----------------------------


● | able to promote a clear field of vision and not obstruct view;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


● | sufficiently flowable;
--+-----------------------


● | non-sticky (to tissue or equipment);
--+-------------------------------------


● | permits normal healing;
--+------------------------


● | agnostic to the presence of antithrombotic medications (“blood thinners”) to whether the patient has bleeding abnormalities;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | non-toxic; and
--+---------------


● | not sourced from human or other animal blood or tissue components.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------

We carefully consider these items while developing our Biosurgery products with the objective of meeting these needs.
We are developing products for hemostasis and sealant applications. Many of the hemostasis products currently available do not possess certain features and handling characteristics that are ideal for use in a laparoscopic setting. For instance, many available products are difficult to use in MIS or NOTES because they tend to be sticky, powdery, fabric-based or are otherwise difficult to insert into and control through the small gauge yet long catheters used during these procedures. We believe that the novel features and differentiating characteristics of our Biosurgery products will make them more suitable for such surgeries compared to many or most of the presently available alternatives.

According to a 2015 MedMarket Diligence, LLC report, the market for hemostatic agents and sealants achieved approximately $4.2 billion in worldwide sales in 2015 and was projected to reach $4.8 billion in 2017 and surpass $7.5 billion in 2022. While the majority of those sales are for hemostats, we believe that the projected growth rate for sealants in multiple applications, such as the gastrointestinal track, could become greater as additional products become available.
In spite of the large size of the market for these products, many available hemostatic agents and sealants possess a combination of limitations, including slow onset of action, general unreliability, user-unfriendliness, and risk for adverse effects, such as healing problems, adhesion formation, infection and other safety concerns. Many of the deficiencies of currently available hemostatic agents and sealants are comparable to those of their earlier-generation counterparts, as revolutionary advances in underlying technologies have been elusive.
Commercially available products in the hemostasis field with which we expect our products to compete if they obtain required regulatory approvals can cost between $50 and $500 per procedure, with the higher value added products generally priced at the upper end of that range.
Participants in the hemostatic and sealant market currently include large companies, such as Johnson & Johnson and its affiliated companies, Becton Dickinson and its C. R. Bard unit, Baxter International Inc., as well as various smaller companies. Certain companies in other sectors, such as pharmaceuticals, wound care, and orthopedics, among others, are also interested in these markets.
We are also developing products for gastrointestinal and NOTES procedures, endoscopic mucosal resections (“EMR”) and endoscopic submucosal dissections (“ESD”). Surgical endoscopists are removing more complicated tumors and lesions from the gastrointestinal via EMR and ESD, which are endoscopic techniques to remove early-stage cancer and precancerous growths from the lining of the digestive tract through long narrow equipment which consist of ports, catheters, lights, monitors, and video cameras. This represents the least invasive interventional approach known.
The EMR/ESD market is immature and growing, driven by an increasing elderly population and incidence of gastrointestinal malignancies. While comprehensive data is not readily available, a report by Persistence Market Research projects global revenues in EMR of approximately $2.5 billion in 2025, with ESD representing additional opportunity. Persistence Market Research further projects share of EMR procedures to be approximately 42% for colon cancer, 30% for stomach cancer, and 20% for esophageal cancer. The opportunity is noteworthy in North America, Europe, and also Asia, where a higher prevalence of certain gastrointestinal malignancies and lower screening rates leads to later discovery and removal of tumors than desired.
A particular need for which we are developing AC5-G is a product that provides both a durable and safe lift while being inherently hemostatic. The concept is to inject AC5-G beneath a polyp or tumor to be resected or dissected, thus creating separation between the lesion and the underlying healthy tissue.
Incomplete lesion removal, bleeding and perforation are known challenges and risks of EMR/ESD. The objective of a lift is to minimize the risk for perforation into the peritoneum, which can cause significant morbidity and mortality, and increase the probability of visualizing and removing the entire desired lesion. The lift should also be durable, potentially lasting at least two hours, such that the frequency of repeat injections and perforation risk is minimized. Normal and abnormal tissues can also bleed during these procedures, and it can be challenging and time consuming to stop. Surgeons have expressed desire for an agent that can prophylactically or actively address such bleeding. Surgeons have further expressed interest in sealant properties in the event that a perforation occurs during the procedure.
Several companies, including Boston Scientific, have products that provide either a lift or are hemostatic, but not both. Based on early indicators, we believe AC5-G provides properties for both lift and hemostasis. AC5-G was featured in a video presentation during the Emerging Technology Session of the Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons (SAGES) 2020 Annual Meeting, which took place from August 11-13, 2020.
Potential Disadvantages of our Current and Planned Products Compared to the Competition
Some potential disadvantages of our products compared to currently marketed products follow:

● | The favorable handling characteristics of AC5 Devices result, in part, from their non-sticky and non-glue-like nature. However, if a surgeon or healthcare provider requires a product to adhere tissues together, or provide similar glue-like action, then AC5 Devices in their current form would not achieve that effect.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

17




● | While we project that our products will be sufficiently economical to manufacture at scale, they may not be able to compete from a price perspective with inexpensive products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | We have not yet generated significant efficacy or economic data in humans, unlike many successful products in the Dermal Sciences or Biosurgery categories.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | While we believe that the flowable nature of our products before they assemble into a dense nanofiber network can provide a meaningful advantage, some surgeons may prefer a solid product in certain applications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Other Governmental Regulations and Environmental Matters
We are or may become subject to various laws and regulations regarding laboratory practices and the use of animals in testing, as well as environmental laws and regulations governing, among other things, any use and disposal by us of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances in connection with our research. At this time, costs attributable to environmental compliance are not material. In each of these areas, applicable U.S. and foreign government agencies have broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including, among other things, the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of approvals, seize or recall products, and withdraw approvals, any one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if we are able to successfully obtain approvals for and commercialize our product candidates, then the Company and our products may become subject to various federal, state and local laws targeting fraud, abuse, privacy and security in the healthcare industry.
Intellectual Property
We are focused on the development of self-assembling compositions, particularly self-assembling peptide compositions, and methods of making and using such compositions primarily in healthcare applications. Suitable applications of these compositions include limiting or preventing the movement of bodily fluids and contaminants within or on the human body, preventing adhesions, treatment of leaky or damaged tight junctions, and reinforcement of weak or damaged vessels, such as aneurysms. Our strategy to date has been to develop an intellectual property portfolio in high-value jurisdictions that tend to uphold intellectual property rights.
As of November 5, 2021, we either own or license from others a number of U.S. patents, U.S. patent applications, foreign patents and foreign patent applications.
Six patent portfolios assigned to Arch Biosurgery, Inc. include a total of 43 patents and pending applications in a total of nine jurisdictions, including twelve patents and pending applications in the US. These portfolios cover self-assembling peptides, formulations and methods of use thereof and self-assembling peptidomimetics and methods of use thereof, including eight issued US patents (US 9,415,084; US 9,162,005; US 9,789,157; US 9,821,022; US 9,339,476; US 10,314,886; US 10,682,386; and 10,869,907) that expire between 2026 and 2034 (absent patent term extension), as well as sixteen patents that have been either allowed, issued or granted in foreign jurisdictions.
We have also entered into a license agreement with Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Versitech Limited (“MIT”) pursuant to which we have been granted exclusive rights under two portfolios of patents and non-exclusive rights under another three portfolios of patents.
The two portfolios exclusively licensed from MIT include a total of 22 patents and pending applications drawn to self-assembling peptides, formulations and methods of use thereof and self-assembling peptidomimetics and methods of use thereof in a total of nine jurisdictions. The portfolios include five issued US patents (US 9,511,113; US 9,084,837; US 10,137,166; US 9,327,010; and US 9,364,513) that expire between 2026 and 2027 (absent patent term extension), as well as fifteen patents that have been either allowed, issued or granted in foreign jurisdictions.
The three portfolios non-exclusively licensed from MIT include a number of US and foreign applications, including three issued US patents (US 7,846,891; US 7,713,923; and US 8,901,084) that expire not before 2024 (absent patent term extension), as well as four patents that have been either allowed, issued or granted in foreign jurisdictions.
Our license agreement with MIT imposes or imposed certain diligence, capital raising, and other obligations on us, including obligations to raise certain amounts of capital by specific dates. Additionally, we are responsible for all patent prosecution and maintenance fees under that agreement. Our breach of any material terms of our license agreement with MIT could permit the counterparty to terminate the agreement, which could result in our loss of some or all of our rights to use certain intellectual property that is material to our business and our lead product candidate. Our loss of any of the rights granted to us under our license agreement with MIT could materially harm our product development efforts and could cause our business to fail.
