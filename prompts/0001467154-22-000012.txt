Overview
We are a pre-commercial nitric oxide-based pharmaceutical company focused on dermatology and anti-infective therapies. Our vision is to create the world’s leader in nitric oxide-based science, technology, and clinical translation in support of delivering safe and efficacious therapies using our proprietary nitric oxide-based technology platform, Nitricil™, to generate macromolecular NCEs. Our proprietary technology platform leverages nitric oxide’s naturally occurring anti-viral, anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and immunomodulatory mechanisms of action to treat a range of diseases with significant unmet needs. Nitric oxide plays a vital role in the natural immune system response against microbial pathogens and is a critical regulator of inflammation. Our ability to harness nitric oxide and its multiple mechanisms of action has enabled us to create a platform with the potential to generate differentiated product candidates. The two key components of our nitric oxide platform are our proprietary Nitricil technology, which drives the creation of NCEs, and our formulation science, both of which we use to tune our product candidates for specific potential indications. Our ability to deploy nitric oxide in a solid form, on demand and in localized formulations allows us the potential to improve patient outcomes in a variety of diseases.
We have advanced strategic development programs in the field of dermatology, while also further expanding the platform into infectious diseases, men’s and women’s health, and various other medical conditions with significant unmet needs. This decision was based on the connection between the multi-factorial pathologies of diseases in these areas and the demonstrable anti-microbial, anti-viral and anti-inflammatory properties of Novan’s nitric oxide technology.
We have clinical-stage dermatology and anti-infective drug candidates with multi-factorial (SB204), anti-viral (SB206), anti-fungal (SB208), and anti-inflammatory (SB414) mechanisms of action. We have also introduced a possible anti-viral product candidate for the treatment of external genital warts (SB207). We have conducted or are currently conducting preclinical work on NCEs, including berdazimer sodium, and formulations for the potential treatment of (i) SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19 (SB019); (ii) antimicrobial indications for the adjacent companion animal health market (NVN4100); (iii) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia caused by high-risk human papilloma virus in the men’s and women’s health field (WH504 and WH602); and (iv) inflammatory disorders.
We are currently focusing our efforts and resources on our priority development pipeline candidates, which include (i) progressing our lead program, SB206, as a treatment for molluscum contagiosum, or molluscum, including preparing for and seeking U.S. regulatory approval, and implementing prelaunch strategy and U.S. commercial preparation; (ii) advancing our late-stage product candidate, SB204, for the treatment of acne vulgaris, or acne, within the U.S., as our second lead program toward a registrational Phase 3 study, based on two prior Phase 3 studies; and (iii) progressing our SB019 development program into a Phase 1 study for a potential intranasal prophylaxis or therapeutic for mild-to-moderate COVID-19 infection.
During 2021, our primary programmatic focus was on our molluscum product candidate, SB206, and we intend to continue to focus our near term development efforts on this program. Following the positive top-line results from the B-SIMPLE4 trial announced in June 2021 and the comprehensive B-SIMPLE4 safety data announced in September 2021, we target a potential NDA submission of SB206 for molluscum no later than the fourth quarter of 2022. We previously articulated a targeted NDA submission of SB206 during the third quarter of 2022, however, due to factors including supply chain constraints, impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, certain manufacturing related equipment issues and scheduling challenges, both within our corporate facility and with third-party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, we have adjusted our expected timing accordingly.
Thus, we continue to prepare for a regulatory submission and potential approval of SB206 as a treatment for molluscum. The timing of the targeted NDA submission is dependent upon: (i) completion of our new manufacturing facility to have the infrastructure and capability necessary to produce cGMP API registration batches; (ii) continued technical transfer activities to our drug product CMO and preparing the necessary registration batches of drug product; (iii) preparatory activities and data accumulation related to the NDA submission including conducting customary drug substance and drug product stability protocols; and (iv) regulatory and quality documentation compilation related to our preclinical, clinical and chemistry, manufacturing and control, or CMC, data related to the B-SIMPLE trials, and our drug manufacturing and related processes.
We are continuing to consider and progress the prelaunch strategy and commercial preparations for SB206, if approved. We have selected Syneos Health, a fully integrated biopharmaceutical solutions organization, as our commercial solutions provider for SB206 as a treatment for molluscum. Our relationship with Syneos Health, structured as a fee-for-service arrangement, is focused on implementing the SB206 prelaunch strategy and commercial preparation, if approved by the FDA.
In September 2021, we also announced our updated strategic priorities and outlined potential key milestones. In addition to the regulatory progression of SB206, including implementing prelaunch strategy and commercial preparation, we also announced our intention to progress (a) SB204, a topical monotherapy for the treatment of acne, by (i) preparing for a pivotal Phase 3 study during 2022; (ii) targeting the conduct of a potential pivotal Phase 3 trial in 2023; and (iii) targeting a potential NDA submission of SB204 for acne in 2024; and (b) SB019, as a potential intranasal treatment option for COVID-19, by (i) targeting a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers in 2022; (ii) targeting the conduct of a potential Phase 2/3 study(s) in 2023; and (iii) targeting a potential NDA submission of SB019 for COVID-19 in 2024. The progression of the SB019 program, subsequent to the execution of a Phase 1 study, and the progression of the SB204 program, including the execution of the potentially registrational SB204 Phase 3 trial, are subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.
Further advancement of our molluscum program beyond the potential NDA submission of SB206, or advancement of any other early-stage or late-stage clinical program across our platform, has been and may be further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and is subject to our ability to secure additional capital. Sources of additional capital may potentially include (i) equity or debt financings, including through sales of common stock to Aspire Capital Fund, LLC, or Aspire Capital, pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement that we entered into with Aspire Capital on July 21, 2020, or the July 2020 Aspire CSPA; or (ii) non-dilutive sources, such as partnerships, collaborations, licensing, grants or other strategic relationships. Our equity issuances during the year ended December 31, 2021, have resulted in significant dilution to our existing stockholders. Any issuance of equity, or debt convertible into equity, would result in further significant dilution to our existing stockholders.
Please refer to the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report for further discussion regarding our current liquidity and our future funding needs in addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations.
Technology
The Novan Nitric Oxide Platform
Nitric oxide is one of the most researched molecules in human physiology and has been extensively studied in many areas of medicine including in microbial diseases and in the modulation of inflammation. The scarcity of nitric oxide-based therapeutic products is due to the challenges associated with controlling the release of a gas, the poor stability and low storage capacity of nitric oxide-loaded molecules, the inability to target specific tissues, and the toxicity of several small molecules used as carriers to store nitric oxide.
The two key components of our nitric oxide platform are our proprietary Nitricil technology, which drives the creation of NCEs, and our formulation science, both of which we use to tune our product candidates for specific potential indications.
Novan’s Nitricil technology enables us to store large amounts of nitric oxide gas in a stable, solid form by chemically loading it on a macromolecule, or polymer. The advantages of our proprietary Nitricil technology include tunability, stability, high storage capacity, targeted delivery, and what we believe is a favorable safety profile. Our ability to select from several nitric oxide-loaded materials has created our proprietary library of Nitricil compositions, each of which possesses a unique nitric oxide release profile.
Our formulation science and expertise allow us to customize the drug delivery method for the relevant anatomical location of a variety of diseases. With our potential dermatological indications, the topical semi-solid formulations enable us to further tune the release of nitric oxide when applied by using proprietary combinations of inactive ingredients. This additional level of control enables us to use one API for multiple potential therapeutic indications by altering the nitric oxide pharmacology with the composition of the topical formulation. This component of our nitric oxide platform creates an additional barrier to entry, which we believe would position us to prolong the period of market exclusivity for each of our product candidates, if approved.
We believe that our ability to deploy nitric oxide in a solid form, on demand and in localized formulations allows us the potential to improve patient outcomes in a variety of diseases. 
Nitric Oxide Background
Nitric oxide, or NO, is a two-atom molecule that is produced naturally by the human body. Since the Nobel Prize-winning discovery in 1998 that nitric oxide is responsible for regulating blood flow, or vasodilation, the effects of nitric oxide have been extensively studied in many areas of physiology.
As a fundamental component in host defense against invading organisms, cells of the immune system naturally generate nitric oxide using the enzyme nitric oxide synthase, or NOS, and the amino acid precursor L-arginine. Nitric oxide is released in a targeted manner to kill microbial pathogens, including bacteria, fungi and viruses.
We believe that Novan's Nitricil technology has the potential to be a novel antimicrobial agent by delivering therapeutic quantities of nitric oxide and leveraging nitric oxide's multiple mechanisms of action and its ability as a gas to diffuse freely through cell membranes – unlike most other pharmaceutical agents. Importantly, the pharmacologic activity of nitric oxide is such that its production is localized at or near the site of infection. Because nitric oxide is a key component of the immune system’s natural response to invading organisms, it may provide a therapeutic solution for degrading and killing microorganisms without the development of anti-microbial resistance.
Nitric oxide and its multiple mechanisms of action have wide ranging possibilities to treat human disease. We believe that our expertise at developing nitric oxide-releasing NCEs and fine tuning the formulation technology to the targeted disease separates us from other drug development companies focused in this space. Nitric oxide is a naturally occurring chemical in the human body, which enhances its safety profile. The proven anti-microbial and anti-inflammatory effects of nitric oxide, combined with its naturally strong safety profile and our ability to capture and deliver effective doses, positions Novan with the potential to generate differentiated product candidates. 
Priority Development Pipeline
We are currently focusing our efforts on our Priority Development Pipeline. We presently maintain exclusive, worldwide commercial rights for all product candidates currently in our pipeline, with the exception of the rights we have licensed to Sato Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Sato, to develop, use and sell SB204 and SB206 in Japan. 
Our priority development pipeline is currently positioned as shown in Figure 1 below.
Figure 1:
SB206, a Topical Anti-viral Treatment for Molluscum Contagiosum (a Viral Skin Infection)
We are developing SB206 (12% berdazimer sodium, 10.3% berdazimer) as a topical gel with anti-viral properties for the treatment of viral skin infections, with a current focus on molluscum contagiosum. Molluscum is a contagious skin infection caused by the molluscipoxvirus that affects up to six million people in the United States annually. The greatest incidence is in children aged one to 14 years. The average time to resolution is 13 months, however, 13% of children experience lesions that may not resolve in 24 months. There is no FDA-approved prescription drug treatment for molluscum. More than half of patients diagnosed with the infection are untreated. The majority of patients in the United States that receive treatment are treated with potentially painful procedures and the remaining are often prescribed products indicated for the treatment of external genital warts.
Based on the results of our initial Phase 3 trials for SB206 (referred to as B-SIMPLE1 and B-SIMPLE2), announced in January 2020, we held a Type C meeting with the FDA on April 1, 2020 seeking feedback on our proposal to conduct one additional, well-controlled pivotal study of SB206 to support a future NDA. Based on feedback, the FDA provided guidance indicating that the FDA would consider one additional pivotal trial, the B-SIMPLE4 Phase 3 trial, that, if successful, could be supported by the previously completed B-SIMPLE2 trial for a future NDA submission. In addition, the FDA provided guidance with regard to both the study design for the B-SIMPLE4 Phase 3 trial and expectations for a future NDA submission.
B-SIMPLE4 was designed as a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of SB206 12% once daily that exceeded its enrollment target by randomizing 891 total patients (1:1 active:vehicle randomization), 
ages 6 months and above, with molluscum, across 55 clinical sites. Patients were treated once-daily with SB206 12% or Vehicle Gel for a minimum of 4 weeks and up to 12 weeks to all treatable lesions (baseline and new). There were visits at Screening/Baseline, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8 and Week 12, and a safety follow-up at Week 24. As part of B-SIMPLE4’s study design, we also implemented additional patient and caregiver training and patient engagement efforts and offered decentralized visit capabilities for conducting visits during the COVID-19 pandemic. The primary efficacy endpoint for B-SIMPLE4 was the proportion of patients achieving complete clearance of all treatable molluscum lesions at Week 12.
We initiated the B-SIMPLE4 trial in August 2020, the first patient was enrolled and dosed in September 2020, the trial completed patient enrollment during the first quarter of 2021 and the final patient completed their last Week-12 visit in late April 2021. We announced positive top-line efficacy and safety results on June 11, 2021. In the B-SIMPLE4 trial, 32.4% of patients experienced total clearance at Week 12 and 43.5% experienced total clearance or one remaining lesion at Week 12. B-SIMPLE4 achieved statistical significance for the primary endpoint with a p-value less than 0.0001. B-SIMPLE4 also achieved statistical significance for all secondary endpoints. P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of less than 0.050 is generally considered to represent statistical significance, meaning there is less than five percent likelihood that the observed results occurred by chance. We announced the B-SIMPLE4 trial’s last patient visit in late July 2021 and the final safety profile through Week 24 was released in the third quarter of 2021. The comprehensive safety data readout demonstrated a favorable safety profile, consistent with previous studies and met our expectations. Based on these data, we believe that SB206, if approved, could provide a powerful treatment option for children and adults with molluscum. We are targeting a potential NDA submission of SB206 for molluscum no later than the fourth quarter of 2022 and are preparing for regulatory filing and potential approval of SB206 as a treatment for molluscum. Additionally, we received notice that the FDA has conditionally accepted Kinsolus™ as the brand name for SB206, if approved.
Amended Sato Agreement
In 2018, we licensed rights to Sato Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., or Sato, to develop, use, and sell SB206 in certain topical dosage forms in Japan for the treatment of viral skin infections, and to manufacture the finished form of SB206 for sale in Japan, which are in addition to the rights granted to Sato related to SB204 for the treatment of acne vulgaris. The significant terms and the related accounting considerations of our licensing arrangement with Sato are further described in “Note 4—Licensing Arrangements” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
In April 2020, Sato informed us of its intention to progress the SB206 development program in Japan with a Phase 1 clinical trial given the observed treatment benefit and favorable safety profile in the B-SIMPLE program. In November of 2020, Sato determined its initial Japanese Phase 1 study for SB206 would require an amended design, including evaluation of potential lower dose strengths, to further refine dose tolerability in a subsequent Phase 1 study. In the fourth quarter of 2020 we concluded that a prospective delay in Sato’s overall SB206 development plan had occurred and we estimated the program timeline to be extended by 1.75 years from our previous estimate, and a corresponding extension of the performance period estimate to 9.25 years, completing in the second quarter of 2026. 
In late July 2021, Sato communicated an updated plan regarding its amended design for its additional Japanese Phase 1 study for SB206. The amended study design includes evaluation of potential lower dose strengths, including potential further refinement in a subsequent dose tolerability study. As part of the communication regarding these Phase 1 studies, Sato also communicated an updated comprehensive timeline for the Japanese SB206 program. The updated timeline assumes that the 12% formulation is appropriate to proceed for development in Japan and is to be reassessed based on the findings of the Phase 1 study.
Based upon (i) the expected timing of the additional Phase 1 study; (ii) Sato’s estimated comprehensive developmental schedule for SB206, including additional post-Phase 1 clinical trials; and (iii) current and future Japanese clinical trial material manufacturing and technical transfer considerations, including the manufacturing site for drug product, we concluded that a prospective delay in Sato’s overall SB206 Japanese development plan had occurred in July 2021. We estimate the program timeline to be extended by 0.75 years from our previous estimate, and a corresponding extension of the performance period estimate to 10 years, completing in the first quarter of 2027. We understand that the progression of the Japanese SB204 program could follow the same timeline as the Japanese SB206 program, subject to the nature of the results of Sato’s comprehensive asset developmental program, including SB206. 
In early January 2022, Sato communicated its decision to progress with the 12% formulation in its Phase 1 study, rather than lower dose strengths. Therefore, the most recent estimated development timeline remains reasonable, and continues to be subject to prospective reassessment and adjustment based upon Sato’s interaction with the Japanese regulatory authorities and other developmental and timing considerations. The details of this development are further described in “Note 5—Revenue Recognition” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. 
SB204, for the Treatment of Acne Vulgaris
SB204 is a product candidate designed as a once-daily, topical monotherapy for the treatment of acne vulgaris, a multi-factorial disease with multiple aspects of the disease pathology (immunomodulatory and anti-bacterial). Acne vulgaris is the most common skin condition in the United States. The disease ranges in severity from mild to severe cystic acne and causes both physical and psychological effects, including permanent scarring, anxiety, depression and poor self-esteem. Acne is a multi-factorial disease with several mechanistic contributors to the disease pathology, often requiring multiple treatments that address more than one of the major causes of acne pathogenesis. Localized nitric oxide delivery may provide immunomodulatory (anti-inflammatory) and anti-bacterial mechanisms of action from a single active ingredient.
We believe that acne continues to be characterized as an unmet medical need due to the difficulty of balancing efficacy, systemic safety and cutaneous tolerability, as well as the growing concerns with anti-bacterial resistance with existing therapies. In our SB204 clinical development program, topical application of SB204 has been well-tolerated with no significant safety concerns identified. In maximal-use pharmacokinetic trials that we have conducted in adult and pediatric patients with acne vulgaris, we observed no detectable systemic exposure from SB204 following its topical application.
In the first quarter of 2017, we reported top-line results from two identically designed Phase 3 pivotal clinical trials for SB204. SB204 demonstrated statistical significance compared to vehicle on all three co-primary endpoints in one of the trials but demonstrated statistical significance on only one of three co-primary endpoints in the other trial. We conducted an in-depth examination of the full data sets from these trials, including post hoc analyses in pooled and sub populations, with extensive assistance from third-party expert consultants in biostatistics and regulatory affairs. In mid-2017 we completed our 40-week long term safety trial in eligible patients with acne who had previously completed 12 weeks of treatment in the related Phase 3 pivotal trials of SB204. No serious adverse events were observed with over 400 patients followed for six months and over 200 patients followed for one year.
We have had several interactions with the FDA since mid-2017 regarding SB204 and the acne indication. In September 2017, we conducted a guidance meeting with the FDA to obtain clinical and regulatory guidance by reviewing the previously completed parallel Phase 3 pivotal trials in patients with moderate-to-severe acne. The FDA’s specific feedback noted that there were no additional safety requirements and that one additional pivotal trial, in moderate-to-severe acne, would be required for submission of an NDA. In the third quarter of 2018, the FDA provided feedback on two potential paths forward for the acne indication, confirming the need for one additional pivotal trial for moderate-to-severe acne patients prior to an NDA submission.
Based on the recent positive pivotal Phase 3 results in the SB206 molluscum development program, we believe we can optimize the trial design of a pivotal Phase 3 study for SB204 that has the potential to serve as a second pivotal trial to support an NDA submission. As such, we plan to prepare for a pivotal Phase 3 study during 2022; target the conduct of a potential pivotal Phase 3 trial in 2023, subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering; and target a potential NDA submission of SB204 for acne in 2024. 
In January 2017, we licensed rights to Sato to develop, use, and sell SB204 in certain topical dosage forms in Japan for the treatment of acne vulgaris, and to manufacture the finished form of SB204 for sale in Japan. The significant terms and the related accounting considerations of our licensing arrangement with Sato are further described in “Note 4—Licensing Arrangements” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements. For further information regarding the current status of the Japanese SB204 program see “Note 5—Revenue Recognition” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements.
SB019, an intranasal treatment option for Coronaviridae (COVID-19)
We continue to explore the use of our proprietary Nitricil technology to progress SB019, a potential intranasal treatment option for COVID-19, targeting the reduction of viral shedding and transmission. Nitric oxide has generally demonstrated the ability to inhibit viral replication of viruses within the Coronaviridae family, and we have an extensive body of in vitro and in vivo data demonstrating the efficacy of our proprietary technology for other anti-viral indications. Based on the scientific literature and data available to-date related to berdazimer sodium and SB206, we believe that nitric oxide may inhibit viral replication by disrupting protein function critical for viral replication and infection through generation of reactive intermediates.
In October 2020, we announced positive in vitro results showing the potential efficacy of our Nitricil platform technology, berdazimer sodium (NVN1000), as an anti-viral against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. To evaluate the ability of our Nitricil platform technology as a potential nasal treatment option for COVID-19, we initiated in vitro assessments targeting the reduction of viral burden in differentiated normal human bronchial epithelial cells. The studies were conducted at the Institute for Antiviral Research at Utah State University, and these results demonstrate the first instance of an anti-viral effect from a nitric oxide-based medicine in a 3-D tissue model that has similar structure to the human airway epithelium. The results from the in vitro
assessment of concentrations as low as 0.75 mg/mL demonstrated that berdazimer sodium reduced 90% of the virus after repeat dosing, once daily.
In December 2020, we entered into a Master Services Agreement with Catalent, Inc., a leading global provider of integrated services, delivery technologies and manufacturing solutions, relating to our COVID-19 program. This agreement includes work to support CMC activities and development of an intranasal formulation of berdazimer sodium for use in that program.

To further evaluate the potential of our Nitricil platform technology as an intranasal treatment option for COVID-19, we initiated preliminary preclinical in vivo studies to evaluate the efficacy of berdazimer sodium in reducing viral burden in infected animals and to deter viral transmission to uninfected animals.
In June 2021, we announced positive results from two separate studies that independently demonstrated the ability of berdazimer sodium to prevent progression of infection into the lungs after transmission, significantly limiting severity of disease in this model. The intranasal treatment was well-tolerated during these studies, and no treatment-related adverse effects were observed. 
In November 2021, we announced favorable results of a Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, 14-day repeat dose intranasal study. The preclinical safety data indicated that intranasal administration of SB019 formulation is well tolerated and safe. The GLP study evaluated repeated dosing with the SB019 product candidate (i.e., 5 times daily) for a period of 14 days and concluded with a 7-day recovery period without drug exposure. There were no treatment-related adverse events up to the highest dose tested of 14 mg/day berdazimer sodium, and the SB019 formulation was concluded to be well-tolerated under the conditions of this study.
Based on the positive preclinical and clinical data demonstrating anti-viral effect of berdazimer sodium against multiple viruses, as well as the public health need to reduce breakthrough infections and transmission, we plan to advance our SB019 product candidate. Pre-investigational new drug, or IND, application activities are underway with a target of an IND submission in 2022. Subject to regulatory guidance, our targeted timeline includes (i) initiating a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers in 2022; (ii) conducting a potential Phase 2/3 study(s) in 2023, subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering; and (iii) a potential NDA submission of SB019 for COVID-19 in 2024.
Pipeline Expansion Opportunities
Our pipeline expansion opportunities are currently positioned as shown in Figure 2 below.
Figure 2:
SB414, for the Treatment of Inflammatory Skin Diseases, including Atopic Dermatitis and Psoriasis
SB414 is a product candidate designed as a topical cream for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases, with a focus on the treatment of atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. In 2018, we completed two complementary Phase 1b clinical trials with SB414 in patients with atopic dermatitis and psoriasis. The design of these complementary trials was to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of SB414. The trials were also designed to assess pharmacodynamics and specific target engagement through a reduction of key inflammatory biomarkers.
Atopic Dermatitis
We initiated a Phase 1b trial with SB414 in adults with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in December 2017. In the Phase 1b trial, 48 adults with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis, with up to 30% body surface area at baseline, were randomized to receive one of 2% SB414 cream, 6% SB414 cream, or vehicle, twice daily for two weeks. In the complementary Phase 1b trial for mild-to-moderate chronic plaque psoriasis, 36 adults received SB414 6% cream or vehicle twice daily for four weeks. 
We received and analyzed the preliminary top-line results from the Phase 1b clinical trials during the second and third quarters of 2018. In the atopic dermatitis trial, biomarkers from the Th2, Th17 and Th22 inflammatory pathways known to be highly relevant and indicative of atopic dermatitis, including Interleukin-13, or IL-13, IL-4R, IL-5, IL-17A and IL-22, were downregulated after two weeks of treatment with SB414 2%. The changes in Th2 and Th22 biomarkers and clinical efficacy assessed as the percent change in Eczema Area Severity Index scores were highly correlated in the SB414 2% group. Additionally, the proportion of patients achieving a greater than or equal to 3-point improvement on the pruritus (itch) numeric rating scale after two weeks of treatment was greater for patients treated with SB414 2% compared to patients treated with vehicle. 
The 2% or 6% doses of SB414 in the trial did not result in any serious adverse events, and SB414 2% was more tolerable with no patients discontinuing treatment in the trial due to application site reactions. SB414 at the 6% dose was not consistently effective in reducing biomarkers across both the atopic dermatitis and psoriasis trials. This lack of consistent biomarker movement could potentially be explained by the increased irritation score experienced by patients treated with SB414 6%. SB414 6% showed detectable systemic exposure in a subset of patients, which cleared in nearly all affected patients within 12 hours, in both the atopic dermatitis and psoriasis trials. Given the successful downregulation of key biomarkers, favorable tolerability and unquantifiable systemic exposure with SB414 2%, we conducted non-clinical studies and completed our Phase 2 clinical development plan during 2019 to support a potential future Phase 2 clinical program launch. The SB414 program is currently on hold with further advancement subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.
Psoriasis
We initiated clinical development of SB414, our first use of our nitric oxide platform in the field of immunology, by dosing the first patient in October 2017 in a Phase 1b clinical trial to evaluate SB414 as a cream for the treatment of psoriasis. In the Phase 1b trial for mild-to-moderate chronic plaque psoriasis, 36 adults received SB414 6% cream or vehicle twice daily for four weeks. SB414 at the 6% dose did not result in any serious adverse events, but SB414 at the 6% dose was not consistently effective in reducing biomarkers across the trial. This lack of consistent biomarker movement could potentially be explained by the increased irritation score experienced by patients treated with SB414 6%. SB414 6% showed detectable systemic exposure in a subset of patients, which cleared in nearly all affected patients within 12 hours. Based on the results of the Phase 1b trial in psoriasis, we could potentially explore the use of lower doses of SB414 in psoriasis, subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.
SB208, for the Treatment of Athlete’s Foot (Tinea Pedis) and Fungal Nail Infections (Onychomycosis)
SB208 is a product candidate designed as a topical broad-spectrum anti-fungal gel for the potential treatment of fungal infections of the skin and nails, including athlete’s foot (tinea pedis) and fungal nail infections (onychomycosis). Studies have demonstrated enhanced efficacy when tinea pedis and onychomycosis are treated concurrently, suggesting that an effective topical treatment, suitable for simultaneous application to the nail plate and skin, may lead to lower rates of recurrence and enhanced efficacy.
We conducted a Phase 2 proof-of-concept trial in patients with clinical signs and symptoms of tinea pedis and announced top-line results in the second quarter of 2017. SB208 demonstrated a statistically significant effect compared to vehicle in (i) the primary endpoint of achieving negative fungal culture at day 14; and (ii) the secondary endpoint of achieving mycological cure at day 14 (mycological cure is defined by having a negative laboratory culture and negative fungal clinical diagnosis). At the end of a 4-week post treatment follow-up period, mycological cure was maintained at day 42 in both dose groups.
We conducted a Phase 1, single-center, double-blinded, randomized clinical trial in 32 adult females to evaluate the rate of fingernail growth associated with SB208 16% cream and the local tolerability of the gel when used over the course of 29 days. SB208 16% cream demonstrated a statistically significant greater mean daily nail growth rate for the treatment period when compared to the same patient’s own growth rate in the run-in period and was well tolerated by patients.

The SB208 program is currently on hold with further advancement subject to obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.
SB207, for the Treatment of External Genital Warts
Genital warts are among the world’s most common sexually transmitted diseases. We have previously evaluated SB206’s anti-viral activity in a Phase 2 randomized, double-blinded, vehicle-controlled clinical trial in 107 patients with genital warts caused by HPV. We announced top-line results from this Phase 2 clinical trial in the fourth quarter of 2016. SB206 demonstrated statistically significant results in the clearance of external genital and perianal warts. Once-daily treatment arms were generally well-tolerated, including the most effective dose, SB206 12% once-daily. With the full results from this Phase 2 trial made available, a Type B meeting was held with the FDA in the second quarter of 2017 with minutes received shortly thereafter.
In response to our identification of targeted viral opportunities of high unmet need where we believe our nitric oxide releasing technology could provide clinical benefit to patients, we developed SB207, a new anti-viral product candidate for the treatment of external genital warts. The SB207 product candidate incorporates our existing drug substance, berdazimer sodium (NVN1000), including the nitric oxide release profile of SB206, in a new formulation specifically tailored for external genital warts. Following the FDA’s December 2019 feedback from a pre-IND meeting request with the FDA, we have determined that further advancement of SB207 is subject to further evaluation of clinical plans and developmental timelines, as well as obtaining additional financing or strategic partnering.
Advancement in Men’s and Women’s Health
In February 2020, following the successful progression of a Phase 1 grant received in August 2019, we were awarded a Phase 2 federal grant of approximately $1.0 million from the National Institute of Health, or NIH, that will enable the conduct of IND-
enabling toxicology and pharmacology studies and other preclinical activity of a nitric oxide containing intravaginal gel (WH602) designed to treat high-risk HPV infections that can lead to cervical intraepithelial neoplasias, or CIN. In March 2021, we were awarded additional funding of $0.1 million as part of this Phase 2 grant. Under the terms of the aforementioned NIH grant, we are entitled to receive the grant funds in the form of periodic reimbursements of our allowable direct expenses, allocated overhead, general and administrative expenses and payment of other specified amounts.
This product candidate, in addition to a non-gel formulation product candidate (WH504) supported by a federal grant from the U.S. Department of Defense’s, or DoD, Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs, or CDMRP, currently in development, together represent the core of our Men’s and Women’s Health business unit. This unit has continued to be supported through a collaboration with Health Decisions, Inc., or Health Decisions, a Premier Research company.
Companion Animal Health
We have initiated exploratory work to evaluate our new chemical entity, NVN4100, as a potential product candidate for antimicrobial indications in companion animal health. On June 7, 2021, we announced positive proof-of-concept in vitro results and informative in vivo results with NVN4100. This program is currently on hold, pending the engagement of potential collaborators or strategic partners to progress this asset, including the conduct of additional studies and formulation work.
Competition
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. We consider our primary potential competition to be a broad base of existing providers and drug developers of therapeutics in the field of dermatology, specifically related to treatments for molluscum and acne vulgaris.
Additional providers and drug developers will become primary potential competition as we expand our platform to include infectious diseases, companion animal health, and men’s and women’s health therapeutic areas. Product competition includes pharmaceutical generics, branded generics, pharmaceutical brands, biologics as well as over-the-counter, or OTC, products. 
We expect continued future competition across research and drug development in various different fields of innovation; capital and resource allocation to many of these areas appears to be continuous and of a global nature. In addition, there are certain instances where competition extends into the medical procedure and the medical device spectrums of human health care. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with these existing therapies as well as new therapies that may become available in the future. Our success will be based in part on our ability to identify, develop and manage a portfolio of product candidates that are safer and more effective than competing products and therapies.
Intellectual Property
Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our product candidates and technologies and to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others. We seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications that may affect our business, and to the extent we identify such developments, evaluating and taking appropriate courses of action. With respect to the former, our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing for patent applications on inventions that are important to the development and conduct of our business with the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, and its foreign counterparts. We also use other forms of protection, such as trademark, copyright and trade secret protection, to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable.
We own or have an exclusive license to issued patents and pending patent applications in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions (including applications filed in foreign jurisdictions and international or Patent Cooperation Treaty, or PCT, applications that have not yet entered national phase). Patent coverage lasts for varying periods according to the date of filing of the patent application or the date of grant or issuance of the patent and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. Generally, patents issued for regularly filed applications in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in certain instances, the term of a patent can be extended to recapture a portion of the USPTO delay in issuing the patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over another patent that expires earlier. The term of a patent may also be eligible for patent term extension to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the extension term cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product by product basis from country to country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
Nitricil Technology
We exclusively license from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, or UNC, issued patents and pending applications directed to our library of Nitricil compounds, including patents issued in the United States, Canada, Italy, Great Britain, France, Ireland, Germany, Finland, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Japan and Australia with claims intended to cover NVN1000, the NCE for our current clinical-stage product candidates. Additionally, one such issued patent in the United States has claims specifically directed to the composition of matter of NVN1000. These patents and pending applications, if issued, are projected to expire in 2026 without taking into account any patent term extensions that may be available to us. Additionally, NVN1000 has been classified as an NCE, and patent term extensions may be available to extend the life of a United States patent that covers NVN1000 beyond 2026. We also own patents issued in the United States, China, Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy and Switzerland directed to methods of manufacturing Nitricil compounds. These patents are projected to expire in 2032.
Formulation Science and Therapeutic Uses
We own patents issued in the United States, Australia, Germany, Spain, France, Great Britain, Ireland, Italy, China, Mexico, South Korea, Brazil, Canada, and Japan directed to methods of reducing sebum production using nitric oxide-releasing macromolecules, including, in certain embodiments, through the use of Nitricil compounds. We also own issued patents in the United States, Australia, Germany, Spain, Great Britain, Italy, Finland, France, and Japan and pending applications filed in the United States, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe and Japan directed to the alcohol gel component of SB204 and SB206 and/or the SB204 and SB206 two-component formulations. We own patents issued in the United States, Australia, Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Great Britain, and Japan and are pursuing patent applications in the United States, Brazil, Canada, China, Europe and South Korea directed to the use of nitric oxide-releasing compounds, including, in certain embodiments, Nitricil compounds, for the treatment of viral skin infections.
Altogether, our issued United States and foreign patents and pending United States and foreign patent applications, if issued, relating to one or more of our clinical-stage product candidates are projected to expire between 2026 and 2037, without taking into account any patent term extensions that may be available to us and assuming that prosecution is pursued to issuance with no shortening of term.
Other Patented Technology
In addition to the patents and pending applications we own or have an exclusive license related to Nitricil compounds and our product candidates, we also own or have exclusive licenses to issued patents and pending applications in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions covering other nitric oxide-based therapeutics and/or methods of use in indications for dermatological and oncovirus-mediated diseases.
Trade Secrets
We rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information by limiting access to such information on a need-to-know basis exclusively. In addition, we seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisors to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements, or to include such provisions in their consulting agreement, upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements and provisions, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Trademarks
Novan® is a registered trademark of our company in the United States. In addition, we have pending trademark applications in the United States, including for Nitricil and Kinsolus.
Research and Development Arrangements
On April 29, 2019, we entered into a royalty and milestone payments purchase agreement with Reedy Creek Investments LLC, or Reedy Creek, pursuant to which Reedy Creek provided us funding in an initial amount of $25.0 million, for us to use primarily to pursue the development, regulatory approval and potential commercialization activities for SB206, for the treatment of molluscum, and advance programmatically other activities with respect to SB414, for atopic dermatitis, and SB204, for acne.
On May 4, 2019, we entered into a development funding and royalties agreement, or the Funding Agreement, with Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated, or Ligand, pursuant to which Ligand provided us funding of $12.0 million, which we used to pursue the development and regulatory approval of SB206, for the treatment of molluscum.
Please see “Note 6—Research and Development Arrangements” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report for additional information regarding these research and development arrangements, including our obligations under these agreements.
Collaboration and Licensing Agreements
Amended Sato License Agreement
In 2017, we entered into a license agreement, and a related first amendment, with Sato, or collectively, the Sato Agreement, whereby we licensed rights to develop, use, and sell SB204 in certain topical dosage forms in Japan for the treatment of acne vulgaris, and to manufacture the finished form of SB204 for sale in Japan. In October 2018, we entered into a second amendment to the Sato Agreement, or the Sato Amendment, and collectively, with the Sato Agreement, the Amended Sato Agreement. The Sato Amendment expands the Amended Sato Agreement to include SB206, our product candidate for the treatment of viral skin infections, including molluscum. Pursuant to the Amended Sato Agreement, we granted to Sato an exclusive, royalty-bearing, non-transferable license under certain of our intellectual property rights, with the right to sublicense with our prior written consent, to develop, use and sell products in Japan that incorporate SB206 or SB204 in certain topical dosage forms for the treatment of viral skin infections or acne vulgaris, respectively, and to make the finished form of such products. We, or our designated contract manufacturer will also supply finished product to Sato for use in development of SB204 or SB206 in the licensed territory. The rights granted to Sato do not include the right to manufacture the API of SB206 or SB204; rather, the parties agreed to negotiate a commercial supply agreement pursuant to which we or a third-party contract manufacturer would be the exclusive supplier to Sato of the API for the commercial manufacture of licensed products in the licensed territory.
Under the terms of the Amended Sato Agreement, we also have exclusive rights to certain intellectual property that may be developed by Sato in the future, which we may choose to use for our own development and commercialization of SB204 or SB206 outside of Japan. The term of the Amended Sato Agreement (and the period during which Sato must pay royalties under the Amended Sato Agreement) expires on the twentieth anniversary of the first commercial sale of a licensed product in the licensed field in the licensed territory. 
In April 2020, Sato informed us of its intention to progress the SB206 development program in Japan with a Phase 1 clinical trial given the observed treatment benefit and favorable safety profile in the B-SIMPLE program. In November of 2020, Sato determined its initial Japanese Phase 1 study for SB206 would require an amended design, including potential evaluation of lower dose strengths, to further refine dose tolerability in a subsequent Phase 1 study. Based upon (i) the need for an additional Phase 1 study; (ii) Sato’s current estimated comprehensive developmental schedule for SB206 including additional post-Phase 1 clinical trials; and (iii) current and future Japanese clinical trial material manufacturing and technical transfer considerations, the Company has concluded that a prospective delay in Sato’s overall SB206 development plan has occurred. The Company estimates the program timeline to be extended by 1.75 years from its previous estimate, and a corresponding extension of the performance period to 9.25 years, currently estimated to be completed in the second quarter of 2026. 
In late July 2021, Sato communicated an updated plan regarding its amended design for its additional Japanese Phase 1 study for SB206. The amended study design includes evaluation of potential lower dose strengths, including potential further refinement in a subsequent dose tolerability study. As part of the communication regarding these Phase 1 studies, Sato also communicated an updated comprehensive timeline for the Japanese SB206 program. The updated timeline assumes that the 12% formulation is appropriate to proceed for development in Japan, and is to be reassessed based on the findings of the Phase 1 study.
Based upon (i) the expected timing of the additional Phase 1 study; (ii) Sato’s estimated comprehensive developmental schedule for SB206, including additional post-Phase 1 clinical trials; and (iii) current and future Japanese clinical trial material manufacturing and technical transfer considerations, including the manufacturing site for drug product, we concluded that a prospective delay in Sato’s overall SB206 Japanese development plan had occurred in July 2021. We estimate the program timeline to be extended by 0.75 years from our previous estimate, and a corresponding extension of the performance period estimate to 10 years, completing in the first quarter of 2027. We understand that the progression of the Japanese SB204 program could follow the same timeline as the Japanese SB206 program, subject to the nature of the results of Sato’s comprehensive asset developmental program, including SB206. 
In early January 2022, Sato communicated its decision to progress with the 12% formulation in its Phase 1 study, rather than lower dose strengths. Therefore, the most recent estimated development timeline remains reasonable, and continues to be subject to 
prospective reassessment and adjustment based upon Sato’s interaction with the Japanese regulatory authorities and other developmental and timing considerations.
For additional information about the Amended Sato Agreement, please refer to the sections entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in this Annual Report and “Note 4—Licensing Arrangements” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
UNC License Agreement
We acquired exclusive rights to our library of Nitricil compounds pursuant to license agreements with UNC entered into in July 2007 and October 2009, which were subsequently amended, restated and consolidated in June 2012. We amended the consolidated license agreement in November 2012 to expand the scope of licensed patents to cover additional nitric oxide technologies in consideration for an upfront cash payment. We may obtain similar amendments to the consolidated license agreement to expand the scope of licensed patents to cover future additional nitric oxide technologies or as improvements on licensed technology and, if such amendments were executed, we may be required to pay additional upfront cash payments. In April 2016, November 2018 and November 2021, we amended the agreement to clarify the scope of the intellectual property of the consolidated license agreement and to make modifications to certain milestones under the consolidated license agreement. 
Under the consolidated license agreement with UNC, we are granted an exclusive, worldwide license, with the ability to sublicense, under the licensed UNC patents, including those directed to Nitricil compounds, to develop and commercialize products utilizing the licensed technology. As partial consideration for the consolidated license agreement, we issued 19,105 shares of our common stock to UNC and a nominal upfront cash payment. Additionally, under the consolidated license agreement, we are obligated to pay UNC a running royalty percentage in the low single digits on net sales of licensed products (by us or any of our sublicensees, such as Sato), and to pay up to $425,000 to UNC in regulatory and commercial milestones on a licensed product by licensed product basis.
Under the consolidated license agreement, UNC controls prosecution activities with respect to licensed patents owned solely by UNC, we control prosecution activities with respect to licensed patents jointly owned by us and UNC and we are obligated to reimburse UNC for reasonable prosecution and maintenance costs. Pursuant to the consolidated license agreement, we have the first right to defend against third-party claims of patent infringement with respect to the licensed products and to enforce the licensed patents against third-party infringers.
Unless earlier terminated by us at our election, or if we materially breach the agreement or become bankrupt, the consolidated license agreement remains in effect on a country by country and licensed product by licensed product basis until the expiration of the last to expire issued patent covering such licensed product in the applicable country, and upon such expiration, we receive a perpetual, unrestricted, fully-paid and royalty free right to develop and commercialize such licensed product in such country. As of December 31, 2021, the last to expire issued patent licensed to us under the consolidated license agreement is projected to expire in 2033. UNC may terminate the agreement or render the license granted thereunder non-exclusive for our material breach of the agreement that remains uncured after 90 days of receipt of written notice thereof from UNC and may also terminate the agreement or render the license granted thereunder non-exclusive upon providing written notice for our bankruptcy or insolvency-related events within 30 days of the occurrence of such events. We may terminate the agreement at any time for convenience upon providing written notice of not less than 30 days to UNC.
Separation Transaction and Licensing Arrangements with KNOW Bio, including Amendments
2015 Separation Transaction and Licensing Arrangements
In connection with the December 2015 separation of our non-dermatology assets to KNOW Bio, we granted to KNOW Bio, through two separate agreements, exclusive licenses, with the right to sublicense, to certain United States and foreign patents and patent applications controlled by us as of the execution date of the agreement, and, under one of the agreements, patents and patent applications which became controlled by us during the three years immediately following the execution date of such agreement, directed towards nitric oxide-releasing compositions and methods of manufacturing thereof, including methods of manufacturing Nitricil compounds, and other nitric oxide-based therapeutics. 
Under the exclusive licenses, the following rights were retained by Novan or conveyed to KNOW Bio:
•Novan retained exclusive development and commercialization rights in all fields for any products containing certain specified particles, referred to as the Novan Particles, including those in our NVN1000 API and in other NCEs we are developing. 
•Novan retained exclusive rights to develop and commercialize products utilizing the licensed technology in the Retained Dermatology Field, which is defined as the diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and palliation of diseases,

For additional information about the Separation Transaction, please see “Note 2—KNOW Bio, LLC” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
2017 Amendments to KNOW Bio Licensing Arrangements
In October 2017, we entered into certain amendments, or the KNOW Bio Amendments, to the original license and sublicense agreements described above between us and KNOW Bio, or the Original KNOW Bio Agreements. Pursuant to the terms of the KNOW Bio Amendments, we re-acquired from KNOW Bio exclusive, worldwide rights under certain United States and foreign patents and patent applications controlled by us as of the execution date of the Original KNOW Bio Agreements, and patents and patent applications which became controlled by us during the three years immediately following the execution date of the Original KNOW Bio Agreements, directed towards nitric oxide-releasing compositions and methods of manufacturing thereof, including methods of manufacturing Nitricil compounds, and other nitric oxide-based therapeutics, to develop and commercialize products for all diagnostic, therapeutic, prophylactic and palliative uses for any disease, condition or disorder caused by certain oncoviruses, or the Oncovirus Field. KNOW Bio also granted to us an exclusive license, with the right to sublicense, under any patents and patent applications which became controlled by KNOW Bio during the three years immediately following the execution date of the 
Original KNOW Bio Agreements and directed towards nitric oxide-releasing compositions and methods of manufacturing thereof, including methods of manufacturing Nitricil compounds, and other nitric oxide-based therapeutics, but not towards medical devices, to develop and commercialize products for use in the Oncovirus Field. Additionally, KNOW Bio agreed that KNOW Bio would not commercialize any products in the Oncovirus Field during the first three years following the execution date of the Original KNOW Bio Agreements. The three-year period in which new patents and patent applications controlled by KNOW Bio are added to the exclusive license and the three-year term of the commercialization non-compete both expired on December 29, 2018. 
The rights granted to us in the Oncovirus Field in the KNOW Bio Amendments continue for so long as there is a valid patent claim under the Agreements, and upon expiration continue on a perpetual non-exclusive basis, and are subject to the termination rights of KNOW Bio and us that are set forth in the Original KNOW Bio Agreements. In addition, under the KNOW Bio Amendments, KNOW Bio may terminate the rights granted to the Company in the Oncovirus Field without terminating the Original KNOW Bio Agreements.
Additional terms, including our financial obligations, under the KNOW Bio Amendments are described in further detail in “Note 2—KNOW Bio, LLC” to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report.
Government Regulation
The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates.
United States Government Regulation
In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. 
The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s Good Laboratory Practice, or GLP, regulations;
•submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
•approval by an independent Institutional Review Board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
•performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
•submission to the FDA of an NDA after completion of all pivotal clinical trials;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
•satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity, and of selected clinical investigation sites to assess compliance with GCPs; and
•FDA review and approval of the NDA to permit marketing of the product for particular indications for uses in the United States.
Preclinical Studies
Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. Prior to beginning the first clinical trial with a product candidate in the United States, a sponsor must submit an IND to the FDA, which is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational drug product to humans. To support an IND to conduct clinical trials, a sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and 
places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
Clinical trials involve the administration of the IND to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. Depending on its charter, this group may determine whether a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access to certain data from the trial. In addition, information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health for public dissemination on its www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1 clinical trial: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
•Phase 2 clinical trial: The drug is administered to a limited patient population with the specified disease or condition to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
•Phase 3 clinical trials: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population with the specified disease or condition, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 studies, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
While the IND is active, progress reports summarizing the results of the clinical trials and non-clinical studies performed since the last progress report, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA, and written IND safety reports must be submitted to the FDA and investigators for serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, and any clinically important increased rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction compared to that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug and finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality and purity of the final drug. In addition, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
Marketing Approval
Assuming successful completion of the required testing in accordance with all applicable regulatory requirements, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications for use. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee.
In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision as to whether it will accept the application for filing. The actual review time may be significantly longer, depending on the complexity of the review, FDA requests for additional information and the sponsor’s submission of additional information. 
The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. During its review, the FDA may raise additional issues or request additional data or information, during which time, the review period is generally suspended until such requests are received. This can delay, sometimes substantially, the FDA’s review and potential approval of an application.
The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. 
Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, or require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization. The FDA may also place other conditions on approval, including the requirement for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the NDA must submit a proposed REMS. The FDA will not approve the NDA without an approved REMS, if required. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. 
The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs or if unexpected safety or efficacy concerns arise. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. In addition, new government requirements, including those resulting from new legislation, may be established, or the FDA’s policies may change, which could impact the timeline for regulatory approval or otherwise impact ongoing development programs.
Special FDA Expedited Review and Approval Programs
The FDA offers a number of expedited development and review programs for qualifying product candidates. To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need for such disease or condition. Fast Track designation applies to the combination of the product candidate and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a Fast Track designated product candidate has opportunities for more frequent interactions with the applicable FDA review team during product development. In addition, the FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track designated product candidate on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA.
A product candidate intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may also be eligible for breakthrough therapy designation to expedite its development and review. A product candidate can receive breakthrough therapy designation if preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product candidate, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. The designation includes all of the fast track program features, as well as more intensive FDA interaction and guidance beginning as early as Phase 1, and an organizational commitment to expedite the development and review of the product candidate, including involvement of senior managers.
Any marketing application for a drug submitted to the FDA for approval, including a product candidate with a fast track designation or breakthrough therapy designation, may also be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. A product candidate is eligible for priority review if it is designed to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety or effectiveness compared to available alternatives for such disease or condition. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten-month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission.
In addition, product candidates studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved upon a determination that the product candidate has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures if the sponsor fails to conduct the required post-marketing studies or if such studies fail to verify the predicted clinical benefit. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product.
Fast track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, priority review, and accelerated approval do not change the standards for approval and approval is not guaranteed. Such designation may, however, expedite the development or approval process. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. 
Emergency Use Authorization
The Commissioner of the FDA, under delegated authority from the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or HHS, may, under certain circumstances allow for the marketing of a product that does not otherwise comply with FDA regulations by issuing an Emergency Use Authorization, or EUA, for such product. Specifically, before an EUA may be issued, there must be a government determination of certain threats or emergencies, or potential threats or emergencies. In the case of a public health emergency (or significant potential thereof), the Secretary of HHS must determine that the public health emergency affects or has the significant potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens abroad, and that it involves a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear agent, or CBRN, or a disease or condition that may be attributable to such CBRN. On February 4, 2020, the Secretary of HHS determined that there is such a public health emergency that involves the virus now known as SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes the COVID-19 infection. Once the determination of the threat or emergency has been made, the Secretary of HHS must then declare that an emergency exists justifying the issuance of EUAs for certain types of products (referred to as EUA declarations). On March 27, 2020, the Secretary of HHS declared – on the basis of his determination of a public health emergency that has the potential to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens living abroad that involves SARS-CoV-2 – that circumstances exist justifying authorization of drugs and biologics during the COVID-19 pandemic, subject to the terms of any EUA that is issued.
Once an EUA declaration has been issued, the FDA can issue EUAs for products that fall within the scope of that declaration. To issue an EUA, the FDA Commissioner must conclude that (1) the CBRN that is referred to in the EUA declaration can cause serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions; (2) based on the totality of scientific evidence available, it is reasonable to believe that the product may be effective in diagnosing, treating, or preventing the disease or condition attributable to the CBRN and that the product’s known and potential benefits outweigh its known and potential risks; and (3) there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product. Products subject to an EUA must still comply with the conditions of the EUA, including labeling and marketing requirements. Moreover, the authorization to market products under an EUA is limited to the period of time the EUA declaration is in effect, and the FDA can revoke an EUA in certain circumstances.
Post-Approval Requirements
Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences associated with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual program fee requirements for any marketed products.
The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. The FDA may also limit the indications for use or may impose labeling or other requirements on the product.
In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
•restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
•fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
•refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
•product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
•injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. Failure to comply with these requirements can result in, among other things, adverse publicity, warning letters, corrective advertising and potential civil and criminal penalties.
Other Health Care Laws
In addition to FDA restrictions on marketing of pharmaceutical products, other United States federal and state healthcare regulatory laws restrict business practices in the pharmaceutical industry, which include, but are not limited to, state and federal anti-kickback, false claims, and transparency laws with respect to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare providers.
The federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting, receiving or providing any remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for or recommending the purchase, lease, or order of any item or service reimbursable, in whole or in part, under Medicare, Medicaid or other federal healthcare programs. The term “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value. The Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers and formulary managers on the other. In addition, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. The majority of states also have anti-kickback laws, which establish similar prohibitions and in some cases may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.
The federal False Claims Act prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false, fictitious or fraudulent claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government, or from knowingly making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation. A claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the United States government. Violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute may also constitute a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act. Actions under the civil False Claims Act may be brought by the Attorney General or as a “qui tam” action by a private individual in the name of the government. Violations of the civil False Claims Act can result in very significant monetary penalties and treble damages. In addition, the civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent. Many states also have similar fraud and abuse statutes or regulations that apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payor. Given the significant size of actual and potential settlements, it is expected that the government authorities will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers’ and manufacturers’ compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws.
The federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, prohibits, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payors, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing from a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare offense, and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services. Similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation.
In addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians and certain other healthcare providers. Under the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children’s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments and “transfers of value” provided to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors), certain non-physician practitioners such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners, and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. In addition, certain states require implementation of compliance programs and compliance with the pharmaceutical industry’s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government, impose restrictions on marketing practices, and/or tracking and 
reporting of pricing information and marketing expenditure as well as gifts, compensation and other remuneration or items of value provided to physicians and other healthcare professionals and entities.
Violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us can result in penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and individual imprisonment.
Coverage and Reimbursement
Sales of our product candidates, if approved, by us or any potential commercial partners will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. Patients are unlikely to use our products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover a significant portion of the cost of our products. Sales of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will therefore depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include government authorities, managed care plans, private health insurers and other organizations.
The process for determining whether a third-party payor will provide coverage for a drug typically is separate from the process for setting the price of such product or for establishing the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product once coverage is approved. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, also known as a formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce a physician’s willingness to prescribe our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a third-party payor’s decision to provide coverage for a drug does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. Additionally, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One third-party payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate.
In addition, the United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost-effectiveness of drugs, in addition to questioning safety and efficacy. If these third-party payors do not consider our products to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover our products after FDA approval or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow us to sell our products at a profit.
Healthcare Reform
A primary trend in the United States healthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and other third-party payors have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the amount of reimbursement for particular medical products. For example, the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, among other things, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program; introduced a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected; extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care plans; subjected drug manufacturers to new annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal healthcare programs; and created a new Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research.
Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. On June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the ACA without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the ACA. Prior to the Supreme Court’s decision, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through August 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the ACA marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the ACA.
In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. This included aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, will stay in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022, unless additional Congressional action is taken. On January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act was signed into law, which, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and imaging centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Recently there has also been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies.
We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products once approved or additional pricing pressures. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our product candidates.
Data Privacy and Security
Pharmaceutical companies may be subject to United States federal and state and foreign data privacy, security and data breach notification laws governing the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information. In the United States, HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and regulations implemented thereunder, or collectively HIPAA, imposes privacy, security and breach reporting obligations with respect to individually identifiable health information upon “covered entities” (health plans, health care clearinghouses and certain health care providers), and their respective business associates, individuals or entities that create, receive, maintain or transmit protected health information in connection with providing a service for or on behalf of a covered entity, as well as their covered subcontractors. HIPAA mandates the reporting of certain breaches of health information to HHS, affected individuals and if the breach is large enough, the media. Entities that are found to be in violation of HIPAA as the result of a breach of unsecured protected health information, a complaint about privacy practices or an audit by HHS, may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative fines and penalties and/or additional reporting and oversight obligations if required to enter into a resolution agreement and corrective action plan with HHS to settle allegations of HIPAA non-compliance. Even when HIPAA does not apply, according to the Federal Trade Commission or the FTC, failing to take appropriate steps to keep consumers’ personal information secure may constitute unfair acts or practices in or affecting commerce in violation of Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The FTC expects a company’s data security measures to be reasonable and appropriate in light of the sensitivity and volume of consumer information it holds, the size and complexity of its business, and the cost of available tools to improve security and reduce vulnerabilities.
In addition, certain state laws govern the privacy and security of health-related and other personal information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same requirements, thus complicating compliance efforts. By way of example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, or the CCPA, which went into effect January 1, 2020, among other things, creates new data privacy obligations for covered companies and provides new privacy rights to California residents, including the right to opt out of certain disclosures of their information. The CCPA also creates a private right of action with statutory damages for certain data breaches, thereby potentially increasing risks associated with a data breach. Although the law includes limited exceptions, including for “protected health information” maintained by a covered entity or business associate, it may regulate or impact our processing of personal information depending on the context. Further, the California Privacy Rights Act, or the CPRA, was recently voted into law by California residents. The CPRA significantly amends the CCPA, and imposes additional data protection obligations on covered companies doing business in California, including additional consumer rights processes and opt outs for certain uses of sensitive data. It also creates a new California data protection agency specifically tasked to enforce the law, which would likely result in increased regulatory scrutiny of California businesses in the areas of data protection and security. The substantive requirements for companies subject to the CPRA will go into effect on January 1, 2023.
In Europe, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or the GDPR, went into effect in May 2018 and imposes strict requirements for processing the personal data of data subjects within the European Economic Area, or the EEA. Companies that must comply with the GDPR face increased compliance obligations and risk, including more robust regulatory enforcement of data protection requirements and potential fines for noncompliance of up to €20 million or 4% of the annual global revenues of the noncompliant company, whichever is greater. In addition, the GDPR increases the scrutiny of transfers of personal data from clinical trial sites located in the EEA to the United States and other jurisdictions that the European Commission does not recognize as having “adequate” data protection laws; in July 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union, or the CJEU, limited how organizations could lawfully transfer personal data from the EEA to the United States by invalidating the EU-US Privacy Shield and 
imposing further restrictions on use of the standard contractual clauses, which could increase our costs and our ability to efficiently process personal data from the EEA. Additionally, from January 1, 2021, we have had to comply with the GDPR and also the United Kingdom General Data Protection Regulation, or the UK GDPR, which, together with the amended UK Data Protection Act 2018, retains the GDPR in United Kingdom, or UK, national law. The UK GDPR mirrors the fines under the GDPR, e.g., fines up to the greater of €20 million (£17.5 million) or 4% of global turnover. The relationship between the UK and the European Union, or the EU, in relation to certain aspects of data protection law remains unclear, and it is unclear how UK data protection laws and regulations will develop in the medium to longer term, and how data transfers to and from the UK will be regulated in the long term. The European Commission has adopted an adequacy decision in favor of the UK, enabling data transfers from EU member states to the UK without additional safeguards. However, the UK adequacy decision will automatically expire in June 2025 unless the European Commission re-assesses and renews or extends that decision.
Supply Chain
We continue to assess the impact of COVID-19 on our supply chain and related vendors and global supply chain constraints across various industries, including interruption of, or delays in receiving, supplies of raw materials, API or drug product from third-party manufacturers due to staffing shortages, production slowdowns or stoppages and disruptions in delivery systems. We are also continuing to evaluate the impacts of COVID-19 and global supply chain constraints on our new facility. We expect to complete the commissioning and validation of our new facility to support various research and development and cGMP activities, including small-scale manufacturing capabilities for API and drug product, by the end of the first half of 2022. We are in the process of, and proceeding with the related preparatory activities associated with qualifying, commissioning and validating the manufacturing equipment for use in API production.
We currently rely on third-party suppliers to provide the raw materials that are used by us or our third-party manufacturers in the manufacture of our product candidates. There are a limited number of suppliers for raw materials, including nitric oxide, that we use to manufacture our product candidates. We also rely on third-party logistics vendors to transport our raw materials, API, and drug products through our supply chain. Certain materials, including our API, have designated hazard classifications that limit available transportation modes or quantities. Third-party logistics vendors may choose to delay or defer transportation of materials from time to time, especially in light of the pandemic and related global supply chain constraints, which could adversely impact the timing or cost of our manufacturing supply chain activities or other associated development activities.
Manufacturing and Supplies
We have adopted a strategy of engaging with, utilizing and relying on third parties through partnerships, collaborations, licensing or other strategic relationships for the performance of activities, processes and services that (i) do not typically result in the generation of significant new intellectual property; and (ii) can leverage their existing robust infrastructure, systems and facilities, as well as associated subject matter expertise. A parallel and inter-related strategic objective has been to manage our own internal resources, including our manufacturing capabilities.
Drug Substance
Upon successful completion of the required technology transfer, we intend for a new third-party API manufacturer to be able to manufacture berdazimer sodium in compliance with established manufacturing processes, applicable regulatory guidelines and as appropriate for potential large-scale commercial quantities.
In June 2019, we established an operating and business relationship with a third-party full-scale API manufacturer, with the goal being for this third-party API manufacturer to become the primary external supplier of our proprietary berdazimer sodium (NVN1000) drug substance. We executed a master contract manufacturing agreement, which included the process and analytical method transfer necessary to advance the production of our drug substance for future clinical trials and potentially for commercial purposes on a global basis if any of our product candidates are approved.
Through January 2021, we remained engaged in technical transfer efforts with this third-party API manufacturer. However, in February 2021, based on progress to date, including timing considerations relating to top-line results for the B-SIMPLE4 Phase 3 trial, we terminated our existing work orders related to technical transfer activities with this third-party API manufacturer. The master services agreement remains in place with this third-party API manufacturer for potential longer term needs.
We have since entered into development services agreements with other third-party full-scale API manufacturers for certain manufacturing process feasibility services including process familiarization, safety assessments, preliminary engineering studies, and initial process and analytical methods determination. Following the successful completion of such preliminary activities with a third-party API manufacturer and other preparatory activities, we would then plan to proceed with a third-party API manufacturer beyond the initial stages noted above, in which case we would expect to incur substantial costs associated with technical transfer 
efforts, capital expenditures, manufacturing capabilities, and ultimately, potential large-scale commercial quantities of our drug substance.
Internal Capability
We manufactured the API necessary for the B-SIMPLE4 Phase 3 trial using internal manufacturing capabilities at our former facility. In addition, we currently have an inventory of API that allows us to continue certain preclinical and/or developmental activities.
With the B-SIMPLE4 Phase 3 trial positive top-line efficacy results, we are targeting a potential NDA submission of SB206 for molluscum no later than the fourth quarter of 2022. We are in the process of commissioning and validating our new facility, which we expect to complete by the end of the first half of 2022, to support various research and development and cGMP activities, including the production of cGMP API registration batches necessary to support the SB206 NDA submission as well as other small-scale manufacturing capabilities for API and drug product. 
The anticipated additional manufacturing capabilities that we expect to come from our new facility include the ability to act as a supportive, or potentially primary, component of, or as a back up to, elements of a potential future commercial supply chain, and the ability to produce limited quantities of clinical trial materials. We believe the new facility, once operational, will have the capability to support our planned potential NDA submission for SB206 and potential commercial launch quantities of API for SB206. The timing of our efforts to submit an NDA and to have a third-party full-scale API manufacturer ready for production are expected to inform our future decisions on the expected duration and utilization level of the capabilities of our new facility.
We expect to continue to work toward completion of technical transfer activities with a third-party full-scale API manufacturer to provide the API needed for long-term commercial supply of drug substance, if any of our product candidates are approved. We believe this strategy of increasing utilization of and reliance upon third-party vendors and strategic partners for the performance of activities, processes and services can ultimately provide enhanced capabilities and operating efficiencies for us or any of our potential partnerships, collaborations, licensing or other strategic relationships. At the same time, we are attempting to balance the need to have internal capabilities to allow flexibility for the progression of our product development programs on our targeted timelines.
Drug Product
On October 15, 2018, we established a strategic alliance with Orion Corporation, or Orion, a Finnish full-scale pharmaceutical company with broad experience in drug manufacturing. The alliance enables Orion to manufacture our topical nitric oxide-releasing product candidates on our behalf and on the behalf of our global strategic partners. We have executed a master contract manufacturing agreement to enable technology transfer and manufacturing of clinical trial materials for future clinical trials with our topical product candidates. We are engaged in the transfer of technology for the manufacture of both SB204 and SB206, which has been slowed from time to time due to various factors, including in 2020 as part of our efforts to preserve cash, and, upon completion, we intend for Orion to be able to manufacture the drug product, or the finished dosage form of the gel, in accordance with our established manufacturing processes, in compliance with applicable regulatory guidelines and as appropriate for clinical trials. We have continued to work toward completion of technical transfer and manufacturing activities to provide the necessary regulatory registration batches of drug product for our planned NDA submission of SB206 for molluscum, and if any of our product candidates are approved, commercial supply of drug product. A completed manufacturing technology transfer to Orion will enable the manufacture of multiple assets for supply of clinical trial materials and, potentially, commercial quantities if any of our product candidates are approved. Importantly, this alliance is being structured to support major global markets in which we and our partners pursue regulatory approvals for our product candidates. 
As we move forward with these initiatives, we will need significant additional funding to continue our operating activities, including these technical transfer projects, potential utilization and development of internal capabilities and cost structure changes, and to make further advancements in our product development programs, as described in the section entitled “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations —Liquidity and Capital Resources” in this Annual Report.

As part of our strategic objective to reduce our own internal resources and large-scale manufacturing capabilities, in February 2020 we took actions that reduced our internal resources, including personnel headcount. As a part of this action, we reduced personnel headcount from a total of 41 full-time employees as of December 31, 2019 to a total of 23 full-time employees as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of 29 full-time employees, in addition to 3 part-time employees.
Of the 29 full-time employees as of December 31, 2021, 8 were dedicated to our Nitricil technology and formulation science research and development, 6 were dedicated to our manufacturing capability and product operations, 7 were in clinical and regulatory operations, 2 were in commercial operations and 6 were in general and administrative functions. Of the 3 part-time employees as of December 31, 2021, 1 was in clinical and regulatory operations, and 2 were in general and administrative functions. 
We also utilize consultants and contractors to support our operating activities and our employees. 
Recruiting and retaining qualified personnel and key talent is critical to our success. Our business results depend in part on our ability to successfully manage our human capital resources. Factors that may affect our ability to attract and retain qualified employees include employee morale, competition from other employers and availability of qualified individuals. None of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement or represented by a labor or trade union. We believe we have a good relationship with our employees. 
Compensation and Benefits
We strive to provide robust compensation and benefits to our employees. In addition to salaries, compensation and benefit programs include annual bonuses, stock-based compensation awards, a long-term performance based compensation plan, a 401(k) plan with employee matching opportunities, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off and other employee assistance programs. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel who are necessary to the operation of the business and the development of our product candidates is critical to our success.
COVID-19 Pandemic 
The health and wellness of our employees is also critical to our success. In an effort to keep our employees safe during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented a number of health-related measures including, but not limited to, protocols governing the use of face-masks while on company property, temperature taking protocols, a flexible work-from-home policy, cleaning procedures at our corporate headquarters, social-distancing protocols, restrictions on visitors to our facility, and limitations on in-person meetings and other gatherings.
