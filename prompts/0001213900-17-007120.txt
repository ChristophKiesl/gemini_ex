Recent Developments
 
On August 25, 2016, the Company announced that it entered into a definitive Market Partner Agreement with InsightPOS, LLC (“POS”), for distribution, market development and revenue sharing in a new, exciting cash register Interactive Point Of Sale (POS) system. Due to qualifying conditions that had to be met before the agreement was fully accepted, this agreement was fully accepted on September 7, 2016 and can now be considered a “Definitive Material Agreement”.
 
InsightPOS is a “State of the Art”, “Super Functional Point Of Sale” system that has received great attention due to its sleek, modern, efficient design and amazing combination of tools that make the retail experience friendlier, quicker and better both for the shopper and for store management. InsightPOS will allow retailers to sell and manage their store’s inventory, with over 50 million SKUs already in the system and increase customer loyalty by offering important services and benefits. These additional services include, but are not limited to, long distance telecom products, cellular account payments (US and International), utility bill payments (electric, water, cable, satellite, etc.) and others. InsightPOS will provide the ability for each retail store to offer financial services, including gift cards, reloadable debit cards and potentially money transfer services, which will increase store revenue organically in a manner few have imagined possible. Insight POS can replace the entire cash register, inventory and management system.

NXGH has secured vendor financing to provide and install terminals at no cost to qualified retail establishments, including training upon approval by InsightPOS. The revenues generated by system utilization should maintain the system at no cost to each retailer. NXGH will market major brand services along with its own branded services, GPR (General Purpose Reload) and reward cards.
 
NXGH, through its affiliate, Next Communications, Inc., has the right to sell STI Mobile, Next Cala and any Next products to 8,800 locations that were serviced by a prepaid distribution network. NXGH will offer the InsightPOS system to clients of this distribution network as well via direct sales through its own sales force and affiliates. When a system is installed, NGH receives 50% of the gross profits received by InsightPOS after retailer commissions are paid.
 
NXGH, through its vendor, InsightPOS has secured financing to deliver and install 10,000 units.
 
Next CALA
 
Our Next CALA subsidiary promotes and distributes NextCALA-branded Prepaid Visa® General Purpose Reloadable (“GPR”) prepaid debit cards, bearing the Next CALA Debit™ and Visa® logos. Customers may register for our prepaid debit card at http://www.nextcala.com. Each of our cards is issued by The Bancorp, MetaBank, Metropolitan Bank or Sutton Bank.
 
Based on projections by industry experts, we believe that prepaid debit cards are one of the fastest growing niches in the financial sector. The number of cards sold is expected to grow 22% annually from 2016 to 2020, according to projections by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Millions of individuals in the U.S., including those in various minority communities, are unable to obtain access to the banking system due to various reasons, including but not limited to poor credit scores or a lack of exposure to the U.S. banking system. Prepaid debit cards are a convenient option for such individuals. Prepaid debit cards may also be an intermediate step toward such individuals ultimately joining the financial system. In addition, prepaid debit cards are a popular option for gift-giving due to fraud protection in the case of loss or theft. We believe that prepaid debit cards are replacing cash as a preferred gift for these reasons, in certain regards.
 
Card holders can upload funds onto their NextCALA prepaid cards via ACH wire transfer, online, or in person using Vanilla Reload machines, which are stationed in over 50,000 locations throughout the U.S., including but not limited to Walmart, CVS, Dollar General, Rite Aid and Walgreens retail stores, and anywhere in the Mio Reload Network, which includes more than 450,000 retail locations throughout the world. The card can be used like a traditional credit card or debit card and is accepted wherever Visa Debit® cards are accepted. Money spent using the card is deducted from the total balance of prepaid funds previously uploaded on the card. Unlike a credit card, prepaid debit card holders do not have the ability to spend more than the balance of prepaid funds previously uploaded on the card. Prepaid debit cards can be used and spent online and can be used at an ATM machine to retrieve cash.
 
Contractual Relationships with InComm, Bancorp, and Visa. Next CALA Prepaid Card® GPR cards are distributed and serviced by prepaid industry leader, InComm Financial Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of InComm Holdings, Inc. (“InComm”). Next CALA has been indemnified by InComm, which possesses money transmitter licenses in all 50 states. InComm specifically also indemnifies Next CALA with respect to Anti Money Laundering and Know Your Client US banking regulations, as they capture and verify all of this as part of our agreement. In addition, The Bancorp Bank (“Bankcorp”), a member of the FDIC, pursuant to a license from Visa USA, Inc., acts as program manager and as clearing house and provides banking capacities in transactions involving the cards. Prepaid card deposits are held by Bankcorp, MetaBank, Metropolitan Bank or Sutton Bank.

We are currently negotiating certain other terms with InComm, including the following:
 

● | InComm may grant us access to its retail partners for distribution of our prepaid card and other products; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | InComm may provide us with an Application Protocol Interface on their hosted website; 
● | InComm may provide us with most favored nation pricing to procure and resell electronic and physical starter cards, gift cards, closed loop products; 
● | InComm may provide us with participation in pass through as a revenue share composition on any of our generated cards, revenue and usage;

● | InComm may use its best efforts to introduce our call center enablement for better quality customer experience to have our rewards component be first in sequence, followed by a soft hand off to Incomm for any financial Ccard customer service. 

 
However, there is no guarantee that InComm will agree to any of these terms, and such terms remain subject to further negotiations between us and InComm.

Mobile Apps. Earlier this year, Next CALA released its NEXTCALA Mobile applications for both Android and iOS. The NEXTCALA mobile Android and iOS applications give users access to mobile banking and banking services 24 hours per day, 365 days per year. Users are able to use the application to make mobile-to-mobile payments, to transfer funds to family, friends, and retailers, and to see all balances and transactions, including retail transactions made online or in physical retail locations with the Next CALA Prepaid Visa® card associated with the app user’s account. With the NEXTCALA Mobile app, users not only have an easier way to bank, they also earn points that can be redeemed towards long distance calls either via voice or HD Video among other benefits provided under the NEXTCALA Rewards program.

Prepaid Card Solutions Democratize Banking and Payments. Prepaid cards democratize electronic payments and remittances for those outside the traditional banking system. The growing popularity of prepaid card solutions for both banked and unbanked consumers is driven by the prepaid card’s unique ability to solve almost any payment need.
 
Rapid Growth of the Mobile Banking Market. Based on projections by industry experts, the Company believes that prepaid debit cards are one of the fastest growing niches in the financial sector.

The NEXTCALA Rewards platform is currently being developed and scheduled for release in the second half of 2017.

Vitco is currently the owner of 25% of the issued and outstanding shares of NxtGn.

Next Mobile operates this business pursuant to contracts with Sprint Corporation which allow Next Mobile to use Sprint’s network infrastructure to operate a virtual telecommunications network providing voice, text, and data services of essentially the same quality as those Sprint provides to its own retail subscribers.
 

As customers worldwide continue to migrate away from legacy telephone and banking systems to enhanced mobility solutions, the Company’s technological advantage and the synergies created by its unique combination of reloadable bank card and mobile virtual network operator rights will make its products increasingly useful to unserved, under-banked, non-banked and other emerging niche markets.
 
Joint Venture. Because MVNO marketing is capital intensive, Next Mobile intends to sell a 50% interest in its MVNO rights to an operating partner who will be responsible for funding all future marketing expenses of the MVNO. The Company has been introduced to interested purchasers by Sprint, and believes it will be able to sell a 50% interest in the MVNO for $1.5 million in cash plus a commitment to fund all of the joint venture’s future marketing expenses.

M&M holds International and Domestic Section 214 licenses issued by the Federal Communications Commission, and operate the NextMobile360™ business through its wholly-owned subsidiary Next Mobile. While M&M has historically provided wholesale long distance telephony service to a number of leading domestic and international carriers, most of M&M’s traffic is now generated by demand from its sibling companies NxtGn and Next Mobile.
 
Network. The M&M Network is the private international network over which the Company is capable of delivering large volumes of highest-quality international long distance voice and data telephony services at significant cost savings. The network’s architecture is scalable and proprietary, and M&M plans to increase capacity as demand increases. The M&M Network consists of four principal elements:
 
Points of Presence. Points of presence digitize voice signals into data, allowing transmission and retrieval over a broadband data network. M&M’s points of presence, which are the gateways to the M&M Network, are located within its Global Network Operations Center in Miami, Florida, and colocations throughout the world.
 
The Transmission Medium. This is the Internet, which is the backbone of the M&M Network.
 
The M&M Voice and Data Platform Controller. This is M&M’s proprietary software and switchless routing platform, which is the heart of the M&M Network. Developed by M&M and NxtGn in cooperation with Cisco, the system can scale to support more than 200,000 simultaneous sessions on a single chassis. M&M’s Next Voice and Data Platform Controller is located within the Company’s Global Network Operations Center in Miami, Florida.
 
The M&M Global Network Operations Center. This is the facility which houses the Company’s primary point of presence and the M&M Voice Platform Controller, and from which M&M monitors and manages the voice and data traffic transmitted through the network.
 
Focus on High-Margin Destinations in Difficult Operating Environments. By focusing its route development operations on building strategic partnerships with providers in difficult telephony operating environments in Latin America, Africa, and other emerging markets, M&M hopes to increase its market reach and overall revenues. By using NxtGn’s proprietary call processing technology, M&M can significantly reduce equipment costs and other capital expenditures required to enter difficult operating environments. The technological advantage which historically made M&M a market leader in long distance traffic terminated in Mexico and other destinations in Latin America will allow M&M to expand its market reach into Africa and the Middle East and other lucrative markets.
