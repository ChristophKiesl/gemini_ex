Item 1. BUSINESS
The terms “we,” “our,” “ours,” “us,” “Covanta” and “Company” refer to Covanta Holding Corporation and its subsidiaries and the term “Covanta Energy” refers to our subsidiary Covanta Energy, LLC and its subsidiaries.
About Covanta Holding Corporation
We are organized as a holding company, which was incorporated in Delaware on April 16, 1992. We conduct all of our operations through subsidiaries, which are engaged predominantly in the business of waste and energy services.
Our mission is to provide sustainable waste and energy solutions. We seek to do this through a variety of service offerings, including our core business of owning and operating infrastructure for the conversion of Waste-to-Energy (“WtE”).
WtE facilities produce energy through the combustion of non-hazardous municipal solid waste (“MSW”) in specially-designed power plants. Most of our facilities are “mass-burn” facilities, which combust the MSW on an as-received basis without any pre-processing such as shredding, sorting or sizing. The process reduces the waste to an inert ash while extracting ferrous and non-ferrous metals for recycling. In addition to our mass-burn facilities, we own and/or operate additional facilities that use other processes or technologies, such as refuse-derived fuel facilities which process waste prior to combustion.
WtE serves two key markets as both a sustainable waste management solution that is environmentally superior to landfilling and as a source of clean energy that reduces overall greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. WtE is considered renewable under the laws of many states and under federal law. Our facilities are critical infrastructure assets that allow our customers, which are principally municipal entities, to provide an essential public service through sustainable practices.
Our WtE facilities earn revenue from the disposal of waste, generally under long-term contracts, the generation of electricity, and from the sale of metals recovered during the WtE process. We operate and/or have ownership positions in 41 WtE facilities currently in commercial operation, 39 of which are in North America. In total, these facilities process approximately 21 million tons of solid waste annually, equivalent to 8% of the post-recycled MSW generated in the United States ("U.S."). Our facilities produce approximately 10 million megawatt hours (“MWh”) of baseload electricity annually. We also operate waste management infrastructure, including 13 waste transfer stations, 20 material processing facilities, four landfills (primarily for ash disposal), one metals processing facility, and one ash processing facility (currently in start-up and testing phase), all of which are complementary to our core WtE business.
Outside of North America, we operate and/or have equity interests in WtE projects in Ireland, Italy, the United Kingdom ("UK") and China (our projects in the UK and China are currently in development and/or under construction). We continue to evaluate additional opportunities for international WtE projects where the regulatory and market environments are attractive. For additional information, see Recent Business Developments below, and Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 3. New Business and Asset Management. Ownership and operation of facilities in foreign countries potentially involves greater political and financial uncertainties than we experience in the U.S., as described below and discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors.
We have one reportable segment, which comprises our entire operating business. Additional information about our reportable segment and our operations by geographic area is contained in Item 8. Financial Statements And Supplementary Data — Note 1. Organization and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.
Environmental Benefits of WtE
We believe that WtE offers solutions to public sector leaders around the world for addressing two key issues: sustainable waste management and renewable energy generation. We believe that the environmental benefits of WtE, as an alternative to landfilling, are clear and compelling: by processing municipal solid waste in WtE facilities, we reduce GHG emissions, lower the risk of groundwater contamination, and conserve land. WtE facilities reduce GHG emissions by displacing fossil-fuel fired grid electricity, recycling metals, and diverting MSW from landfills, which are the 3rd largest source of man-made methane, a GHG over 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide (“CO2”) over a 20-year period. At the same time, WtE generates clean, reliable energy from a renewable fuel source, thus reducing dependence on fossil fuels, the combustion of which is itself a major contributor of GHG emissions. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), using lifecycle tools such as its own Municipal Solid Waste Decision Support Tool, has found that, on average, approximately one ton of CO2-equivalent is reduced relative to landfilling for every ton of waste processed. We believe that WtE is also an important component of business and

community efforts to divert post-recycled waste from landfills as part of their GHG, zero-waste-to-landfill, circular economy, and other sustainability initiatives. WtE facilities also represent key community infrastructure, providing local, reliable and sustainable waste management and energy services. As public planners and commercial and industrial companies address their needs for more environmentally sustainable waste management and energy generation in the years ahead, we believe that WtE will be an increasingly attractive alternative.
We continuously seek to educate policymakers and regulators about the environmental and economic benefits of WtE and advocate for policies and regulations that appropriately reflect these benefits. Our business is highly regulated, and as such we believe that it is critically important for us, as an industry leader, to play an active role in the debates surrounding potential policy developments that could impact our business.
We believe that our efforts to promote, protect and expand our business will be enhanced by the development of additional technologies in fields such as recycling, alternative waste treatment processes, combustion controls, emission controls and residue recycling, reuse or disposal. We have advanced our research and development efforts in some of these areas relevant to our WtE business, and have patents and patents pending for advances in controlling emissions. 
Other Environmental Services Offerings
In addition to our core WtE business, we offer a variety of sustainable waste management solutions in response to customer demand, including on site clean-up services, wastewater treatment, pharmaceutical and healthcare solutions, reverse distribution, transportation and logistics, recycling and depackaging. Together with our processing of non-hazardous "profiled waste" for purposes of assured destruction or sustainability goals in our WtE facilities, we offer these services under our Covanta Environmental Solutions ("CES") brand. Through acquisitions and organic growth initiatives, we have expanded our network of facilities to enable us to provide a range of services to industrial customers for the treatment, recycling and/or disposal of their non-hazardous materials. These businesses are highly synergistic with our existing profiled waste business, offer us the opportunity to expand the geographical sourcing of our waste streams and expand our presence in the environmental services sector, allowing us to drive higher margin profiled waste volumes into our WtE facilities and access additional revenue growth opportunities.
STRATEGY
In October 2020, we announced the launch of a comprehensive strategic review of our assets, operations, growth priorities, and capital structure. This review is an opportunity to explore all options to enhance stockholder value, including assessing plans for each of our business lines and geographies. This review will be broad in scope and will be completed in due course. The board of directors appointed Michael Ranger as President and Chief Executive Officer to lead this review and its subsequent execution. 
Sustainability Goals & Projects
We continue to advance our performance against a series of sustainability goals aligned with our business goals and mission. Set in the areas of safety and health, environment, materials management, human resources and community affairs, each goal has an assigned champion on our senior leadership team to ensure their full integration into our business. We believe attaining these goals helps us respond to our customers’ increasing interest in sustainability and the sustainable solutions we provide, mitigate certain risks, and gain a competitive advantage in business development opportunities. We seek to continuously improve our performance across these aspects to remain an industry leader. 
Providing sustainable waste, materials, and energy services to our customers is the cornerstone of our business. Our corporate culture is focused on the triple bottom line of sustainability — people, planet, and prosperity — in support of our mission. In addition to robust financial reporting, we are committed to transparently reporting our environmental, social and governance standards, policies, and performance through our corporate sustainability report, which can be found on our Company website.

WASTE-TO-ENERGY PROJECTS
Our WtE projects generate revenue primarily from three sources: (1) fees charged for operating facilities or processing waste received; (2) the sale of electricity and/or steam; and (3) the sale of ferrous and non-ferrous metals that are recovered from the waste stream as part of the WtE process. We may also generate additional revenue from the construction, expansion or upgrade of a facility, when a public sector client owns the facility. Our customers for waste services or facility operations are principally public sector entities, though we also market disposal capacity at certain facilities to commercial customers. Our facilities primarily sell electricity, either to utilities at contracted rates or, in situations where a contract is not in place, at prevailing market rates in regional markets (primarily PJM, NEPOOL and NYISO in the Northeastern U.S.), and in some cases sell steam directly to industrial users.
We also operate and/or have ownership positions in environmental services businesses, transfer stations, and landfills (primarily for ash disposal) that are ancillary and complementary to our WtE projects and generate additional revenue from disposal or service fees.
WtE Contract Structures
Most of our WtE projects were developed and structured contractually as part of competitive procurement processes conducted by public sector entities. As a result, many of these projects have common features. However, each contractual agreement is different, reflecting the specific needs and concerns of a client community, applicable regulatory requirements and/or other factors.
Our WtE projects can generally be divided into three categories, based on the applicable contract structure as described in the table below. Notwithstanding distinctions among these general classifications in contract structures, in all cases we focus on a consistent set of performance indicators to optimize service to customers and operating results, including: (i) boiler availability; (ii) safety and environmental performance measures; (iii) tons processed; (iv) megawatt hours and/or steam sold; and (v) recycled metal tons recovered and sold. 
The following summarizes the typical contractual and economic characteristics of the three primary project structures for our WtE projects located in North America:

 | Tip Fee | Service Fee(Covanta Owned) | Service Fee(Client Owned) 
Number of facilities: | 18 | 3 | 18 
Client(s): | Host community and municipal and commercial waste customers | Host community, with limited merchant capacity in some cases | Dedicated to host community exclusively 
Waste or servicerevenue: | Per ton “tipping fee” | Fixed fee, with performance incentives and inflation escalation 
Energy revenue: | Covanta retains 100% | Share with client(Covanta retains approximately 20% on average) 
Metals revenue: | Covanta retains 100% | Share with client(Covanta typically retains approximately 50%) 
Operating costs: | Covanta responsible for all operating costs | Pass through certain costs to client(e.g. ash disposal) 
Project debt service: | Covanta project subsidiary responsible | Paid by client explicitly as part of service fee | Client responsible for debt service 
After service contractexpiration: | N/A | Covanta owns the facility; clients have certain rights set forth in contracts; facility converts to Tip Fee or remains Service Fee with new terms | Client owns the facility; extend with Covanta or tender for new contract

We are principally responsible for capital costs in facilities that we own; however, client communities may have a contractual obligation to fund a portion of certain capital costs, particularly if required by a change in law. We also may be required to participate in capital improvements for non-owned facilities that we operate, which would be accounted for as operating expense. In contracts with our client communities, we typically agree to operate the facility and meet minimum performance standards. These may include waste processing, energy efficiency, energy production and environmental standards. Unexcused failure to meet these requirements or satisfy the other material terms of our agreement, may result in damages charged to us or, if the breach is substantial, continuing and unremedied, termination of the applicable agreement. If one or more contracts were terminated for our default, these contractual damages may be material to our cash flow and financial condition. To date, we have not incurred material liabilities under such performance guarantees.

Contracted and Merchant Revenue 
We generated 77% of our waste and service revenue in 2020 under contracts at set rates, while 23% was generated at prevailing market prices. Our waste disposal / service contracts expire at various times between 2021 and 2053. As of December 31, 2020, the volume weighted average contract life of our service fee contracts and tip fee contracts was 8 and 6 years, respectively. Our energy contracts expire at various times between 2021 and 2039. As our contracts expire, and to the extent they are not extended or replaced on similar terns, we become subject to greater market risk in maintaining and enhancing our revenue. To date, we have been successful in extending the majority of our existing contracts to operate WtE facilities owned by public sector clients. 
As our waste service agreements at facilities that we control expire, we intend to seek replacement or additional contracts, and because project debt on these facilities will be paid off at such time, we expect to be able to offer rates that will attract sufficient quantities of waste while providing acceptable revenue to us. The expiration of existing energy contracts at these facilities will require us to sell our output either into the local electricity grid at prevailing rates or pursuant to new contracts. We expect that multi-year contracts for waste supply at these facilities will continue to be available on acceptable terms in the marketplace, at least for a substantial portion of facility capacity, as municipalities continue to value long-term committed and sustainable waste disposal capacity. We also expect that an increasing portion of system capacity will be contracted on a shorter-term basis, and so we will have more frequent exposure to waste market risk. We expect that multi-year contracts for energy sales will generally be less available than in the past, thereby increasing our exposure to energy market prices upon expiration. As our existing contracts have expired and our exposure to market energy prices has increased, we entered into hedging arrangements in order to mitigate our exposure to near-term (one to three years) revenue fluctuations in energy markets, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Our efforts in this regard will involve only mitigation of price volatility for the energy we produce in order to limit our energy revenue "at risk," and will not involve speculative energy trading.
See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our results of operations may be adversely affected by market conditions existing at the time our contracts expire. Over time, we expect to seek to renew, extend or sign new waste and service contracts and pursue opportunities with commercial customers and municipalities that are not necessarily stakeholders in our facilities in order to maintain a significant majority of our waste and service revenue (and WtE fuel supply) under multi-year contracts. Our strategies in regard to such opportunities will be reviewed as part of our ongoing strategic review.

MARKETS, COMPETITION AND BUSINESS CONDITIONS
Waste Services 
Post-recycled municipal solid waste generation in the U.S. is approximately 250 million tons per year, of which the WtE industry processes approximately 30 million tons (of which we process approximately three-quarters).
WtE is an important part of the waste management infrastructure of the U.S., particularly in regions with high population density but limited availability of land for landfilling, with 75 facilities currently in operation that collectively process approximately 30 million tons of post-recycled solid waste and serve the needs of over 37 million people and produce enough electricity for the equivalent of 1.3 million homes. The use of WtE is even more prevalent in Western Europe and many countries in Asia, such as China and Japan. Over 1,200 WtE facilities are in use today around the world, with a capacity to process approximately 260 million tons of waste per year. In the waste management hierarchies of the U.S. EPA and the European Union (“EU”), WtE is designated as a superior solution to landfilling.
Renewable Energy 
Public policy in the U.S., at both the state and national levels, has developed over the past several years in support of increased generation of renewable energy as a means of combating the potential effects of climate change, as well as increasing domestic energy security. Today in the U.S., approximately 17% of electricity is generated from renewable sources, approximately 38% of which is hydroelectric power.
WtE is designated as renewable energy in 31 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico, as well as in several federal statutes and policies. Unlike most other renewable resources, WtE generation can serve base-load demand and is more often located near population centers where demand is greatest, minimizing the need for expensive incremental transmission infrastructure.

General Business Conditions
Economic - Changes in the economy affect the demand for goods and services generally, which affects overall volumes of waste requiring management and the pricing at which we can attract waste to fill available capacity. We receive the majority of our revenue under short- and long-term contracts, which limits our exposure to price volatility, but with adjustments intended to reflect changes in our costs. Where our revenue is received under other arrangements and depending upon the revenue source, we have varying amounts of exposure to price volatility.
The largest component of our revenue is waste revenue, which has generally been subject to less price volatility than our revenue derived from the sale of energy and metals. Waste markets tend to be affected, both with respect to volume and price, by local and regional economic activity, as well as state and local waste management policies.
At the same time, U.S. natural gas market prices influence electricity and steam pricing in regions where we operate, and thus affect our revenue for the portion of the energy we sell that is not under fixed-price contracts. Energy markets tend to be affected by regional supply and demand, as well as national economic activity and regulations.
The following are various published pricing indices relating to the U.S. economic drivers that are relevant to those aspects of our business where we have market exposure; however, there is not a precise correlation between our results and changes in these metrics.

Seasonal - Our quarterly operating results within the same fiscal year typically differ substantially due to seasonal factors, primarily as a result of the timing of scheduled plant maintenance. We conduct scheduled maintenance periodically each year, which requires that individual boiler and/or turbine units temporarily cease operations. During these scheduled maintenance periods, we incur material repair and maintenance expense and receive less revenue until the boiler and/or turbine units resume operations. This scheduled maintenance usually occurs during periods of off-peak electric demand and/or lower waste volumes, which are our first, second and fourth fiscal quarters. The scheduled maintenance period in the first half of the year (primarily first quarter and early second quarter) is typically the most extensive, while the third quarter scheduled maintenance period is the least extensive. Given these factors, we normally experience our lowest operating income from our projects during the first half of each year.
During the first half of 2020, we experienced some modest delays in our normal scheduled maintenance activities due to the novel coronavirus ("COVID-19') related quarantines, travel restrictions and social distancing requirements. As a result, our scheduled maintenance was more heavily weighted towards the second half of the year than it has been historically. 
Our operating results may also be affected by seasonal weather extremes during summers and winters. Increased demand for electricity and natural gas during unusually hot or cold periods may affect certain operating expenses and may trigger material price increases for a portion of the electricity and steam we sell.
Performance - Our WtE facilities have historically demonstrated consistent reliability; our average boiler availability was 91.3% in 2020. We have historically met our operating obligations without experiencing material unexpected service interruptions or incurring material increases in costs. In addition, with respect to many of our contracts, we generally have limited exposure for risks not within our control. Across our fleet of facilities, we operate and maintain a large number of 
Table of Contents

combustion units, turbine generators, and air-cooled condensers, among other systems. On an ongoing basis, we assess the effectiveness of our preventative maintenance programs, and implement adjustments to those programs in order to improve facility safety, reliability and performance. These assessments are tailored to each facility's particular technologies, age, historical performance and other factors. As our facilities age, we expect that the scope of work required to maintain our portfolio of facilities will increase in order to replace or extend the useful life of facility components and to ensure that historical levels of safe, reliable performance continue. For additional information about such risks and damages that we may owe for unexcused operating performance failures, see Item 1A. Risk Factors — Operation of our businesses involves significant risks, which could have an adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations. In monitoring and assessing the ongoing operating and financial performance of our businesses, we focus on certain key factors: tons of waste processed, electricity and steam sold, boiler availability, plant operating expense and safety and environmental performance.
Waste, Energy and Metals Markets - We compete in waste markets that are highly competitive. In the U.S., the market for waste management is almost entirely price-driven and is greatly influenced by economic factors within regional waste markets. These factors include:
•regional population and overall waste production rates;
•the number of waste disposal sites (including principally landfills, other WtE facilities and transfer stations) in existence or in the planning or permitting process;
•the available disposal capacity (in terms of tons of waste per day) that can be offered by other regional disposal sites;
•the extent to which local governments seek to control transportation and/or disposal of waste within their jurisdictions;
•the extent to which local governments and businesses continue to value sustainable approaches to handling of wastes; and
•the availability and cost of transportation options (e.g., rail, inter-modal, trucking) to provide access to more distant disposal sites, thereby affecting the size of the waste market itself.
Waste service providers seek to obtain waste supplies for their facilities by competing on price (usually on a per-ton basis) with other service providers. At our facilities, where a service fee structure exists, we typically do not compete in this market because we do not have the contractual right to solicit merchant waste. At these facilities, the client community is responsible for obtaining the waste, if necessary by competing on price to obtain the tons of waste it has contractually promised to deliver to us. At our WtE facilities governed by tip fee structures and our waste procurement services businesses, we are responsible for obtaining waste supply, and therefore, actively compete in these markets to enter into spot, medium- and long-term contracts. These WtE projects are generally in densely-populated areas, with high waste generation rates and numerous large and small participants in the regional market. Our waste operations are largely concentrated in the northeastern U.S. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Our waste operations are concentrated in one region and expose us to regional economic or market declines for additional information concerning this geographic concentration. Certain of our competitors in these markets are vertically-integrated waste companies, which include waste collection operations, and thus have the ability to control supplies of waste, which may restrict our ability to offer services at attractive prices. Our business does not include traditional waste collection operations.
If a long-term contract expires and is not renewed or extended by a client community, our percentage of contracted processing capacity will decrease and we will need to compete in the regional market for waste supply at the facilities we own, from both municipal and commercial services. At that point, we will compete on price with landfills, transfer stations, other WtE facilities and other waste technologies that are then offering disposal or other services in the region.
Our sustainable service offerings seek to respond to increasing customer demand for environmentally preferred waste handling and disposal, as well as specific business risk mitigation requirements for certain materials. For these services, we compete with many large and small companies offering these services, in local and regional waste markets that are similarly influenced by the factors noted above which affect the broader waste markets.
We currently sell a portion of our electricity and other energy product output pursuant to contracts, and for this portion of our energy output we do not compete on price. For the portion of our energy output that we sell into competitive energy markets, we have entered into hedging arrangements in order to mitigate our exposure to price volatility, and we expect to continue to do so in the future. Our efforts in this regard involve only mitigation of price volatility for the energy we produce and will not involve speculative energy trading.
For the portion of our portfolio that is exposed to electricity markets, we expect prices will be driven by several factors including natural gas supply/demand conditions, regional electricity supply/demand factors, regional transmission and natural 
Table of Contents

gas supply capacity and system conditions, weather conditions, and emerging environmental regulations. All of these factors will have national and regional impacts that affect electricity and steam prices.
Electricity and steam prices in the markets where the majority of our facilities are located are heavily impacted by movements in natural gas prices. The substantial increase in unconventional or shale gas supply has created downward pressure on gas prices relative to historical levels and therefore on prices for the electricity we sell that is not under contract. However, when demand for gas is high during certain seasons or weather conditions, the gas pipeline system has been limited in its ability to transport enough gas to certain regions, such as New England and California. As a result, gas prices can experience short-term spikes, and electricity prices follow.
Several long-term trends are expected to affect U.S. natural gas prices; including shale gas production, storage capacity, liquefied natural gas exports, regulation, coal plant retirements, as well as industrial, transportation and residential demand. Furthermore, regional natural gas prices, especially in the Northeast are expected to be affected by changes in regional production and transportation capacity.
We generally enter into short-term contracts tied to floating market index prices for sales of recovered ferrous and non-ferrous metals with processors and end-users (i.e., mills). We compete with other suppliers who are generally not in the WtE industry and whose product may be less costly to process than metals from WtE sources. Recycled metal prices for both ferrous and non-ferrous materials are impacted directly and indirectly by tariff and trade actions both by the U.S. and foreign governments. Efforts in early 2020 by the U.S. government to place tariffs on imported steel and aluminum increased domestic demand for our products.
Markets for New Project Development - Market conditions for new WtE project development are generally more favorable in select international markets, such as the UK, as compared to the U.S. This is due to a variety of factors which exist in these markets including higher prevailing market tip fees and/or energy revenues, the absence of available land for alternative disposal techniques (i.e., landfilling), and regulatory policy support which favors technologies such as WtE. Therefore, our ongoing WtE project development initiatives are generally outside of the U.S. We have and expect to evaluate opportunities for project development in the U.S., such as facilities for metals, ash processing and recycling, in order to enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of our WtE operations. 
Brexit Implications - In March, 2017, the UK formally notified the EU of its intention to leave the EU (so-called “Brexit”), and on January 31, 2020, the UK formally severed political ties and left the EU. The UK’s economic ties to the EU and its existing trading arrangements with both the EU and countries outside the EU (including the U.S.) remained in place pending trade agreement renegotiations during a “standstill” transition period through December 31, 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic has created additional challenges in finalizing these trade agreements, but the UK reached a trade deal with the EU on December 24, 2020 ahead of the UK leaving the EU's single market and customs union on December 31, 2020. The UK is now negotiating and renegotiating its trade arrangements with non-EU countries. We have studied and consulted with local experts regarding the potential market and economic impacts of Brexit on the UK, with a particular focus on potential impacts to the waste and energy markets as they might affect our plans to expand our business with GIG. The government of the UK has shown no indication of an intention to rollback or reverse its policy support for environmental protection generally, the renewables market, or for WtE specifically. As such, while Brexit may have some impact on construction costs and schedule for both existing and potential new UK WtE projects, we do not believe that Brexit will materially impact the key market and economic drivers for investment in the combined pipeline of WtE projects we are pursuing jointly with GIG. For further information, see Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 3. New Business and Asset Management — Green Investment Group Limited (“GIG”) Joint Venture.
Impact of COVID-19 on the U.S. and the global economy
The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, our employees, our operations, our business and the economy. In early 2020, we began to see impacts from COVID-19 on the economy and commercial activity in the U.S., resulting in reduced volumes and disruptions in waste markets. We have seen an increase in commercial activity and a stabilization of business conditions from the lows in the second quarter of 2020, but the extent of potential impacts from COVID-19 in the future remains uncertain. We cannot predict the potential future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic with new variants of the virus circulating and delays in distributing and administering the vaccine, and it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in the future. For a full discussion of risks associated with COVID-19, see Part I — Item 1A. Risk Factors.
Table of Contents

While a limited number of our employees have contracted COVID-19, we have followed recommended protocols and have thus far not experienced material disruptions to our operations as result of workforce availability issues. Depending upon the rate, extent, and location of future COVID-19 infection, more widespread infection of our employees could cause significant increases to operating expenses at specific facilities or the curtailment of operations at such facilities on a temporary basis.
Our WtE plants and material processing facilities provide a vital service to our municipal and commercial clients. As waste disposal facilities, they have been recognized as part of Critical Infrastructure by the Department of Homeland Security and as essential services by state and local governments. While we remain a primary waste outlet for numerous municipalities and commercial customers, the downturn in economic activity in 2020 affected patterns and volumes of waste generation. Residential waste represents the substantial majority of our contracted volumes. While we experienced limited reduction in these volumes during the early stages of the pandemic, residential volumes have returned to, and in some areas exceeded, pre-pandemic levels. We also process commercial waste, including profiled waste, at many facilities. Volumes of these materials for disposal fell during the early stages of the pandemic, which required us to internalize more waste volumes from our transfer station network as well as access third party replacement waste volumes at a lower revenue basis per ton. Volumes of commercial waste generally have returned closer to pre-pandemic levels, and revenue per ton levels have returned as well. Three of our WtE facilities are currently permitted to accept Regulated Medical Waste (“RMW”). While we have received some COVID-19 RMW material to date, we have seen reductions in other types of RMW, and thus overall volumes of RMW have not materially changed as a result of the pandemic. 
The COVID-19 pandemic had a dampening effect on prices in these markets. Such factors have caused, and may continue to cause, the portion of our energy revenue exposed to the market and/or our recycled metals revenue to fluctuate to an extent that may materially affect our quarterly and annual financial results. During 2020, the commodity markets into which we sold energy and metals were at levels significantly below prior periods.
Although our operations have experienced only limited disruption to date, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs associated with instituting measures to ensure employee safety, access to contractors needed for construction and maintenance activities, and delays of previously scheduled projects that have been placed on hold or rescheduled to later in the year. 
Most of the construction activity at our equity method investment projects in the UK has continued during the pandemic, and we are working to mitigate any impacts. In England, construction activities have been considered essential and so the Rookery and Newhurst sites, adhering to guidance set by Public Health England, have generally proceeded on schedule. The government in Scotland initially took a different approach, and construction at the Earls Gate site was suspended or curtailed through early June, but subsequently resumed. 
In light of the uncertainty around the macroeconomic impacts of COVID-19, we implemented a program of expense reduction intended to mitigate the financial impacts to our business, with an initial goal of reducing 2020 costs by $15 million to $30 million. This program included several elements among which were:
•Eliminating all non-essential travel and reducing discretionary spend;
•Enacting a hiring freeze for new corporate employees;
•Lowering compensation through a 50% reduction in payment of CEO's base salary amount, a 25% reduction in payment of executive leadership base salary amounts, and a 20% reduction in cash compensation for all corporate support employees through a combination of wage reductions and furloughs. These measures remained in place through mid-July 2020;
•Lowering the cash portion of board of directors' fees by 60% during the same time period as management reductions and furloughs;
•Focusing growth investments primarily on UK projects and the start-up of our first Total Ash Processing System ("TAPS") and remaining highly disciplined in making any additional discretionary investments; and 
•Lowering the annualized dividend payout to $0.32 per share.
These efforts resulted in cost savings of approximately $24 million in 2020. Most of these efforts were targeted at offsetting the negative impact of the pandemic on 2020 results and are unlikely to re-occur in 2021.
As the COVID-19 pandemic is ongoing and the near term worldwide economic outlook remains uncertain, we cannot reasonably estimate the length or severity of this pandemic, or the extent to which the disruption may materially impact the Company's consolidated financial statements.

Technology, Research and Development
In our WtE business, we own and/or operate WtE facilities that utilize various technologies from several different vendors, including mass-burn combustion technologies and refuse-derived fuel technologies which include pre-combustion waste processing not required with a mass-burn design. As we continue our efforts to develop and/or acquire additional WtE projects internationally, we will consider mass-burn combustion and other technologies that best fit the needs of the local environment of a particular project.
We believe that all forms of WtE technologies offer an environmentally superior solution to post-recycled waste management and energy challenges faced by leaders around the world, and that our efforts to expand our business will be enhanced by the development of additional technologies in such fields as emission controls, residue disposal, alternative waste treatment processes, gasification, and combustion controls. We have advanced our research and development efforts in these areas and have developed new and cost-effective technologies that represented major advances in controlling NOx emissions. These technologies, for which patents have been granted, have been tested at existing facilities and we are now operating and/or installing such systems at a number of our facilities. We intend to maintain a focus on research and development of technologies in these and other areas that we believe will enhance our competitive position, and offer new technical solutions to waste and energy problems that augment and complement our business.
A number of other companies are similarly engaged in new technology development focused on extracting energy from waste materials through a variety of technical approaches, including: gasification, pyrolysis or other combustion designs; converting waste to fuels or other commodities; or processing waste to enable co-firing in larger power plants or industrial boilers. Firms engaged in these activities generally are less well-capitalized than Covanta, although some engage in joint ventures with larger and well-capitalized companies. To date, we believe such efforts have not produced technologies that offer economically attractive alternatives in the absence of policy support.
REGULATION OF BUSINESS
Regulations Affecting Our Business
Environmental Regulations — General
Our business activities in the U.S. are extensively regulated pursuant to federal, state and local environmental laws. Federal laws, such as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, and their state counterparts, govern discharges of pollutants to air and water. Other federal, state and local laws, as well as legal and regulatory regimes in international markets, comprehensively govern the generation, transportation, storage, treatment and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and also regulate the storage and handling of chemicals and petroleum products (such laws and regulations are referred to collectively as the “Environmental Regulatory Laws”).
Other federal, state and local laws, such as the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as “CERCLA” and collectively referred to with such other laws as the “Environmental Remediation Laws”) make us potentially liable on a joint and several basis for any on site or off site environmental contamination which may be associated with our activities and the activities at our sites. These include landfills we have owned, operated or leased, or at which there has been disposal of residue or other waste generated, handled or processed by our facilities. Some state and local laws also impose liabilities for injury to persons or property caused by site contamination. Some service agreements provide us with indemnification from certain liabilities.
The Environmental Regulatory Laws prohibit disposal of regulated hazardous waste at our municipal solid waste facilities. The service agreements recognize the potential for inadvertent and improper deliveries of hazardous waste and specify procedures for dealing with hazardous waste that is delivered to a facility. Under some service agreements, we are responsible for some costs related to hazardous waste deliveries. We have not incurred material hazardous waste disposal costs to date.
The Environmental Regulatory Laws also require that many permits be obtained before the commencement of construction and operation of any waste or renewable energy project, and further require that permits be maintained throughout the operating life of the facility. We can provide no assurance that all required permits will be issued or re-issued, and the process of obtaining such permits can often cause lengthy delays, including delays caused by third-party appeals challenging permit issuance. Our failure to meet conditions of these permits or of the Environmental Regulatory Laws can subject us to regulatory enforcement actions by the appropriate governmental authority, which could include fines, penalties, damages or other sanctions, such as orders requiring certain remedial actions or limiting or prohibiting operation. See Item 1A. Risk Factors — Compliance with environmental laws, including changes to such laws, could adversely affect our results of operations. To date, we have not 
Table of Contents

incurred material penalties, been required to incur material capital costs or additional expense, or been subjected to material restrictions on our operations as a result of violations of Environmental Regulatory Laws or permit requirements.
While we believe that we are in compliance with existing Environmental Regulatory and Remediation Laws, we may be identified, along with other entities, as being among parties potentially responsible for contribution to costs associated with the correction and remediation of environmental conditions at disposal sites subject to CERCLA and/or analogous state Environmental Remediation Laws. Our ultimate liability in connection with such environmental claims will depend on many factors, including our volumetric share of waste, the total cost of remediation, and the financial viability of other companies that have also sent waste to a given site and, in the case of divested operations, our contractual arrangement with the purchaser of such operations.
The Environmental Regulatory Laws may change. New technology may be required or stricter standards may be established for the control of discharges of air or water pollutants, for storage and handling of petroleum products or chemicals, or for solid or hazardous waste or ash handling and disposal. Thus, as new technology is developed and proven, we may be required to incorporate it into new facilities or make major modifications to existing facilities. This new technology may be more expensive than the technology we use currently.
Environmental Regulations — Recent Developments
Domestic
Maximum Achievable Control Technology ("MACT") Rules — EPA is authorized under the Clean Air Act to issue rules periodically which tighten air emission requirements to achievable standards, as determined under a specified regulatory framework. EPA is required to establish these MACT rules for a variety of industries, including new and existing municipal waste combustion (“MWC”) units, industrial boilers and solid waste incinerators. All of our facilities comply with all applicable MACT rules currently in effect.
EPA has an obligation to complete a combined Risk and Technology Review ("RTR") for the large MWC source category and will subsequently propose revised MWC MACT rules. While the scope of and timing for implementation of RTR for the MWC source category is uncertain, the resulting revised MWC MACT may lower existing MWC MACT emission limits for most, if not all, regulated air pollutants emitted by our facilities, and may require capital improvements and/or increased operating costs. We are unable at this time, to estimate the magnitude of such costs, which may be material, or to determine the potential impact on the profitability of our MWC facilities.
In some cases, the costs incurred to meet the revised MACT rules at facilities may be recovered from public sector clients and other users of our facilities through increased fees permitted to be charged under applicable contracts; however, to the extent we incur costs at other of our facilities to meet the applicable MACT rules, such costs are not subject to contractual recovery and instead will be borne directly by the affected facilities.
New Jersey Environmental Justice Legislation — In September 2020, New Jersey passed a new environmental justice law requiring the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to evaluate the environmental and public health impacts of certain facilities, including waste management facilities, on overburdened communities when reviewing certain permit applications. While all three of our New Jersey WtE facilities fall within the new law, implementing legislation is still being developed and we cannot estimate the impact on our business at this time. Given our strong environmental performance, our continuing investments in improved environmental controls, our commitment to environmental justice, and the relatively minor contribution of our facilities to the air impacts in our local communities, we do not believe that any adverse impacts will be material.
International
Implementation of a revised Best Available Techniques Reference Document for Waste Incineration (WI BREF) — In the EU, legislation affects our business primarily in the form of “Directives” which are binding on member states and which are implemented through national enabling legislation. The EU has finalized an Industrial Emissions Directive (the so-called “WI BREF Directive”) which affects emissions from WtE facilities as of November 2019. Within four years from the WI BREF publication date of December 3, 2019, all existing WI facilities are required to revise their respective permits and incorporate the WI BREF directive requirements. A WI facility is considered to be existing if it is permitted even if it has not yet begun operations. The finalized WI BREF will also impact future permitting of new facilities in member states, as well as other jurisdictions that base their requirements on EU Directives (which would include the UK whether or not it leaves the EU). Based on the published WI BREF directive and the pending publication of a WI BREF interpretative document by the UK 
Table of Contents

Environmental Agency, we do not believe that the WI BREF Directive will have a material adverse effect on any of the UK WtE projects or the Dublin WtE facility or our ability to execute on our plans to develop future WtE projects in the UK.
European Union Capacity Market GHG Limitations — In 2019, the European Parliament passed a new Directive on the internal market for electricity that sets fossil fuel CO2 intensity thresholds to determine eligibility to participate in the European capacity markets. Less efficient WtE facilities and those receiving wastes with high amount of fossil-based carbon (i.e. plastics) could exceed the thresholds. However, guidance on the rule provides individual member states flexibility to applying the thresholds for WtE facilities. Ireland’s current calculation approach for carbon intensity accounts for the methane avoidance benefits of keeping waste out of landfills and the UK has signaled it intends to continue to exclude waste from the definition of fossil fuel. Based on the guidance and the position taken to date by Ireland and the UK, we do not believe that the capacity mechanism directive will have a material impact on our current operations or our plans to develop WtE projects in the UK.
Energy Regulation
Our businesses are subject to the provisions of federal, state and local energy laws applicable to the development, ownership and operation of facilities located in the U.S. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”), among other things, regulates the transmission and the wholesale sale of electricity in interstate commerce under the authority of the Federal Power Act (“FPA”). In addition, under existing regulations, FERC determines whether an entity owning a generation facility is an Exempt Wholesale Generator (“EWG”), as defined in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (“PUHCA 2005”). FERC also determines whether a generation facility meets the technical and other criteria of a Qualifying Facility (cogeneration facilities and other facilities making use of non-fossil fuel power sources, such as waste, which meet certain size and other applicable requirements, referred to as “QFs”), under the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978, as amended (“PURPA”). Each of our U.S. generating facilities has either been determined by FERC to qualify as a QF or is otherwise exempt from the relevant regulations, or the subsidiary owning the facility has been determined to be an EWG.
Federal Power Act — The FPA gives FERC exclusive rate-making jurisdiction over the wholesale sale of electricity and transmission of electricity in interstate commerce. Under the FPA, FERC, with certain exceptions, regulates the owners of facilities used for the wholesale sale of electricity or transmission of electricity in interstate commerce as public utilities. The FPA also gives FERC jurisdiction to review certain transactions and numerous other activities of public utilities. Most of our QFs are currently exempt from FERC’s rate regulation under the FPA because (i) the QF is 20 MW or smaller; (ii) its sales are made pursuant to a state regulatory authority’s implementation of PURPA; (iii) the QF is owned by a municipality or subdivision thereof; or (iv) its sales are made pursuant to a contract executed on or before March 17, 2006. Our QFs that are not exempt, or that lose these exemptions from rate regulation, are or would be required to obtain market-based rate authority from FERC or otherwise make sales pursuant to rates on file with FERC.
Under the FPA, public utilities are required to obtain FERC’s acceptance of their rate schedules for the wholesale sale of electricity. Our generating companies in the U.S. that are not otherwise exempt from FERC’s rate regulation make sales of electricity pursuant to market-based rates or other rates authorized by FERC. With respect to our generating companies with market-based rate authorization, FERC has the right to suspend, revoke or revise that authority and require our sales of energy to be made on a cost-of-service basis if FERC subsequently determines that we can exercise market power, create barriers to entry, or engage in abusive affiliate transactions. In addition, amongst other requirements, our market-based rate sellers are subject to certain market behavior and market manipulation rules and, if any of our subsidiaries were deemed to have violated any one of those rules, such subsidiary could be subject to potential disgorgement of profits associated with the violation and/or suspension or revocation of market-based rate authority, as well as criminal and civil penalties. If the market-based rate authority for one (or more) of our subsidiaries was revoked or it was not able to obtain market-based rate authority when necessary, and it was required to sell energy on a cost-of-service basis, it could become subject to the full accounting, record keeping and reporting requirements of FERC. Even where FERC has granted market-based rate authority, FERC may impose various market mitigation measures, including price caps, bidding rules and operating restrictions where it determines that potential market power might exist and that the public interest requires such potential market power to be mitigated. A loss of, or an inability to obtain, market-based rate authority could have a material adverse impact on our business. We can offer no assurance that FERC will not revisit its policies at some future time with the effect of limiting market-based rate authority, regulatory waivers, and blanket authorizations.
Under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”), FERC has approved the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, or “NERC,” to address the development and enforcement of mandatory reliability standards for the wholesale electric power system. Certain of our subsidiaries are responsible for complying with the standards in the regions in which we operate. NERC also has the ability to assess financial penalties for non-compliance. In addition to complying with NERC requirements, certain of our subsidiaries must comply with the requirements of the regional reliability council for the region in 
Table of Contents

which that entity is located. Compliance with these reliability standards may require significant additional costs, and noncompliance could subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, fines, and increased compliance costs.
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 — PUHCA 2005 provides FERC with certain authority over and access to books and records of public utility holding companies not otherwise exempt by virtue of their ownership of EWGs, QFs, and Foreign Utility Companies, as defined in PUHCA 2005. We are a public utility holding company, but because all of our generating facilities have QF status, are otherwise exempt, or are owned through EWGs, we are exempt from the accounting, record retention, and reporting requirements of PUHCA 2005 and FERC’s right to access our books and records is limited in scope.
Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act — PURPA was passed in 1978 in large part to promote increased energy efficiency and development of independent power producers. PURPA created QFs to further both goals, and FERC is primarily charged with administering PURPA as it applies to QFs. FERC has promulgated regulations that exempt QFs from compliance with certain provisions of the FPA, PUHCA 2005, and certain state laws regulating the rates charged by, or the financial and organizational activities of, electric utilities. The exemptions afforded by PURPA to QFs from regulation under the FPA and most aspects of state electric utility regulation are of great importance to us and our competitors in the WtE and independent power industries.
PURPA also initially included a requirement that utilities must buy and sell power to QFs. Among other things, EPAct 2005 eliminated the obligation imposed on utilities to purchase power from QFs at an avoided cost rate where the QF has non-discriminatory access to wholesale energy markets having certain characteristics, including nondiscriminatory transmission and interconnection services. In addition, FERC had previously established a regulatory presumption that QFs with a capacity greater than 5 MW have non-discriminatory access to wholesale energy markets in most geographic regions in which we operate. In 2020, FERC Order 872, extended the rebuttable presumption that QFs have nondiscriminatory access to markets to all facilities above 5 MW, rather than 20 MW. However, FERC also established that a subset of QFs with capacities between 5 MW and 20 MW could rebut the presumption provided that the predominant purpose of the QF is other than the sale of electricity. Further modifications to PURPA included greater flexibility by the utility with regard to terms and conditions of QF contracts, although the impacts of these provisions are uncertain at this time. As a result, many of our expansion, renewal and development projects must rely on competitive energy markets rather than PURPA’s historic avoided cost rates in establishing and maintaining their viability.
Outside the context of a long-term contract and dependent on state action, recent changes to FERC regulations could also affect the rates for QF energy sales to a utility pursuant to PURPA purchase obligations. In some states, this could mean that outside the context of a long-term contract, QFs that were formerly entitled to a fixed avoided cost rate for energy sales pursuant to the PURPA purchase obligation may now receive a variable energy rate. However, it is not certain how states will react to the new FERC regulations.
RTOs and ISOs — Many of our projects operate in or have access to organized energy markets, known as regional transmission organizations ("RTOs") or independent system operators ("ISOs"). Each organized market subject to FERC jurisdiction administers centralized energy, capacity and ancillary services markets pursuant to tariffs approved by FERC. These tariffs and rules prescribe requirements on how the energy, capacity and ancillary service markets operate, how market participants bid, clear, are dispatched, make bilateral sales with one another, and how entities with market-based rates are compensated. Certain of these markets set prices, referred to as Locational Marginal Prices that reflect the value of energy, capacity or certain ancillary services, based upon geographic locations, transmission constraints, and other factors. Each market is subject to market mitigation measures designed to limit the exercise of market power. These market structures may affect the bidding, operation, dispatch and sale of energy, capacity and ancillary services from our projects that rely on competitive energy markets rather than PURPA’s avoided cost rates.
Policy Debate Regarding Climate Change and Renewable Energy
The public and political debate over GHG emissions (principally CO2 and methane) and their contribution to climate change continues both internationally and domestically. We expect this debate to continue. The incoming Biden administration has identified addressing climate change as one of its priorities and has already taken steps to rejoin the Paris Climate Agreement. Any resulting regulations could in the future affect our business. As is the case with all combustion, our facilities emit CO2, however WtE is recognized as creating net reductions in GHG emissions and is otherwise environmentally beneficial, because it:
•avoids CO2 emissions from fossil fuel power plants;
•avoids methane emissions from landfills; and
•avoids GHG emissions from mining and processing metal because it recovers and recycles metals from waste.
Table of Contents

In addition, WtE facilities are a resilient domestic source of baseload energy, preserve land, and are typically located close to the source of the waste and thus typically reduce fossil fuel consumption and air emissions associated with long-haul transportation of waste to landfills.
For policy makers at the local level who make decisions on sustainable waste management alternatives, we believe that using WtE instead of landfilling will result in significantly lower net GHG emissions, while also introducing more control over the cost of waste management and supply of local electrical power. We are actively engaged in encouraging policy makers at state and federal levels to enact legislation that supports WtE as a superior choice for communities to avoid both the environmental harm caused by landfilling waste, and reduce local reliance on fossil fuels as a source of energy.
Many of these same policy considerations apply equally to other renewable technologies. The extent to which such potential legislation and policy initiatives will affect our business will depend in part on whether WtE and our other renewable technologies are included within the range of clean technologies that could benefit from such legislation.
Several initiatives have been developed at the state or regional levels, and some initiatives exist in regions where we have projects. For example:
•The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (“RGGI”) is an operating regional “cap-and-trade” program focused on fossil fuel-fired electric generators which does not directly affect WtE facilities. We operate one fossil-fuel fired boiler at our Niagara facility included in the RGGI program.
•California's Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 ("AB 32"), seeks to reduce GHG emissions in California in part through an economy-wide “cap-and-trade” program. WtE facilities were exempt from the cap-and-trade program through the end of 2017 but began incurring a compliance obligation in 2018. We have established a reserve to procure allowances as necessary to meet our compliance obligation. The current regulation provides transition assistance to WtE facilities. A resolution passed by the Board of the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”) directs the agency to provide additional transition assistance to WtE facilities in a subsequent revision to the regulation. The specific degree of additional assistance to be provided is uncertain at this time. 
•In 2019, the New York State legislature passed the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act which put the state on the path to achieve net zero GHG emissions by 2050. The state is currently beginning the process of developing specific policies and regulations to implement the legislation. We are actively engaged in the regulatory development process, including through participation in a state-led waste sector working group by appointment by the state’s environmental regulator. The State has recognized that the main source of GHG emissions from the waste sector is from methane via organic waste decomposition in landfills. Given WtE’s international recognition as a means of reducing GHG emissions by avoiding methane from the waste management sector, we expect WtE facilities will have an important role to play in the transition to a net zero economy; however, the exact impact on our business in New York is uncertain at this time.
International Climate Change Policies
Certain international markets in which we compete have recently adopted regulatory or policy frameworks that encourage WtE projects as important components of GHG emission reduction strategies, as well as waste management planning and practice.
The European Union
Historically, the EU has adopted legislation which requires member states to reduce the utilization of and reliance upon landfill disposal, including (1) Directive 1999/31/EC concerning the landfill of waste (known as the “Landfill Directive”) which imposes operational and technical controls on landfills and restricts, on a reducing scale, the amount of biodegradable municipal waste which member states may dispose of to landfill; and (2) Directive 2008/98/EC on waste (known as the revised “Waste Framework Directive”) which enshrines the waste hierarchy to divert waste from landfill and underpins a preference for efficient WtE for the recovery of value from residual wastes.
In July 2018, the EU finalized its Circular Economy Package ("CEP"), amending several of the Directives described above to advance a more circular economy. Included within the CEP are the continued preference for efficient energy recovery over landfilling, increased targets for recycling and reuse, and new limits on landfilling.

To date, WtE has not been subject to the EU’s Emissions Trading Scheme ("ETS"), one of the primary policy mechanisms for the EU to achieve its GHG reduction targets. In light of increased climate ambition on the part of the EU, the European Commission has published an Inception Impact Assessment as part of its consultation process on changes to the ETS necessary to help the region meet its new GHG reduction target of 55% by 2030 relative to 1990. WtE has been listed as a potential new sector for inclusion in the ETS in the future. As the public consultation is just beginning, we cannot predict the outcome of this process or the potential impact at this time.
Brexit Implications
With respect to the impact of Brexit in the UK, we have studied and consulted with local experts regarding the potential regulatory impacts, with a particular focus on potential impacts to the waste and energy markets as they might affect our plans to expand our business with GIG. For further information, see Item 8. Financial Statements And Supplementary Data — Note 3. New Business and Asset Management — Green Investment Group Limited (“GIG”) Joint Venture. The government of the UK has shown no indication of an intention to rollback or reverse its policy support for environmental protection generally, the renewables market, or for WtE specifically, including with respect to the Directives described above. As such, while we can provide no assurance, we do not believe Brexit will materially impact the key regulatory drivers for investment in the combined pipeline of WtE projects we are pursuing jointly with GIG.
Employee Health and Welfare
We are subject to numerous regulations enacted to protect and promote worker health and welfare through the implementation and enforcement of standards designed to prevent illness, injury and death in the workplace. The primary law relating to employee health and welfare applicable to our business in the U.S. is the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 ("OSHA"), which establishes certain employer responsibilities including maintenance of a workplace free of recognized hazards likely to cause illness, death or serious injury, compliance with standards promulgated by OSHA, and assorted reporting and record keeping obligations, as well as disclosure and procedural requirements. Various OSHA standards apply to certain aspects of our operations.
Employee health and welfare laws governing our business in foreign jurisdictions include the Workplace Health and Safety Directive and the Directive concerning ionizing radiation in the EU, and various provisions of the Canada Labour Code and related regulations in Canada.
HUMAN CAPITAL
Our employees are essential to our business and our success. We are committed to attracting the best talent, hiring and retaining a diverse workforce, and creating a safe, respectful, equitable, and inclusive work environment for all employees, regardless of age, sex, gender, religion, race, ethnicity or sexual orientation.
As of December 31, 2020, we employed approximately 4,000 full-time employees, approximately 3,700 are located in the U.S., with the remainder of employees located in Canada, Ireland, the UK and China. 
In the U.S., approximately 300 employees are based at our headquarters in Morristown, NJ, while approximately 3,400 employees are based in facilities across the U.S. Approximately 300 of our facility-based employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with various expiration dates through 2024.
Impacts of COVID-19
As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, beginning March 16, 2020, all corporate and field administrative employees transitioned to working primarily from home, while essential plant employees continued to report to our facilities in order to maintain our operations. 
In our operating facilities and our offices, we follow mandatory and recommended health and safety protocols. While some of our employees have contracted COVID-19, we have not experienced material disruptions to our operations as a result of illnesses, quarantines, or other workforce or workplace disruptions. Effective September 14, 2020, we reopened our offices in Morristown, NJ, in a limited capacity; however, most employees continue to work primarily from home due to pandemic safety precautions.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion ("DE&I")
We believe that a diverse and inclusive workforce is a stronger and more productive workforce; one that is more capable of solving problems, innovating, and meeting our business goals and the goals of our clients, partners and stockholders. We serve diverse communities, we live and work in those communities, and we are committed to taking action so that our workforce better reflects the diversity of the communities in which we operate.
Our DE&I Leadership Council includes cross-functional executive leadership and is charged with establishing and advancing our diversity, equity and inclusion goals. In 2019, Covanta joined CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion (“CEO Action”), and in 2020, one of our leaders joined CEO Action as part of a one-year fellowship to help promote corporate best practices to promote diversity and address systemic racism and social injustice.
Since 2011, we have published a Sustainability Report including transparent information on our workforce diversity, including gender and ethnicity. We announced our first goal around diversity and inclusion in 2016 and have made periodic updates to our goal since that time.
Today, as part of our commitment to DE&I and to better reflect the diversity of the communities in which we operate, we have committed to increasing the recruitment and retention of a more diverse workforce, and specifically to improving our recruitment and retention of female and black employees across our company and specifically in leadership roles. We also conduct regular pay equity reviews to ensure that we are paying diverse groups of employees equitably. We report our progress and review our goals with the Compensation and Nominating and Governance Committees of our Board of Directors.
2020 Workforce Diversity

 | Women | Men 
Gender Diversity | 12% | 88% 
 | Minority | Non-Minority
Ethnic Diversity | 30% | 70% 

In 2020, we piloted new unconscious bias training, following the completion in 2019 of a company-wide diversity and inclusion training program. Also, in recent years we established company-wide Employee Resource Groups ("ERGs"), to promote diversity and support amongst our employees with shared interests and experiences. We currently have five ERGs; Women of Covanta: RISE, Early Career Connections, Black Professionals, Sustainability, and LatinX.
Succession and Recruitment
In response to changing trends inside and outside of the Company, we have undertaken several programs to better prepare for retirements in our workforce, knowledge transfer, and the hiring, training, and development of a new generation of workers. In addition to our undergraduate internship program, we implemented a mentoring program in 2017 and an Early Career Development Program in 2018. We believe Covanta’s commitment to developing sustainable solutions for society and the environment is attractive to current and upcoming generations of workers who desire to actively engage in the drive to improve future environmental outcomes.
For many years, Covanta has also made concerted efforts to recruit and hire more veterans, and we are proud that veterans make up approximately 10% of our total workforce.
