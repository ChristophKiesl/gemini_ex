OUR COMPANY - OUR VISION
Harsco Corporation is a market-leading, global provider of environmental solutions for industrial and specialty waste streams, and innovative equipment and technology for the rail sector. Our three reportable business segments are Harsco Environmental, Harsco Clean Earth, and Harsco Rail and we are working towards transforming the Company into a single-thesis environmental solutions company that is a global leader in the markets we serve.
We have worked in recent years to both transform our portfolio and strengthen our financial results, and we have invested to achieve these objectives and to grow the Company. These investments include targeted organic investments, as well as mergers and acquisitions, and have accelerated our business transformation. The purchase of Clean Earth and ESOL along with the prior sale of our energy-linked business in 2019 were significant strategic steps for our Company. As a result, approximately 82% of our revenues in 2020 were generated from our two environmentally-focused segments. It also is important to note that these transactions have reduced the Company’s portfolio complexity and business cyclicality.
More broadly, we are committed to viewing every customer need through a sustainability lens. Our customers are increasingly expecting more customizable solutions that address environmental challenges within their industries. The Company is responding to this need by helping our customers build better businesses and, in a larger sense, a better environment. Our go-forward strategy is clear: to continue our transformation with the goal of becoming a leading, global environmental solutions company.
SEGMENT INFORMATION
The Company’s current operations consist of three reportable business segments: Harsco Environmental, Harsco Clean Earth, and Harsco Rail. Until 2019, the Company also reported the Harsco Industrial Segment composed of three businesses, which were sold in 2019 and 2020. Historical results for these businesses are now accounted for as discontinued operations. 
The Company reports segment information using the “management approach,” based on the way management organizes and reports the segments within the enterprise for making operating decisions and assessing performance. The Company’s reporting segments are identified based upon differences in products, services, and markets served. Financial information concerning segments and international and domestic operations is included in Note 16, Information by Segment and Geographic Area, in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data,” which information is incorporated herein by reference. 
Our revenues by business segment are as follows, and a further description of the products and services offered through these business segments is presented below.
HARSCO ENVIRONMENTAL
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
Our Harsco Environmental Segment can trace its heritage back to the earliest efforts in industrial recycling and environmental resource management. Where others only saw waste and expense, our predecessors saw opportunity and value nearly 100 years ago. HE was founded upon market insights, grounded in respect for environments, efficient use of resources, and optimism for the future. 
Today, HE is the premier, global provider of environmental services and material processing to the global steel and metals industries. HE partners with its global customer base to deliver production-critical on-site operational support and resource recovery services, through management of our customers’ primary waste or byproduct streams. Our services support the metal manufacturing process, generating significant operational and financial efficiencies for our customers and allowing them to focus on their core steelmaking businesses. 
HE serves 70 customers at over 155 sites in approximately 30 countries. Our diversified customer base includes the largest steel producers in the regions where we operate, serving a mix of mini-mill and integrated operations. In recent years, HE has greatly extended its reach, signing major new services contracts in bellwether emerging markets like China and India, and further strengthening our footprint in Western economies. As a result, our global portfolio is balanced and diversified, with foreign currency risk partially mitigated by the fact that our operating costs and revenues are regularly denominated in local currencies.
In addition to providing critical services to our customers, we provide zero-waste solutions for relevant waste or byproduct streams - an important component of our value proposition. We repurpose processed material for alternative uses and / or convert this material into viable products to be sold in other markets via our applied products offerings and capabilities. Our applied products portfolio includes road and roofing materials, abrasives, agriculture products and aggregates. This expertise is increasingly important to our customers as environmental regulations increase and the marketplace grows more averse to landfilling waste. 
CUSTOMERS AND SERVICE CONTRACTS
We offer our customers a suite of more than 30 services, and our on-site work is performed under long-term contracts. These contracts typically include fixed fees or minimum billings, which de-risk our investment during periods of economic weakness, and variable fees often linked to the amount of metal produced or waste processed at a site. Our variable fees under contracts are, importantly, not linked to steel prices. Additionally, in recent years we have strengthened our contract terms and underwriting practices in an effort to earn a sufficient and timely return on our investments, as well as achieve other objectives. These measures, along with various improvement initiatives, have boosted our site portfolio results and driven more consistent performance across our operations.
Our contract renewal rates are high, with many customer relationships that span decades. Our largest customers today include ArcelorMittal, Gerdau, Tisco, SSAB, and Heibei. We serve most of our major customers at multiple sites, often under multiple contracts. The length of our customer relationships reflects our value proposition. Customers choose the Company to (1) achieve operational and financial efficiencies; (2) concentrate their efforts on metal manufacturing and supporting end-market product demands; (3) gain access to process innovations and technologies developed by the Company; and (4) leverage our downstream product applications and know-how. Lastly, HE had one customer in the past three years that provided more than 10% of this segment's revenues, again under many long-term contracts at multiple sites. 
On December 31, 2020, the Company's services contracts had estimated future revenues of $3.5 billion at current production levels, compared with $3.2 billion at December 31, 2019, with the increase primarily due to new and renewed contracts and the timing of contract expirations. These contract values provide the Company with a substantial base of anticipated long-term revenues. Approximately 19% of these revenues are expected to be recognized by December 31, 2021; approximately 39% of these revenues are expected to be recognized between January 1, 2022 and December 31, 2024; approximately 19% of these revenues are expected to be recognized between January 1, 2025 and December 31, 2027; and the remaining revenues are expected to be recognized thereafter. Estimated future revenues are exclusive of anticipated contract renewals, projected volume increases and ad-hoc services as well as future revenues from roofing granules, abrasives products, roadmaking materials, additives and specialty recovery technology services.
ON-SITE SERVICES
HE provides a broad range of services, most of which address our customers’ environmental challenges. In total, these services reduce both landfill waste and the carbon footprint of our customers’ sites and in 2020, on-site services represented approximately 85% of HE’s revenues. A summary of our most significant services is as follows:
Resource Recovery, Metal Recycling and Slag Optimization
Resource recovery, metal recycling and slag optimization is the core component of our service offerings. We capture liquid steel waste or byproduct (slag) and transport it for cooling, treatment and conditioning. We then recover valuable metal from the waste-stream, which is returned to our customer in a form suitable for recycling through the customers’ manufacturing process. The residual non-metallic processed material is then finally transformed into environmental products that create new and additional revenue streams to other customers.
Scrap Management
We manage customer scrap inventories and upgrade scrap by making it cleaner and denser. Improved scrap characteristics reduce electricity usage which, combined with the usage of recycled material, provides sustainability benefits to our customers.
Materials Handling and Logistics
We transport materials, including semi-finished and finished products, safely and efficiently for our customers. Our tracking technology also provides real-time analysis of material location, quantities and product quality.
Meltshop and Furnace Services
Meltshop and furnace services allow the molten metal production process to run smoothly and efficiently. These services include under-vessel cleaning and the removal of ladle slag (waste) and general melt shop debris. 
APPLIED PRODUCTS
HE creates value-added downstream products from industrial waste-streams. Our experience in manufacturing these products and successfully penetrating relevant end-markets is an important differentiator for the Company. These zero-waste solutions preserve our natural resources and reduce or eliminate landfill disposal. Applied products in 2020 represented approximately 13% of HE’s revenues, and our major applied products include the following:
Road Surfacing and Materials
Because of its natural shape and interlocking properties, steel slag holds many advantages when used in asphalt roadway surfaces, ranging from high skid resistance to better durability.  The Company’s slag-based asphalt product, developed and sold as SteelPhalt™, maintains positive surface characteristics throughout the life of the road, allowing longer replacement intervals and lower maintenance costs.  The Company also sells a slag aggregate that is a sustainable and cost-effective alternative to natural stone. This aggregate is often used as unbound road base material for secondary roads and sub-base material elsewhere.
Abrasives and Roofing Materials
Our Reed Minerals business is among the largest roofing granule suppliers in the U.S., partnering with the country's leading shingle manufacturers. Nearly 100 years ago, we pioneered a process of recycling coal combustion waste from power plants. Through the Company's proprietary process, we create premium quality roofing granules that are a critical raw material in asphalt roofing shingles. 
Reed is also one of the largest U.S. manufacturers of abrasives, using coal as well as copper slag and crushed glass, for the surface preparation market. Our BLACK BEAUTY® abrasives are well-recognized within the industry and are used as blast material to remove paint, rust, and other coatings from surfaces, prior to applying a new finish. 
Metallurgical Additives
The Company’s custom-designed steelmaking additives facilitate fluid slag formation in the steelmaking process, thus improving customer productivity and helping achieve the steel product specifications required for today’s premium applications.
Agriculture and Turf Products
We produce soil conditioners and fertilizers, principally from stainless steel slag that optimize crop yields and turf performance. CrossOver® and AgrowSil products are our leading silicon, calcium and magnesium-based product brands, sold mainly in the Americas. These products are formulated to address nutrient deficiencies and toxicity issue in soil as well as help plants withstand outside pressures and disease.
Cement Additives
Steel slag is naturally cementitious and commonly blended with other materials to produce environmentally-friendly, high-performing cement products. Cement made with slag aggregate can achieve permeabilities and strengths that compare favorably to concrete made with conventional aggregates.
ALTEK GROUP
In 2018, the Company acquired Altek Europe Holdings Limited and its affiliated entities ("Altek"), a UK-based manufacturer of market-leading products that enable aluminum producers and recyclers to manage and extract value from critical waste streams, reduce waste generation, and improve operating productivity. The cost-efficient recovery of metal and other valuable materials is increasingly important to the aluminum industry. Altek’s products and technologies address this challenge, and its latest AluSalt™ innovation offers customers a breakthrough technology that converts salt slag waste into valuable products, addressing one of the largest environmental concerns within the aluminum market.
GROWTH STRATEGY
After a period of business improvement, we have started in recent years to invest growth capital in HE. We have identified attractive opportunities that meet our return thresholds to expand our service portfolio, and our pipeline of opportunities remains significant. Additionally, we have initiated efforts to expand our downstream products business and plan to continue investing in innovation to support our business sustainability. 
A summary of our key growth initiatives is as follows:
•Further Penetrate Existing Sites. Given our broad services capabilities, we see significant potential for add-on services contracts at existing sites.
•New Sites. We continue to pursue new services contracts in certain markets, particularly in emerging economies where out-sourcing opportunities are significant because of increased environmental awareness or where steel consumption (production) is set to grow.
•Investment in Downstream Products. We see ample opportunities to expand certain products businesses, and our investment in a second SteelPhalt™ (road materials) plant in Europe is a recent example.
•Innovation. We are at the forefront of innovation in our industry. Our Pure and Applied Innovation Programs are specifically focused on helping our customers solve their most pressing environmental challenges amid ever-increasing regulation. This initiative includes developing new customer or industry solutions, either in-house or externally, and expanding the usage of technologies that already exist within our business.
COMPETITORS
HE competes principally with a small number of privately-held businesses for services outsourced by customers on a global basis. We also compete with numerous smaller, privately-held businesses in each of our regional markets and, to some degree, customers that may decide to perform certain services themselves.
We believe that HE differentiates itself from its competition through innovative technologies that support our service offerings, and through the operating expertise developed by sharing best practices across our global portfolio. Our safety practices and performance also support our business, as do our long-standing relationships and our downstream product solutions.
HARSCO CLEAN EARTH
BUSINESS OVERVIEW
In June 2019, the Company acquired Clean Earth, one of the largest specialty waste processing companies in the U.S. CE provides processing and beneficial reuse solutions for hazardous wastes, contaminated materials, and dredged volumes. In April 2020 the Company acquired ESOL, an established waste transportation, processing and services provider with a comprehensive portfolio of disposal solutions for customers primarily across the industrial, retail and healthcare markets. These acquisitions accelerated Harsco’s transformation into a global, market-leading, single-thesis environmental solutions platform.
Combined, this business now operates 19 permitted TSDF facilities and 51 10-day transfer facilities across the U.S., serving more than 90,000 customer locations while utilizing a fleet of over 700 vehicles. It also holds a portfolio of more than 560 critically-important permits, and approximately 94 percent of the waste handled by CE is recycled or beneficially reused. 
Specialty-waste permits have considerable value, and CE is positioned to take advantage of increasingly stringent regulation on the handling of this waste. These dynamics provide recurring revenues and support attractive underlying growth. CE also operates in a fragmented market where acquisition opportunities are likely to develop. As a result, we see CE as a platform for growth as we continue the transformation of the Company’s business portfolio.
INTEGRATION
By the end of 2022, the Company expects to integrate and fully realize identified synergies and profit improvement potential from the acquisition of ESOL. These improvements are anticipated through transportation and disposal efficiencies, procurement and operational savings, and commercial benefits. 
CUSTOMERS
CE provides low-cost, regulatory-compliant solutions to a diverse base of customers or suppliers (waste originators). These customers include waste generators in numerous industries, including chemicals, power, aerospace, medical, retail and metals, as well as integrated waste companies and brokers. CE also services federal, state and local governments as well as developers linked to large infrastructure and redevelopment projects, and it processes a variety of consumer goods, including electronics, cleaners, pesticides and aerosols, which must be handled in strict compliance with environmental regulations.
LINES OF BUSINESS
Hazardous Waste
CE provides testing, tracking, processing, recycling, and disposal services for hazardous waste and it operates 24 Resource Conservation and Recovery Act ("RCRA") Part B Permits and waste water processing permits. This includes 19 Treatment, Storage and Disposal Facility permits (TSDFs) that enable the Company to process a variety of complex hazardous wastes, consisting of toxic, reactive and flammable materials such as industrial wastewater, manufacturing sludge, oily-mixtures, chemicals, pesticides, asbestos and pharmaceutical waste. The remaining facilities handle a limited number of other wastes, including landfill leachate with per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances ("PFAS"), electronics, batteries and light bulbs. These operations possess unique and differentiated processing technologies, such as applications for aerosol can and medical waste recycling. In 2020, this line of business represented approximately 76% of CE’s revenues.
Contaminated Materials
CE processes approximately 3.3 million tons per year of contaminated soil at thirteen locations. These soils are contaminated with heavy metals, PCBs, pesticides, PFAS or other chemicals, and the related clean-up work is often the result of infrastructure improvements, private redevelopment, industrial site remediation and/or underground storage tank removal. CE treats and recycles this soil through various processes, after which the material is suitable for beneficial reuse as construction fill material or landfill capping. In 2020, this line of business represented approximately 20% of CE’s revenues.
Dredged Materials
CE operates one facility to treat dredged material, the sediment accumulated at the bottom of waterways that is removed for environmental (clean-up) or maintenance (maintain depth) purposes. After treatment, these materials are also beneficially reused as fill material. In 2020, dredged material processing represented approximately 4% of CE’s revenues.
OPERATIONS AND PERMITS
CE maintains a full suite of regulation-compliant treatment capabilities that de-characterize waste and that can be tailored to meet customer-specific requirements. These solutions include: a) Thermal Desorption - a remediation technology that involves heating soil to remove or separate the contaminants; b.) Bioremediation - a treatment process that degrades contaminants by the application of microorganisms or engineered bacteria; c.) Chemical fixation - a remediation process using chemical additives; and d.) Physical treatment - a sizing and segregation process to remove unsuitable materials. 
Additionally, CE holds a portfolio of more than 560 process, treatment and operating permits, including the ones mentioned above. This permit portfolio is difficult to duplicate, making these permits valuable and critically-important assets in this heavily-regulated industry. CE has achieved a 100% renewal-retention rate on desired permits in the past 20 years, and the number of permits held by CE has increased considerably over the past few years. CE’s ability to secure new permits or permit modifications for new waste streams or processes in the future remains an important growth lever for the business.
BACKLOG
The dollar value of CE's backlog is excluded due to the short-cycle nature of services provided and variability in revenues due to the timing of receipt and composition of materials. CE had an estimated material backlog on December 31, 2020 of approximately 2.7 million tons, most of which can be attributed to its contaminated materials business. This backlog provides us significant visibility on future performance within our contaminated materials business.
GROWTH
Favorable underlying market dynamics, driven by increased regulation and a growing list of contaminants and hazardous materials, and investment are anticipated to fuel CE’s growth in the coming years. We also anticipate penetrating the market with new treatment solutions and expansion of existing technologies, including permit modifications and applications in new geographic markets. Lastly, CE is well-positioned to benefit from an improved outlook for maintenance and environmental dredging, and we expect acquisitions to be an important growth lever for CE. CE operates in a very fragmented, regionally-driven market, and as a result, we expect to pursue acquisition opportunities that may provide increased scale and/or new capabilities, along with synergies and attractive financial returns to the Company.
COMPETITION
Given the fragmented nature of the specialty waste industry, CE competes with numerous companies. Our larger peers include Clean Harbors, Heritage Environmental Services, and U.S. Ecology within the hazardous materials line of business, and GFL Environmental and Impact Environmental within the contaminated materials market. CE differentiates itself from competitors through service reliability and responsiveness, its diverse operating capabilities and regulatory compliant solutions, and the value it provides through providing low-cost solutions relative to other disposal alternatives in the regions where it operates.
HARSCO RAIL

RAIL EQUIPMENT
Manufacturing high-quality, cutting-edge technology equipment is core to Harsco Rail. These products are developed through an active research and development effort, often in conjunction with our customers. Our primary operating costs include product engineering, metal and electrical components. Rail equipment sales represented approximately 56% of segment revenues in 2020. Below is a summary of our major equipment categories. 
Surfacing Equipment
Harsco Rail’s surfacing machines precisely align and stabilize railway track by raising the rail to the desired height and packing the supporting ballast foundation.  This process increases rail productivity and limits maintenance downtime for our customers. The Company is also a leader in the development of automated tamping equipment through the integration of drone technology, which provides customers with incremental operating flexibility.
Utility Track Vehicles ("UTVs")
Our all-purpose UTVs are used to power work trains for a broad range of rail maintenance requirements, including snow removal, catenary maintenance, and other repairs. UTVs are engineered to order, providing highly versatile configurations equipped with cranes, generators and/or work platforms used by our customers. Harsco Rail has also developed and introduced a hybrid diesel-electric maintenance vehicle, a breakthrough technology, that supports customer ambitions to electrify their rails and lower their carbon footprint.
Production Grinders
Harsco Rail’s suite of grinding products extend the life of track and enhance customer performance. Our grinders remove cracks and other surface defects and re-profile rail heads. The result is smoother and quieter track that enables our customers to operate at higher speeds and lower fuel consumption.
Tie Equipment
Harsco Rail provides a full line of tie equipment, with drone capabilities, to help customers maintain their linear assets. These products include spike puller, anchor spreader and tie replacement vehicles that support optimal track performance and safety.
New Track Construction Equipment
A new track construction machine produced by the Company can lay roughly a mile of track per day in continuous operation. The equipment constructs track three times faster than the stick-building alternative and works with all forms of ties.

These products include OEM genuine replacement parts and upgrade kits to ensure equipment achieves peak performance and to minimize operating costs. Our service representatives are deployed around the world, and our e-commerce 
website features over 20,000 parts. Aftermarket parts sales and services represented approximately 32% of segment revenues in 2020.
PROTRAN TECHNOLOGY
Protran is a leading technology provider to the rail and transit market. Its railway track worker and train operator safety systems help protect railway personnel from oncoming rail traffic and prevent vehicle-to-vehicle collisions. Protran’s safety equipment is found on transit buses as well, providing turn alerts to pedestrians. Protran also sells track measurement and diagnostic solutions. This technology provides analytical data on track conditions, thereby helping railways plan the timing and location of preventive maintenance. Protran represented approximately 3% of segment revenues in 2020.
RAILWAY CONTRACTING SERVICES
Harsco Rail's contracting services provide customers with a quality service through work crews that operate the equipment and understand the customer's maintenance needs. With years of experience, Harsco Rail's contract service teams have covered more than 397 thousand miles of track, helping customers achieve desired productivity goals. Railways contracting services represented approximately 9% of segment revenues in 2020.
CUSTOMERS
Over 125 major railways, including Class-1 railroads in North America, mass transit systems (authorities), equipment leasing companies and state-owned railroads around the world have chosen Harsco Rail to optimize the condition of their tracks. Harsco Rail’s geographic and product mix is diversified. In 2020, approximately 34% of Harsco Rail’s revenues were derived outside of North America. Harsco Rail had one customer in 2020, 2019 and 2018 that provided more than 10% of the segment's revenues. 
BACKLOG
Harsco Rail had an order backlog on December 31, 2020 of $441.4 million compared with $446.9 million on December 31, 2019. Most of this backlog can be attributed to our Rail equipment business. Equipment is often sold through long lead-time purchase orders or under large, multi-year supply contracts, while aftermarket and Protran sales have shorter-cycle characteristics.
Importantly, this backlog also provides us significant visibility for future quarters. As of December 31, 2020, $241.1 million or 55% of the Harsco Rail segment's manufactured products order backlog is expected to be filled in 2021. The remainder of this backlog is expected to be filled through 2026.
MANUFACTURING AND WORKING CAPITAL
Our primary equipment manufacturing facility is in Columbia, South Carolina. We also maintain a manufacturing presence in Europe, mainly to support certain large, multi-year supply contracts in that region. 
Given the time required to manufacture certain equipment, Rail manages its inventories to meet forecasted demand and customer requirements. We will usually build inventories during the design and production phase for large or long-lead-time orders, and the opposite is true as equipment is delivered under these contracts. Further, the overall cash impact of these inventory changes is partially mitigated by the fact that Rail often receives advance or progress payments on large orders.
GROWTH
Developing new and differentiated technology is critical to our growth, and we see numerous potential growth levers for Harsco Rail throughout our product portfolio and expanding global presence. We expect to benefit in North America from the efficiency or productivity goals of our freight customers and investments by transit authorities to upgrade and improve asset performance. In the international market, we anticipate further share gains through our equipment innovations, and we are positioned to benefit as global spending for safety and measurement technologies and rail electrification increases. 
COMPETITION
We have many competitors across our global product and services portfolio, including Plasser & Theurer, Nordco, Loram, and Matisa Materiel Industriel SA. We believe Harsco Rail differentiates itself from competitors through innovative technology solutions, as well as service and product quality. We create customized products designed to meet the specific needs of our customers’ railway projects, while at the same time meeting their productivity, safety and environmental goals.
ENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE
We are committed to building a global, market-leading environmental solutions company that preserves our environment, adheres to ethical and responsible business practices, and supports our customers as they do the same. Environmental, Social 
and Governance ("ESG") is central to our business strategy and operations - our employees are inspired to develop innovative products and services that positively impact the environment and support the Company’s growth.
Our ESG focus areas include:

This report, published in the second-half of 2020, is our most comprehensive sustainability report to date and can be found on the Company’s website (www.harsco.com/sustainability) along with other related policies.
HARSCO BUSINESS SYSTEM ("HBS")
Our HBS is a shared set of processes that reflect and support our corporate strategy. These repeatable and replicable standards and practices are the hallmark of a high-performing company. There is intrinsic value in a common language, and a defined business system does away, in large part, with ambiguity about what constitutes success. The elements of our HBS are: 
Environmental, Health & Safety; Continuous Improvement; Talent Development; Strategic Planning; and Acquisitions & Divestitures. 
ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES
Given the Company’s evolution to a single-thesis environmental solutions company, acquisitions and divestitures have been an important element of our business strategy. These actions support the Company’s growth ambitions, while reducing business cyclicality and portfolio complexity.
In April 2020 the Company completed the acquisition of ESOL, from Stericycle, Inc., for $429.0 million in cash, inclusive of post-closing adjustments. ESOL is an established waste transportation, processing and services provider with a comprehensive portfolio of disposal solutions for customers primarily across the industrial, retail and healthcare markets. ESOL's network includes thirteen permitted TSDF facilities and forty-eight 10-day transfer facilities serving more than ninety thousand customer locations utilizing a fleet of more than seven hundred vehicles. The acquisition of ESOL furthers Harsco’s transformation into a global, market-leading, single-thesis environmental solutions platform. The results of ESOL are included in the Harsco Clean Earth Segment.
In June 2019, the Company acquired CE from Compass Diversified Holdings for approximately $628 million in cash. This acquisition expanded the Company’s environmental service capabilities, while providing the Company entry into the specialty market, which possesses attractive organic growth and recurring revenues characteristics as well as a platform for future acquisition growth.
Also, in 2019, the Company completed the sale of the AXC business for approximately $600 million (July 2019) and the Harsco Industrial Patterson-Kelley business (November 2019) for approximately $60 million in cash. In January 2020 the Company sold IKG for $85.0 million, including a note receivable with a face value of $40.0 million. These divestitures accelerated the transformation of the Company's portfolio of businesses into a global leading provider of environmental solutions and services, and significantly reduce the Company’s exposure to the cyclicality of the U.S. energy market.
In May 2018, the Company acquired Altek, a U.K.-based manufacturer of market leading products that enable aluminum producers and recyclers to manage critical waste streams and improve operating productivity. Altek has developed unique technologies that support the sustainability of its customers, which complements the Company’s other industrial waste services. The Company acquired Altek for a purchase price of £45 million (approximately $60 million). Altek's revenues and operating results are included in the results of the Harsco Environmental Segment.
SEASONALITY
Certain of the Company's businesses can be subject to seasonal fluctuations. Demand for services and solutions provided by HE are subject to seasonal changes related to weather conditions, inventory management through the steel-industry supply chain, and customer operating outages linked to regular holidays. The timing of these impacts varies by region, however, overall customer demand for HE across its global footprint tend to be strongest in the second quarter and third quarter of each year. CE, meanwhile, provides services that can also fluctuate seasonally with weather, construction activity, retail spending and municipal waste collection programs. As a result, demand for CE services tends to be weakest in the first quarter of each year. Harsco Rail is not considered to be influenced by seasonal trends, although its business is often influenced by the timing of budgetary practices by customers.
Due to these factors, the Company’s revenues and earnings are usually higher during the second and third quarters of each year relative to the first and fourth quarter of the year. Additionally, the Company’s cash flows are also influenced by seasonality. The Company’s cash flow from operations has historically been higher in the second half of the year, compared with the first half, due to working capital management, receivable collections during the fourth quarter as a result of higher revenues in preceding quarters and the timing of certain cash payments, including for incentive compensation and pension contributions.
ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE
The Company is subject to various environmental regulations within its global operations and the scope of relevant environmental regulation is expanded following the Company’s acquisition of CE and ESOL in 2019 and 2020, respectively. CE operates within an industry that is subject to stringent environmental regulations by federal, state and local authorities, which regulate the treatment and disposal of specialty waste. Facility and operating permits or approvals from these authorities are required to maintain operations. The nature of these permits varies by jurisdiction and are based on the activities at a particular site. These permits are generally difficult to obtain. This dynamic, along with increased regulation on the treatment and disposal of specialty waste, is beneficial to our CE business.
The most significant U.S. federal environmental regulation that impacts our business is the RCRA. RCRA created a cradle-to-grave system which governs the transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous waste. Under RCRA, each hazardous waste processing facility must maintain a RCRA permit and comply with defined operating practices. This legislation is administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ("EPA"), although its authority may be delegated to a State EPA with similar or more stringent environmental standards.
The Company is also subject to air and water quality control legislation in the U.S. and in foreign countries where the Company operates. The Clean Water Act regulates the discharge of pollutants into waterways and sewers in the U.S, and, where necessary, we obtain and must comply with permits to discharge wastewater from our facilities. Similarly, the Clean Air Act in the U.S. controls emissions of pollutants into the air and requires permits for certain emissions.
The Company regards compliance with all applicable environmental regulations as critical to its business. Historically, the Company has been able to renew and retain all required permits to maintain its operations and it has not experienced substantial difficulty complying with relevant environmental regulations. The Company also does not anticipate making any material capital expenditures to comply with or improve environmental performance in the future, and while environmental regulations may increase or expand, it cannot predict the extent of this future environmental regulation, its related costs and the overall effect on the Company’s business.

Health, Safety and Wellness
We are committed to the health, safety and wellness of our employees.

We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of health and wellness programs globally.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we developed and implemented robust principals and standards, in consultation with infectious disease and public health experts, we consider to be in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, to ensure we not only complied with governmental regulations, but created safe work environments for our employees.
