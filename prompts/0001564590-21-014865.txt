Overview
 ORIC Pharmaceuticals is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to improving patients’ lives by Overcoming Resistance In Cancer.
 Profound advancements in oncology drug development have expanded the treatment options available to patients, yet therapeutic resistance and relapse continue to limit the efficacy and duration of clinical benefit of such treatments. Collectively, our founders and management team have a decades-long heritage of identifying and characterizing resistance mechanisms in oncology, having discovered and developed groundbreaking medicines at companies such as Ignyta, Medivation, Aragon and Genentech.
 At ORIC, our fully integrated discovery and development team is advancing a diverse pipeline of innovative therapies designed to counter resistance mechanisms in cancer by leveraging our expertise within three specific areas: hormone-dependent cancers, precision oncology and key tumor dependencies. Our lead product candidate, ORIC-101, builds upon a legacy of successful drug development by our founders in the field of nuclear hormone receptors and their efforts to elucidate the cause of resistance to the groundbreaking prostate cancer therapies that they had developed. ORIC-101 is a potent and selective small molecule antagonist of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), which has been linked to resistance to multiple classes of cancer therapeutics across a variety of solid tumors. In 2019, we initiated two separate Phase 1b trials of ORIC-101 in combination with (1) Xtandi (enzalutamide) in metastatic prostate cancer and (2) Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) in advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In December 2020, we selected the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) and initiated the dose expansion portion of the Phase 1b trial of ORIC-101 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and we expect to report interim safety, efficacy and translational data from this trial in the first half of 2021. In January 2021, we selected the RP2D and initiated the dose expansion portion of the Phase 1b trial of ORIC-101 in combination with enzalutamide and we expect to report interim safety, efficacy, and translational data from this trial in the second half of 2021. Our other product candidates include (1) ORIC-533, an orally bioavailable, potent and selective, small molecule inhibitor of CD73, a key node in the adenosine pathway believed to play a central role in resistance to chemotherapy- and immunotherapy-based treatment

regimens, (2) ORIC-944, an allosteric inhibitor of PRC2 via the EED subunit, for which we licensed exclusive worldwide development and commercialization rights from Mirati Therapeutics in August 2020 and (3) ORIC-114, a brain penetrant, orally bioavailable, irreversible inhibitor designed to selectively target EGFR and HER2 with high potency towards exon 20 insertion mutations. We expect to file an IND for ORIC-533 in the first half of 2021, an IND for ORIC-944 in the second half of 2021 and a CTA for ORIC-114 in the second half of 2021. Beyond these product candidates, we are developing multiple precision medicines targeting other hallmark cancer resistance mechanisms. We believe our team and capabilities uniquely position us to be a leader in developing novel therapies to overcome resistance in cancer.
 Cancer resistance continues to be one of the most daunting challenges facing patients, clinicians and researchers in oncology today. A multitude of biological factors and pathways have been linked to resistance, which enables tumors to restore cell growth and survival by circumventing a treatment’s intended mechanism of action. Our resistance platform is focused on three areas: (1) innate resistance, which derives from an unaddressed oncogenic driver that promotes tumorigenesis; (2) acquired resistance, the result of an induced or enriched oncogenic driver that arises in response to treatment; and (3) bypass resistance, the activation of a compensatory signaling pathway in response to treatment.
 
We are building a portfolio of novel agents targeting multiple resistance mechanisms by leveraging our specialized expertise in hormone-dependent cancers, precision oncology and key tumor dependencies:
 
 
• | Hormone-dependent cancers: Two of our founders, Drs. Charles Sawyers and Richard Heyman, are leading experts in nuclear hormone receptors and hormone-dependent cancers. They previously co-founded two oncology companies, Aragon (acquired by Johnson & Johnson in 2013) and Seragon (acquired by Roche in 2014), that developed therapeutics targeting two nuclear hormone receptors, the androgen receptor (AR) and estrogen receptor (ER), respectively, the former effort leading to the approved drug Erleada (apalutamide). Our lead product candidate, ORIC-101, while independently developed by ORIC, builds on academic work from Dr. Sawyers’ laboratory at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) implicating GR as a potential mechanism of resistance to Xtandi (also discovered by Dr. Sawyers and developed by Medivation, which was acquired by Pfizer in 2016) in prostate cancer. Similarly, our product candidate, ORIC-944, an allosteric inhibitor of PRC2 via EED, is being developed as a potential treatment for advanced prostate cancer. Given the breadth of solid tumor indications in which hormone signaling pathways have been implicated in driving disease, or in the development of resistance, we believe our differentiated insight into this biology is a crucial component of our future success.

• | Precision oncology: Our precision medicine approach of utilizing biomarkers for demonstration of target and pathway engagement and ultimately for patient selection is rooted in our management team’s prior experience at Ignyta (acquired by Roche in 2018) in successfully developing Rozlytrek (entrectinib), which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ROS1-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK)-positive solid tumors in 2019. Similarly, our product candidate, ORIC-114, a brain penetrant, irreversible inhibitor designed to selectively target EGFR and HER2 with high potency against exon 20 insertion mutations, is being developed in genetically defined patient populations, including NSCLC and metastatic breast cancer. Our team’s experience in precision oncology dates back decades, including Dr. Sawyers’ pivotal role in the development of Gleevec (imatinib) and Sprycel (dasatinib). We believe our team’s expertise and experience in precision oncology will allow us to develop drugs with a higher probability of clinical success within biomarker-defined patient populations, while also potentially reducing the time and cost of development.

• | Key tumor dependencies: Key tumor dependencies are abnormal alterations that promote cancer cell growth and survival and also confer specific vulnerabilities that normal cells lack; these cancer-specific dependencies are compelling therapeutic targets. Our scientific team—led by our Chief Scientific Officer, Head of Drug Discovery, Head of Biology and Head of Translational Medicine—has amassed deep knowledge of key oncogenic drivers and pathways in order to identify and validate oncology targets. They most recently worked together at Genentech, where they progressed more than 20 oncology discovery programs into clinical development, with three approvals to date, including Cotellic (cobimetinib), Zelboraf (vemurafenib) and Polivy (polatuzumab vedotin). Our knowledge of innate, acquired and bypass resistance mechanisms, as well as our in-depth experience in forward and reverse translation, underpins our discovery efforts to identify key drivers of cancer resistance that can be exploited for therapeutic gain. Our resistance platform and in-house capabilities in medicinal chemistry and structure-based design enable us to pursue these resistance mechanisms. For example, our understanding of innate resistance and our medicinal chemistry expertise has led to the discovery of ORIC-533, an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of CD73.

 We are applying our internal drug discovery capabilities to these three areas of expertise to develop innovative therapies targeting the critical cancer resistance mechanisms that we believe will bring the largest benefit to patients, including by making existing therapies more effective for a longer period of time.

Our portfolio currently consists of multiple internally discovered and in-licensed programs targeting key resistance mechanisms in cancer. Our product candidates are shown in the figure below:


Our most advanced discovery and research programs are shown in the figure below:


GR antagonist program: ORIC-101
 GR is a nuclear hormone receptor that mediates responses to glucocorticoid hormones involved in regulating a range of cellular functions, such as metabolism, cell growth and differentiation. Roughly in parallel, two distinct and uncorrelated mechanisms of GR-mediated resistance to anti-cancer therapies began to be studied by oncology experts. The original hypothesis for our lead program targeting GR was borne out of work conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Sawyers at MSKCC in search of explanatory factors underlying resistance to anti-androgen prostate cancer therapies, including Xtandi and Erleada. His work demonstrated that GR signaling is a bypass mechanism to anti-androgen therapy, with GR taking over for AR signaling, and that increased expression of GR in prostate cancer is correlated with resistance to Xtandi. Similarly, GR has also been studied for its potential role in mediating resistance to chemotherapy, though in this case, the mechanism appears to be related to GR’s role in imparting a “pro-survival” phenotype on the tumor via certain biological processes like epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition and anti-apoptosis. We and others have shown that GR is overexpressed across over 20 advanced solid tumors including prostate, pancreatic, triple negative breast (TNBC) and ovarian cancers, and that GR overexpression is associated with worse survival outcomes for patients treated with anti-androgen therapies in prostate cancer and chemotherapy in other solid tumors.
 Our lead product candidate, ORIC-101, is a potent and selective small molecule GR antagonist designed to inhibit GR transcriptional activity and block pro-survival signals downstream of its activation that confer resistance to anti-androgen therapies and chemotherapies. Since its initial discovery at ORIC, we have rapidly advanced ORIC-101 through preclinical studies that have informed a robust clinical development plan designed to test both potential mechanisms of GR-mediated resistance. Following the successful completion of two Phase 1a trials in over 50 healthy volunteers, we initiated in 2019 two separate Phase 1b trials of ORIC-101 in combination with: (1) enzalutamide in metastatic prostate cancer and (2) nab-paclitaxel in advanced or metastatic solid tumors. These trials were intended to establish safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics (PD), preliminary anti-tumor activity and a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of ORIC-101 in combination with each of these therapeutics. In December 2020, we selected the RP2D and initiated the dose expansion portion of the Phase 1b trial of ORIC-101 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and we expect to report interim safety, efficacy, and translational data from this trial in the first half of 2021. In January 2021, we selected the RP2D and initiated the dose expansion portion of the Phase 1b trial of ORIC-101 in combination with enzalutamide and we expect to report interim safety, efficacy, and translational data from this trial in the second half of 2021. To help inform which patients may be most suitable for treatment with ORIC-101, we have developed a proprietary immunohistochemistry (IHC) assay that measures GR protein expression levels as well as a proprietary GR gene activation signature that measures GR signaling activity, both of which are being utilized in our ongoing clinical trials and may be used for patient selection in future clinical trials. If either of these approaches proves to be a useful method for patient selection, we expect to incorporate the specific diagnostic test into our registrational studies and partner with the appropriate diagnostic provider to co-develop a companion diagnostic. In general, the FDA expects to review and approve simultaneously NDA and PMA submissions for a therapeutic and its companion diagnostic, respectively, so any delay in diagnostic approval could delay drug approval.

CD73 inhibitor program: ORIC-533
 Many cancers usurp the anti-inflammatory adenosine pathway to avoid detection by the immune system, thereby reducing the effectiveness of certain chemotherapy- and immunotherapy-based treatments. Accumulation of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment is implicated in local immune suppression that leads to tumor growth. CD73 is an enzyme that controls the rate at which extracellular adenosine is produced and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including TNBC, NSCLC, melanoma and prostate, among others. Several global pharmaceutical companies are developing anti-CD73 antibodies, but due to significant medicinal chemistry challenges, to our knowledge, only one additional orally bioavailable inhibitor of CD73 is in clinical development. With our resistance platform capabilities, our medicinal chemistry team created a differentiated compound that is both potent and orally bioavailable. Our product candidate ORIC-533, is an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of CD73 that has demonstrated more potent adenosine inhibition in vitro compared to an antibody-based approach and other small molecule CD73 inhibitors. ORIC-533 continues to progress in IND enabling studies and we expect to file an IND with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the first half of 2021. Having conducted a preclinical collaboration with an academic key opinion leader that generated compelling single agent activity in patient derived model systems in an undisclosed tumor type, we plan to pursue a single agent clinical development path in this indication.
 PRC2 inhibitor program: ORIC-944
 The dysregulation of PRC2 methyltransferase activity can lead to tumorigenesis in a wide range of cancers including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and hematological malignancies. PRC2 is composed of two druggable subunits: EED and EZH2. Several companies are developing EZH2 inhibitors; however, the pharmacologic properties of these compounds result in high doses that achieve only partial target inhibition in the clinic. Additionally, preclinical studies suggest drug resistance to EZH2 inhibitors may develop via EZH1 bypass compensation or acquired mutations in EZH2. Allosteric inhibition of EED impacts the assembly, stabilization, and activation of PRC2, and may have benefits over EZH2-mediated inhibition of PRC2. ORIC-944 is a potent and selective allosteric inhibitor of PRC2 via the EED subunit and is efficacious in enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer models in preclinical studies. We have initiated IND enabling studies and plan to file an IND with the FDA in the second half of 2021, with initial clinical development as a single agent in treatment-resistant prostate cancer.
 Brain penetrant EGFR/HER2 exon 20 program: ORIC-114
 The ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family is involved in key cellular functions, including cell growth and survival. EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations are observed across multiple solid tumors, including NSCLC, breast, gastrointestinal, bladder and other cancers. EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are observed in approximately 2% of all patients with NSCLC and these patients have a worse prognosis than patients with NSCLC driven by other EGFR mutations. HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations are observed in approximately 1.5% of all patients with NSCLC. Approximately one-third of patients with exon 20 insertion mutations develop brain metastases, which contributes to poor prognosis.
 ORIC-114 is a brain penetrant, orally bioavailable, irreversible inhibitor designed to selectively target EGFR and HER2 with high potency against exon 20 insertion mutations. ORIC-114 has demonstrated greater brain exposure in preclinical studies compared to certain other compounds being developed against exon 20 mutations and has shown strong anti-tumor activity in an EGFR-driven intracranial lung cancer model. Currently, there are no medicines approved by the FDA specifically to treat tumors with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations. We have initiated IND enabling studies and plan to file a Clinical Trial Application (CTA) in South Korea in the second half of 2021.
 Other preclinical programs
 In addition to our product candidates, we are leveraging our resistance platform in pursuit of multiple discovery research programs that focus on our expertise within hormone-dependent cancers, precision oncology and key tumor dependencies. These programs highlight our medicinal chemistry and structure-based design expertise, thus for the most part utilize a small molecule therapeutic approach to target oncogenic drivers in solid tumors like prostate, breast, and lung cancer that relapse with innate, acquired or bypass resistance. Our most advanced discovery research program is currently in lead optimization.
 Our strategy 
 Our goal is to discover, develop and commercialize innovative therapies that overcome resistance in cancer. The key elements of our business strategy to achieve this goal include: 
  
• | Leveraging the insights, experience and networks of our founders and management team. Our founders and management team have extensive experience identifying, discovering, developing and commercializing innovative cancer therapeutics aimed at novel targets, including Rozlytrek, Erleada, Talzenna, Xtandi, Sprycel and Gleevec. We are using this broad oncology experience together with our internal discovery and development capabilities to build a diverse pipeline of therapies targeting multiple cancer resistance mechanisms. For example, our lead product candidate, ORIC-101, while independently developed by ORIC, builds on academic work originally conducted by the laboratory of Dr. Sawyers at MSKCC.

• | Advancing our lead product candidate, ORIC-101, as rapidly as possible through clinical development by exploring rational combinations across multiple tumor types. The GR signaling pathway has been implicated in resistance to anti-androgen therapies in prostate cancer as well as chemotherapy regimens in other advanced solid tumor indications. Our clinical development effort for ORIC-101, an internally developed potent and selective small molecule antagonist of GR, will initially focus on indications where there is evidence suggesting GR-mediated signaling contributes to resistance and disease progression. In 2019, we initiated two separate Phase 1b trials of ORIC-101 in combination with (1) enzalutamide in metastatic prostate cancer and (2) nab-paclitaxel in advanced or metastatic solid tumors, and we expect to report interim data from the Phase 1b trial of ORIC-101 in combination with nab-paclitaxel in the first half of 2021 and from the Phase 1b trial of ORIC-101 in combination with enzalutamide in the second half of 2021. Where possible, we plan to pursue accelerated development strategies in areas of high unmet need.

• | Leveraging our resistance platform in building the leading, fully integrated company focused on delivering innovative medicines that aim to overcome resistance in cancer. As of December 31, 2020, we had 61 full-time employees, including world-class discovery, preclinical and clinical development teams, encompassing all major functions necessary to take a molecule from target identification through registrational clinical trials. Together, they bring in-house expertise in medicinal chemistry, biology, translational medicine, computational chemistry, in vitro and in vivo pharmacology, computational biology, biomarker development and CMC. We have also established internal expertise in clinical development, clinical operations, pharmacovigilance, clinical pharmacology, regulatory and quality. The members of our research and development organization have collectively led and contributed to dozens of IND filings and multiple drug approvals in oncology. These internal capabilities led to the discovery and clinical development of our first product candidate and will enable us to continue to expand and advance our portfolio of additional product candidates.

• | Continuing to expand our portfolio of product candidates through both internal research activities and business development efforts. Our internally generated product candidate, ORIC-533, is an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of CD73. We expect to file an IND for ORIC-533 with the FDA in the first half of 2021. We also continue to advance our other internally generated programs as well as expand our pipeline through internal discovery activities. Simultaneously, we believe that accessing external innovation and expertise is important to our success. For example, we have in-licensed Mirati’s allosteric PRC2 program, including a lead product candidate now designated ORIC-944, as well as Voronoi’s EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation program, including a lead product candidate now designated ORIC-114. ORIC-944 is a potent and selective allosteric inhibitor of PRC2 and is efficacious in enzalutamide-resistance prostate cancer models in preclinical studies. ORIC-114 is a brain penetrant, orally bioavailable, irreversible inhibitor designed to selectively target EGFR and HER2 with high potency towards exon 20 insertion mutations. We will continue to leverage our leadership team’s prior business development experience as we evaluate potential in-licensing and acquisition opportunities to further expand our portfolio. We aim to be the partner of choice for academic groups and companies in the field of cancer resistance.

• | Utilizing a precision medicine approach in the development of each of our product candidates. We use biomarkers to demonstrate target and pathway engagement and plan to use them for patient selection in our clinical trials. This approach is rooted in our team’s prior experiences developing targeted therapies, such as Rozlytrek, an orally bioavailable, tyrosine kinase inhibitor approved for select tumors that harbor ROS1 or NTRK fusions. We seek to design rigorous and cost-efficient clinical programs that increase the probability of success by exploring connections between cellular-level biology and patient-level clinical outcomes. The use of biomarker-based patient selection is designed to enable demonstration of clinical proof-of-concept earlier and with fewer patients, leading ultimately to smaller pivotal trials. As part of our strategy, our in-house team of experienced translational scientists and computational biologists leverages existing technologies as well as develops proprietary assays to enable the selection and assessment of biomarkers for each of our programs. For ORIC-101, we have developed a proprietary IHC assay that measures GR protein expression levels as well as a proprietary GR gene activation signature that measures GR signaling activity. Both of these assays are being utilized in our two ongoing Phase 1b clinical trials of ORIC-101.

• | Evaluating opportunities to accelerate development timelines and enhance the commercial potential of our programs in collaboration with third parties. We own or license full worldwide development and commercialization rights to each of our programs (other than in the ORIC Territory with respect to our brain penetrant EGFR and HER2 exon 20 program, ORIC-114). We have established collaborations and intend to continue evaluating opportunities to work with partners that meaningfully enhance our capabilities with respect to the development and commercialization of our product candidates. For example, for our Phase 1b trial of ORIC-101 in combination with enzalutamide in prostate cancer, we have entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Astellas. In addition, we intend to commercialize our product candidates in key markets either alone or with partners in order to maximize the worldwide commercial potential of our programs.

Background on cancer resistance 
 Cancer resistance continues to be one of the most daunting challenges facing patients, clinicians and researchers in oncology today. A multitude of biological factors and pathways have been linked to resistance, which enables tumors to restore cell growth and survival by circumventing a treatment’s intended mechanism of action. Furthermore, treatment resistance in cancer emerges irrespective of therapeutic class, including targeted therapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy and chemotherapy. 
 Our resistance platform is focused on three areas: (1) innate resistance, which derives from an unaddressed oncogenic driver that promotes tumorigenesis; (2) acquired resistance, the result of an induced or enriched oncogenic driver that arises in response to treatment; and (3) bypass resistance, the activation of a compensatory signaling pathway in response to treatment. 
 Overview of key resistance mechanisms and ORIC team’s prior relevant experience 
 

 
• | Innate resistance occurs when a key tumor dependency is not addressed, such as a driver mutation with no available targeted therapeutic. A recent example of a drug targeting innate resistance is Rozlytrek, developed by Ignyta for patients with ROS1-positive, metastatic NSCLC and NTRK gene fusion-positive solid tumors. We believe these innate resistance targets have a higher probability of technical success than other cancer targets, hold potential for meaningful clinical outcomes, and have the potential for rapid clinical development and approval timelines. Innate resistance targets have been the subject of a number of targeted therapies that have been approved over the past couple of decades. Studies have shown that treatments that target and inhibit unaddressed driver mutations have high response rates with generally good durability, including in a resistant setting. This efficacy in a refractory patient population in turn has been shown to enable a shorter development pathway, with many such agents being approved based upon single arm trials of modest size. New advances in small molecule drug discovery have created an opportunity to better target next-generation oncogenic drivers. Our pipeline includes several programs targeting innate resistance including ORIC-533, our orally bioavailable small molecule CD73 inhibitor, which we designed to address adenosine-driven innate resistance to chemotherapy- and immunotherapy-based treatment regimens; ORIC-944, our allosteric inhibitor of PRC2, which was designed to address innate resistance related to PRC2 dysregulation in prostate and other tumors; and ORIC-114, our brain penetrant, orally bioavailable, irreversible inhibitor designed to address innate resistance related to exon20 insertion mutations of EGFR and HER2 in lung and other tumors. While other therapies targeting innate resistance have shown technical success, our programs are distinct from other therapies and there is no guarantee that our product candidates will be approved, are more likely to receive FDA approval than other potential product candidates, or if approved, will be approved quickly.

• | Acquired resistance arises in response to treatment resulting in a newly acquired or enriched oncogenic driver. Genomic changes in the therapeutic target, such as DNA mutation or amplification, can be evolutionarily selected to propel proliferation in heterogeneous tumors or may be acquired through the course of the disease. Specific changes in the target itself often result in loss of potency of the initial therapeutic. An example of acquired resistance is seen in chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) treated with the first-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor Gleevec, with resistance frequently driven by mutations in BCR-ABL that lead to loss of Gleevec binding activity. The second-generation BCR-ABL inhibitor Sprycel was developed to specifically address acquired resistance to Gleevec, with our co-founder, Dr. Sawyers, playing a critical role in the development of both therapeutics. Our pipeline includes one preclinical program and several ongoing discovery efforts directed towards targets for acquired resistance in solid tumors.

• | Bypass resistance occurs when a therapeutically targeted cancer pathway is reactivated in cells to compensate for the presence of a therapeutic. Targeted therapies that induce reactivation of the same pathway indicate a key dependence on that specific pathway for tumor growth and survival. Similar to GR, this key dependency concept is illustrated in the context of BRAF mutant melanoma. Mutations in the BRAF kinase allow for unrestricted signaling of the protein that is required for tumor growth and survival. Discovery of small molecule BRAF inhibitors led to significant reduction of tumor growth and improvement of melanoma patient survival, as the innate resistance was addressed. However, following the initial profound responses observed in patients, patients began relapsing. Mechanistic exploration into the basis of patient progression revealed that some tumors were evolving to reactivate the same pathway further downstream, as the tumors compensated for the BRAF therapeutic. The development of Cotellic to target MEK further downstream in this pathway overcame the bypass mechanism and significantly improved patient outcomes.

Collectively, our team has spent decades identifying and characterizing resistance mechanisms and has a strong heritage of bringing forth new and improved therapies designed to exploit resistance biology from the research lab to the clinic and, ultimately, to patients in need. 
 Our areas of focus within cancer resistance 
 Our vision for patients with cancer is that therapeutics specifically addressing resistance will provide durable treatment responses, such that solid tumors can become a chronic disease with patient survival measured in years rather than months. Within the broader resistance landscape, we have specialized expertise in hormone-dependent cancers, precision oncology and key tumor dependencies, areas in which we have focused our internal discovery and external business development efforts. 
 
Hormone-dependent cancers 
 Two of our founders, Drs. Sawyers and Heyman, are leading experts in nuclear hormone receptors and hormone-dependent cancers. They previously co-founded two oncology companies, Aragon and Seragon, that developed therapeutics targeting two nuclear hormone receptors, AR and ER, respectively. Following the acquisitions of Aragon—whose lead product, Erleada, was ultimately approved for prostate cancer—and Seragon, and built upon academic work from Dr. Sawyers’ laboratory at MSKCC implicating GR as a potential mechanism of resistance to Xtandi (also discovered by Dr. Sawyers) in prostate cancer, Drs. Sawyers and Heyman conceived of ORIC and proposed GR as our first target of interest. 
 The nuclear hormone receptor gene family is a therapeutically rich target class implicated in a broad range of human diseases. Within this family, AR and ER are among the best-known targets that have resulted in a number of approved oncology therapies. ER has been implicated in breast and endometrial cancers, for which Nolvadex (tamoxifen) and Faslodex (fulvestrant) have been approved for breast cancer. Similarly, AR has been implicated in prostate cancer, for which Casodex (bicalutamide), Xtandi, Erleada and Nubeqa (darolutamide) have been approved. 
 A third member of this family is GR, which is encoded by the NR3C1 (nuclear receptor subfamily 3, group C, member 1) gene and is a nuclear hormone receptor to which cortisol and other glucocorticoids bind. When glucocorticoids bind to GR, its primary mechanism of action is translocation into the nucleus and regulation of gene transcription. GR is expressed in almost every cell in the body and regulates genes controlling metabolism, cell growth, inflammation, apoptosis and differentiation. Because the receptor gene is expressed in several forms, it has many different (pleiotropic) effects in different parts of the body. 
 There is substantial in vitro, in vivo and clinical evidence that GR signaling allows certain solid tumors to resist treatment. In some cancers GR signaling promotes tumor growth, while in others it stimulates genes that protect from cell death. Many types of solid tumors overexpress GR and are potential targets for ORIC-101, including prostate, pancreatic, ovarian, TNBC and endometrial cancers, among others. 
 Given the breadth of solid tumor indications in which hormone signaling pathways have been implicated in driving disease, or in the development of resistance, we believe our differentiated insight into this biology is a crucial component of our future success.
 Precision oncology (biomarker-driven, patient-selected trials) 
 Our clinical development team—including our Chief Medical Officer, Head of Clinical Development and heads of five core functions—previously worked together with our Chief Executive Officer at Ignyta, an oncology company that developed a pipeline of precision therapies, including Rozlytrek, which is now approved by the FDA in two different indications for genetically defined tumors, ROS1-positive metastatic NSCLC and NTRK-positive solid tumors. The clinical development of Rozlytrek, which was largely driven by this team, relied upon biomarker-driven patient selection via a companion diagnostic, leading to the approval of the compound approximately five years after it first entered the clinic. 
 8

The Rozlytrek and Ignyta experience can be seen as a paradigm for precision oncology, in which the identification of biomarkers forms the basis of the entire drug discovery and development process, from early understandings of PK and PD modulation of target biology through to appropriate patient selection during clinical development. As part of our strategy, our in-house team of experienced translational scientists and computational biologists utilize existing technologies as well as develop proprietary assays to enable the selection and assessment of biomarkers for each of our programs. We seek to design rigorous and cost-efficient clinical programs that increase the probability of success by exploring connections between cellular-level biology and patient-level clinical outcomes. The use of biomarker-based patient selection is designed to enable demonstration of clinical proof-of-concept earlier and with fewer patients, leading ultimately to smaller pivotal trials. 
 Our emphasis on a precision oncology approach to the mechanisms that underlie cancer resistance enables us to develop biological methods and assays that can be employed in the selection of appropriate patients for our development candidates rather than relying solely on limited clinical diagnosis information. For example, like many cancers, prostate cancer is a heterogeneous disease with different pathways contributing to potential resistance mechanisms to anti-androgen therapy that may vary from patient to patient or evolve over the course of a patient’s treatment history. In this complex resistance landscape, measuring levels of GR expression or gene activity represent potential strategies for selecting patients whose tumors are susceptible to GR inhibition through ORIC-101 therapy, enabling the possibility of identifying a subset of patients more likely to benefit from ORIC-101. To this end, we have developed a proprietary IHC assay that measures GR protein expression levels as well as a proprietary GR gene activation signature that measures GR signaling activity. Both of these assays are being utilized in our two ongoing Phase 1b clinical trials for ORIC-101. We intend to apply a similar precision oncology approach to the advancement of our entire pipeline.
 Key tumor dependencies 
 Our scientific team—led by our Chief Scientific Officer, Head of Drug Discovery, Head of Biology and Head of Translational Medicine—has amassed deep knowledge of key oncogenic drivers and pathways in order to identify and validate oncology targets. They most recently worked together at Genentech, where they progressed more than 20 oncology discovery programs into clinical development, with three approvals to date, including Cotellic, Zelboraf and Polivy. The team’s approach to uncovering tumor dependencies that are key drivers of cancer resistance is biology-focused and mechanistically driven. 
 Tumors are dependent on distinct biological drivers, or key tumor dependencies, which can be exploited to develop therapeutics. Examples of key tumor dependencies include oncogenic drivers, metabolic dependencies and lineage-specific markers. The earliest known tumor dependency occurs after normal cells acquire mutations that initiate tumor development. These early lesions continuously evolve within a given tissue in the presence of other cell types, such as endothelial and immune cells, ultimately generating a heterogeneous tumor ecosystem. The interplay between tumor cells and other heterologous cell types within a tissue impart physiological restrictions, such as limited oxygen or increased acidity, that tumor cells are forced to withstand to enable growth. This concept of evolution under selective pressure also applies in the context of an advanced tumor being subjected to therapeutic interventions—the relapsing tumors are forced to adapt in order to grow in the presence of treatment. Through these evolutionary processes, tumor cells can become exclusively dependent on distinct pathways, and these are the key dependencies that can be exploited for therapeutic gain. 
 Our understanding of key tumor dependencies has also led to the development of an orally bioavailable small molecule inhibitor of CD73, ORIC-533, that targets adenosine within a key metabolic pathway upon which tumors become dependent. Many cancers usurp the anti-inflammatory adenosine pathway to avoid detection by the immune system, thereby reducing the effectiveness of certain chemotherapy and immunotherapy-based treatments. Accumulation of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment is implicated in local immune suppression that leads to tumor growth. CD73 is an enzyme that controls the rate at which extracellular adenosine is produced and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including TNBC, NSCLC, melanoma and prostate, among others. In addition to our GR and CD73 programs, we are developing multiple programs focused on addressing key dependencies in solid tumors, defined as either unaddressed drivers of innate resistance, acquired mutations or bypass mechanisms that cause relapse. 
 Our resistance platform and in-house capabilities in medicinal chemistry and structure-based design enable drug discovery efforts for these resistance mechanisms. This platform, along with our forward and reverse translation expertise, underpins our efforts to address key drivers of cancer resistance.

Our most advanced discovery and research programs are shown in the figure below: 


GR antagonist program: ORIC-101 
 Our lead product candidate, ORIC-101, builds upon a legacy of successful drug development by our founders in the field of nuclear hormone receptors and their efforts to elucidate the cause of resistance to the groundbreaking prostate cancer therapies that they had developed. ORIC-101 is a potent and selective small molecule GR antagonist designed to inhibit GR transcriptional activity and block pro-survival signals downstream of its activation that confer resistance to anti-androgen therapies and chemotherapies. Following the successful completion of two Phase 1a trials in over 50 healthy volunteers, in 2019 we initiated two separate Phase 1b trials of ORIC-101 in combination with: (1) enzalutamide in metastatic prostate cancer and (2) nab-paclitaxel in advanced or metastatic solid tumors. In December 2020, we selected the RP2D and initiated the dose expansion portion of the Phase 1b trial of ORIC-101 in combination with nab-paclitaxel and we expect to report interim safety, efficacy, and translational data from this trial in the first half of 2021. In January 2021, we selected the RP2D and initiated the dose expansion portion of the Phase 1b trial of ORIC-101 in combination with enzalutamide and we expect to report interim safety, efficacy, and translational data from this trial in the second half of 2021.
 
Glucocorticoid receptor background 
 Glucocorticoids are steroid hormones secreted by the adrenal gland in a circadian and stress-associated manner to regulate metabolism, cell growth, apoptosis, differentiation and inflammation. Glucocorticoids signal through GR, a member of the superfamily of nuclear receptors expressed across a wide variety of tissues. Upon ligand binding, GR undergoes nuclear translocation, which is shown in the figure below. In the nucleus, GR binds to glucocorticoid response elements on DNA and transcriptionally activates a spectrum of genes that mediate multiple biological effects.

Glucocorticoid receptor signaling mediates multiple physiological processes 
 

Note: GR: glucocorticoid receptor. HSPs: heat shock proteins. GREs: glucocorticoid response elements. 
 The glucocorticoid receptor as a mechanism of resistance
 Multiple preclinical studies have implicated GR activation as a potential cause of cancer treatment resistance in cancers of epithelial origin. Roughly in parallel, two distinct and uncorrelated mechanisms of GR-mediated resistance to anti-cancer therapies began to be studied by oncology experts. Dr. Sawyers’ work has demonstrated that GR signaling is a bypass mechanism to anti-androgen therapy, with GR taking over for AR signaling, and that increased expression of GR in prostate cancer is correlated with resistance to Xtandi. Similarly, GR has also been studied for its potential role in mediating resistance to chemotherapy, though in this case, the mechanism appears to be related to GR’s role in imparting a “pro-survival” phenotype on the tumor via certain biological processes like epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition and anti-apoptosis. We and others have shown that GR is overexpressed across over 20 advanced solid tumors including prostate, pancreatic, triple negative breast (TNBC) and ovarian cancers, which is shown in the figure below, and that GR overexpression is associated with worse survival outcomes.

P-value is a conventional statistical method for measuring the statistical significance of clinical results. A p-value of 0.01 or less represents statistical significance, meaning there is a less than 1-in-100 likelihood that the observed result occurred by chance. 
 The FDA utilizes statistical significance, as measured by p-value, as an evidentiary standard of efficacy and typically requires a p-value of 0.05 or less to demonstrate statistical significance. 
 Limitations of other GR antagonists 
 Preclinical studies performed in TNBC and ovarian cancer models have helped to establish that genetic ablation or pharmacologic inhibition of GR enhances chemotherapy response. We are aware of only one other company, Corcept Therapeutics, developing GR antagonists for oncology. Corcept has compounds, including mifepristone and relacorilant, that are either approved or being evaluated in clinical trials for endocrine disorders and are also being evaluated in clinical trials for their potential to reverse oncology resistance. 
 Korlym (mifepristone) is a steroidal GR antagonist approved by the FDA in 2012 for the treatment of patients with Cushing’s syndrome, a disease characterized by elevated levels of the glucocorticoid cortisol. Mifepristone has been broadly used preclinically as a pharmacologic inhibitor of GR to examine the impact of modulation of GR on response to anti-cancer agents. Mifepristone has also been studied in multiple clinical trials across a variety of solid tumors and therapeutic regimens. Clinical trials of mifepristone were initiated in mCRPC, where the standard of care is AR antagonism, but mifepristone has since been shown to be a potent AR agonist and is therefore not expected to be a suitable treatment for mCRPC. Its potential as a combination therapy in oncology is further limited by its significant interactions with cytochrome P450 (CYP), most notably with CYP2C8, which is a key metabolic pathway for both taxanes (a major chemotherapeutic class used across multiple solid tumors) and Xtandi, and thus creates the potential for drug-drug interactions. 
 Relacorilant, currently in a Phase 3 trial for Cushing’s syndrome, is a non-steroidal GR antagonist that lacks the AR agonism of mifepristone. However, it retains many of the CYP liabilities of mifepristone, making combination development in oncology challenging. Despite these drawbacks, it is being developed in multiple oncology indications and has shown promising initial signs of durable clinical benefit in combination with nab-paclitaxel in metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer and other advanced or metastatic solid tumors. 
 ORIC-101 differentiation 
 ORIC-101 is a highly potent and selective steroidal GR antagonist, as shown by the single-digit nanomolar inhibition for receptor binding in the figure below. Like relacorilant, ORIC-101 is not an AR agonist. However, unlike relacorilant, due to our medicinal chemistry and structure-based drug discovery efforts, we observed ORIC-101 to have reduced CYP2C8 inhibition based on our preclinical studies. While certain ORIC-101 metabolites inhibit CYP2C8, they represent a fraction of the plasma exposure of the parent ORIC-101 compound. Thus, we believe ORIC-101 has the potential to enable potent GR inhibition but with less potential risk for drug-drug interaction with other combination agents, most notably taxanes and Xtandi.

ORIC–101 is a potent and selective GR antagonist designed for oncology 
 

Note: GR: glucocorticoid receptor; AR: androgen receptor; PR: progesterone receptor. GR antagonism, AR antagonism and PR antagonism measured by luciferase assay. 
 The above table demonstrates the results of a series of preclinical in vitro experiments that we conducted evaluating ORIC-101, mifepristone and relacorilant across a variety of properties that we believe to be important in developing a potent and selective GR antagonist. The determination of more favorable or less favorable relates to the ideal properties of a GR antagonist for a combination therapy in oncology. 
 In these experiments, we employed luciferase reporter assays to measure antagonist and agonist activities of the molecules on GR, AR and PR. These assays are commonly used in in vitro experiments to measure the potency of molecules for nuclear hormone receptor targets such as GR, AR and PR (among other receptors). These assays have been well characterized in peer-reviewed scientific publications and are widely utilized in the scientific community. 
 The endpoints of these preclinical in vitro experiments were the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50). The IC50 value represents the concentration of molecule needed to inhibit activity by 50% (i.e., a lower IC50 represents more potent inhibition). Cells were treated in the studies for 20 hours. Each molecule was compared against the other molecules. 
 In these preclinical in vitro experiments, mifepristone was shown to be a potent AR agonist, while ORIC-101 and relacorilant were not. AR agonism is commonly accepted to be an undesirable feature of a potential cancer treatment as this activity has been shown to stimulate the growth of prostate cancer. Since ORIC-101 is not an AR agonist, it was shown that mifepristone is less favorable than ORIC-101 with respect to this criterion. 
 In these experiments, relacorilant was shown to not be a PR antagonist, while mifepristone and ORIC-101 were shown to be PR antagonists. Since PR antagonism is not a required feature of a GR antagonist, it was shown that relacorilant is more favorable than ORIC-101 with respect to this criterion. 
 In addition, we used a common in vitro experiment that is accepted by Health Authorities to evaluate potential drug interaction liability mediated by CYP inhibition. Preclinical in vitro experiments were used to determine direct inhibition of major cytochrome P450 (CYP) activity including CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 by ORIC-101 in human liver microsomes. The endpoint of this preclinical in vitro experiment was IC50. The IC50 value represents the drug concentration needed to inhibit the activity of a specific CYP isoform to metabolize its corresponding probe substrate by 50% (i.e., a lower IC50 represents more potent inhibition). The incubation was carried out for five minutes, which was within the linear range of metabolite formation of the probe substrates. 
 In these preclinical in vitro experiments to show CYP inhibition, ORIC-101 directly inhibited CYP3A4/5 with IC50 value of 1.6 µM. IC50 inhibition against CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 could not be determined via mathematical analysis as they were higher than 3 µM and >10 µM, respectively. In contrast, mifepristone directly inhibited CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5, with IC50 values of 1.5, 4.9 and 9.5 µM, respectively; whereas, relacorilant directly inhibited CYP2C8, CYP2C9 and CYP3A4/5, with IC50 values of 0.21, 2 and 1.3 µM, respectively. These data suggest that in vitro, while ORIC-101 inhibits CYP3A4/5, ORIC-101 exhibited improved properties against CYP2C8 and CYP2C9 compared with mifepristone and relacorilant.

Our current opportunities for ORIC-101 
 Resistance to hormone therapy in prostate cancer
 We have chosen GR antagonism in prostate cancer as our initial therapeutic focus due to the well-documented biology of GR signaling as the principal driver of resistance to Xtandi in patients with prostate cancer, as published in Cell by our co-founder Dr. Sawyers. His work demonstrated that GR signaling is a bypass mechanism to anti-androgen therapy, with GR taking over for AR signaling, and that increased expression of GR in prostate cancer is correlated with resistance to Xtandi. We have demonstrated in preclinical prostate cancer models that GR antagonism can limit bypass resistance to Xtandi. Based on these data, we believe that ORIC-101, in combination with current standard-of-care agents such as Xtandi, has the potential to significantly improve clinical outcomes. 
 Prostate cancer overview 
 In the United States, prostate cancer is the second most prevalent cancer in men and the second leading cause of cancer death in men. The American Cancer Society estimated that in 2021 there would be approximately 250,000 new cases of prostate cancer and over 30,000 deaths from the disease in the United States by year end. Further, according to another study, over 50,000 new cases of metastatic prostate cancer were expected in 2020, which includes patients with both hormone-sensitive prostate cancer and mCRPC. 
 Treatment options for prostate cancer depend on many different factors, including the stage of the cancer. The disease is considered metastatic once the cancer has spread outside of the prostate gland to other parts of the body, such as the bones, lymph nodes, bladder and rectum. Tumors are considered hormone- (or castration-) sensitive if they still respond to medical or surgical treatment to lower testosterone levels. Tumors are considered castration-resistant if they progress despite androgen deprivation therapy (ADT), which is often correlated with rising levels of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). 
 In making treatment evaluations, physicians monitor disease burden in several ways, including changes in PSA levels. Increased PSA blood levels are considered by many physicians as indicative of cancer progression and alternative treatment options may be considered at that time. Current standard of care treatment for men with castration-resistant prostate cancer provides that patients should initially receive a combination of ADT and either Zytiga (abiraterone), which works by decreasing androgen levels, or Xtandi, which works by blocking androgen binding to AR. If the disease progresses despite these second-generation hormonal therapies, chemotherapy is typically the next treatment option. However, treatment with chemotherapy is generally postponed for as long as possible due to the potential for severe side effects including neuropathies, nausea, diarrhea, decreased mental capacity and increased risk of infections. 
 AR remains the principal driver of castration-resistant prostate cancer progression during the transition from localized to metastatic disease. While a majority of patients with prostate cancer will initially respond to either Zytiga, Xtandi or Erleada, the vast majority of these patients will ultimately become resistant, resulting in limited survival. Based on our preclinical data, we believe ORIC-101 may overcome a key resistance mechanism to these therapies and lead to meaningful clinical benefit for patients with prostate cancer.

An investigator analysis of Medivation’s Phase 3 clinical trial AFFIRM, in which patients with mCRPC who had previously received docetaxel were randomized to receive enzalutamide or a placebo, highlighted the potential role of GR in mediating enzalutamide resistance. A post-hoc analysis evaluated the impact of baseline corticosteroid use on clinical outcomes. Thirty percent of patients in this 1,199-patient trial were on corticosteroids at baseline. The results demonstrated that patients on baseline corticosteroids (i.e., GR agonism) had faster time to PSA progression and decreased overall survival when adjusted for other prognostic factors (e.g., age, performance status, prior therapy, disease burden, comorbidities).

 Preclinical data 
 Several mechanisms of resistance to AR antagonists have been identified that are based on abnormalities in AR and its signaling. Dr. Sawyers’ laboratory at MSKCC identified GR expression as a potential resistance mechanism bypassing AR altogether. As shown in the figure below, a retrospective analysis was conducted on tumor biopsies collected from mCRPC patients who were bifurcated into two groups: “good” responders to enzalutamide (experiencing clinical benefit for greater than six months) and “poor” responders to enzalutamide (experiencing clinical benefit for less than six months). GR expression levels were evaluated at baseline prior to the start of and after eight weeks of enzalutamide therapy. This analysis demonstrated a correlation between overexpression of GR and poor clinical outcomes. Patients with a “poor” response to enzalutamide demonstrated relatively higher GR expression levels at baseline as compared to “good” responders. Furthermore, “poor” responders demonstrated significantly higher GR expression levels after eight weeks on enzalutamide as compared to both: (1) the GR expression levels of “poor” responders at baseline, and (2) the GR expression levels of “good” responders after eight weeks on enzalutamide. These findings suggest that AR-inhibition by enzalutamide induced GR overexpression and that the levels of this GR overexpression were more pronounced in patients with poor clinical outcomes.

 Note: Patients who continued to benefit from enzalutamide for greater than six months were classified as “good” responders. Patients who discontinued enzalutamide earlier than six months due to a lack of clinical benefit were classified as “poor” responders. Matched tumor samples include those obtained from the same patient at baseline and after eight weeks of treatment. 
 This same observation was confirmed if “good” versus “poor” response was defined by a maximal PSA decline of greater than 50% versus less than 50%. Again, as shown in the figure below, GR expression in tumors was significantly higher in “poor” responders after eight weeks on enzalutamide as compared to “good” responders.

Furthermore, in the LNCaP xenograft model with exogenous AR overexpression (LNCaP AR), acquired resistance to enzalutamide and apalutamide correlated with the upregulation of GR expression, which is shown below.

 Similarly, as demonstrated in the figure on the left below, our in vitro studies demonstrate that inhibition of AR leads to upregulation of GR expression. In addition, as demonstrated in the figure on the right below, our in vitro studies of GR-expressing VCaP cells showed that the GR agonist dexamethasone conferred enzalutamide resistance, while the addition of a GR antagonist to counteract the dexamethasone reversed this effect.

Mechanistically, published data suggest that AR and GR drive a partially overlapping transcriptional program. Thus, GR activation can circumvent enzalutamide-mediated AR inhibition and sustain prostate cancer cell growth. But inhibiting GR activation is only effective in the presence of sustained AR inhibition. When AR expression levels rise, and the cancer cell is able to revert to AR mediated signaling, GR expression levels fall to baseline. These findings suggest that combined inhibition of both GR and AR could prolong the duration of response with next-generation AR antagonists such as enzalutamide or apalutamide.

AR and GR have overlapping gene signatures

 Note: Venn diagram of AR and GR signature gene lists. AR and GR signatures were defined as all genes showing >1.6 (or <1.6)-fold change (FDR < 0.05) after eight hours of addition of dihydrotestosterone (1 nM) or dexamethasone (100 nM) to charcoal-stripped media, respectively.
 In addition to this GR-mediated resistance in prostate cancer to AR-modulators, such as enzalutamide, GR may play a similar role in mediating resistance to a new class of agents called AR degraders. As demonstrated in the figure below on the left, AR degrader treatment suppressed prostate cancer cell growth driven through AR. Further in vitro studies demonstrate that prostate cancer cells treated with an AR degrader had diminished activity when GR is activated through the presence of a GR ligand. This bypass escape mechanism can be reversed with the addition of ORIC-101 GR antagonist. In the graph on the right, PSA levels and other transcriptional markers that correspond to GR as a bypass mechanism of resistance for AR modulators and AR degraders were impacted and correspond to the effects on prostate cancer cell growth.

 Resistance to chemotherapy in solid tumors 
 Preclinical data over the past decade indicate that activation of GR confers resistance to a variety of chemotherapeutic agents across an array of solid tumors that include ovarian, TNBC, prostate, pancreatic, small and non-small cell lung and urological cancers. In those settings, activation of GR signaling leads to decreased response to antimetabolites, taxanes and platinum agents, thus acting as a therapeutic resistance mechanism. At the molecular level, GR signaling drives transcriptional activation of anti-apoptotic genes such as serum and glucocorticoid inducible protein kinase-1 (SGK1), baculoviral IAP repeat containing 3 (BIRC3), and mitogen-activated protein kinase phosphatase-1 (MKP1/DUSP1), which in part mediate cell survival. In addition, GR activation has been demonstrated to regulate transcription of proteins that mediate cell adhesion and invasion. In that regard, GR-driven upregulation of integrins, the extracellular matrix protein Fibronectin-1 and the transmembrane glycoprotein Mucin-1, have been associated with pro-adhesion and protection from chemotherapy. Most recently, it has been shown that the master regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), SNAI2, is a direct GR target, as well as a partial GR-induced chemoprotector.

 Preclinical data 
 ORIC-101, as shown in the figure below, demonstrated activity in combination with chemotherapy in vitro using a colony formation assay. Ovarian, NSCLC and TNBC cell lines were used to assess how inhibition of GR activity by ORIC-101 affects dexamethasone-mediated chemoprotection. Based on the relative potencies of cortisol and dexamethasone, and the range of average unbound cortisol concentration in patients, a dexamethasone concentration of 30 nM was selected to simulate the expected level of GR activation at the average circulating cortisol level (approximately 375 nM) occurring in adult patients with cancer. The experiment demonstrated that co-administration of ORIC-101 reversed dexamethasone-mediated, GR-driven chemoprotection in GR positive cell lines.

 The effect of ORIC-101 on the response to the chemotherapeutic compound paclitaxel was evaluated in vivo in the HCC1806 TNBC xenograft mouse model. The efficacy of paclitaxel was significantly diminished in tumors grown under conditions simulating human cortisol levels sufficient to drive GR activation. Treatment with ORIC-101 was effective in reversing the effects of cortisol on paclitaxel efficacy, as shown in the figure below. Paclitaxel + cortisol + ORIC-101 treatment resulted in 88.7% tumor growth inhibition relative to paclitaxel + cortisol. At Day 68, palpable tumors were present in 93.3% of mice treated with cortisol + paclitaxel and only in 6.7% of mice treated with cortisol + paclitaxel + ORIC-101.

Data is displayed as mean ± SEM. Cortisol supplementation required to activate human GR since primary glucocorticoid utilized by rodents is corticosterone.

Comparable activity has been demonstrated in xenograft models of ovarian cancer, TNBC and in combination with other classes of chemotherapy. 
 
Clinical development plan for ORIC-101 
 As shown in the figure below, following our preclinical studies that demonstrated that GR signaling is a bypass resistance mechanism to anti-androgen modulators in prostate cancer, as well as a resistance mechanism to chemotherapeutics in a variety of solid tumors, we completed two Phase 1a trials of ORIC-101 as a single agent in over 50 healthy volunteers, and in 2019, we initiated two separate Phase 1b trials of ORIC-101 in combination with: (1) enzalutamide in metastatic prostate cancer and (2) nab-paclitaxel in advanced or metastatic solid tumors. 
 

Phase 1a healthy volunteer trials 
 We have conducted two healthy volunteer trials with ORIC-101. Study ORIC-GR-17001 was a single-ascending dose trial that evaluated preliminary safety and PK of ORIC-101, and study ORIC-GR-17002 was a multiple-ascending dose trial that evaluated the safety, PK and PD of ORIC-101 as well as of alternative formulations of ORIC-101.

Our Phase 1a trials are summarized in the table below. 
 

(1) 26 dosing events with 20 unique individual participants. Participants in fed portion were previously dosed in fasted portion (five with Lipid 2, one with Lipid 1). 
 
Study 17001 
 In study ORIC-GR-17001, ORIC-101 was administered in a fed state via oral suspension as four single ascending doses of 120, 240, 480 and 800 mg, in cohorts of six subjects each. Overall, there was dose-proportional increase in the Cmax and area under the curve (AUC) of ORIC-101 in plasma. The trial was conducted at a single site in the United States. 
Study 17002 
 Study ORIC-GR-17002 explored alternate formulations of ORIC-101 with a preliminary assessment of food effect (Part A) along with a multiple-ascending dose portion (Part B). The trial was conducted at a single site in the United Kingdom. In Part A, a prototype spray-dried dispersion (SDD) powder in an oral suspension was evaluated along with two lipid capsule formulations. The oral SDD suspension and both lipid capsule formulations provided similar exposure to ORIC-101. There was also a modest food effect observed. 
 In Part B, ORIC-101 Lipid B capsules were administered once daily for 10 consecutive days at a dose of 200 mg/day or 350 mg/day, under fed conditions. Six subjects were treated at each dose level. The exposure to ORIC-101, in terms of Cmax and AUC in plasma, increased in a dose-dependent manner with approximately 2-fold accumulation. The half-life of 14-15 hours supported once daily dosing, which is shown in the figure below. 
 Exposure of ORIC-101 from Phase 1a multiple-ascending dose study supports once-daily dosing 
 

Cortisol levels can be used as a pharmacodynamic indicator of GR inhibition. Following 10 days of administration of ORIC-101 at the doses of 200 mg/day and 350 mg/day, mean plasma cortisol concentrations upon waking increased over time, to a maximum on Day 8 at the dose of 200 mg/day (approximately 44% higher than Day 1) and Day 10 at the dose of 350 mg/day (approximately 78% higher than Day 1), and then subsequently decreased in both regimens, which is shown in the figure below.

Changing endogenous levels of cortisol demonstrated biological activity of ORIC 101 in Phase 1a 
 

Finally, as another PD measure of GR inhibition, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected and analyzed for expression of genes known to be targets of GR signaling. In this analysis, ORIC-101 was associated with decreased expression of these key PD biomarkers of GR activity, with the decrease occurring within the first day of ORIC-101 exposure and persisting for the entire duration of 10 days of dosing, as shown in the figure below. 
 ORIC-101 was associated with downregulation of key pharmacodynamic biomarkers of GR activity in Phase 1a 
 

Note: ORIC-101 was dosed once daily for 10 days. PBMC: peripheral blood mononuclear cell; FKBP5: FK506 binding protein; DDIT4: DNA-damage-inducible transcript 4 protein. 
 Safety 
 Overall, 56 subjects received at least a single dose of ORIC-101 across both healthy volunteer trials. A total of 12 subjects received 10 daily doses of ORIC-101 at either 200 mg/day (n=6) or 350 mg/day (n=6). All observed adverse events (AEs) were Grade 1 in severity, reversible, and no AE required study subject discontinuation. 
 In study ORIC-GR-17001, a single administration of ORIC-101 oral suspension at a dose of 120, 240, 480 or 800 mg was well-tolerated with only two Grade 1 AEs reported: pain in the extremity and nausea, one participant in the 480 mg and 800 mg dose, respectively. Both were mild, attributed to ORIC-101 and resolved without treatment. 
 In study ORIC-GR-17002, Part A, a single administration of ORIC-101 in oral SDD suspension or lipid capsules at the dose of 50 mg or 200 mg was well-tolerated. The most commonly reported treatment-emergent AEs attributed to ORIC-101 were mild gastrointestinal AEs. These were observed in 2 participants and consisted of Grade 1 nausea in one subject and Grade 1 nausea, abdominal pain, and diarrhea in a second subject. They resolved without treatment. 
 22

In study ORIC-GR-17002, Part B, multiple doses of ORIC-101 Lipid B were administered in a fed state in two cohorts of six healthy human volunteers at doses of 200 mg and 350 mg once daily for 10 days and no serious AEs were observed at either dose level. Treatment-emergent AEs occurred in two and five participants at each dose level, respectively, and were all Grade 1 and reversible. The most common AEs (reported in one of six participants at 200 mg and five of six participants at 350 mg) were gastrointestinal in nature and were deemed related to ORIC-101. These events are generally consistent with known tolerability issues with the caprylic acid formulation and could also be attributable (at least in part) to pill burden at the higher ORIC-101 dose of 350 mg (7 x 50 mg capsules). In addition, there were no clinically significant post-dose changes in electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs, or safety laboratory results.

Phase 1b trial of ORIC-101 in combination with enzalutamide for metastatic prostate cancer 
 In the fourth quarter of 2019, we initiated study ORIC-101-02, an open-label, single arm, multicenter, dose escalation followed by dose expansion trial of ORIC-101 in combination with enzalutamide in patients with metastatic prostate cancer progressing on enzalutamide. The purpose of this trial is to assess safety, PK, PD and preliminary antitumor activity of ORIC-101 in combination with enzalutamide as well as establish its recommended Phase 2 dose. Once patients are deemed eligible, they receive treatment with ORIC-101 in addition to continuing their current enzalutamide therapy without any washout period. 
 As of March 27, 2020, two patients completed Cycle 1 (28 days) without DLT events and were in Cycle 2 and Cycle 3, respectively; one additional patient was ongoing in Cycle 1, completing enrollment in Dose Level 1, in which patients receive 80 mg ORIC-101 in combination with 160 mg enzalutamide on a continuous daily dosing regimen. 
 Subsequent to March 27, 2020, the DLT evaluation period for all patients in Dose Level 1 was completed with no DLTs observed. After review of safety and PK data from Dose Level 1 by the study’s SRC, enrollment and evaluation for DLT was completed for Dose Level 2 (160 mg ORIC-101 in combination with 160 mg enzalutamide on a continuous daily dosing regimen) with no DLTs observed. After review of safety and PK data by the SRC, enrollment and evaluation for DLT was completed for Dose Level 3 (240 mg ORIC-101 in combination with 160 mg enzalutamide on a continuous daily dosing regimen) with no DLTs observed.  
 23

In January 2021, we completed the Part I dose escalation portion of ORIC-101 in combination with enzalutamide in metastatic prostate cancer, selected the RP2D, and initiated the dose expansion portion of the trial. For the Part II dose expansion portion of the trial, up to 48 patients are expected to be enrolled and treated at the RP2D of 240 mg of ORIC-101 and 160 mg of enzalutamide on a continuous daily dosing schedule. Patients will be enrolled independent of GR status, with retrospective analysis of GR expression and other potentially predictive biomarkers. We expect to report interim safety, efficacy, and translational data from this trial in the second half of 2021.

Phase 1b trial of ORIC-101 in combination with nab-paclitaxel in advanced or metastatic solid tumors 
 In 2019, we initiated study ORIC-101-01, an open-label, single arm, multicenter, dose escalation followed by dose expansion trial of ORIC-101 in combination with nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced or metastatic solid tumors in the United States. The purpose of this trial is to assess safety, PK, PD and preliminary anti-tumor activity of ORIC-101 in combination with nab-paclitaxel as well as establish a recommended Phase 2 dose.

As of March 27, 2020, 11 patients had enrolled in this study across four dosing cohorts. In the initial cohort, Dose Level 1, patients received 240 mg ORIC-101 administered on Days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19 in combination with 100 mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel on Days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle. Three patients with advanced pancreatic cancer were enrolled at this dose level. During the first cycle of treatment, two patients experienced DLTs. Specifically, one patient experienced Grade 3 fatigue and discontinued treatment after two weeks on study. A second patient with advanced pancreatic cancer that had metastasized to the liver experienced Grade 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia and Grade 5 hepatic failure in the setting of rapid disease progression. A CT scan of the abdomen on study Day 9 demonstrated disease progression, and the patient died on study Day 12. These toxicities are well-described for nab-paclitaxel (including reports of hepatic necrosis and hepatic encephalopathy leading to death), which is metabolized primarily via the liver.
 24

After review of safety and PK data from Dose Level 1 by the study’s SRC, it was determined that Dose Level 1 exceeded the maximum tolerated doses of the combination of ORIC-101 and nab-paclitaxel. The SRC further recommended restarting the dose escalation at lower doses of ORIC-101 and nab-paclitaxel (80 mg and 75 mg/m2, respectively) but did not require the addition of prophylactic growth factor (G-CSF) for potential nab-paclitaxel-induced neutropenia. The protocol was amended and following FDA review and Institutional Review Board (IRB) approvals, three new patients were enrolled to the revised new Dose Level 1A: one patient with endometrial cancer, one patient with colorectal cancer, and one patient with a poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung. All patients completed the DLT evaluation period without DLT events. 
 Three additional patients were enrolled at Dose Level 2A (160 mg ORIC-101 and 75 mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel) and have completed the DLT evaluation period without DLT events: one patient with gastric cancer, one patient with a large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung, and one patient with testicular cancer. 
 The table below notes adverse events in Cohort 1A and 2A as of February 24, 2020. Adverse events were mostly Grade 1 or 2 in severity and reversible, with no Grade ³ 4 treatment-related AEs.

Note: Severity grade as per the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) V.5.0; G = grade. 
 The status of GR expression in tumor was assessable for two patients in Dose Level 1A based upon baseline tumor biopsy. The patient with endometrial cancer showed significant GR staining of her tumor, while there was little tumor staining of the patient with colorectal cancer. A baseline tumor biopsy could not be obtained in the third patient. 
 The patient with endometrial cancer had previously received a five-month course of paclitaxel and carboplatin to which her best response was stable disease. She subsequently received two sequential experimental agents but had disease progression on each of them. The patient then received nab-paclitaxel and ORIC-101 starting two months after her last experimental agent and eight months after her last exposure to taxane-platinum chemotherapy. This patient experienced a 33% reduction in tumor burden (per the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] v1.1) after Cycle 2 (eight weeks on study) as shown in the figure below. The tumor marker, CA-125, had also declined from 686 U/mL at baseline down to 525 U/mL. The patient experienced only Grade 1 and 2 AEs, all of which were reversible. 
 First on-study tumor scans for patient with endometrial cancer 
 

In patients with endometrial cancer, there are reports of successful retreatment with a taxane-platinum doublet but only in patients who previously received a taxane-platinum doublet in the adjuvant setting or in patients who had at least a six month treatment-free interval between first- and second-line treatment in the metastatic setting. Furthermore, published data are based upon taxane-platinum doublet rather than single-agent taxane retreatment. Thus, in this patient who did not respond to her initial taxane-platinum treatment in the first-line metastatic setting and who had only a four-month treatment-free interval, there would be little to no expectation of tumor regression with single-agent taxane therapy. 
 25

A baseline tumor sample from this patient showed a high level of staining for GR by immunohistochemistry (H-score 150), which declined in a follow-up biopsy after treatment with ORIC-101 and nab-paclitaxel (H-score 65), with particular reduction in the percentage of cells that stained 3+ and 2+ for GR, as shown below, indicating elimination of highly GR+ tumor cells.
 
 
 | | Staining Intensity (%)*
-----------------+---------------+------------------------
Timepoint | Tumor H-score | 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 
PRE-DOSE | 150 | 20 | 20 | 50 | 10
END OF TREATMENT | 65 | 40 | 55 | 5 | 0 

 
In conjunction with this decline in GR tumor expression levels upon treatment, there was also evidence of GR-pathway inhibition. As part of the study, PBMCs were collected at various timepoints to assess the expression level of three genes indicative of GR-pathway signaling activity: PER1, GILZ, and FKBP5. With GR inhibition, it would be expected that expression of one or more of these genes would decrease, although the specific pattern may vary by tumor and between patients. In this patient, during ORIC-101 treatment, there was a marked decrease in expression of PER1 compared to baseline, as well as a decrease in expression of GILZ, as shown in the figures below. 
 

Collectively, these translational studies suggest that this patient with GR-positive endometrial cancer, who experienced tumor regression on ORIC-101 and nab-paclitaxel after prior taxane exposure, had a measurable reduction in GR-positive cells in the tumor on treatment with concurrent evidence of in vivo GR inhibition. A follow-up radiographic assessment four weeks after the initial eight-week assessment revealed further regression of the target lesions (38% reduction from baseline) along with stable non-target lesions; however, the appearance of new lesions led to an overall determination of disease progression as per RECIST v1.1. The patient subsequently came off study treatment due to disease progression. 
 Of the remaining two patients in Dose Level 1A, one patient (with colorectal cancer that showed no evidence of GR-positive staining at baseline) came off treatment for disease progression after seven weeks. The other patient (with poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma of the lung and unknown GR status) came off treatment for disease progression after 10 weeks. 
 Two patients in Dose Level 2A were ongoing (patient with gastric cancer in Cycle 3, and patient with large cell lung cancer in Cycle 2); the third patient (with testicular cancer) came off treatment for disease progression at the end of Cycle 1. As of March 27, 2020, two new patients had been enrolled in Dose Level 3A: 240 mg ORIC-101 and 75 mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel. 
 As of October 12, 2020, enrollment was completed for Dose Levels 2A and 3A, which evaluated ORIC-101 at 160 mg or 240 mg, respectively, once daily on an intermittent dosing schedule, with 75 mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel. No DLTs were observed in either Dose Levels 2A or 3A. As planned per protocol, exploration of ORIC-101, administered on a 21-day continuous daily dosing regimen with 75 mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel, was completed, with ORIC-101 at 160 mg combined with 75 mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel and no DLTs were observed. 
 In December 2020, we completed the Part I dose escalation portion of ORIC-101 in combination with nab-paclitaxel in solid tumors, selected the RP2D, and initiated the dose expansion portion of the trial. For the Part II dose expansion portion of the trial, up to 132 patients are expected to be enrolled across four cohorts, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, ovarian cancer, triple negative breast cancer, and other advanced solid tumors. Patients in Part II of the trial will be treated at the RP2D of 160 mg of ORIC-101 continuous once daily dosing and 75 mg/m2 of nab-paclitaxel on days 1, 8, and 15 of a 28-day cycle, without requirement for prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Eligible patients must have previously progressed on a taxane-containing regimen and will be enrolled independent of baseline GR status, with retrospective analysis of GR expression and other potentially predictive biomarkers. We expect to report interim safety, efficacy, and translational data from this trial in the first half of 2021.

CD73 inhibitor program: ORIC-533 
 Background on adenosine and CD73 
 Adenosine, a purine nucleoside base, is an extracellular signaling molecule derived from adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Adenosine is a potent suppressor of immune function and accumulates in tissues at sites of inflammation and damage. Analogously, in the context of tumors, adenosine in the tumor microenvironment is implicated in local immunosuppression that leads to tumor growth. Extracellular ATP is metabolized to AMP by the enzyme CD39, and AMP is metabolized to adenosine by the enzyme CD73. Adenosine, via its interaction with adenosine receptors, functions to suppress immune function. Multiple cell types within the tumor milieu, including cancer cells, endothelial cells and immune cells, express CD73. 
 Rationale for targeting CD73 in oncology 
 Many cancers usurp the anti-inflammatory adenosine pathway to avoid detection by the immune system, thereby reducing the effectiveness of certain chemotherapy- and immunotherapy-based treatments. Accumulation of adenosine in the tumor microenvironment is implicated in local immune suppression that leads to tumor growth. As shown in the figure below, CD73 is an enzyme that controls the rate at which extracellular adenosine is produced, and its overexpression is associated with poor prognosis in several cancers, including TNBC, NSCLC, melanoma and prostate, among others. Several global pharmaceutical companies are developing anti-CD73 antibodies, but due to significant medicinal chemistry challenges, to our knowledge, only one orally bioavailable inhibitor of CD73 is in clinical development. With our resistance platform capabilities, our medicinal chemistry team created a differentiated compound that is both potent and orally bioavailable. 
 
CD73 has been linked to therapy resistance 
 

27

Preclinical data 
 ORIC-533 is an orally bioavailable small molecule that potently and selectively antagonizes CD73 enzymatic function (< 1nM) and fully inhibits CD73-mediated AMP to adenosine conversion both in human tumor cells and immune cells. Preclinical studies show that ORIC-533 restores CD8+ T-cell expansion and activation of adenosine-induced immunosuppression. Reversal of adenosine-induced intratumoral immunosuppression with ORIC-533 leads to significant anti-tumor responses in vivo. 
 

In the figure above on the left, an ORIC-533 analogue decreased adenosine production in a concentration-dependent manner in cultured human CD8+ T cells and human H1568 cancer cells. While an ORIC-533 analogue can completely block adenosine production by immune and tumor cells, an anti-CD73 antibody is unable to achieve the same degree of functional inhibition. In the figure above on the right, a single oral dose of our compound in mice achieved unbound plasma exposures that exceed the in vitro EC90 levels required for suppression of adenosine production for 24 hours. 
 Moreover, CD73 inhibition in vivo substantially reduced the adenosine/AMP ratio in EMT6 mouse tumors following sustained CD73 inhibitor treatment.

Evaluation of tumors at the end of study, on the right above, show the depletion of adenosine and corresponding increase in T cells in the tumor microenvironment. 
 28

When compared to other CD73 inhibitors in preclinical studies, ORIC-533 more potently suppressed adenosine production from AMP in both T cells and tumor cells, and at nM concentrations was able to rescue activation of CD8+ T cells exposed to a high AMP environment.

The above figure demonstrates the results of a series of preclinical experiments that we conducted evaluating ORIC-533, AB680, Calithera, and Eli Lilly compounds across a variety of properties that we believe to be important in developing a potent and efficacious CD73 inhibitor. In the figure and table on the left above, human PBMCs, H1568 NSCLC cells, and human CD8+ T cells were pre-treated with compounds for 15 minutes, followed by addition of 10 uM AMP/5 uM EHNA for 1 hour. Adenosine in supernatant was quantified by LC-MS/MS. The biochemical binding assay was carried out with purified CD73 protein and compounds assessed at a wide concentration range to calculate IC50. In the figure on the above right, human PBMC-derived CD8+ T cells were activated for 24 hours with tetrameric anti-CD3/CD28/CD2 antibodies in serum free media, labeled with CellTrace™ Violet and plated onto 96-well plates. Compounds at varying concentrations and 1millimolar AMP were added, and cells incubated for 72-96 hours. T cell proliferation was quantified by flow cytometry. TNFa cytokine production in cell supernatants was measured by Meso Scale Discovery immunoassay. 
 ORIC-533 continues to progress in IND enabling studies and we expect to file an IND with the FDA in the first half of 2021. Having conducted a preclinical collaboration with an academic key opinion leader that generated compelling single agent activity in patient derived model systems in an undisclosed tumor type, we plan to pursue a single agent clinical development path in this indication.
 PRC2 inhibitor program: ORIC-944
Background 
 The PRC2 is a histone methyltransferase consisting of three core subunits: EED, EZH2 or EZH1, and SUZ12 and plays a key role in gene regulation and transcriptional repression, in particular during embryonic development. The dysregulation of PRC2 can lead to tumorigenesis in a wide range of cancers including prostate cancer, breast cancer, and hematological malignancies. EED is responsible for histone binding and activation of the PRC2 complex. Allosteric inhibition of EED impacts the assembly, stabilization, and activation of PRC2. 
 29

Rationale for targeting allosteric inhibition of PRC2 through EED 
 The PRC2 complex has two druggable subunits, EZH2, whose enzymatic function is the target of first generation therapeutics, and EED, which next-generation therapeutics like ORIC-944 inhibit. Several companies are developing EZH2 inhibitors; however, the pharmacologic properties of these compounds result in high doses given more than once a day, that achieve only partial target inhibition in the clinic. Allosteric inhibition of PRC2 through EED is differentiated from targeting EZH2 and may be beneficial for a number of reasons. First, preclinical studies show that EED inhibition is active against mutants in EZH2 that confer innate resistance to EZH2 inhibitors. Second, in a similar fashion, acquired mutations in EZH2 are sensitive to EED inhibition. Third, cells treated with EZH2 inhibitors are also able to activate EHZ1 in a compensatory bypass mechanism of resistance, yet those cells are sensitive to EED inhibition.

 Preclinical Data 
 ORIC-944 is a potent and selective allosteric inhibitor of PRC2 with mechanism of action via binding the EED subunit. ORIC-944 when dosed orally once a day as a single agent significantly inhibited prostate tumor growth in an enzalutamide-resistant prostate cancer model as seen in the figure below. While cross-study comparisons of preclinical data have limitations and caveats, the ORIC-944 efficacy appears to be superior to EZH2 inhibitors in the same models.

 30

Additional preclinical studies with ORIC-944 as a monotherapy and in combination regimens are being explored. We have initiated IND enabling studies and plan to file an IND with the FDA in the second half of 2021, with initial clinical development as a single agent in treatment-resistant prostate cancer.
 Brain penetrant EGFR/HER2 exon 20 program: ORIC-114 
 Background 
 The ErbB receptor tyrosine kinase family is involved in key cellular functions, including cell growth and survival. EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations are observed across multiple solid tumors, including NSCLC, breast, gastrointestinal, bladder and other cancers. EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations are observed in approximately 2% of all patients with NSCLC and these patients have a worse prognosis than patients with NSCLC driven by other EGFR mutations. HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations are observed in approximately 1.5% of all patients with NSCLC. Outside of NSCLC, it is estimated that EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations are observed in 0.6% of patients. In total, these prevalence estimates suggest a target population in non-small cell lung cancer of over 7,500 patients in the US annually, plus an additional 8,500 patients across other cancers. 
 Rationale for brain penetrant inhibitor of EGFR/HER2 with high potency towards exon 20 mutations 
 Currently, there are no medicines approved by the FDA specifically to treat NSCLC, breast, gastrointestinal, bladder and other cancers associated with EGFR or HER2 exon 20 insertion mutations across any of the tumors in which they occur, and standard EGFR inhibitors and chemotherapy provide limited benefit for these patients. Furthermore, within NSCLC, approximately one-third of patients with exon 20 insertion mutations develop brain metastases, which contributes to poor prognosis. Several companies are developing EGFR exon 20 inhibitors; however, to our knowledge none have demonstrated significant brain exposure suitable for addressing brain metastases, an area of significant unmet medical need. 
 

(1) Robichaux et al Nat Med (2018). EGFR exon 20 insertion (n=9) and classical EGFR mutation (n=129)
 EGFR exon 20 insertions are associated with lower PFS with first and second generation EGFR TKIs, such as erlotinib, gefitinib and afatinib, compared to other EGFR mutations. 
 31

Preclinical data 
 ORIC-114 was designed as a brain penetrant, orally bioavailable, irreversible inhibitor designed to selectively target EGFR and HER2 with nanoMolar potency towards exon 20 insertion mutations. As shown in the figure below, in a kinase selectivity panel, the ErbB receptor tyrosine kinases were strong hits and there were no off-targets identified for ORIC-114, unlike the comparator clinical compounds. 
 

All kinome selectivity screens were conducted on a 468 kinase panel with 1 uM of either TAK-788, poziotinib, CLN-081, or ORIC-114 in a head-to-head assessment. The top 10% of hits are shown in red. Notably, ORIC-114 did not hit any of the 3F family of kinases with the potential for covalent Cys interaction in the active site. 
 ORIC-114 demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in various NSCLC EGFR exon 20 insertion mutation models. In the example below, in a model carrying variant NPH, ORIC-114 demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity when dosed orally once daily at 4 mg/kg, multiples lower than the TAK-788 in vivo dose.

ORIC-114 was designed for brain penetrance and demonstrated potent anti-tumor activity in an intracranial NSCLC EGFR exon 19 deletion mutation in vivo model, when dosed at 2.5 mg/kg QD PO, superior to TAK-788 which was dosed at 30 mg/kg QD PO. Efficacy was measured by quantification of the bioluminescence photon flux in mice carrying intracranial PC9-Luc tumors. 
 

We have initiated IND enabling studies and plan to file a CTA in South Korea in the second half of 2021.
 Other preclinical programs 
 In addition to our product candidates, we are leveraging our resistance platform in pursuit of multiple discovery research programs that focus on our expertise within hormone-dependent cancers, precision oncology and key tumor dependencies. These programs highlight our medicinal chemistry and structure-based design expertise, thus for the most part utilize a small molecule therapeutic approach to target oncogenic drivers in solid tumors like prostate, breast, and lung cancer that relapse with innate, acquired or bypass resistance. Our most advanced discovery research program is currently in lead optimization. 
 
 
• | Discovery Program A: a blocking antibody that is targeting a mechanism of innate resistance caused by a gene rearrangement found in a subset of many solid tumors.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Discovery Program B: a small molecule therapeutic intended to address a mechanism of innate resistance found in a subset of breast cancers, specifically those driven by a distinct DNA amplification. Breast cancer models with this amplification have a key tumor dependency on a particular enzymatic interaction and our therapeutic approach is to inhibit this enzyme.

 Our collaboration and license agreements 
 Voronoi license agreement 
 On October 19, 2020, we entered into the Voronoi License Agreement with Voronoi. The Voronoi License Agreement gives us access to Voronoi’s preclinical stage EGFR and HER2 exon 20 insertion mutation program, including a lead product candidate now designated as ORIC-114. Under the Voronoi License Agreement, Voronoi granted us an exclusive, sublicensable license under Voronoi’s rights to certain patent applications directed to certain small molecule compounds that bind to EGFR or HER2 with one or more exon 20 insertion mutations and certain related know-how, in each case, to develop and commercialize certain licensed compounds and licensed products incorporating any such compound worldwide other than in the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan (the ORIC Territory). Under the Voronoi License Agreement, we are wholly responsible for development and commercialization of licensed products in the ORIC Territory. In addition, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product in certain major markets in the ORIC Territory. 
 33

Our financial obligations under the Voronoi License Agreement included an upfront payment comprised of a $5.0 million cash payment and the issuance to Voronoi of 283,259 shares of our common stock issued pursuant to a stock issuance agreement (Stock Agreement) entered into between the parties on October 19, 2020. The number of shares issued pursuant to the Stock Agreement was based on a price of $28.24 per share, representing a premium of 25% to the 30-day trailing volume weighted average trading price of our common stock. The shares were issued in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act for transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. 
 We are also obligated to make milestone payments to Voronoi upon the achievement of certain events. Upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones with respect to the first licensed product, we are obligated to pay Voronoi up to a maximum of $111.0 million. Upon the achievement of certain commercial milestones with respect to the first licensed product, we are obligated to pay Voronoi up to a maximum of $225.0 million. If we pursue a second licensed product, we would pay Voronoi up to an additional $272.0 million in success-based milestones. In addition, we are obligated to pay Voronoi tiered mid-single-digit to low-double-digit royalties on annual net sales of licensed products in the ORIC Territory. 
 Unless earlier terminated, the Voronoi License Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of all royalty payment obligations. Following the expiration of the Voronoi License Agreement, we will retain our licenses under the intellectual property Voronoi licensed to us on a royalty-free basis. We and Voronoi may each terminate the Voronoi License Agreement if the other party materially breaches the terms of such agreement, subject to specified notice and cure provisions, or enters into bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. Voronoi may also terminate the agreement if we discontinue development of licensed products for a specified period of time. We also have the right to terminate the Voronoi License Agreement without cause by providing prior notice to Voronoi. 
 If Voronoi terminates the Voronoi License Agreement for cause, or we terminate the Voronoi License Agreement without cause, then we are obligated to grant a nonexclusive license to Voronoi under certain of our patents and know-how and to assign to Voronoi certain of our regulatory filings for licensed compounds and licensed products. 
 Mirati license agreement 
 On August 3, 2020, we entered into a license agreement (Mirati License Agreement) with Mirati. The Mirati License Agreement gives us access to Mirati’s preclinical stage allosteric PRC2 program, including a lead product candidate now designated as ORIC-944. Under the Mirati License Agreement, Mirati granted us a worldwide, exclusive, sublicensable, royalty-free license under Mirati’s rights to certain patents and patent applications directed to certain small molecule compounds that bind to and inhibit PRC2 and certain related know-how, in each case, to develop and commercialize certain licensed compounds and licensed products incorporating any such compound. Under the Mirati License Agreement, we are wholly responsible for development and commercialization of licensed products. In addition, we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one licensed product in certain major markets. For a limited period of time, we and Mirati are both prohibited from researching, developing or commercializing any other compound or product whose principal mechanism of action is to modulate or inhibit PRC2 by directly binding thereto. 
 Our financial obligations under the Mirati License Agreement are comprised of an upfront payment of 588,235 shares of our common stock issued pursuant to a stock issuance agreement (Stock Agreement) entered into between the parties on August 3, 2020. The number of shares issued pursuant to the Stock Agreement were based on a price of $34.00 per share, representing a premium of 10% to the 60-day trailing volume weighted average trading price of our common stock. The shares were issued in a private placement in reliance on Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering. During the eighteen-month period following the date of the Stock Agreement, Mirati is subject to certain transfer restrictions, and the parties agreed to negotiate and enter into a registration rights agreement, with respect to the shares. We are not obligated to pay Mirati milestones or royalties.
 Unless earlier terminated, the Mirati License Agreement will continue in effect on a country-by-country and licensed product-by-licensed product basis until the later of (a) the expiration of the last valid claim of a licensed patent covering such licensed product in such country or (b) ten years after the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country. Following the expiration of the Mirati License Agreement, we will retain our licenses under the intellectual property Mirati licensed to us on a royalty-free basis. We and Mirati may each terminate the Mirati License Agreement if the other party materially breaches the terms of such agreement, subject to specified notice and cure provisions, or enters into bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings. Mirati may terminate the agreement if we challenge any of the patent rights licensed to us by Mirati or we discontinue development of licensed products for a specified period of time. We also have the right to terminate the Mirati License Agreement without cause by providing prior notice to Mirati. 
 If Mirati terminates the Mirati License Agreement, or we terminate the Mirati License Agreement without cause, then we are obligated to assign to Mirati, or grant an exclusive license to Mirati with respect to, certain of our patents, know-how and regulatory filings directed to licensed compounds and licensed products.

Astellas collaboration and supply agreement 
 In September 2019, we entered into a clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement with Astellas to evaluate ORIC-101 in combination with enzalutamide for the treatment of patients with metastatic prostate cancer. Under the terms of the clinical trial collaboration and supply agreement, we are sponsoring and conducting the Phase 1b trial of ORIC-101 in combination with enzalutamide. Astellas, which jointly commercializes enzalutamide in the United States with Pfizer, is providing enzalutamide for the trial. We maintain global development and commercial rights to ORIC-101 and rights to develop ORIC-101 in combination with other agents. 
 Sales and marketing 
 We intend to retain significant development and commercial rights to our product candidates and, if marketing approval is obtained, to commercialize our product candidates on our own, or potentially with a partner, in the United States and other regions. We currently have no sales, marketing or commercial product distribution capabilities. We intend to build the necessary infrastructure and capabilities over time for the United States, and potentially other regions, following further advancement of our product candidates. Clinical data, the size of the addressable patient population, the size of the commercial infrastructure and manufacturing needs may all influence or alter our commercialization plans. 
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates for preclinical and clinical testing, as well as for commercial manufacture if any of our product candidates obtain marketing approval. We also rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties to package, label, store and distribute our investigational product candidates, as well as for our commercial products if marketing approval is obtained. We believe that this strategy allows us to maintain a more efficient infrastructure by eliminating the need for us to invest in our own manufacturing facilities, equipment and personnel while also enabling us to focus our expertise and resources on the development of our product candidates. 
 To date, we have obtained active pharmaceutical ingredients (API) and drug product for our product candidates from single-source third party contract manufacturers. We are in the process of developing our supply chain for each of our product candidates and intend to put in place framework agreements under which third-party contract manufacturers will generally provide us with necessary quantities of API and drug product on a project-by-project basis based on our development needs. 
 As we advance our product candidates through development, we will consider our lack of redundant supply for the API and drug product for each of our product candidates to protect against any potential supply disruptions. 
 We generally expect to rely on third parties for the manufacture of any companion diagnostics we may develop. 
 Intellectual property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including obtaining, maintaining and defending our patent rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications and obtaining issued patents, or in-licensing issued patents and patent applications, in the United States and in markets outside of the United States directed to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology and product candidates and continuing innovation to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the field of oncology. We also plan to rely on data exclusivity, market exclusivity and patent term extensions when available. Our commercial success will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, improvements and product candidates; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including any patents that we may own or license in the future; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties. 
 Our patent portfolio consists of issued patents and pending patent applications that we own or in-licensed related to ORIC-101, ORIC-533, ORIC-944, ORIC-114 and various other compounds and programs. As of December 31, 2020, the portfolio includes four issued United States patents, 22 pending United States patent applications, seven pending international patent applications filed under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT application), seven issued patents in various markets outside of the United States, and 75 pending patent applications in various markets outside of the United States. 
 As of December 31, 2020, our patent portfolio covering ORIC-101 included patents issued in the United States, Australia, Japan, and New Zealand, along with patent applications pending in the United States, Europe, Japan, China, and other markets outside of the United States.  The issued United States patents covering ORIC-101 as composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions and related methods of use are expected to expire in 2037, absent any patent term extensions for regulatory delay. Any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications related to ORIC-101 are expected to expire between 2037 and 2041, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 35

With respect to ORIC-533, as of December 31, 2020, we have patent applications pending in the United States, Europe, Japan, China and other markets outside of the United States covering ORIC-533 as composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions and related methods of use. Any patents that may issue from our pending patent applications related to ORIC-533 are expected to expire between 2039 and 2040, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
 With respect to ORIC-944, as of December 31, 2020, we have exclusively in-licensed from Mirati patent applications pending in the United States, Europe, China, Japan, and other markets outside of the United States covering ORIC-944 as composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions and related methods of use. Any patents that may issue from the pending patent applications related to ORIC-944 are expected to expire in 2039 absent any patent term adjustments or extensions. 
 With respect to ORIC-114, as of December 31, 2020, we have exclusively in-licensed from Voronoi in the ORIC Territory a pending PCT application and a patent application pending in Korea covering ORIC-114 as composition of matter, pharmaceutical compositions, and related methods of use. Any patents that may issue from the pending patent applications related to ORIC-114 are expected to expire in 2040, absent any patent term adjustments or extensions.
 As of December 31, 2020, our patent portfolio also included issued patents in the United States, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, and patent applications pending in the United States and Canada that are exclusively licensed to us by MSKCC. These licensed patents and patent applications are based on the academic work conducted in the laboratory of Dr. Sawyers at MSKCC and do not cover ORIC-101, any of our current product candidates, or any of our discovery and research programs. 
 We also possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of our product candidates, including related manufacturing processes and technology. 
 With respect to our product candidates and processes we intend to develop and commercialize in the normal course of business, we intend to pursue patent protection covering, when possible, compositions, methods of use, dosing and formulations. We may also pursue patent protection with respect to manufacturing and drug development processes and technologies. 
 Issued patents can provide protection for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In general, patents issued for applications filed in the United States can provide exclusionary rights for 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. In addition, in certain instances, the term of an issued U.S. patent that covers or claims an FDA approved product can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period, which is called patent term extension. The restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The term of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with the laws of the foreign jurisdiction, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. 
 The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of oncology has emerged in the United States. The relevant patent laws and their interpretation outside of the United States is also uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our technology or product candidates and could affect the value of such intellectual property. In particular, our ability to stop third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions and improvements. We cannot guarantee that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications we may file in the future, nor can we be sure that any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products, the methods of use or manufacture of those products. 
 Moreover, even our issued patents may not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. Patent and other intellectual property rights in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology space are evolving and involve many risks and uncertainties. For example, third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our product candidates and practicing our proprietary technology, and our issued patents may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or could limit the term of patent protection that otherwise may exist for our product candidates. In addition, the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that are outside the scope of the rights granted under any issued patents. For these reasons, we may face competition with respect to our product candidates. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any particular product candidate can be commercialized, any patent protection for such product may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing the commercial advantage the patent provides. 
 36

Competition 
 The pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our technology, the expertise of our executive and scientific team, research, clinical capabilities, development experience and scientific knowledge provide us with competitive advantages, we face increasing competition from many different sources, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions, governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize may compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of our competitors, either alone or with their collaborators, have significantly greater financial resources, established presence in the market, expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement and marketing approved products than we do. These competitors also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Additional mergers and acquisitions may result in even more resources being concentrated in our competitors. 
 Our commercial potential could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than products that we may develop. Our competitors also may obtain FDA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market or make our development more complicated. The key competitive factors affecting the success of all of our programs are likely to be efficacy, safety and convenience. 
 For ORIC-101, our small molecule GR antagonist, we are aware of several other clinical-stage GR antagonists being developed by Corcept Therapeutics. To our knowledge, there are no GR antagonists approved for the treatment of cancer and the most advanced such GR antagonist is in a Phase 3 clinical trial in combination with nab-pacitaxel in patients with metastatic pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. 
 For ORIC-533, our orally bioavailable small molecule CD73 inhibitor, we are aware of several companies developing antibodies against this target, including AstraZeneca, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Novartis in collaboration with Surface Oncology, Incyte Corporation, Corvus Pharmaceuticals, Innate Pharma, Tracon Pharmaceuticals in collaboration with I-Mab Biopharma, Gilead Sciences, Akeso and Symphogen. Other companies, such as Eli Lilly and Company, Arcus Biosciences, Calithera Biosciences and Merck through its acquisition of Peloton Therapeutics, have small-molecule programs against this target. To our knowledge, only Eli Lilly has an orally available, small molecule CD73 inhibitor in a clinical trial for patients with cancer. 
 For ORIC-944, we are aware of several companies developing inhibitors against PRC2 via EZH2 inhibition that are currently in clinical trials, including Epizyme, Constellation Pharmaceuticals, Daiichi Sankyo, Pfizer, Shanghai HaiHe Pharmaceutical and Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co. To our knowledge, only Novartis has an allosteric PRC2 inhibitor in a clinical trial for patients with cancer.
 For ORIC-114, we are aware of several companies developing inhibitors against exon 20 insertion mutations that are currently in clinical trials, including Takeda, Spectrum Pharmaceuticals, The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, Rain Therapeutics, Dizal Pharmaceuticals Co., Ltd., Cullinan Oncology and Black Diamond Therapeutics. 
 Government regulation
 Government authorities in the United States at the federal, state and local level and in other countries regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, approval, labeling, packaging, storage, record-keeping, promotion, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, marketing and export and import of drug and biological products. Generally, before a new drug can be marketed, considerable data demonstrating its quality, safety and efficacy must be obtained, organized into a format specific for each regulatory authority, submitted for review and approved by the regulatory authority. 
 37

U.S. drug development 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA). Drugs also are subject to other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or post-market may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions. These sanctions could include, among other actions, the FDA’s refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, a clinical hold, untitled or warning letters, product recalls or market withdrawals, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement and civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us. 
 Our product candidates are considered small molecule drugs and must be approved by the FDA through the NDA process before they may be legally marketed in the United States. The process generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of extensive preclinical studies in accordance with applicable regulations, including studies conducted in accordance with GLP;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each trial may be initiated;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with applicable IND regulations, good clinical practice (GCP) requirements and other clinical trial-related regulations to establish substantial evidence of the safety and efficacy of the investigational product for each proposed indication;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | a determination by the FDA within 60 days of its receipt of an NDA to accept the filing for review;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of a FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the drug will be produced to assess compliance with cGMP requirements to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the preclinical study and/or clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA filing;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS), and the potential requirement to conduct post-approval studies. The data required to support an NDA are generated in two distinct developmental stages: preclinical and clinical. The preclinical and clinical testing and approval process requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we cannot be certain that any approvals for any current and future product candidates will be granted on a timely basis, or at all.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Preclinical studies and IND 
 The preclinical developmental stage generally involves laboratory evaluations of drug chemistry, formulation and stability, as well as studies to evaluate toxicity in animals, which support subsequent clinical testing. The sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. An IND is a request for authorization from the FDA to administer an investigational product to humans, and must become effective before human clinical trials may begin. 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry and formulation, as well as in vitro and animal studies to assess the potential for adverse events and in some cases to establish a rationale for therapeutic use. The conduct of preclinical studies is subject to federal regulations and requirements, including GLP regulations for safety/toxicology studies. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical studies, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some long-term preclinical testing, such as animal tests of reproductive adverse events and carcinogenicity, may continue after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the trial on clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
 38

Clinical trials 
 The clinical stage of development involves the administration of the investigational product to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control, in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety and assess efficacy. Each protocol, and any subsequent amendments to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Furthermore, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an IRB for each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted to ensure that the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB must also approve the informed consent form that must be provided to each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative, and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. There also are requirements governing the reporting of ongoing clinical trials and completed clinical trial results to public registries. 
 A sponsor who wishes to conduct a clinical trial outside of the United States may, but need not, obtain FDA authorization to conduct the clinical trial under an IND. If a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor may submit data from the clinical trial to the FDA in support of an NDA. The FDA will generally accept a well-designed and well-conducted foreign clinical trial not conducted under an IND if the trial was conducted in accordance with the ethical principles contained in the Declaration of Helsinki pursuant to 21 CFR 312.120(c)(4), incorporating the 1989 version of the Declaration, or with the laws and regulations of the foreign regulatory authority where the trial was conducted, such as the EMA, whichever provides greater protection of the human subjects, and with GCP and GMP requirements, and the FDA is able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary, and the practice of medicine in the foreign country is consistent with the United States.
 Clinical trials in the United States generally are conducted in three sequential phases, known as Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3, and may overlap. 
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trials generally involve a small number of healthy volunteers or disease-affected patients who are initially exposed to a single dose and then multiple doses of the product candidate. The primary purpose of these clinical trials is to assess the metabolism, pharmacologic action, tolerability and safety of the drug.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trials involve studies in disease-affected patients to determine the dose and dosing schedule required to produce the desired benefits. At the same time, safety and further pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic information is collected, possible adverse effects and safety risks are identified, and a preliminary evaluation of efficacy is conducted.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trials generally involve a large number of patients at multiple sites and are designed to provide the data necessary to demonstrate the effectiveness of the product for its intended use, its safety in use and to establish the overall benefit/risk relationship of the product and provide an adequate basis for product approval. These trials may include comparisons with placebo and/or other comparator treatments. The duration of treatment is often extended to mimic the actual use of a product during marketing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, are conducted after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication. In certain instances, the FDA may mandate the performance of Phase 4 clinical trials as a condition of approval of an NDA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials, among other information, must be submitted at least annually to the FDA. Sponsor is also responsible for submitting written IND safety reports, including reports of serious and unexpected suspected adverse events, findings from other studies suggesting a significant risk to humans exposed to the drug, findings from animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically significant increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. Additionally, some clinical trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the clinical trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee. This group provides authorization for whether a trial may move forward at designated check-points based on access to certain data from the trial.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
39

 
• | Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal safety studies and also must develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the drug as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process, as performed by the manufacturing facility, must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of our product candidates. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that our product candidates do not undergo unacceptable deterioration over their labeled shelf life.

 NDA review process 
 Following completion of the clinical trials, data is analyzed to assess whether the investigational product is safe and effective for the proposed indicated use or uses. The results of preclinical studies and clinical trials are then submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA, along with proposed labeling, chemistry and manufacturing information to ensure product quality and other relevant data. In short, the NDA is a request for approval to market the drug in the United States for one or more specified indications and must contain proof of safety and efficacy for a drug. 
 The application must include both negative and ambiguous results of preclinical studies and clinical trials, as well as positive findings. Data may come from company-sponsored clinical trials intended to test the safety and efficacy of a product’s use or from a number of alternative sources, including studies initiated by investigators. To support marketing approval, the data submitted must be sufficient in quality and quantity to establish the safety and efficacy of the investigational product to the satisfaction of FDA. FDA approval of an NDA must be obtained before a drug may be legally marketed in the United States. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA), as amended, each NDA must be accompanied by a user fee. FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each marketed human drug. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Additionally, no user fees are assessed on NDAs for products designated as orphan drugs, unless the product also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 The FDA reviews all submitted NDAs before it accepts them for filing, and may request additional information rather than accepting the NDA for filing. The FDA must make a decision on accepting an NDA for filing within 60 days of receipt. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth review of the NDA. Under the goals and policies agreed to by the FDA under PDUFA, the FDA has 10 months, from the filing date, in which to complete its initial review of a new molecular-entity NDA and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date of a new molecular-entity NDA designated for priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority NDAs, and the review process is often extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA will conduct a pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facilities for the new product to determine whether they comply with cGMP requirements. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. The FDA also may audit data from clinical trials to ensure compliance with GCP requirements. Additionally, the FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products which present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions, if any. The FDA is not bound by recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations when making decisions on approval. The FDA likely will reanalyze the clinical trial data, which could result in extensive discussions between the FDA and the applicant during the review process. After the FDA evaluates an NDA, it will issue an approval letter or a Complete Response Letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. A Complete Response Letter indicates that the review cycle of the application is complete, and the application will not be approved in its present form. A Complete Response Letter usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA. The Complete Response Letter may require additional clinical data, additional pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial(s) and/or other significant and time-consuming requirements related to clinical trials, preclinical studies and/or manufacturing. If a Complete Response Letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the NDA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. Even if such data and information are submitted, the FDA may decide that the NDA does not satisfy the criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. 
 40

Orphan drugs 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making the product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. 
 Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. 
 If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years from the date of such approval, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by means of greater effectiveness, greater safety or providing a major contribution to patient care or in instances of drug supply issues. However, competitors may receive approval of either a different product for the same indication or the same product for a different indication but that could be used off-label in the orphan indication. Orphan drug exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval before we do for the same product, as defined by the FDA, for the same indication we are seeking approval, or if a product candidate is determined to be contained within the scope of the competitor’s product for the same indication. If one of our products designated as an orphan drug receives marketing approval for an indication broader than that which is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, requirements and benefits. 
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA has a fast track program that is intended to expedite or facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs are eligible for fast track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preclinical or clinical data demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast track designation applies to both the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor can request the FDA to designate the product for fast track status any time before receiving NDA approval, but ideally no later than the pre-NDA meeting with the FDA. 
 Any product submitted to the FDA for marketing, including under a fast track program, may be eligible for other types of FDA programs intended to expedite development and review, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product is eligible for priority review if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and, if approved, would provide a significant improvement in safety and effectiveness compared to available therapies. 
 A product may also be eligible for accelerated approval, if it treats a serious or life-threatening condition and generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies. In addition, it must demonstrate an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality (IMM), which is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well controlled post-marketing clinical trials. FDA may withdraw drug approval or require changes to the labeled indication of the drug if confirmatory post-market trials fail to verify clinical benefit or do not demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit to justify the risks associated with the drug. If the FDA concludes that a drug shown to be effective can be safely used only if distribution or use is restricted, it may require such post-marketing restrictions as it deems necessary to assure safe use of the product. 
 Additionally, a drug may be eligible for designation as a breakthrough therapy if the product is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs or biologics, to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the product may demonstrate substantial improvement over currently approved therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. The benefits of breakthrough therapy designation include the same benefits as fast track designation, plus intensive guidance from the FDA to ensure an efficient drug development program. Fast track designation, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation do not change the standards for approval, but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 41

Post-approval requirements 
 Following approval of a new product, the manufacturer and the approved product are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, monitoring and record-keeping requirements, requirements to report adverse events and comply with promotion and advertising requirements, which include restrictions on promoting drugs for unapproved uses or patient populations, known as “off-label promotion,” and limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Prescription drug promotional materials must be submitted to the FDA in conjunction with their first use. Further, if there are any modifications to the drug, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new NDA or NDA supplement, which may require the development of additional data or preclinical studies and clinical trials. 
 The FDA may also place other conditions on approvals including the requirement for REMS, to assure the safe use of the product. A REMS could include medication guides, physician communication plans or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. Any of these limitations on approval or marketing could restrict the commercial promotion, distribution, prescription or dispensing of products. Product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following initial marketing. 
 The FDA may withdraw approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information, imposition of post-market studies or clinical studies to assess new safety risks or imposition of distribution restrictions or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market, or product recalls;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters, or holds on post-approval clinical studies;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention;
--+------------------------------


• | refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+-------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 FDA regulation of companion diagnostics 
 A therapeutic product may rely upon an in vitro companion diagnostic for use in selecting the patients that will be more likely to respond to that therapy. If an in vitro diagnostic is essential to the safe and effective use of the therapeutic product and if the manufacturer wishes to market or distribute such diagnostic for use as a companion diagnostic, then the FDA will require separate approval or clearance of the diagnostic as a companion diagnostic to the therapeutic product. According to FDA guidance, an unapproved or uncleared companion diagnostic device used to make treatment decisions in clinical trials of a drug generally will be considered an investigational medical device unless it is employed for an intended use for which the device is already approved or cleared. If used to make critical treatment decisions, such as patient selection, the diagnostic device generally will be considered a significant risk device under the FDA’s Investigational Device Exemption, or IDE, regulations. The sponsor of the diagnostic device will be required to comply with the IDE regulations for clinical studies involving the investigational diagnostic device. According to the guidance, if a diagnostic device and a drug are to be studied together to support their respective approvals, both products can be studied in the same clinical trial, if the trial meets both the requirements of the IDE regulations and the IND regulations. The guidance provides that depending on the details of the clinical trial protocol, the investigational product(s), and subjects involved, a sponsor may seek to submit an IDE alone (e.g., if the drug has already been approved by FDA and is used consistent with its approved labeling), or both an IND and an IDE. 
 42

Pursuing FDA approval/clearance of an in vitro companion diagnostic would require either a pre-market notification, also called 510(k) clearance, or a pre-market approval, or PMA, or a de novo classification for that diagnostic. The review of companion diagnostics involves coordination of review with the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. 
 510(k) clearance process 
 To obtain 510(k) clearance, a pre-market notification is submitted to the FDA demonstrating that the proposed device is substantially equivalent to a previously cleared 510(k) device or a device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976 for which the FDA has not yet required the submission of a PMA application. The FDA’s 510(k) clearance process may take three to 12 months from the date the application is submitted and filed with the FDA, but may take longer if FDA requests additional information, among other reasons. In some cases, the FDA may require clinical data to support substantial equivalence. In reviewing a pre-market notification submission, the FDA may request additional information, which may significantly prolong the review process. Notwithstanding compliance with all these requirements, clearance is never assured. 
 After a device receives 510(k) clearance, any subsequent modification of the device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, will require a new 510(k) clearance or require a PMA. In addition, the FDA may make substantial changes to industry requirements, including which devices are eligible for 510(k) clearance, which may significantly affect the process. 
 De novo classification process 
 If a new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) pre-market notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a different route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification process. This process allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. The FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk and requires PMA or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed. 
 Obtaining FDA marketing authorization, de novo down-classification, or approval for medical devices is expensive and uncertain, and may take several years, and generally requires significant scientific and clinical data. 
 PMA process 
 The PMA process, including the gathering of clinical and nonclinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, can take several years or longer. The applicant must prepare and provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness, including information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. PMA applications are subject to an application fee. In addition, PMAs for medical devices must generally include the results from extensive preclinical and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to establish the safety and effectiveness of the device for each indication for which FDA approval is sought. In particular, for a diagnostic, the applicant must demonstrate that the diagnostic produces reproducible results. As part of the PMA review, the FDA will typically inspect the manufacturer’s facilities for compliance with the Quality System Regulation, or QSR, which imposes extensive testing, control, documentation, and other quality assurance and GMP requirements. 
 Other U.S. regulatory matters 
 Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors, customers, and others may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, which may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we research, as well as, sell, market, and distribute any products for which we obtain marketing approval. The applicable federal, state and foreign healthcare laws and regulations that may affect our ability to operate include, but are not limited to: 
  
• | the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which makes it illegal for any person, including a prescription drug or medical device manufacturer (or a party acting on its behalf), to knowingly and willfully solicit, receive, offer or pay any remuneration that is intended to induce or reward referrals, including the purchase, recommendation, order or prescription of a particular drug, for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid.

 Pricing and rebate programs must also comply with the Medicaid rebate requirements of the U.S. Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 and more recent requirements in the ACA. If products are made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule of the General Services Administration, additional laws and requirements apply. Manufacturing, sales, promotion and other activities also are potentially subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. In addition, the distribution of pharmaceutical and/or medical device products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical and/or medical device products. Products must meet applicable child-resistant packaging requirements under the U.S. Poison Prevention Packaging Act as well as other applicable consumer safety requirements. 
 The failure to comply with any of these laws or regulatory requirements subjects firms to possible legal or regulatory action. Depending on the circumstances, failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements can result in significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, including damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participation in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, integrity oversight and reporting obligations, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, requests for recall, seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, denial or withdrawal of product approvals or refusal to allow a firm to enter into supply contracts, including government contracts.

U.S. patent-term restoration and marketing exclusivity 
 Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of any future product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits restoration of the patent term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and FDA regulatory review process. Patent-term restoration, however, cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent-term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the submission date of an NDA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or the issue date of the patent, whichever is later, and the approval of that application, except that the review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA. 
 Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA also can delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the United States to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application (ANDA), or a 505(b)(2) NDA submitted by another company for a generic version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement with respect to one or more patents listed for the drug in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations publication. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for a NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness or generate such data themselves. 
 European Union and UK drug development 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies r marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside the U.S. have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. The approval process varies from country to country and the time may be longer or shorter that that required to obtain FDA approval. The requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary greatly from country to country and may require us to perform additional pre-clinical or clinical testing.
 European Union drug review and approval 
 Pharmaceutical products in the European Union are subject to regulation under comprehensive legislation enacted by the European Commission in the European Medicinal Products Directive (Directive 2001/83/EC), as amended. Centrally authorized products are also regulated by Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004. This legislation is binding on all Member States together with ancillary legislation governing research. In the UK, the main legislative texts relating to human medicines is the Medicines Act 1968 and the Human Medicines Regulation 2012.
 The European Union system for authorization of medicinal products for human use offers several routes: the centralized procedure, the decentralized procedure, and the mutual recognition procedure, as well as domestic national routes. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization that is valid for all 27 European Union Member States as well as the EEA countries of Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. The centralized procedure is mandatory for certain categories of investigational products, including human products containing a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, including cancer, AIDS, diabetes and neurodegenerative illness; orphan medicinal products; and medicinal products manufactured using biotechnological processes. Applications for marketing authorization for such medicines must be submitted to the EMA, in which the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) is generally responsible for conducting the initial assessment of a product. 
 45

The decentralized and mutual recognition procedures are applicable to the majority of conventional medicinal products and are both based on the principle of recognition of a marketing authorization by one or more Member States. The decentralized procedure is available for applicants who wish to market a product in various European Union Member States where such product has not received marketing approval in any European Union Member State before. In this procedure, an application for marketing authorization is submitted simultaneously in several Member States, one of them being chosen as the “Reference Member State.” At the end of the procedure, national marketing authorizations are granted in the Reference and in the concerned Member States. The mutual recognition procedure is compulsory when a medicinal product has already received a marketing authorization in one Member State and is to be marketed in a Member State other than that in which it was first authorized. Any national marketing authorization granted by a European Union Member State's national authority can be used to support an application for its mutual recognition by other Member States. Marketing authorization applications can also be submitted directly to the Member State's national competent authority under the national route (if the centralized route is not compulsory). 
 The UK is no longer a member of the EU, but EU law remains applicable in Northern Ireland. There are a number of new marketing authorization routes available in the UK, Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) or Northern Ireland, in addition to the national procedure, which are broadly categorized as either (1) national routes (i.e.  the innovative licensing and access procedure (ILAP), the national procedure, rolling review, EC Decision Procedure (ECDP), the MR/DC reliance procedure and unfettered access from Northern Ireland); or (2) international routes (i.e. Access Consortium to market a medicine in the UK, Australia, Canada, Singapore and/or Switzerland; or the Project Orbis program for cancer treatments). The application procedure will depend on the relevant procedure chosen.
 All granted centrally authorized marketing authorizations automatically became Great Britain (GB) marketing authorizations on 1 January 2021. Though there are several ways to obtain a marketing authorization for GB (and Northern Ireland) discussed above, the EDRCP is available for marketing authorizations approved under the centralized procedure. Under this procedure the UK's regulator, the MHRA, can rely on the decision of the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization under centralized procedure for a period of two years from January 1, 2021 when determining an application for a GB marketing authorization. Applicants submit a letter of intent to submit an EDRCP to the MHRA at least 4 weeks before the submission of the application for the EDRCP marketing authorization application.  The marketing authorization application is submitted after receipt of the positive opinion from the CHMP.
 The objective of the EMA is the comprehensive evaluation of benefit/risk profile of a new medicinal product going through the centralized procedure. This evaluation involves showing that the product has significant efficacy and safety, together with a satisfactory plan for risk management post-marketing. The CHMP is the EMA’s expert committee responsible for human medicinal products. The CHMP is responsible for conducting the initial review of centrally authorized marketing authorization applications and for assessing modifications or extensions (variations) to an existing marketing authorization. It also considers the recommendations of the Pharmacovigilance Risk Assessment Committee on the safety of medicines on the market and when necessary, recommends to the European Commission changes to a medicine’s marketing authorization, or its suspension or withdrawal from the market. The marketing authorization application is similar to the NDA in the United States. All application procedures require an application in the common technical document (CTD), which includes the submission of detailed information about the manufacturing and quality of the product, and non-clinical and clinical trial information. The main scientific principle used by the CHMP in the evaluation of medicinal products is the benefit/risk ratio based on quality, efficacy, safety, and risk management considerations. The CHMP assesses whether the data it reviews comply with the ICH-harmonized Good Practices published for GCP, GMP and good laboratory practice (GLP). The CHMP also considers whether studies concluding efficacy and safety of products have sufficient statistical power.
 Marketing authorizations for the UK are submitted to the MHRA.  As the Medicinal Products Directive is transposed into domestic law, the standards of clinical efficacy, safety, chemical control and manufacture as at 31 December 2020 (the end of the transition period for the UK’s exit from the EU) are retained.  As Northern Ireland continues to apply EU law, medicines regulation for Great Britain is likely to be closely aligned with the EU for some time.
 Two recent developments have been introduced which further expand the European regulatory framework: the Falsified Medicines Directive and the Pharmacovigilance Directive. The Falsified Medicines Directive obliges manufacturers of medicinal products to audit their suppliers of active substances to ensure compliance with GMP. It also introduces a new obligation on product manufacturers to inform the competent authority (e.g., ANSM) and the marketing authorization holder if they become aware that these products may be falsified, whether they are being distributed through the legitimate supply chain or by illegal means. The Pharmacovigilance Directive obliges marketing authorization holders to monitor the safety of authorized products and detect any change in their risk-benefit profile. A new pan-European clinical trial data information database has been created that will be complementary to the database established for pharmacovigilance (Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 with respect to centrally authorized medicinal products).  In addition, Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 520/2012 outlines the practical implications for marketing authorization holders, national competent authorities, and the EMA. Also, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 357/2014 on post-authorization efficacy studies specifies the situations in which such studies may be required. Post-authorization efficacy studies may be required where concerns relating to some aspects of efficacy of the medicinal product are identified and can 
 46

be resolved only after the medicinal product has been marketed, or where the understanding of the disease, the clinical methodology or the use of the medicinal product under real-life conditions indicate that previous efficacy evaluations might have to be revised significantly. Brexit will disrupt the operation of pre- and post-authorization clinical trial infrastructure. The rules around GMP and pharmacovigilance in the UK currently remain similar to the EU requirements.  However, the Falsified Medicines Directive will not apply in Great Britain though it is likely that the UK will implement a procedure to minimize the risk of falsified medicines.  
 Clinical trials in the European Union are regulated under European Council Directive 2001/20/EC (Clinical Trials Directive) on the implementation of GCP in the conduct of clinical trials of medicinal products for human use. The Clinical Trials Directive requires the sponsor of an investigational medicinal product to obtain a CTA, much like an IND in the United States, from the national competent authority of a European Union Member State in which the clinical trial is to be conducted. The application for CTA must satisfy detailed requirements for the protection of trial subjects including requirements relating to consent and specific rules for minors and adults unable to consent by reason of incapacity. The CTA application must be accompanied by an investigational medicinal product dossier with supporting information prescribed by the Council Directive and corresponding national laws of the Member States and further detailed in applicable guidance, including the European Commission Communication 2010/C 82/01. A clinical trial may only be commenced after an Ethics Committee has given its approval. 
 A sponsor of a clinical trial must also follow certain procedures, including obtaining a unique EudraCT number by entering specified relevant information in the EudraCT Community Clinical Trial System. In addition, Member States require that the manufacture and/or importation of investigational medicinal products be authorized. Sponsors of investigational medicinal products must ensure compliance with, among other things, GCP and good manufacturing practice (GMP) as well as requirements pertaining to safety reporting. 
 In April 2014, Regulation EU No 536/2014 (Clinical Trials Regulation) was adopted to replace the Clinical Trials Directive. The Clinical Trials Regulation is intended to simplify the current rules for clinical trial authorization and standards of performance. For instance, there will be a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point, a European Union portal and database. The implementation of the Clinical Trials Regulation depends on confirmation of full functionality of the Clinical Trials Information System (CTIS) through an independent audit, which commenced in September 2020. The system is currently planned to go live in December 2021. The new clinical trial portal and database will be maintained by the EMA in collaboration with the European Commission and the European Union Member States. The objectives of the new Regulation include consistent rules for conducting trials throughout the European Union, consistent data standards and adverse events listing, and consistent information on the authorization status. Additionally, information on the conduct and results of each clinical trial carried out in the European Union will be made publicly available.
 The main legislation that applies to clinical trials in the UK is the UK Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004, which transposes the Clinical Trials Directive into domestic law.  Consequently, the requirements and obligations that relate to the conduct of clinical trials in the UK currently remain largely aligned with the EU position.  A CTA will be required to conduct a clinical trial in the UK, together with Ethics Committee approval.  However, the sponsor of a clinical trial in the UK must be established in the UK or a country on an approved list currently limited to the EU Member States plus Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway) or appoint a legal representative who is established on one of the aforementioned countries. Clinical trials should also be registered on an established international register such as ISRCTN registry or ClinicalTrials.gov.  The UK also requires the manufacture and/or importation of investigational medicinal products to be authorised.  There is no mutual recognition agreement between the UK and EU on GMP, so medicines manufactured in the UK would be subject to GMP release in the EU. 
 Similar to the U.S. patent term-restoration, Supplementary Protection Certificates (SPCs) serve as an extension to a patent right in Europe for up to five years. SPCs apply to specific pharmaceutical products to offset the loss of patent protection due to the lengthy testing and clinical trials these products require prior to obtaining regulatory marketing approval.
 Coverage and reimbursement 
 Sales of our products will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. There is significant uncertainty related to third-party payor coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, for example, principal decisions about reimbursement for new products are typically made by CMS. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new product will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare, and private third-party payors often follow CMS’s decisions regarding coverage and reimbursement to a substantial degree. However, no uniform policy of coverage and reimbursement for drug products exists. Accordingly, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any of our products will be made on a payor-by-payor basis.

Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. Further, such payors are increasingly challenging the price, examining the medical necessity and reviewing the cost effectiveness of medical product candidates. There may be especially significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific product candidates on an approved list, known as a formulary, which might not include all FDA-approved drugs for a particular indication. We may need to conduct expensive pharmaco-economic studies to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost effectiveness of our products. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be obtained. 
 In addition, companion diagnostic tests require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biological products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biological products, will apply to companion diagnostics. 
 In addition, in most foreign countries, the proposed pricing for a drug must be approved before it may be lawfully marketed. The requirements governing drug pricing and reimbursement vary widely from country to country. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product or it may instead adopt a system of direct or indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. There can be no assurance that any country that has price controls or reimbursement limitations for pharmaceutical products will allow favorable reimbursement and pricing arrangements for any of our products. Historically, products launched in the European Union do not follow price structures of the United States and generally prices tend to be significantly lower. 
 Healthcare reform 
 The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA), established the Medicare Part D program to provide a voluntary prescription drug benefit to Medicare beneficiaries. Under Part D, Medicare beneficiaries may enroll in prescription drug plans offered by private entities that provide coverage of outpatient prescription drugs. Unlike Medicare Part A and B, Part D coverage is not standardized. While all Medicare drug plans must give at least a standard level of coverage set by Medicare, Part D prescription drug plan sponsors are not required to pay for all covered Part D drugs, and each drug plan can develop its own drug formulary that identifies which drugs it will cover and at what tier or level. However, Part D prescription drug formularies must include drugs within each therapeutic category and class of covered Part D drugs, though not necessarily all the drugs in each category or class. Any formulary used by a Part D prescription drug plan must be developed and reviewed by a pharmacy and therapeutic committee. Government payment for some of the costs of prescription drugs may increase demand for products for which we receive marketing approval. However, any negotiated prices for our products covered by a Part D prescription drug plan likely will be lower than the prices we might otherwise obtain. Moreover, while the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private third-party payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own payment rates. 
 The United States government, state legislatures and foreign governments have shown significant interest in implementing cost containment programs to limit the growth of government-paid healthcare costs, including price-controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products for branded prescription drugs. For example, the ACA substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both the government and private insurers, and continues to significantly impact the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA contains provisions that may reduce the profitability of drug products through increased rebates for drugs reimbursed by Medicaid programs, extension of Medicaid rebates to Medicaid managed care plans, mandatory discounts for certain Medicare Part D beneficiaries and annual fees based on pharmaceutical companies’ share of sales to federal health care programs. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to enter into and have in effect a national rebate agreement with the HHS Secretary as a condition for states to receive federal matching funds for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs furnished to Medicaid patients. The ACA made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price (AMP), to 23.1% of AMP and adding a new rebate calculation for “line extensions.” The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization and by enlarging the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. Additionally, for a drug product to receive federal reimbursement under the Medicaid or Medicare Part B programs or to be sold directly to U.S. government agencies, the manufacturer must extend discounts to entities eligible to participate in the 340B drug pricing program. The required 340B discount on a given product is calculated based on the AMP and Medicaid rebate amounts reported by the manufacturer.

Since its enactment, there have been legislative and judicial efforts to repeal, replace, or change some or all of the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have passed. On December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new federal tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) which includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate.” In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently, eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the ACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminates the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 (the BBA), among other things, amended the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare Part D drug plans. In December 2018, CMS published a new final rule permitting further collections and payments to and from certain ACA-qualified health plans and health insurance issuers under the ACA risk adjustment program in response to the outcome of federal district court litigation regarding the method CMS uses to determine this risk adjustment. On April 27, 2020, the United States Supreme Court reversed a federal circuit decision that previously upheld Congress’ denial of $12 billion in “risk corridor” funding. On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the ACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the ACA are invalid as well. On March 2, 2020, the United States Supreme Court granted the petitions for writs of certiorari to review this case. The Supreme Court of the United States held oral arguments on the Fifth Circuit Court case in November 2020 and is expected to issue a decision by mid-2021. Litigation and legislation over the ACA are likely to continue, with unpredictable and uncertain results. It is unclear how this Supreme Court decision, future litigation, and healthcare measures promulgated by the Biden administration will impact the implementation of the ACA, our business, financial condition and results of operations. Complying with any new legislation or reversing changes implemented under the ACA could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business.
 Other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the ACA was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of up to 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which will stay in effect through 2030 with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 unless additional congressional action is taken. In January 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. These new laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for our drugs, if approved, and accordingly, our financial operations. 
 Additionally, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny recently over the manner in which drug manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. In 2020, under the Trump administration, HHS and CMS issued final rules in November and December of 2020 that were expected to impact, among others, price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Part D, fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, manufacturer price reporting requirements under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including regulations that affect manufacturer-sponsored patient assistance programs subject to pharmacy benefit manager accumulator programs and Best Price reporting related to certain value-based purchasing arrangements. Multiple lawsuits have been brought against HHS challenging various aspects of the rules. The Biden administration has also implemented a regulatory rule freeze for all federal agency rules that had not gone into effect as of January 20, 2021. The impact of these lawsuits as well as legislative, executive, and administrative actions of the current administration on us and the pharmaceutical industry as a whole is currently unknown. At the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. These and other health reform measures that are implemented may have a material adverse effect on our operations. 
 We are unable to predict the future course of federal or state healthcare legislation in the United States directed at broadening the availability of healthcare and containing or lowering the cost of healthcare. These and any further changes in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenue or increase our costs could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. It is also possible that additional governmental action will be taken to address the COVID-19 pandemic. The continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations, and other payors of healthcare services and medical products to contain or reduce costs of healthcare and/or impose price controls may adversely affect the demand for our product candidates, if approved, and our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.
