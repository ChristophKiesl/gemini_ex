ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Company Overview
Except as otherwise indicated or unless the context otherwise requires, “KLX Energy Services,” “KLXE,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to KLX Energy Services Holdings, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. Our fiscal year ends on January 31, as a result, the years ended January 31, 2021 and 2020 are referred to as “Fiscal 2020" and "Fiscal 2019,” respectively.
KLX Energy Services is a growth-oriented provider of diversified oilfield services to leading onshore oil and natural gas exploration and production companies operating in both conventional and unconventional plays in all of the active major basins throughout the United States. KLXE was initially formed from the combination and integration of seven private oilfield service companies acquired during 2013 and 2014. Each of the acquired businesses was regional in nature and brought one or two specific service capabilities to KLX Energy Services. We were incorporated in Delaware on June 28, 2018, and on September 14, 2018, we completed our spin-off from KLX Inc. and became an independent, publicly traded company. See Item 7. "Management Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for more details of our acquisitions since becoming a publicly traded company, including our 2020 acquisition of Quintana Energy Services Inc.
We deliver mission critical oilfield services to primarily independent major oil and gas companies focused on drilling, completion, production and intervention activities for the most technically demanding wells from over 50 service facilities located in the United States. Our primary services include directional drilling, coiled- tubing, thru tubing, hydraulic frac rentals, fishing, pressure control, wireline, rig-assisted snubbing, fluid pumping, flowback, testing, pressure pumping and well control services. Our primary rentals and products include hydraulic fracturing stacks, blow out preventers, tubulars, downhole tools, dissolvable plugs, composite plugs and accommodation units. We operate in three segments on a geographic basis, including the Southwest Region (the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford), the Rocky Mountains Region (the Bakken, Williston, DJ, Uinta, Powder River, Piceance and Niobrara basins) and the Northeast/Mid-Con Region (the Marcellus and Utica as well as the Mid-Continent STACK and SCOOP and Haynesville). 
Our proprietary products and specialized services are supported by technically skilled personnel and a broad portfolio of innovative in-house research and development (“R&D”), manufacturing, repair and maintenance capabilities. We work with our customers to provide engineered solutions across the entire lifecycle of the well, by streamlining operations, reducing non-productive time and developing cost-effective solutions and customized tools for our customers’ most challenging service needs, which include technically complex unconventional wells requiring extended reach horizontal laterals with greater completion intensity per well. We believe long-term revenue growth opportunities will continue to be driven by increases in the number of new customers served and the breadth of services we offer to existing and prospective customers. See Item 7. "Management Discussion and analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations" for more details about our complementary suite of our targeted services and engineered solutions.
We endeavor to create a “next generation” oilfield services company in terms of management controls, processes and operating metrics and have driven these processes down through the operating management structure in every region. We believe this differentiates us from many of our competitors. This allows us to offer our customers in all of our geographic regions discrete, comprehensive and differentiated services that leverage both the technical expertise of our skilled engineers and our in-house R&D team. 
Industry Overview
The oil and gas industry has historically been both cyclical and seasonal. Activity levels are driven primarily by drilling rig counts, technological advances, well completions, workover activity, the geological characteristics 
of the producing wells and their effect on the services required to commence and maintain production levels and our customers’ capital and operating budgets. All of these indicators are driven by commodity prices, which are affected by both domestic and global supply and demand factors. In particular, while U.S. natural gas prices are correlated with global oil price movements, they are also affected by local weather, transportation and consumption patterns. Global supply and demand factors will likely continue to result in commodity price volatility, similar to that experienced in 2020.
During the first quarter of 2020, the emergence of COVID-19, and the global pandemic caused thereby, placed significant downward pressure on the global economy and oil demand and prices, leading North American operators to announce significant cuts to planned 2020 capital expenditures and causing the continued acceleration of upstream oil and gas bankruptcies. In response, OPEC, coupled with production curtailment and a drop in hydraulic fracturing activity amongst North America operators, removed significant oil supply from and eased pressure on the market. During the second half of 2020, OPEC and the non-OPEC suppliers (collectively, “OPEC+”) worked to maintain oil production through an agreed upon quota, and North America operators largely remained disciplined in capital spending. The reduced activity levels have led to a plunging North America onshore rig count. For more information, see “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of Part I and in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Recent Trends and Outlook” in Item 7 of Part II of this Annual Report.
Products and Services
The principal high value-added services and related tools and equipment we offer to support our customers throughout the lifecycle of the well include drilling, completions, production and well intervention services and products in each of our geographic reporting segments.
Drilling: We provide directional drilling and associated drilling services to E&P companies in many of the most active areas of onshore oil and natural gas developments in the United States, including all active U.S. oil and natural gas basins with level 1 facilities in Appalachian Mountain, Gulf Coast, Mid-Continent, West Texas and Rocky Mountain regions.
Our drilling activities are comprised of directional drilling services, downhole navigational and rental tools businesses and support services, including well planning, site supervision, accommodation rentals and other drilling rentals, which assists customers in the drilling and placement of complex directional and horizontal wellbores. These directional drilling activities utilize in-house positive pulse and electromagnetic measurement-while-drilling ("MWD") communication options to ensure accurate and timely delivery of data transmission for all real-time drilling applications as well as logging-while-drilling capabilities.
In addition to navigation, our systems offer various technologies, including gamma ray, azimuthal gamma ray, real-time continuous inclination and azimuth, rotary steerable, pressure-while-drilling, mode shifting, stick-slip and destructive dynamics, dynamic sequencing and real-time shock and vibration modules. KLXE utilizes modern well planning and anti-collision software to assist our well planners in providing accurate real-time information to our customers. Additionally, KLXE offers our K-series mud motor fleet that features a proprietary transmission-mandrel to deliver strong build rates, fights fatigue on extended laterals and is available to service all known well profiles. The demand for these services tend to be influenced primarily by customer drilling-related activity levels. 
As of January 31, 2021, our market share of the U.S. onshore drilling market was 8.2%. We intend to continue to re-deploy additional MWD kits into 2021, as market conditions warrant.
Completion: Our completions activities are focused on services that help our customers complete and stimulate extended reach horizontal laterals and more technical wellbores. We are highly experienced in safely servicing deep, high-pressure, high-temperature wells in all of the most active onshore basins in the United States and provide premium perforating services for both wireline and tubing-conveyed applications. We believe we offer best-in-class service execution at the wellsite and innovative downhole technologies, positioning us to benefit from our ability to service technically complex wells where the potential for increased 
operating leverage is high due to the large number of stages per well. This is in addition to our customer focus on execution rather than price. 
Our completions activities include a wide range of services: 

•coiled tubing and nitrogen services;
•pressure control products and services;
•wellhead and hydraulic fracturing rental products and services 
•flowback and testing services;
•wireline services (including pump down perforating, logging, pipe recovery and slickline);
•downhole completion tools, including:
◦toe sleeves;
◦wet shoe cementing bypass subs;
◦composite plugs;
◦dissolvable plugs;
◦liner hangers;
◦stage cementing tools, inflatables, float and casing equipment; and 
◦retrievable completion tools;
•cementing products and services;
•thru-tubing technologies and services;
•rig assist snubbing services; and
•acidizing and pressure pumping services.
Our coiled tubing units are used in the provision of completion services or in support of well-servicing and workover applications. Our rig-assisted snubbing units are used in conjunction with a workover rig to insert or remove downhole tools or in support of other well services while maintaining pressure in the well, or in support of unconventional completions. Our nitrogen pumping units provide a non-combustible environment downhole and are used in support of other pressure control or well-servicing applications. We also offer highly-technical and specialized well control services, which are typically required in response to emergencies at the well site, requiring a variety of solutions including freezing, hot tapping and gate valve drilling services, as well as critical well control and containment operations. Our team is comprised of oilfield services veterans with extensive domestic and international experience in well control operations. 
As of January 31, 2021, we had a fleet of 39 coiled tubing units, 24 of which are large diameter coiled tubing units across our geographical regions. Over time, when the industry recovers, we believe that our investments in large diameter coil tubing spreads will allow us to increase our share of spend as the large diameter coil tubing pulls through asset light services such as flowback and testing services, thru-tubing and pressure control services, while leveraging our recently enhanced cost structure. 
Last year we continued to optimize the quality and performance of our magnesium alloy based line of dissolvable hydraulic fracturing plugs. Our proprietary dissolvable plugs deliver all the benefits of a traditional hydraulic fracturing plug but without the need for bottom hole intervention for removal. KLXE dissolvable plugs have been deployed successfully across all major U.S. oil and natural gas basins in now more than 700 wells by more than 60 customers. Our plugs dissolve quickly and reliably, resulting in faster time to production, are effective in a wide range of operating temperatures and salinity, including temperatures ranging from 80 to 300 degrees Fahrenheit, and do not require mill out, thus saving time and cost. 
The Company has 127 wireline units in the fleet and 56, or 44.1% are configured to run pump down or plug-and-perf operations. Our R&D organization also enables our operations to support our customers with cutting edge pump down operations that include greaseless wireline, addressable gun systems and addressable release tools, to provide our customers with high quality pump down services. We also maintain a full line of radial cement bond tools, compensated neutron porosity tools and casing evaluation tools to provide well evaluation services to our clients. We also utilize greaseless line and quiet truck wireline technology to meet the environmental concerns of our customers. 
We offer a full line of valves and corresponding services to assist clients with their pressure control needs during hydraulic fracturing operations. These valves are assembled in predetermined configurations based on 
customer preference and installed on the wellhead to control flow and pressure during hydraulic fracturing operations. We own a large, young fleet of valves serving the North American onshore oil and gas market. We have enhanced our hydraulic fracturing valve fleet line through the internal development of next generation technology, including our proprietary, patent pending hydraulic fracturing relief valve (“FRV”). Introduced in 2016, the FRV was built and designed to replace older “pop-off” systems. When tied into a hydraulic fracturing core (pumps), the FRV gives customers a safer and more reliable method for relieving surface pressure in the event of an unforeseen overpressure event. By doing this, we believe we minimize operational risk, as well as greatly reduce health, safety and environmental (“HSE”) concerns that are associated with hydraulic fracturing operations. 
Additional technologies that we currently deploy on behalf of our customers include our (i) patented flotation collar, which assists customers in getting completion casing to the bottom of extended reach wells when friction prevents getting casing to depth, (ii) proprietary IPA toe sleeve, which allows customers a consistent and reliable hydraulic fracturing initiation sleeve at the toe of the completion, (iii) composite hydraulic fracturing plug, a flow control device that is set in the wellbore at given intervals to divert fluid into the formation, and (iv) dissolvable plugs. 
Production: We also provide services to enhance and maintain oil and gas production throughout the productive lives of our customers’ wells. Our production services include maintenance-related intervention services as well as the provision of specifically required products and equipment. As with our completion and intervention service offerings, we have developed a portfolio of proprietary tools that we believe differentiates our production solutions service offering. The principal services and equipment we provide across the production lifecycle of the well include (i) production blow out presenters, (ii) mechanical wireline services, (iii) slick line services, (iv) hydro-testing, (v) premium tubulars and (vi) other specialized production tools.
We believe our proprietary production tool portfolio creates a distinct competitive advantage for us in selling all of our production services. Key downhole production tools that we have developed and deployed with strong customer adoption include: 
Punch Ram Tool—The punch ram tool gives customers the ability to safely and repeatedly release trapped pressure inside production tubulars during pulling operations. The alternative is to “hot-tap” the tubing, which is a high-risk operation that most operators are not willing to employ. 
Hydraulic Fracturing Protect Rod Hang Off Tool—This tool is developed to give customers the ability to “hang off” a rod string rather than tripping it out of the hole and laying it down. The associated costs of tripping rods out of the hole coupled with the damage of laying them down and picking the string back, we believe, make this tool an excellent alternative option for customers. The hang off tool allows an operator to easily hang the rod string in the wellhead and still gives them the ability to tie into the tubing if need be to monitor pressure or pump fluid. 
Intervention: Our intervention services consist of best-in-class technicians and equipment that are focused on providing customers engineered solutions to downhole complications. Intervention involves the application of specialized tools and procedures to retrieve lost equipment and remove other obstructions that either interfere with the completion of the well or are causing diminished production. The principal services we provide to remediate these complications include fishing, thru-tubing and pipe recovery. Given the unique geology and operating characteristics of each well, no two complications are the same, yet each complication our customers experience results in substantial disruption to their well operation and economics. As a result, resolution is “mission critical” to our customers and superior outcomes can support premium pricing. Those outcomes rely principally on the skill and experience of the technicians dedicated to resolving the issues and the availability of exactly the right tools for every eventuality. We believe we have one of the leading teams of intervention specialists in the industry, supported by a comprehensive portfolio of intervention tools and equipment. Each of our geographic regions is fully staffed with top technicians and fully equipped with a comprehensive range and quantity of equipment given the wellbore profiles for the region. 
We support our intervention group with a portfolio of tools consisting of patented and other proprietary technologies. Recent innovations currently deployed in the field include our: (i) DXD Venturi Tool; (ii) HAVOK PDC Bearing Section; (iii) Hydraulic By-Pass Tool; and (iv) Drill Mate (Mechanical By-Pass Valve). These tools were designed to improve upon conventional technology used by our competitors: 
DXD Venturi Tool—The patent pending DXD (Debris Extraction Device) is an internally developed downhole tool that assists customers in removing unwanted debris from the wellbore. Utilizing fluid dynamics, the tool consists of a jet section that accelerates fluid across a nozzle. This increase in fluid velocity creates a pressure drop inside the tool, which draws fluid through an inlet. As the fluid is drawn into the system through the inlet, it picks up unwanted debris in the fluid flow, which is then caught in a series of chambers installed below the tool. The chambers then carry the debris out of the hole when the system is brought back to surface. 
Hydraulic By-Pass Tool—The patented hydraulic by-pass tool allows us to run our conventional motor assemblies and achieve substantially higher circulation rates without reducing the expected life of our conventional power section. The additional fluid being pumped and by-passed optimizes the downhole hydraulics for the operation and assists with proper debris removal. 
Drill Mate (Mechanical By-Pass Valve)—The patented Drill Mate is a downhole tool that was developed to give customers a way to mechanically by-pass fluid during drill out or clean out operations. The tool is a two-piece system that opens and closes based upon the amount of weight being set on the mill or bit. During bottom milling with the tool, the tool is in the closed position, putting 100% of the flow through the motor BHA. As weight is removed from the mill or bit either by milling through the obstruction or picking up off bottom, the tool strokes open, thereby exposing by-pass ports that divert fluid through them. At this point, a customer can increase the amount of fluid being pumped through the BHA to assist in debris removal. This increase in fluid rate does not affect the life of the motor as the additional fluid is by-passed through the Drill Mate tool. 
Customers and Marketing 
Substantially all of our customers are engaged in the energy industry. Most of our sales are to major, large independent and regional oil and natural gas companies, and these sales have resulted in a diversified and geographically balanced portfolio of more than 750 customers within North America. Revenues from our five largest customers collectively represented approximately 27.8% of our revenues for the year ended January 31, 2021. No single customer accounted for more than 10% of our revenues in Fiscal 2020.
Our sales activities are conducted through a network of sales representatives and business development personnel, which provide coverage on a product-line and geographical basis. Sales representatives work closely with local operations managers to target potential opportunities through strategic focus and planning. Customers are identified as targets based on their drilling and completion activity, geographic location and economic viability. Direction of the sales team is conducted through weekly meetings and daily communication. Our marketing activities are performed internally. Our strategy is based on building a strong North American brand though multiple media outlets including our website, select social media accounts, print, billboard advertisements, press releases and various industry-specific conferences, publications and lectures. We have a technical sales organization with expertise and focus within their specific service line. Our strategy is to sell our services using data to demonstrate safety and service quality. We accomplish this through communication across sales regions and operations departments to share best practices and leverage existing customer relationships. 
Competition 
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive. We compete on a number of factors, including performance, safety, quality, reliability, service, price, response time and, a growing breadth of services and products. Additionally, projects are often awarded on a bid basis, which tends to create a highly competitive environment. To be successful, a company must provide services that meet the specific needs of oil and natural gas E&P companies and drilling, completions, production and intervention service contractors at 
competitive prices. We provide our services across the United States and we compete against different companies in each service and product line we offer. Our competition includes many large and small oilfield service companies, including the largest integrated oilfield services companies.
Our major competitors include Schlumberger, Baker Hughes, Halliburton, RPC, Nine Energy Services, Phoenix Technology Services, Scientific Drilling International, NexTier, Liberty Oilfield Services, Basic Energy Services, Superior Energy Services, Key Energy Services, and STEP Energy Services.
We differentiate our company from our competitors by delivering a broad range of drilling, completion, production and intervention services safely with high quality equipment and highly competent personnel, which we believe enables us to deliver superior execution while operating an efficient and safe working environment. While we must be competitive in our pricing, we believe our customers select our services based on the local leadership, relationships and expertise that our field management and operating personnel use to deliver quality services. We maintain and develop new business through corporate, regional, safety, quality and discrete product/service specialist sales teams throughout the United States. 
We believe our focus on cultivating our existing customer relationships as well as developing new relationships, while maintaining our high standard of customer service, technology, safety, performance and quality of crews, equipped us to effectively compete and succeed in a competitive market.
Suppliers and Procurement 
We purchase a wide variety of materials, components and partially completed and finished products from manufacturers and suppliers for our use. We are not dependent on any single source of supply for those parts, supplies, materials or equipment and, as of January 31, 2021, no single supplier accounted for more than 10% of our total supply and procurement costs. To date, we have generally been able to obtain the equipment, parts and supplies necessary to support our operations on a timely basis. While we believe that we will be able to make satisfactory alternative arrangements in the event of any interruption in the supply of these materials and/or products by one of our suppliers, we may not always be able to make alternative arrangements. In addition, certain materials for which we do not currently have long-term supply agreements could experience shortages and significant price increases in the future. As a result, we may be unable to mitigate any future supply shortages and our results of operations, prospects and financial condition could be adversely affected. 
Customer Service 
We are highly differentiated in each of the geographic markets that we serve with our services and associated product offerings. This is achieved by providing targeted, complementary services and related products and being responsive to our customers with both quality, as measured by the industry-standard NPT, and timely responses to requests. The key elements include: 
•24-hours a day, seven days a week operations;
•recognized industry leading technicians in our principal service and product lines;
•responsiveness to our customers’ requirements for ready-to-deploy API certified equipment and a “can do” philosophy;
•technical interface with customers via product line management personnel; and
•client relationship building.
Technology and Intellectual Property
Our engineering and technology efforts are focused on providing efficient and cost-effective solutions to maximize production for our customers across major North American onshore basins. We have dedicated resources focused on the internal development of new technology and equipment, as well as resources focused on sourcing and commercializing new technologies through strategic relationships. Our sales and 
earnings are influenced by our ability to successfully introduce new or improved products and services to the market.
Although in the aggregate our patents and licenses are important to us, we do not regard any single patent, license or strategic relationship as critical or essential to our business as a whole. In general, we depend on our technological capabilities, customer service oriented culture and application of our know-how to distinguish ourselves from our competitors, rather than our right to exclude others through patents or exclusive licenses. We also consider the quality and timely delivery of our products, the service we provide to our customers, and the technical knowledge and skill of our personnel to be more important than our registered intellectual property in our ability to compete. 
We believe we have become a “go-to” service provider for piloting certain new technologies across North America because of our service quality, execution at the wellsite and scale. These strategic relationships provide us and our customers with access to unique technology from independent innovators. This also allows us to minimize exposure to potential technology adoption risks and the significant costs associated with developing and implementing R&D internally. Our internal resources are focused on evolving our existing proprietary tools to stay on trend and ensure quicker, lower completion and production costs for our customers. 
Risk Management and Insurance 
The provision of technical services or use of certain of our tools and equipment in connection therewith could involve operational risk and thereby expose us to liabilities. An accident involving our services or equipment, or the failure of a product, could result in personal injury, loss of life and damage to property, equipment or the environment. Damages from a catastrophic occurrence, such as a fire or explosion, could result in substantial claims for damages. We generally attempt to negotiate the terms of our Master Services Agreements ("MSAs") consistent with industry practice. In general, we attempt to take responsibility for our own personnel and property, while our customers, such as the E&P companies and well operators, take responsibility for their own personnel, property and all liabilities arising from well and subsurface operations. 
In addition, claims for loss of oil and gas production and damage to formations can occur in the oilfield services industry. If a serious accident were to occur at a location where our equipment and services are being used, it could result in us being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting large claims. Because our business involves the transportation of heavy equipment and materials, we may also experience traffic accidents, which may result in spills, property damage and personal injury. 
Oilfield services companies, despite efforts to maintain high safety standards, from time to time, have suffered accidents. Our business is subject to the same risks and, as a result, there is a risk that we will experience accidents in the future. In addition to the property and personal losses from these accidents, the frequency and severity of these incidents affect our operating costs and insurability, and our relationship with customers, employees and regulatory agencies. In particular, in recent years many of our large customers have placed an increased emphasis on the safety records of their service providers. Any significant increase in the frequency or severity of these incidents, or the general level of compensatory payments, could adversely affect the cost of, or our ability to obtain, workers’ compensation and other forms of insurance, and could have other material adverse effects on our financial condition and results of operations. 
We maintain a risk management program that covers operating hazards, including products and completed operations, property damage and personal injury claims as well as certain limited environmental claims. Our risk management program includes primary, umbrella and excess umbrella liability policies in excess of $75 million per occurrence, including sudden and accidental pollution claims. We believe that our insurance is sufficient to cover property and casualty liability claims. 
We endeavor to allocate potential liabilities and risks between the parties in our MSAs. We retain the risk for any liability not indemnified by our customers and in excess of our insurance coverage. These MSAs delineate our and our customers’ respective warranty and indemnification obligations with respect to the 
services we provide. We endeavor to negotiate MSAs with our customers that provide, among other things, that we and our customers assume (without regard to fault) liability for damages to our respective personnel and property. For catastrophic losses, we endeavor to negotiate MSAs that include industry-standard carve-outs from the knock-for-knock indemnities. Additionally, our MSAs often provide carve-outs to the “without regard to fault” concept that would permit, for example, us to be held responsible for events of catastrophic loss only if they arise as a result of our gross negligence or willful misconduct. Our MSAs typically provide for industry-standard pollution indemnities, pursuant to which we assume liability for surface pollution associated with our equipment and originating above the surface (without regard to fault), and our customer assumes (without regard to fault) liability arising from all other pollution, including, without limitation, underground pollution and pollution emanating from the wellbore as a result of an explosion, fire or blowout. The summary of MSAs set forth above is a summary of the material terms of the typical MSA that we have in place and does not reflect every MSA that we have entered into or may enter into in the future, some of which may contain indemnity structures and risk allocations between our customers and us that are different than those described here. 
Information Technology
Our IT systems provide us with a scalable integrated platform that facilitates efficient operations, consolidated invoicing and optimal equipment utilization on both a site and segment basis. Our operating strategy is based upon balancing high asset and personnel utilization levels with consistently superior customer service. As such, our IT systems are integral to effectively managing our business. 
Government Regulation and Environmental, Health and Safety Matters 
Our operations are subject to extensive and changing federal, state and local laws and regulations establishing health, safety and environmental quality standards, including those governing discharges of pollutants into the air and water and the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes. We may be subject to liabilities or penalties for violations of those regulations. We are also subject to laws and regulations, such as The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (“CERCLA”) and similar state statutes, governing remediation of contamination, which could occur or might have occurred at facilities that we own or operate, or which we formerly owned or operated, or to which we send or have sent hazardous substances or wastes for treatment, recycling or disposal. Historically, our environmental compliance costs have not had a material adverse effect on our operations. However, we could become subject to future liabilities or obligations as a result of new or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations. In addition, we may have liabilities or obligations in the future if we discover any environmental contamination or liability relating to our facilities or operations. 
The following is a summary of some of the existing laws, rules and regulations to which we are subject. 
Hazardous Substances and Waste Handling 
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state statutes, regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes. Under the guidance issued by the Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”), individual states administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, sometimes in conjunction with their own, more stringent requirements. We are required to manage the disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes in compliance with RCRA and analogous state laws. RCRA currently exempts many E&P wastes from classification as hazardous waste. Specifically, RCRA excludes from the definition of hazardous waste produced waters and other wastes intrinsically associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil and natural gas. However, efforts have been made from time to time to remove this exclusion and thus it is possible that certain E&P waste now classified as non-hazardous waste and excluded from treatment as hazardous wastes may in the future be designated as “hazardous wastes” under RCRA or other applicable statutes. Stricter regulation of wastes generated during our or our customers’ operations could result in increased costs for our operations or the operations of our customers, which could in turn reduce demand for our services and adversely affect our business. 
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act 

CERCLA, also known as the Superfund law, imposes joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include the current and former owner or operator of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who transported or disposed or arranged for the transport or disposal of a hazardous substance released at the site. Persons who are or were responsible for releases of hazardous substances under CERCLA and any state analogs may be subject to joint and several, strict liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, and for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. We currently own, lease, or operate numerous properties that have been used for manufacturing and other operations for many years. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property, or perform remedial operations to prevent future contamination. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third-parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. 
Worker Health and Safety 
We are subject to a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act, which establishes requirements to protect the health and safety of workers. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration ("OSHA") hazard communication standard, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of the federal Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act and comparable state statutes requires maintenance of information about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and provision of this information to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration regulates and provides safety oversight of commercial motor vehicles, the EPA establishes requirements to protect human health and the environment, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives ("ATF") establishes requirements for the safe use and storage of explosives, and the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission establishes requirements for the protection against ionizing radiation. Substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with these laws and regulations. 
Additionally, OSHA has implemented rules establishing a more stringent permissible exposure limit for exposure to respirable crystalline silica and provided other provisions to protect employees. These rules require compliance with engineering control obligations to limit exposures to respirable crystalline silica in connection with hydraulic fracturing activities by June 2021. OSHA, and analogous state agencies may continue to propose changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment. Additionally, the inhalation of respirable crystalline silica is associated with health risks, including the lung disease silicosis. These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the hydraulic fracturing industry. Concerns over silicosis and other potential adverse health effects, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of hydraulic fracturing sand, may have the effect of discouraging our customers' use of hydraulic fracturing sand.
Transportation Safety and Compliance 
Operating a fleet of over 1,300 vehicles, we are subject to regulation as a motor carrier by the U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”) and analogous state agencies, which requires us to comply with a number of federal and state laws and regulations, including the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Regulations and Hazardous Material Regulations for interstate travel, and comparable state regulations for intrastate travel. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to engage in motor carrier operations, regulatory safety, equipment testing, driver requirements and specifications, and insurance requirements. The trucking industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of the industry by requiring changes in operating practices (including for example, 
changes in fuel emissions limits, hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive or work in any specific period and limits on vehicle weight and size) or by reducing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing truckload services. Additional regulatory initiatives may be pursued relating to fuel quality, engine efficiency and greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions, which could further increase our costs due to truck purchases and maintenance, impairment of equipment productivity, decreases in the residual value of vehicles, unpredictable fluctuations in fuel prices and increases in operating expenses. Our operations, including routing and weight restrictions, could be affected by road construction, road repairs, detours and state and local regulations and ordinances restricting access to certain roads and our increased truck traffic could contribute to deteriorating road conditions in some areas. Also, state and local regulation of permitted routes and times on specific roadways could adversely affect our operations. We cannot predict whether, or in what form, any legislative or regulatory changes or municipal ordinances applicable to our logistics operations will be enacted and to what extent any such legislation or regulations could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business or operations. Moreover, substantial fines and penalties can be imposed and orders or injunctions limiting or prohibiting certain operations may be issued in connection with any failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to the safe operation of commercial motor vehicles. 
Water Discharges 
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”) and analogous state laws impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of oil and other substances, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters, including jurisdictional wetlands, is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. 
In 2015, the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers ("Corps") under the Obama Administration released a final rule outlining federal jurisdictional reach under the Clean Water Act over waters of the United States, including wetlands; however, the 2015 rule was repealed by the EPA and the Corps under the Trump Administration in a final rule that became effective in December 2019 and they also published a final rule in April 2020 re-defining the term “waters of the United States” as applied under the Clean Water Act and narrowing the scope of waters subject to federal regulation. The April 2020 final rule is subject to various pending legal challenges and with President Biden taking office in January 2021, there is the possibility that the Biden Administration will review and reconsider the December 2019 and April 2020 final rules. The process for obtaining permits has the potential to delay our operations and those of our customers. 
In other Clean Water Act matters, spill prevention, control and countermeasure requirements of federal laws require appropriate containment berms and similar structures to help prevent the contamination of navigable waters by a petroleum hydrocarbon tank spill, rupture or leak. In addition, the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws require individual permits or coverage under general permits for discharges of storm water runoff from certain types of facilities. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as other enforcement mechanisms for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations. The Clean Water Act and analogous state laws provide for administrative, civil and criminal penalties for unauthorized discharges and, together with the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, impose rigorous requirements for spill prevention and response planning, as well as substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation, and damages in connection with any unauthorized discharges. 
Air Emissions 
The federal Clean Air Act (“CAA”), and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. These regulations change frequently. These laws and regulations may require us to obtain pre-approval for the construction or modification of certain projects or facilities expected to produce or significantly increase air emissions, obtain and strictly comply with stringent air permit requirements or utilize specific equipment or technologies to control emissions of certain pollutants. For example in 2015, the EPA under the Obama Administration lowered the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (“NAAQS”) for ground 
level ozone from 75 to 70 parts per billion. Since that time, the EPA under the Trump Administration has completed attainment/non-attainment designations and, more recently on December 31, 2020, published notice of a final action that, upon conducting a periodic review of the ozone standard in accord with CAA requirements, elected to retain the 2015 ozone NAAQS without revision on a going-forward basis. However, this December 2020 final action is subject to legal challenge, and the NAAQS may be subject to further revision under the Biden Administration. State implementation of the revised NAAQS could result in stricter permitting requirements, which in turn could delay or impair our or our customers’ ability to obtain air emission permits, and result in increased expenditures for pollution control equipment, the costs of which could be significant. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties, as well as injunctive relief, for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the CAA and associated state laws and regulations. 
Climate Change
The U.S. Congress has not adopted comprehensive climate change legislation but President Biden has already signed several executive orders regarding the combat of climate change in January 2021 and is expected to pursue legislative as well as other executive and regulatory initiatives in the future to limit GHG emissions. At the federal level, the EPA has adopted rules that, among other things, establish construction and operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources, require the monitoring and annual reporting of GHG emissions from certain petroleum and natural gas system sources, and impose new standards reducing methane emissions from oil and gas operations through limitations on venting and flaring and the implementation of enhanced emission leak detection and repair requirements. 
In recent years, there has been considerable uncertainty surrounding regulation of methane emissions, as the EPA under the Obama Administration published a CAA final rule in 2016 establishing new source performance standards (“NSPS”) for methane, but since that time the EPA under the Trump Administration has undertaken several measures to delay or eliminate more stringent requirements under the 2016 final rule. Various states and industry and environmental groups are separately challenging both the original 2016 standards and more recent EPA rules issued under the Trump Administration, and on January 20, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order, that among other things, directed EPA to reconsider certain of those Trump Administration rules. The January 20, 2021 executive order also directed the establishment of new methane and volatile organic compound standards applicable to existing oil and gas operations, including the production segment. 
Additionally, various states and groups of states have adopted or are considering adopting legislation, regulations or other regulatory initiatives that are focused on such areas as GHG cap and trade programs, carbon taxes, reporting and tracking programs, and restriction of emissions. At the international level, President Biden issued executive orders in January 2021 re-committing the United States to the "Paris Agreement," a non-binding agreement for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined reduction goals every five years after 2020, and directed the federal government to formulate the United States’ emissions reduction goal under the agreement. Separately, on January 27, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that commits to substantial action on climate change, calling for, among other things, the increased use of zero-emissions vehicles by the federal government, the elimination of subsidies provided to the fossil fuel industry, and an increased emphasis on climate-related risks across government agencies and economic sectors. 
Litigation risks are also increasing, as a number of states, municipalities and other plaintiffs have sought to bring suit against the largest oil and natural gas exploration and production companies in state or federal court, alleging, among other things, that such energy companies created public nuisances by producing fuels that contributed to global warming effects, such as rising sea levels, and therefore, are responsible for roadway and infrastructure damages as a result, or alleging that the companies have been aware of the adverse effects of climate change for some time but defrauded their investors by failing to adequately disclose those impacts. There are also increasing financial risks for fossil fuel producers and other companies supportive of the oil and natural gas industry as shareholders and bondholders currently invested in fossil-fuel energy companies concerned about the potential effects of climate change may elect in the future to shift some or all of their investments into non-fossil fuel energy related sectors. Institutional lenders who provide 
financing to fossil-fuel energy companies also have become more attentive to sustainable lending and investment practices and some of them may elect not to provide funding for fossil fuel energy companies. Additionally, there is the possibility that financial institutions will be required to adopt policies that limit funding for fossil fuel energy companies, as President Biden recently signed an executive order in January 2021 calling for the development of a climate finance plan and, separately, the Federal Reserve announced in late 2020 that it has joined the Network for Greening the Financial System, a consortium of financial regulators focused on addressing climate-related risks in the financial sector. 
Finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth’s atmosphere may produce climate changes that could have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climatic events; if such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse impact on our operations. 
Hydraulic Fracturing 
Our businesses are dependent on our customers’ hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling activities. Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons, particularly natural gas, from tight formations, including shales. The process, which involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production, is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions.
At the federal level, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel fuels and regarding certain wastewater discharges from onshore unconventional oil and gas extraction facilities. Also, over the past several years, the federal Bureau of Land Management under both the Obama and Trump Administrations has pursued final rules governing hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands but the outcome of those rulemakings remain uncertain. In late 2016 the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources, concluding that "water cycle" activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources under certain circumstances.
While the U.S. Congress has from time to time considered but refused to adopt federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing, the Biden Administration has issued executive orders, could issue additional executive orders, and could pursue other legislative and regulatory initiatives that restrict hydraulic fracturing activities on federal lands. For example, the Biden Administration issued an order on January 20, 2021 temporarily suspending the issuance of new leases and authorizations, including drilling permits on federal lands and waters for a period of 60 days, and subsequently issued a second order on January 27, 2021 suspending the issuance of new leases on federal lands and waters pending completion of a study of current oil and gas practices. Although these suspensions, which do not limit existing operations under valid leases and are not applicable to tribal lands that the federal government holds in trust, do not directly affect our operations, they could impose additional hydraulic fracturing limitations on our customers that could ultimately result in decreased demand for our services.
At the state level, many states have adopted legal requirements that have imposed new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities, including states where our customers operate. States could also elect to place prohibitions on hydraulic fracturing and local governments may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place or manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. 
Seismic Events and Water Availability
In recent years, wells used for the disposal by injection of flowback water or certain other oilfield fluids below ground into non-producing formations have been associated with an increased number of seismic events, with research suggesting that the link between seismic events and wastewater disposal may vary by region and local geology. The U.S. geological survey has in the recent past identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, which list includes Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New 
Mexico, and Arkansas. In response to these concerns, regulators in some states have adopted additional requirements related to seismicity and its potential association with hydraulic fracturing. For example, Texas and Oklahoma has issued rules for wastewater disposal wells that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults. Other states, such as Oklahoma has also issued orders, from time to time, for certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. Another consequence of seismic events may be lawsuits alleging that disposal well operations have caused damage to neighboring properties or otherwise violated state and federal rules regulating waste disposal.
Finally, water is an essential component of shale oil and natural gas production during both the drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. Our customers' access to water to be used in these processes may be adversely affected due to reasons such as periods of extended drought, private, third party competition for water in localized areas or the implementation of local or state governmental programs to monitor or restrict the beneficial use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to assure adequate local water supplies.
