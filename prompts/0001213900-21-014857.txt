ITEM 1. BUSINESS
 
In this Annual Report on Form 10-K (the “Form 10-K”), references to the “Company” and to “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to InterPrivate Acquisition Corp.
 
General
 
We are a blank check company formed under the laws of the State of Delaware on August 16, 2019. We were formed for the purpose of entering into a merger, share exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, recapitalization, reorganization or other similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to as a “target business.” We may pursue a business combination opportunity in any business or industry we choose. Prior to signing the Business Combination Agreement (defined below), our efforts have been primarily limited to organizational activities, activities related to our initial public offering (“IPO”) and pursuing our initial business combination.
 
In August 2019, we issued an aggregate of 5,750,000 shares of our common stock (“founder shares”) for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000, or approximately $0.004 per share, to InterPrivate Acquisition Management LLC (the “Sponsor”), an affiliate of InterPrivate Capital LLC, an entity controlled by Ahmed M. Fattouh, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. In December 2019, the Sponsor contributed an aggregate of 718,750 founder shares back to our capital for no additional consideration resulting in there being an aggregate of 5,031,250 founder shares outstanding. In February 2020, we effectuated a dividend of 0.2 shares of common stock for each share of common stock, resulting in there being an aggregate of 6,037,500 founder shares outstanding.
 
In September 2019, we also issued to designees of EarlyBirdCapital Inc., the representative of the underwriters in our IPO, an aggregate of 300,000 shares of our common stock of which 50,000 shares received by the underwriter were contributed back to our capital for no additional consideration as a result of the dividend effectuated by us in February 2020 as described above at a price of $0.0001 per share.
 
On February 6, 2020, we consummated the IPO of 21,000,000 InterPrivate Units. Each InterPrivate Unit consists of one share of our common stock and one-half of one InterPrivate Warrant, with each whole InterPrivate Warrant entitling the holder to purchase one share of our common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. The InterPrivate Units were sold at an offering price of $10.00 per InterPrivate Unit, generating gross proceeds of $210,000,000.
 
Simultaneously with the consummation of the IPO, we consummated the private placement of 555,000 units (the “Private Units”) at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $5,550,000. The Private Units were sold to the Sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital and its designees. The Private Units are identical to the InterPrivate Units sold in the IPO, except that the warrants underlying the Private Units are non-redeemable and may be exercised on a cashless basis, in each case so long as they continue to be held by the initial purchasers or their permitted transferees.
 
On February 10, 2020, we consummated the sale of an additional 3,150,000 InterPrivate Units that were subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option at $10.00 per InterPrivate Unit, generating gross proceeds of $31,500,000. Simultaneously with the closing of the sale of additional InterPrivate Units, we consummated the sale of an additional 63,000 Private Units at a price of $10.00 per Private Unit, generating total proceeds of $630,000.
 
Following the closing of the over-allotment option and sale of additional Private Units, an aggregate amount of $241,500,000 was placed in the Company’s trust account established in connection with the IPO (the “Trust Account”). We may withdraw from the Trust Account interest earned on the funds held therein necessary to pay our income or other taxes, if any. Except as described in “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, these proceeds will not be released until the earlier of the completion of an initial business combination and our redemption of 100% of the outstanding shares issued in the IPO upon our failure to consummate a business combination within the required time period.
 
The remaining proceeds from our IPO and simultaneous private placement, net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other costs and expenses, became available to be used as working capital to provide for business, legal and accounting due diligence on prospective business combinations and continuing general and administrative expenses.
 
For further details regarding our business, see the section titled “Information about InterPrivate” contained in our definitive proxy statement/prospectus/consent solicitation statement dated February 12, 2021, incorporated by reference herein.
 
Proposed Business Combination
 
The Business Combination Agreement
 
On November 2, 2020, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement (as it may be amended and/or restated from time to time, the “Business Combination Agreement”) with WLLY Merger Sub Corp., a Delaware corporation and newly formed, wholly-owned direct subsidiary of InterPrivate (“Merger Sub”), and Aeva, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Aeva”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will be merged with and into Aeva (the “Merger”), with Aeva surviving the Merger as a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of InterPrivate (the “Proposed Business Combination”). The Business Combination Agreement contains customary representations and warranties, covenants, closing conditions, termination fee provisions and other terms relating to the Proposed Business Combination and the transactions contemplated thereby.

In connection with the closing of the Proposed Business Combination (the “Closing”), at the effective time of the Merger, by virtue of the Merger, all shares of Aeva common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will be canceled and converted into the right to receive shares of our common stock, all outstanding Aeva options will be converted into options to purchase our common stock and all outstanding Aeva restricted stock units will be converted into InterPrivate restricted stock units. The aggregate number of shares of common stock to be issued in the Proposed Business Combination will be equal to $1.7 billion plus the exercise price of all outstanding Aeva options, divided by $10.00. Following the Closing, we will own all the stock of Aeva and the Aeva stockholders as of immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger will hold a majority of our outstanding common stock.
 
The Closing is subject to certain conditions, including but not limited to the approval of our stockholders and Aeva’s stockholders of the Business Combination Agreement. The Business Combination Agreement may also be terminated by either party under certain circumstances including if the Proposed Business Combination has not occurred by March 31, 2021. Aeva has agreed to customary “no shop” obligations subject to a customary “fiduciary out,” and Aeva would be required to pay a termination fee in the amount of $68 million if the Business Combination Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances.
 
On March 11, 2021, at a special meeting of stockholders, our stockholders approved the Proposed Business Combination and other related proposals. The Closing is expected to occur on March 12, 2021.
 
Stockholder Support Agreement
 
On November 2, 2020, certain stockholders of Aeva holding the votes necessary to approve the Proposed Business Combination entered into a Stockholder Support Agreement (the “Stockholder Support Agreement”), pursuant to which, among other things, such stockholders have agreed to vote all of their shares of Aeva capital stock in favor of the approval and adoption of the Business Combination Agreement and the Proposed Business Combination. Additionally, such stockholders have agreed not to (a) transfer any of their shares of Aeva capital stock (or enter into any arrangement with respect thereto) or (b) enter into any voting arrangement that is inconsistent with the Stockholder Support Agreement.
 
Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement
 
Pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement and as a condition to the Closing, we, the Sponsor and EarlyBirdCapital (the “Original Holders”) and certain stockholders of Aeva (the “New Holders”, and collectively with the Original Holders, the “Holders”) will enter into the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement at Closing.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement, we will be obligated to file a registration statement to register the resale of certain of our securities held by the Holders. In addition, subject to certain requirements and customary conditions, including with regard to the number of demand rights that may be exercised, the Holders may demand at any time or from time to time, to sell all or any portion of their registrable securities in an underwritten offering so long as the total offering price is reasonably expected to exceed $30 million. The Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement will also provide the Holders with “piggy-back” registration rights, subject to certain requirements and customary conditions.
 
Subject to certain exceptions, the Registration Rights and Lock-Up Agreement further provides for our securities held by the New Holders to be locked-up for a period of one-hundred eighty days following the Closing, while fifty percent of the founder shares held by the Sponsor will be locked-up until the earlier of (i) one year following the Closing or (ii) the date on which the sale price of our common stock equals or exceeds $12.50 per share for any 20 trading days within any 30-day trading period, and the other fifty percent of the founder shares held by the Sponsor will be locked-up until one year following the Closing.
 
Subscription Agreements
 
On November 2, 2020, we entered into subscription agreements with certain investors, pursuant to which the investors have agreed to purchase in the aggregate approximately 12,000,000 shares of common stock in a private placement for $10.00 per share (the “November 2020 PIPE”) for anticipated gross proceeds of approximately $120,000,000. We agreed to give certain registration rights to the November 2020 PIPE investors pursuant to the subscription agreements.
 
On December 23, 2020, we entered into separate subscription agreements with an institutional accredited investor and its affiliates pursuant to which the investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of approximately 16,168,478 shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $200 million, consisting of a $150 million tranche with a purchase price of $11.50 per share and a $50 million tranche with a purchase price of $16.00 per share, in a private placement (collectively, the “December 2020 PIPE”). The investors who agreed to purchase December 2020 PIPE shares in the $150 million tranche also entered into waiver and lockup agreements with us pursuant to which each agreed (1) to vote all shares of common stock held by such investor on the record date for the special meeting in favor of the proposal to approve the Proposed Business Combination, (2) not to submit any such shares of common stock for conversion in connection with such vote and (3) to a lock-up of such tranche of December 2020 PIPE shares for a period of one year following the Closing.
 
The purpose of the November 2020 PIPE and December 2020 PIPE is to raise additional capital for use in connection with the Proposed Business Combination, to meet the minimum cash requirements of the Company provided in the Business Combination Agreement and for use by the post-combination company following the Closing. The November 2020 PIPE and the December 2020 PIPE are conditioned on, among other customary closing conditions, the closing of the Proposed Business Combination.

Stockholders Agreement
 
In connection with the Closing, we, the Sponsor, Canaan, Lux and the Aeva Founders (defined below) will enter into a stockholders agreement (the “Stockholders Agreement”) to provide for certain governance matters relating to the post-combination company. The Business Combination Agreement and the Stockholders Agreement Term Sheet attached thereto provide for, among other things, the size and composition of the initial board of directors of the post-combination company upon the Closing, which will initially consist of a classified board of seven directors, a majority of which will be independent. Pursuant to the Stockholders Agreement, we will represent and warrant that the initial post-combination board will be set at a size of seven members but at the time of the Closing will consist of only five directors:

● | Soroush Salehian Dardashti; 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mina Rezk (together with Mr. Salehian, the “Aeva Founders”); 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | one independent director designated by Lux, who will be Shahin Farshchi; 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | one independent director designated by Canaan (who also meets the independence requirements under Rule 10A-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to service on the audit committee of the board) (an “Audit Committee Qualified Director”), who will be Hrach Simonian; and 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | one Audit Committee Qualified Director designated by the Sponsor, who will be Ahmed M. Fattouh. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
After Closing, there will be two vacancies on the post-combination board and the Aeva Founders will have the right to nominate both, one of whom shall include an Audit Committee Qualified Director and both of whom shall be subject to the approval of a majority of the post-combination board.
 
Subject to the rules of the NYSE, from and after the Closing, the Stockholders Agreement provides that each Aeva Founder will be entitled to nominate himself to continue to serve on the board until such time as he holds less than 5% of the outstanding common stock of the post-combination company (or his earlier death or Incapacity (as defined in the Stockholders Agreement)), and the post-combination company will include such nominees in its proxy materials for each applicable meeting of stockholders and, subject to applicable law and the exercise of fiduciary duties, recommend to the post-combination company stockholders that each such nominee be elected at such meeting. The amended and restated bylaws of the post-combination company, by reference to the Stockholders Agreement, will provide that (i) Mr. Rezk shall serve as Chairman of the board for so long as he is a director and (ii) in the event Mr. Rezk is no longer a director, then Mr. Salehian shall serve as the Chairman so long as he is a director. The Aeva Founders’ rights under the Stockholders Agreement will not be transferable.
