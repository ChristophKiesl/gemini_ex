ITEM 1.    BUSINESS
General
Our Mission
Our mission is to create enterprise-grade technology for small and medium businesses ("SMBs") delivered through our growing, global network of managed service provider ("MSP") partners.
Overview
Datto Holding Corp. ("Datto Holding", "Datto", “we,” “us,” “our” and “the Company”) is the leading provider of cloud-based software and technology solutions purpose-built for delivery through the MSP channel to SMBs. MSPs represent the future of information technology ("IT") management for SMBs. Digital transformation is driving SMB adoption of modern software and technology, while regulatory and data protection requirements and proliferating security threats are increasing the complexity and risk of IT for SMBs. These trends have created an inflection point in SMB outsourcing to MSPs for IT management. MSPs are equipped with the IT resources and expertise SMBs lack, serving as a single provider to meet all of an SMB’s IT needs. MSPs are trusted to select, procure, implement and manage software and technology stacks that support their SMB customers’ business needs. The number of MSPs continues to grow, with approximately 125,000 MSPs providing this critical function to millions of SMBs worldwide today. 
We are committed to the success of MSPs. It is the foundation of our strategy and culture. We empower our MSP partner channel, creating enormous sales and support leverage for us to efficiently address the large but fragmented SMB IT market. Our MSP-centric platform enables our partners to generate recurring revenue through the sale of our solutions to SMBs and to scale and effectively manage their own businesses. Our relationships are directly with our MSP partners. We are the leading pure-play vendor serving the MSP market, and believe our MSP-centric approach is highly differentiating as it aligns our mutual incentives, creates a motivated and engaged sales channel and reinforces our position as an integral component of our MSP partners’ businesses.
Our cloud-based offerings include Unified Continuity, Networking and Business Management software solutions. Our Unified Continuity and Networking offerings ensure the ongoing availability and security of mission-critical IT systems for SMBs on-premise, in private clouds and in the public cloud. These solutions are simple for MSPs to deploy, configure and manage across their SMB customers through a single portal. Our Business Management software provides critical operational tools to MSPs for efficient workflow management and delivery of end-to-end managed services. Our platform also includes a host of business development tools, training and content to help MSPs address the challenges of marketing and selling to SMB customers.
We employ a land-and-expand business model and grow as our MSP partners grow. We seek to deliver tools and resources that are easy to adopt and enable recurring revenue growth and margin efficiency for our MSP partners. Our partners can expand their footprint with us on a frictionless basis as they increase the number of SMB customers they serve and the number of Datto products that they sell through to their SMB customers. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, our dollar-based net retention rate was 111% and 119%, respectively. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance Metrics” for additional information regarding our dollar-based net retention rate.
We have a highly efficient go-to-market model, in which we leverage our sales force and the power of our brand to attract, retain and grow our MSP partners. As of December 31, 2020, we had over 17,000 MSP partners, of which over 1,100 accounted for annual run-rate revenue, or ARR, of $100,000 or more each. MSP partners with over $100,000 of ARR accounted for 47% of our total ARR as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 our 10 largest partners represented approximately 3% of our ARR and no single partner represented more than 0.8% of our ARR. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Performance Metrics” for additional information regarding ARR.
Our business has experienced rapid growth since inception and generates revenue that is highly recurring. As of December 31, 2020, our ARR was $542.8 million and our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $518.8 million, of which approximately 94% was recurring subscription revenue. As of December 31, 2019, our ARR was $474.8 million and our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $458.8 million, of which approximately 90% was recurring subscription revenue. For the year ended December 31, 2020, our net income was $22.5 million and our adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization ("Adjusted EBITDA") was $150.5 million. For the year ended December 31, 2019, our net loss was $31.2 million and our Adjusted EBITDA was $84.6 million. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Non-GAAP Financial Measures—Adjusted EBITDA” for additional information regarding Adjusted EBITDA.

Industry Background
Significant industry trends are impacting the market for MSP-delivered IT, including:
•MSPs represent the future of IT management for SMBs. As dedicated technology experts, MSPs are equipped with the IT resources and expertise SMBs lack, providing a single source to meet all of an SMB’s IT needs. MSPs are trusted to select, procure and implement software and technology stacks for their SMB customers. After implementation, MSPs provide ongoing value to SMBs through strategic guidance, technical support, monitoring and maintenance of their full IT environments.
• IT providers are transitioning to a recurring managed services model. Globally, the number of MSPs continues to grow as organizations across the broader IT services landscape, including professional services providers, IT consultants, systems integrators and value-added resellers, transition to a managed services model.
A number of technology trends have created an inflection point in SMBs’ outsourcing to MSPs for IT management. These trends are greatly increasing the complexity of the IT challenges faced by SMBs and include:
•SMBs are increasingly adopting digital and cloud-based technologies. In response to competitive pressures and the demands of customers and employees, businesses are increasingly adopting digital and cloud-based technologies to help them transform their operations and compete in the marketplace. Even traditionally offline businesses are increasingly embracing technology to help them more efficiently market to, transact with and support customers, as well as to run their own operations. With the democratization of technology, SMBs are under pressure to adopt digital solutions with enterprise-grade capabilities or risk being disrupted by their competitors. We believe that new business challenges arising from the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 ("COVID-19") pandemic are accelerating the digital transformation of SMBs. According to the International Data Corporation, a global research firm, by 2023, 67% of SMBs will have digital transformation as a key part of their IT strategy.
•Modern technologies are driving complexity in IT. The accelerating pace of technological advancement and proliferation of software and technology offerings are increasing the difficulty for businesses to evaluate, select and implement an optimal IT environment. With the adoption of modern technologies, IT systems have become increasingly linked to business operations and to each other through complex integrations, greatly heightening the importance of effective IT management.
•SMB exposure to security and regulatory risk is increasing. SMBs are increasingly collecting, generating and storing data to perform mission-critical functions. Recognizing the criticality and potential value of this data, bad actors are increasingly targeting SMBs to exploit their perceived security vulnerabilities. According to a survey of our MSP partners during 2020, 78% of MSPs reported ransomware attacks against their SMB customers over the last two years, including 60% reporting attacks in just the first six months of 2020. Cybersecurity Ventures, an IT research firm, predicts that ransomware attacks will cause nearly $20 billion in damage globally by 2021. Moreover, SMB data is potentially subject to various and ever-evolving regulatory regimes, creating the additional challenge of ensuring ongoing compliance.
•SMBs are not equipped to meet the expanding challenges of IT management. Despite requiring certain capabilities of enterprise-grade technology solutions, SMBs lack the time, resources and expertise to deploy, manage and maintain an enterprise-grade IT stack. Grappling with the day-to-day management of IT also takes time and resources away from advancing core business goals.
•The costs of downtime or data loss are meaningful and expanding. With increasingly digital operations, system downtime or data loss results in lost revenue, customer churn, negative brand perception and reduced employee productivity. For SMBs, these losses can be catastrophic, with the potential to result in significant business disruptions or even bankruptcy, driving the need for comprehensive and effective enterprise-grade continuity solutions.
Our Differentiated Approach
We are committed to the success of MSPs. It is the foundation of our strategy and culture. We believe our MSP-centric approach is highly differentiating because it aligns our mutual incentives, creates a motivated and engaged sales channel and ensures we become an integral component of our MSP partners’ businesses. Our approach, combined with our expansive platform, has helped to establish us as the leading pure-play vendor serving the MSP market, with an extensive network of more than 17,000 MSP partners. We empower our MSP partner channel, creating enormous sales and support leverage for us to efficiently address the large, but fragmented, SMB IT market.
Our Unified Continuity and Networking solutions generate recurring revenue for MSPs as part of their managed services for SMBs. MSPs integrate these solutions into managed services that they offer to their SMB customers on their own terms, including pricing, packaging, billing and solution-bundling giving MSPs greater control over growth and profitability of their managed services. We also provide visibility and predictability to our MSP partners by delivering our solutions on a subscription basis.
Table of Contents

Our Business Management offerings further this overall value proposition, enabling MSPs to scale and optimize the workflows and business processes associated with managed services delivery. Our solutions are purpose-built to address the specific needs of MSPs, enabling them to improve customer satisfaction, increase productivity, decrease response times and reduce costs, enhancing the overall profitability of their businesses.
Our platform also features business development tools and content to help MSPs address the challenges of marketing and selling to SMBs. We do not directly market or sell to SMBs to avoid competing with our MSP partners. Instead, we offer MSPs tools for marketing automation and content for marketing programs, as well as training and certifications. We further cultivate the broader MSP ecosystem through our thought leadership efforts and industry-leading events. Our open ecosystem events, such as DattoCon, DattoCon EMEA and MSP Technology Days, are among the largest MSP events in the world.
Our singular dedication to our partners has enabled us to create a network of more than 17,000 MSPs that rely upon Datto solutions to serve over 1.5 million SMBs. Our model of distribution through this network of MSPs mitigates the challenges of addressing the SMB market and provides us with the following benefits:

•Sales leverage. The MSP channel creates enormous sales leverage for us to address the large but fragmented SMB IT market. With each of our sales representatives capable of reaching dozens of MSPs, who in turn can serve hundreds of SMBs, the reach of our sales force is greatly amplified.
•Recurring revenue durability. Our direct contractual relationships with MSP partners insulate us from SMB churn from bankruptcy, consolidation or other adverse events. In the event of SMB customer loss, the associated MSP will often maintain their revenue stream by migrating that customer’s Datto stack to a different customer.
•Natural revenue expansion. Once we are engaged with an MSP, our revenue expands naturally as that MSP adds existing and new SMB customers to our platform, upgrades service tiers or purchases more of our solutions to meet growing data protection or networking needs and cross-sells additional solutions into its customer base. 
•Support and service leverage. We provide 24/7 direct-to-tech support to our MSP partners, who are responsible for providing higher touch implementation and ongoing support services to their SMB customers. This approach allows us to avoid the significant cost associated with providing support and service activities to over 1.5 million SMBs.

•Increase retention of SMB customers. Any time an SMB experiences a security downtime or data loss event, an MSP runs the risk of losing that customer. For this reason, MSPs seek reliable solutions that reduce the risk of SMB downtime and data loss. With our solutions, MSPs gain a last line of defense against security threats that ensures ongoing availability and comprehensive data protection, providing their SMB customers with peace of mind. Datto solutions have proven to be very reliable for MSP partners in enabling the efficient management of their customer base, preventing downtime and recovering from cyberattacks and data loss events. As a result, the MSP’s role in securing SMBs’ mission-critical systems solidifies the MSP’s importance as a trusted partner to SMBs.
•Increase profit generation from SMB customers. Our solutions are competitively priced to enable our MSP partners to generate attractive profit margins. The pricing of our solutions for MSPs is generally based on a predetermined tier for a given solution, ensuring our MSP partners have visibility into delivery cost. The pricing of our solutions is not available to SMBs and our MSP partners have latitude to set the pricing, packaging and bundling of our solutions as a managed offering to their customers. As a result, our MSP partners can leverage our solutions to create reliable profit centers for their businesses.
•Avoid channel conflict. Unlike most technology and software vendors who sell to both MSPs and SMB customers, Datto does not compete with MSPs. Datto’s MSP-centric approach enables us to focus solely on the needs of MSPs, designing our platform and solutions for this market. We provide MSPs with the tools and support they need to create and sell managed services to their SMB customers and the assurance we will not compete directly for the business of SMBs.
•Reduce the cost of managing SMB customer IT environments. Our remote monitoring and management product enables the delivery of end-to-end managed IT services by allowing MSPs to perform proactive monitoring, preventative maintenance and remote remediation of customer systems, applications and devices in real-time with intelligent alerting, auto-response and auto-resolution. Our cloud-based solutions help MSPs achieve better resource utilization by reducing costly truck rolls for on-site service and freeing up resources to pursue higher value activities.
•Enable operational efficiency. Our business management tools are easy to implement and use, enabling MSPs to operate their own businesses more efficiently through centralized operations from a single pane of glass. These software solutions are optimized for the business needs of MSPs to enable workflow automation and deliver actionable insights, providing full visibility into customer IT environments. Our solutions have embedded integrations with other Datto products and other services and technologies to make it easier for an MSP to manage a heterogeneous technology stack.
•Drive business growth. In addition to our products, our platform also includes a range of sales and marketing content, training and other programs as well as technical certifications tailored to our MSP partners to help them more effectively grow their businesses, alleviating a major pain-point for IT professionals with limited sales and marketing experience.
Our Growth Strategy
We pursue numerous actions to drive our growth in subscription revenue. Key elements of our growth strategy include:
•Expand our partner base by adding new MSPs. We believe that there is substantial opportunity to increase our penetration among MSPs. We intend to continue leveraging the strong awareness of our brand as a trusted partner to the MSP community to add new MSPs in the markets we serve. Since December 31, 2018, we expanded our MSP partner base from approximately 14,400 to over 17,000 at December 31, 2020.
•Standardize MSP partners on our platform. Once an MSP partner joins our platform, our goal is to increase the penetration of our solutions across its existing SMB customer base. Typically, MSPs initially deploy our solutions to only a limited number of their SMB customers. Over time, MSPs often continue to migrate additional existing end-customers to our platform for the benefit of managing a single integrated solution stack. Our goal is to aid in this migration in order to increase our overall penetration into our MSP partners’ existing SMB customer base.
•Empower our MSP partners to attract more SMBs. As SMBs increasingly rely on MSPs for IT management, we seek to grow our revenue by helping our existing MSP partners attract additional SMB customers that may ultimately adopt our solutions. We plan to continue developing marketing automation tools and content for marketing, as well as offering training and certifications, in order to facilitate our MSP partners’ growth.
•Facilitate upsell and cross-sell activity with our MSP partners and their SMB customers. We intend to grow our sales teams in order to increase our sales with our MSP partners. Our sales teams upsell our MSP partners to higher service tier subscriptions as the data retention and bandwidth needs of their SMB customers grow. In addition, our sales teams upsell our MSP partners to increase their Business Management subscriptions as they grow. Our sales teams also actively cross-sell our products to our MSP partners, leveraging their positive experiences with our platform. Our dollar-based net retention rate, which was 111% as of December 31, 2020 and 119% as of December 31, 2019, demonstrates our ability to expand within existing MSP partners.

•Extend our product leadership and introduce new platform solutions. We continue to invest in new purpose-built product and service offerings to anticipate and meet the evolving demands of our MSP partners and their SMB customers. We will also continue to pursue opportunistic mergers and acquisitions to complement and enhance our current solution set.
•Expand our international footprint. We believe there is significant opportunity to expand into new international geographies, with approximately 73% of our revenue coming from the United States ("U.S.") in 2020. The maturity of the international SMB IT landscape varies; more mature markets represent growth opportunities in the near term, while less mature markets present a longer-term opportunity as MSPs develop within those markets.
Our Products
Our products include offerings in Unified Continuity, Networking and Business Management.

Unified Continuity Products
Datto Unified Continuity is a complete line of products that protect workloads — data, applications and configurations — located on laptops, workstations, physical and virtual servers and in the public cloud. There are five cloud-based products that together protect and restore workloads, reduce SMB downtime resulting from data or system loss and provide a last line of defense against security threats. These products include:
Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery. MSPs use our all-in-one BCDR products to efficiently protect servers and workstations and minimize downtime for SMBs. SIRIS, Datto’s flagship cloud-managed BCDR product, consists of a state-of-the-art physical or virtual device deployed by MSPs at a customer location or in a private data center, the agent software installed on protected servers and workstations and a cloud-based storage, virtualization and management system. SIRIS is available in service tiers ranging from one to 100 terabytes with a variety of data retention options.
Once an MSP deploys SIRIS, the agent software automatically transfers disk images of the protected machines to the SIRIS device at configurable intervals, as frequently as every five minutes. SIRIS verifies the integrity of every image, transfers a copy of that image to the secure Datto Cloud at selected intervals and can replicate that to a second geographically distributed data center if desired. In this manner, SIRIS establishes a last line of defense for all protected servers and workstations. In the event of a server or workstation security incident or outage, users can initiate a boot of the virtual image of the affected machines either in the SIRIS device or in the Datto Cloud in as little as six seconds.
In addition to SIRIS, BCDR products also include ALTO, a smaller capacity BCDR solution. Available in a 2 terabyte model, ALTO provides many of the same capabilities of SIRIS without local virtualization on the device. The same agents are used to collect server or workstation images and ALTO is managed from the same management portal in the Datto Cloud, but with ALTO all failover virtualization occurs only in the Datto Cloud.

Cloud Continuity. Cloud Continuity is the innovative all-in-one, image-based continuity solution for Windows-based PCs (laptops and desktops). Cloud Continuity takes an image of a protected PC and replicates it directly to the Datto Cloud without the need for a local device. Backup images include all PC files and data, as well as the configuration, settings and software. In the event of a ransomware attack, device loss or theft, or other event that renders the PC unusable, Cloud Continuity allows MSPs to quickly and easily restore to any PC hardware.
SaaS Protection. SaaS Protection is a reliable, automated and secure backup and restoration product for Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace data. Microsoft and Google currently recommend the use of a third-party backup service because Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace do not backup user data. MSPs deploy SaaS Protection seamlessly for their SMB customers in a few simple steps, and can quickly start to take regular backups of user emails, files and sites, storing these backups in the Datto Cloud. MSPs help end-users easily recover from data loss, including ransomware attacks, accidental or malicious deletion and cancelled employee accounts—all from our cloud management portal.
Workplace. Datto Workplace is a complete cloud-hosted file sync and share solution enabling end-users to synchronize files across platforms, including mobile devices. Workplace also serves as a collaboration platform allowing users to share and work together on any type of document in its native file format. Centralized cloud management and sophisticated administrative controls at the end-user and group levels give MSPs and their SMB customers control over file governance. Critical business files are also protected via the ransomware detection and management feature, which gives users the ability to immediately revert back to safe file copies from before an infection, undoing the ransomware encryption of user data.
File Protection. Datto File Protection is an MSP-managed, secure and scalable backup product that enables MSPs to efficiently protect and recover files and folders on workstations and laptops of all types. File and folder backups protect unstructured data from ever-present threats such as human error, hardware failure, ransomware and lost or stolen devices. Users can quickly and easily access

and restore their own files from the Datto Cloud, enabling them to recover from common data-loss scenarios without raising a support request, or MSPs can securely access customer accounts and restore data on their behalf.
Networking Products
Datto Networking delivers a suite of cloud-managed networking products for MSPs to efficiently deploy to their SMB customers. 
Networking products currently include:
Access Points. Our WiFi access points deliver high-powered wireless mesh networks with seamless roaming. These 802.11AC Wave 2 access points include a quad-core processor to ensure all of the Wave 2 features have the necessary processing power to deliver the performance required by SMBs.
Switches. We offer switches with 8, 24 and 48 port options, switching capacity ranging from 20 Gbps to 104 Gbps, and mounting options ranging from fanless desktop to rack mounted. MSPs can choose the form factor, performance and mounting options most appropriate for a particular SMB customer.
Edge Routers. Our Edge Routers provide core functionality including intrusion detection and prevention and a firewall with stateful packet inspection, layer 7 DPI, port forwarding, DMZ host and VLAN segregation.
Business Management Products
Business Management consists of integrated SaaS offerings that enable MSPs to be more efficient at scale, including:
Autotask Professional Services Automation. Autotask PSA is a complete IT business management product that is purpose-built for MSPs and delivers the mission-critical tools an MSP needs to run its business. Continuing to deliver 99.99% uptime in 2020, Autotask PSA pioneered cloud-delivered PSA and provides dashboards that help MSPs turn data into actionable business insights. It enables partners to monitor their sales pipeline, track technician productivity and evaluate customer profitability. It includes device management, ticketing, project management, customer relationship management, invoicing, inventory management and resource management. In addition, our open architecture application programming interface ("API") has enabled more than 100 industry-leading vendors to integrate their business-critical applications with Autotask PSA to further simplify workflows for MSPs. Autotask PSA centralizes business operations and enables quick, data-driven decisions through rich dashboards, customizable alerts and business intelligence tools.
Remote Monitoring and Management. A key component of an MSP’s security best practices, Datto RMM is a remote monitoring and management product designed to assist MSPs with their IT service delivery. Built for MSPs as a multi-tenant solution to manage millions of SMB customer endpoints in an efficient manner, Datto RMM is a fully cloud-managed, scalable SaaS product with integrated endpoint ransomware detection. The underlying architecture provides MSPs with the ability to remotely audit, patch, manage, monitor, support and report on SMB customers’ local and public-cloud deployed endpoints. The platform offers a collection of tools for securely supporting thousands of devices without the need for extensive training. MSPs can use Datto RMM tools to create their own scripts, or easily plug in hundreds of pre-made scripts, to automate repetitive tasks like software patching or rapidly respond to security incidents with pre-defined actions. Integrations with Autotask PSA and other frequently-used solutions allow MSPs to seamlessly report on device status, issues and events. Using configurable dashboards, a simple menu system, remote takeover capability and the flexibility to operate from any internet-connected device, Datto RMM helps MSPs deliver better service and increase responsiveness for their SMB customers.
Our Technology
Unified Continuity, Networking and Business Management products are based on a two-level, multi-tenant, private, hybrid cloud architecture. Designed to provide ease of deployment and a high degree of flexibility, our technology enables MSP partners to deliver managed services across a broad range of scenarios at scale.
Key features of our technologies include:
•Easy to use enterprise-grade technology. Our products are designed to be simple to deploy and easy to manage and are built on the latest enterprise-grade technology. This technology includes Type 1 hypervisors, industry-standard scalable monitoring, converged infrastructure and extensive security features. We abstract this complex technology from our MSPs with simple graphical user interfaces. Further, smart defaults and pre-configuration capabilities in our cloud enable MSPs to configure our products, ship them to end-customers and deploy them with minimal effort. Once deployed and configured, our products then connect to the Datto Cloud and begin uploading data. In this way, MSPs can provide secure enterprise-grade technology to their SMB customers without the hassles of deploying, integrating and managing enterprise products.

•Datto product integrations. We pioneered an integrated product portfolio tailored uniquely for MSPs. While Autotask PSA and Datto RMM can be offered as stand-alone products, they are also integrated with each other, allowing technicians to move seamlessly between our PSA and RMM. Integration between Datto RMM and our Networking solutions allows rapid troubleshooting and problem resolution of network issues. Integration between BCDR and PSA allows the PSA to collect and report on deployed devices and manage related support tickets. These integrations encourage MSPs to standardize across our solutions.
•Third-party product integrations. Datto supports an open technology ecosystem for MSPs. MSPs value using different tools from multiple vendors to deliver their managed services, creating unique and often differentiating technology stacks. Datto products are externally integrated with other products to make it easier for an MSP to manage a heterogeneous technology stack. Leveraging open APIs, third party vendors have built more than 200 integrations with our business management products. This includes everything from security tools to competitive remote monitoring and management and professional services automation vendors.
•Two-level multi-tenant architecture. All of our products share a two-tier multi-tenant design, which facilitates MSP management of both their own and the SMBs’ environments. The first tier provides secure resource sharing among MSP partner accounts hosted on the Datto Cloud, while the second tier sits below each MSP account and provides a tenant-centric view of SMB customers for the MSP partner. Most other multi-tenant systems provide only a single level of tenant management.
•Private virtualization and storage cloud. Datto operates its own exabyte scale private cloud which provides us with control over the environment, efficient operating costs and flexibility to best support our partners. The Datto Cloud provides both compute and storage tiers at multiple geographically distributed data centers. This includes the option to replicate a second copy of SMB customer data to an alternative data center in region. We have developed a differentiated virtual machine ("VM") orchestration layer which allows shared management between our MSP partner and the Datto support organization. 
•Proprietary work-flow engine. Autotask PSA incorporates a field-configurable business logic engine that allows the implementation of business processes without costly code customization. A single multi-tenant cloud architecture delivers scalable efficient deployment of custom workflows for each MSP partner, and enables partners to trigger actions and alerts based on real time internal data as well as data from third party products. This allows MSPs to deploy PSA to meet the needs of their business, rather than redesigning their business to meet the requirements of their chosen management software.
•Proprietary agent and agentless technology. We have developed several proprietary agents across our product lines, specifically BCDR, RMM and Cloud Continuity. Our Unified Continuity agents protect servers, workstations and PCs by deploying an endpoint resident software package or using an agentless approach for virtual machines and private clouds. We have developed both a robust agent and an agentless plugin that support virtual machine backup on Hyper-V and VMware. We have also developed RMM agents and API integrations that enable MSPs to monitor and manage SMB customer endpoints on premise and in the public cloud. By developing this proprietary technology, we can avoid reliance on third-party licensed backup agents.
•Proprietary remote access technology. Datto RMM incorporates near-instantaneous access to managed endpoints using 100% HTML5 technology with no local plugin required on the managed device. Not only is this technology secure and fast, it delivers cross browser compatibility. This enables technicians to address customer tickets from nearly any browser, including mobile devices and tablets. With better performance than third-party licensed options, Datto RMM also enables MSPs to deliver faster, more responsive service to their SMB customers.
•Proprietary virtual machine image verification technology. Our verification technology provides evidence that backups produced by our BCDR products are viable. This technology performs automated tests on every image for ransomware and disk integrity. “Screenshot” verification boots the virtual machine either on the device or in the cloud and performs additional automated testing for viability. This running instance of the protected virtual machine further allows the MSP partner to utilize our scripting API to run custom test scripts that validate functionality and data integrity beyond what can be normally evaluated through the built-in testing. This functionally is linked back through the multi-tenant portal and alerting system to provide the MSP partner with confirmation that their managed systems are protected.
•Cloud to cloud API-level connectivity. In addition to devices deployed on-premises, the Datto Cloud is designed to ingest data directly from SaaS applications hosted in public clouds. This API-level connectivity brokered through our multi-tenant portal provides the same level of management that our MSP partners expect from the hybrid cloud continuity products. We have worked with Microsoft and Google to make efficient use of Microsoft 365 and Google Workspace APIs and achieve efficient data ingest and restore services.

•Proprietary remote synchronization technology. Datto has developed proprietary synchronization technology across a wide range of use cases to allow SMB PCs and devices to efficiently and securely send data to the Datto Cloud without saturating local internet connections. This includes multi-pass synchronization technology that enables local workloads to continue to operate while a backup is taken and transmitted. It also includes file synchronization software, as well as differential assessment, transmission and verification capabilities to enable an MSP to control the transmission and verification of large data sets to the Datto Cloud.
•RMM integrated cloud-managed networking devices. By combining the network cloud API with RMM management dashboards, the Datto RMM engine is able to provide access to network configuration and runtime data that greatly exceeds off-the-shelf solutions reliant on SNMP for device connectivity. This cloud-level integration provides much greater control of Datto Networking devices than can be achieved by combining products from different networking and remote monitoring and management vendors. As a result, MSP technicians solving SMB customer tickets experience a seamless environment, increasing productivity and responsiveness.
•Proprietary embedded RMM Ransomware Detection. One of the largest security threats for MSPs and their SMB customers is ransomware, and Datto RMM now incorporates the first embedded ransomware detection algorithm into deployed RMM agents. On all Datto RMM managed devices, the agent now observes the local system for signs of crypto ransomware. When identified, the agent attempts to stop the encryption process and automatically isolates the system from the network, alerting the MSP to the infection. This allows MSPs to prevent the spread of ransomware, and proactively restore infected systems.
•Hyper-converged hybrid cloud connected edge device. Datto is differentiated in that it deploys a true hyper-converged continuity appliance that combines data storage with local compute capabilities. Alternative continuity systems generally only provide gateway functionality with virtualization occurring either exclusively in the cloud or on other equipment furnished by end-customers on-premises. Datto allows very flexible orchestration of VM instances in either the cloud or on the edge device. 
Our Partners
Datto creates technology for MSPs, enabling them to deliver managed services to their SMB customers and also enabling MSPs to efficiently operate their own businesses. MSPs represent substantially all of our revenue and are referred to as our “partners.” Our MSP partners purchase our products on a subscription basis for their own use or for inclusion in managed services sold to their end-customers in a recurring revenue model. Our MSP partners range in size from very small to mid-sized, and primarily serve small and medium-sized businesses, often managing an SMB customer’s entire IT environment. In smaller MSPs, the business owner or CEO is typically the purchaser of Datto products, and in larger MSPs, the purchaser is often the Vice President of Product or CTO.
Our Business Management products are purchased by an MSP for their own use, with subscription fees based on their number of seats or by number of managed SMB devices. Our Unified Continuity and Networking products are purchased by an MSP for resale to their SMB customers, with subscription fees based on service tier and device count or the number of Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace employee accounts at the SMB domains that our MSP partners protect through our SaaS Protection products. Generally, an MSP first purchases a device or seats to assess our products and include them in their managed services. Following a successful initial assessment, the MSP typically purchases and deploys additional devices and seats for its customers over time.
As of December 31, 2020, we partnered with more than 17,000 MSPs serving over 1.5 million SMBs across more than 25 countries. We count partners as MSPs with active subscriptions for one or more of our products at the end of the measured period. Our revenue is highly diversified across our entire partner base, with no single partner making up more than 0.8% of our ARR. As of December 31, 2020, we had over 1,100 MSP partners that each contributed more than $100,000 of ARR.

Examples of use cases of MSP partners leveraging our solutions to deliver value to their SMB customers include:
•utilizing our BCDR solutions to help an SMB roll back its IT environment after a phishing e-mail and ransomware has compromised that SMB’s systems;
•upon a server failure, helping an SMB to switch over to our local device until that SMB’s environment has been restored;
•enabling an SMB to operate its environment in our cloud in the event of a natural disaster, such as a hurricane or earthquake;
•after an end-customer accidentally misplaces a laptop, helping the customer restore the lost environment onto new hardware;
•recovering data and files from our cloud when a customer accidentally deletes a file from Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace;

•utilizing Datto Networking solutions to provide production, point of sale, network connectivity and guest Wi-Fi services for a conference or event; and
•using the Datto partner portal to remotely diagnose and fix an SMB’s laptop issues.
Competition
We operate in a dynamic industry driven by the technology needs of SMBs and MSPs. Our competition is generally comprised of enterprise IT vendors and emerging innovators with niche point solutions. These competitors include:
•Continuity vendors that provide image-based backup solutions with on-premise only, cloud-only or hybrid infrastructure. The level of continuity provided by image-based backup vendors varies widely, from simple image copy to complex image orchestration, copy, failover and failback. Many vendors providing continuity solutions are not exclusively focused on serving MSPs. 
•Networking vendors that sell a mix of edge routers, WiFi access points and switches to small, medium and large businesses. Typically, these vendors deliver either enterprise scale products at a high price point, or commodity products at a low price point. Enterprise scale products are designed for the many unique demands of large-scale enterprises and are complex to configure and manage. Commodity hardware vendors provide performant products with fewer features at a lower price point, often not designed for MSP deployment and management. 
•Business management software vendors that focus a significant portion of their business on the MSP market provide vertically integrated service management platforms and tools to MSPs to help them operate more efficiently. Many of these vendors are not solely focused on the MSP market, and sell directly to end customers to augment their revenue. 
Key competitive factors in our market include:
•reliability and performance of solutions that protect workloads — data, applications and configurations — and ensure uptime for SMBs;
•MSP-centric, turnkey product capabilities including reliability, multi-tenant cloud management, ease of deployment and manageability at scale;
•ability to provide recurring revenue and margin for MSPs;
•quality and availability of service and support;
•brand awareness, reputation and influence among MSPs; and
•programs, tools and content that help MSPs grow their businesses.
We believe that we compete favorably on these factors.
Marketing and Sales
Our marketing and sales approach begins with our leading content marketing programs that attract MSPs, nurturing these contacts and then efficiently delivering qualified leads to our sales team to close. Once a new MSP is added to our platform, our sales team works with them to help them grow. Using our go-to-market enablement programs, MSPs add new SMBs and sell additional Datto products to their existing SMB customers. Post-sales engagement with our service and success teams ensures partners are either effectively using or are enabled to resell our products, and ongoing relationship management at scale allows our partners to sell and cross-sell more of our products.
Marketing
Our marketing engine delivers industry-leading content, which drives our target audience—MSP business owners and decision makers—to request a demo or become a partner. We distribute our content through a number of digital marketing platforms (social, pay-per-click, search engine optimization, syndication, webinars), and we leverage demos to nurture and further qualify leads. Analytics of this process enable us to fine tune programs and content to drive more successful and qualified lead generation.
We categorize our leads based on propensity to buy using a real-time analytical model. We leverage high touch tactics to attract the higher scoring leads and rely on self-service at the low end. We market Datto as the MSP technology company, creating technology for SMBs delivered by MSPs. Once an MSP becomes a Datto partner, we help it grow with a variety of programs to ensure they are optimally using the products they purchased and are enabled to resell our products through to SMB customers. Our marketing programs 
Table of Contents

also help our partners attract new SMB customers. We leverage our in-depth knowledge and understanding of MSPs to design these free programs, which include a marketing automation tool, robust marketing content, sales training and certifications.
We also foster one of the largest MSP communities in the world through our numerous events. DattoCon, DattoCon EMEA and MSP Technology Days are among the largest MSP events in the world. Our dedicated community development team hosts over 100 Datto virtual and in-person events annually for our partners and prospects around the globe, educating them on best practices, refreshing them on the latest technology and providing insights they can use to grow their businesses. We also exhibit at third-party in person and virtual tradeshows where we continue to engage with MSPs and expand the Datto brand. We believe that fostering a cohesive MSP community and serving as a trusted thought leader for MSPs around the world helps drive MSP growth, which in turn drives Datto growth. These events, combined with our content and digital marketing strategies, help ensure that our partners stay in touch with our brand, maintaining our lead in the MSP market.
Sales
We believe that leveraging the MSP channel creates high levels of sales productivity at low customer acquisition costs, allowing us to efficiently reach SMBs. We add MSP partners to our platform primarily through our sales team. There are three sales teams pursuing new MSP partners and covering our existing partner base: Sales Development Representatives ("SDRs"), Territory Sales Representatives ("Hunters") and Channel Growth Representatives ("Farmers"). SDRs review leads from our marketing team and qualify new partner opportunities, and Hunters are responsible for pursuing and closing these opportunities, leading to a new MSP partner adopting one or more of our products. Farmers work with our partners after their first purchase and build relationships, focusing on upsell and cross-sell opportunities. Our sales teams are organized by geography, consisting of the Americas, EMEA and APAC.

Our MSP partners become multipliers to our sales team with our Unified Continuity and Networking products. With aligned incentives, our Farmers and our partners’ own sales teams work together at scale using a range of “sell with” tactics to help such partners grow their base of SMB customers purchasing managed services powered by Datto solutions and expand their footprint within those customers. Further, our Farmers support MSPs with the enablement and training resources available on our marketing platform to help new and existing partners grow their installed base across our products.
Services, Success and Support
Services and Success
Our services team onboards MSP partners, helps them properly configure and implement our solutions and trains them to use our products to their fullest potential. Our success team provides cross-functional support for partners to drive increased adoption, product usage and subscription renewals and is responsible for relationship and escalation management.
Support
Our support team includes experienced, trained resources located around the world to provide 24x7x365 technical support for all our products. Support is included in all our offerings as long as an MSP partner’s subscription is active. All support tiers offer maintenance releases, patches and access to our support services and portal, including a documentation and knowledge repository, how-to guides, videos and a community where our partners can ask questions and find answers. Our support is distinguished by our “direct to tech” support model whereby our expert technicians immediately answer support calls and speak directly with partners to resolve issues. This includes “code red” support where we work with an MSP partner during a disaster or other incident to minimize disruption to their customer’s business.
Similar to the sales leverage we gain through the MSP channel, our partners also are a multiplier for our support team because they perform first-level technical support with SMBs, only calling Datto when they are unable to resolve an issue. In complex situations such as multiple or repeat issues affecting an MSP, our success team may get involved in an escalation. Our executive leaders also regularly speak with partners as part of our commitment to openness and accessibility.
Product Development
Product development and innovation are at the core of our business. We not only invent technology, but we also reinvent it for MSPs. Our research and development teams are composed of product management, software development and infrastructure engineering functions. These groups are responsible for the design, development, testing and delivery of our solutions. We build our products from inception to serve the needs of MSPs and their SMB customers and continually seek to improve those products.
We have designed our development processes to be highly responsive and cost-efficient. Our diversified global footprint allows us to source from a large pool of talented resources by participating in multiple labor markets. We utilize an Agile development process and small Scrum teams, each dedicated to specific product modules that follow a standard set of best practices and a common set of development values.

Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality and other contractual restrictions to protect our proprietary rights, including our proprietary technology, software, know-how and brands. As of December 31, 2020, we owned 20 issued U.S. patents, with expiration dates ranging from September 2025 to May 2039. We have also filed approximately 21 currently pending patent applications. We do not believe that we are materially dependent on any one of our patents, issued or pending.
We require our employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality and proprietary rights agreements and we control and monitor access to our software, proprietary technology and documents and other confidential information. Our policy is to require all employees and independent contractors to sign agreements assigning to us any inventions, trade secrets, developments, processes and other intellectual property generated by them on our behalf and under which they agree to protect our confidential information.
Although we rely on intellectual property rights as well as contractual protections to establish and protect our proprietary rights, we believe that factors such as the technological and creative skills of our personnel, creation of new services, features and functionality and frequent enhancements to our platform are more essential to establishing and maintaining our technology leadership position.
Human Capital 
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,743 employees, of which 1,327 (76%) were employed in the United States and 416 (24%) were employed outside of the United States. We consider our current relationship with our employees to be good. We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements. However, for one of our foreign subsidiaries, a works council represents our employees. We believe that our ability to recruit, retain and develop highly skilled talent is critical to our future success and growth. We provide our employees with competitive compensation and benefits, including opportunities for equity ownership, a 401(k) plan with company matching contributions, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, parental and family leave, and paid time off.
We strive to maintain an inclusive environment free from discrimination of any kind. We believe that fostering this environment builds a foundation on which our employees are empowered to do their life's work. Our employee resource groups ("ERGs") are company-sponsored groups of employees that promote and support certain objectives including inclusion and diversity, career development and networking. As of December 31, 2020, we had four ERGs including those supporting Women in Technology, the LGBTQ community, people of color and LatinX. We aim to ensure our employees are aware of different ways to notify management of inappropriate behavior, including through a confidential hotline. Any and all reports of inappropriate behavior are taken very seriously and thoroughly investigated and remediated.
In addition, we offer high-quality learning experiences across our global business. This includes an extensive onboarding program, robust sales, product and technical training, as well as a comprehensive professional skills curriculum focused on managerial and leadership skills. We also launched an internal networking and mentoring program intended to connect employees across Datto to foster relationships, development and exchange professional and personal experiences, skills, and career paths.

Implications of Being an Emerging Growth Company
We qualify as an “emerging growth company” as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act. We will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of (1) December 31, 2025, (2) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion, (3) the last day of the fiscal year in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer (this means the market value of common that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700.0 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year) or (4) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
An emerging growth company may take advantage of reduced reporting requirements that are otherwise applicable to public companies. These provisions include, but are not limited to:
•not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;
•reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in periodic reports, proxy statements and registration statements; and
•exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved.
We have elected to take advantage of certain of the reduced disclosure obligations regarding financial statements and executive compensation in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and expect to elect to take advantage of other reduced burdens in future filings. As a result, the information that we provide to our shareholders may be different than you might receive from other public reporting companies in which you hold equity interests.
The JOBS Act also permits an emerging growth company like us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies. We have elected to opt-in to this extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards and, therefore, we will not be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that comply with such new or revised accounting standards on a non-delayed basis.
