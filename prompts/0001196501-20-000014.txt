Item 1. Business
Founded in 1974, HMS is an industry-leading provider of cost containment and analytical solutions in the healthcare marketplace. Our mission is to make healthcare work better for everyone. We use data, technology and analytics to deliver coordination of benefits, payment integrity and population health management solutions that help healthcare organizations reduce costs, improve health outcomes and enhance consumer experiences. We provide a broad range of payment accuracy solutions to government and commercial healthcare payers, including coordination of benefits services, to ensure that the right payer pays the claim, and payment integrity services to address improper payments and fraud, waste and abuse. Our population health management solutions include a portfolio of integrated risk analytics, consumer engagement and care management solutions that provide healthcare organizations with reliable intelligence insight into their population and member risks to predict, identify and avoid preventable high cost events over the healthcare continuum. Through our solutions, we help move the healthcare system forward by saving billions of dollars for our customers while helping consumers lead healthier lives.
HMS began its operations as Health Management Systems, Inc., which became our wholly owned subsidiary in March 2003 when we assumed its business in connection with the adoption of a holding company structure. Since then, our business has evolved through a combination of organic growth and targeted acquisitions. We currently operate as one business segment with a single management team that reports to the Chief Executive Officer.
During fiscal year 2019, we made a number of acquisitions and strategic investments that accelerated the expansion of our service offerings and entry into new markets. In September 2019, we acquired VitreosHealth, an innovator in advanced analytics for predictive and prescriptive health insights, bolstering our predictive analytics capability within our population health management solution and establishing our geographic presence in India. We also made a strategic investment in MedAdvisor, a leading digital medication management company based in Australia, to further evolve our population health management capabilities and potentially expand our international presence. In December 2019, we completed the acquisition of Accent, a payment accuracy and cost containment business. The addition of Accent enhances our capabilities across all of our coordination of benefit and payment integrity solutions and extends our reach in both new and established market segments, offering immediate market expansion and growth opportunities. 
We were originally incorporated in the State of New York in October 2002 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in July 2013. Our principal executive offices are located at 5615 High Point Drive, Irving, Texas 75038, and our telephone number is (214) 453-3000. As of December 31, 2019, we had approximately 3,100 employees. Additional information about HMS is available on our website at www.hms.com.

Our Solutions
We provide solutions that apply broadly across Medicaid, Medicare, commercial at-risk and employer self-insured populations. Our services span the payment and care continuum, from an individual’s enrollment in a healthcare program to pre-payment review of their claims, through post-payment identification and recovery of improper payments, and back to the individual where our consumer-driven solutions allow healthcare organizations to manage individuals' healthcare on a personal level, and at scale, using actionable analytics that drive individuals to take actions that improve health outcomes. Our coordination of benefits and payment integrity services ensure payment accuracy by addressing a wide spectrum of payment errors, including eligibility and coordination of benefits errors, the identification and investigation of potential fraud, and the review of claims on a prepayment and post-payment basis for improper payments and utilization effectiveness. Our population health management services assist customers in managing quality, risk, cost and compliance across all lines of business by engaging consumers, providing the tools to manage their care, and identifying existing or emerging health risk among consumer populations. As a result of these services, our customers saved billions of dollars in 2019 through the prevention of erroneous payments, improved clinical outcomes and reduced insurance plan enrollment turnover; and they received billions more in cash recoveries for improperly paid claims.
Our comprehensive solutions offer value throughout the healthcare continuum and include the following:
Coordination of Benefits (COB)
HMS provides a comprehensive, integrated suite of COB solutions to healthcare organizations, including Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, healthcare exchanges, commercial payers and other at-risk entities. We deliver high value to our customers by delivering timely and accurate information about members' other insurance coverage, which enables our customers to better coordinate care, maximize cost savings, ensure accurate reimbursement and reduce administrative rework. We provide verified insurance coverage information as early as the point of enrollment, as well as at the point of prior authorization, or prior to the payment of a claim, to maximize cost avoidance. We pursue recovery for any healthcare claim for which another party was liable to pay first. Experience and analytics inform our ability to accurately 
identify those claims and deploy workflows and processes that ensure we recover the maximum amount of inappropriately paid expenditures for our customers. 
We also assist customers in identifying other third-party insurance and recovering medical expenses where a member is involved in a casualty or tort incident. For Medicaid agencies exclusively, we provide estate recovery services to identify and recover Medicaid expenditures from the estates of deceased Medicaid members, in accordance with state policies. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our COB services represented 64.5%, 66.4% and 73.4% of our total revenue, respectively.
Payment Integrity (PI)
Our PI solutions and services employ advanced data analytics, leading technologies and clinical expertise to maximize savings and deliver proven, measureable results for federal and state governments, commercial health plans, and other at-risk or self-insured entities. We help our customers identify and avoid improper payments, recover those overpayments when they occur, detect and prevent fraud, ensure compliance with regulations, and increase cost savings with innovative technology and processes. Our PI solutions, delivered on a pre- and post-pay basis across all claims and provider types, are data-driven and stakeholder-sensitive, resulting in better payment accuracy, lower administrative costs, and decreased incidents of fraud and abuse. We leverage predictive and prescriptive analytics, AI, NLP, and ML, and incorporate RPA into our operations for increased efficiency and operational effectiveness. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our PI services represented 25.9%, 24.1% and 20.0% of our total revenue, respectively.
Population Health Management (PHM)
HMS' comprehensive PHM solutions reduce cost, enhance engagement and improve outcomes throughout the member lifecycle. Our flexible, scalable architecture and modular platform integrates early risk identification, advanced analytics, multi- channel outreach and care management components to help our customers target the right members at the right time for interventions, with outreach that drives action and change. Our prescriptive approach leverages AI, ML, NLP and efficacy studies to proactively manage care for all members, drive better outcomes and quality scores, and enhance member satisfaction and retention, while reducing administrative and medical spend. Our PHM solutions enable our customers to understand the health of their unique populations in real-time, and identify future risks, then develop personalized care plans and actionable engagement programs for maximum return on investment. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our PHM services represented 9.6%, 9.5% and 6.6%, of our total revenue, respectively.
Intellectual Property
Our ability to develop and maintain the proprietary aspects of our technology and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of others is important to our business and competitive position. We establish and protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property through a combination of patents, patent applications, trademarks, copyrights, domain names and trade secrets, as well as through contractual rights, including confidentiality, non-disclosure and invention assignment agreements, and other security measures.
As of December 31, 2019, our patent portfolio is comprised of approximately 80 domestic and international patents, and we are currently pursuing several patent applications in the United States and around the world. Our principal trademarks are our company name and corresponding design marks, including but not limited to HMS®, Eliza®, Essette®, VitreosHealth® and Accent®, and our key product marks, such as Elli®, COBManager® and other marks for our products. We also hold copyrights relating to certain aspects of our solutions and services. While we consider all of our intellectual and proprietary rights important to HMS, we believe our business as a whole is not materially dependent on any particular patent, trademark, license or other intellectual property right.
Customers
We provide our solutions to customers across a broad range of entities within the healthcare industry, including state and federal government agencies, health plans and PBMs, healthcare exchanges, employers, at-risk providers and ACOs, and other healthcare organizations. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our total revenue was $626.4 million, $598.3 million and $521.2 million, respectively. No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue during any period presented.
The composition of our 10 largest customers changes periodically. For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, our 10 largest customers represented 42.7%, 41.4% and 39.5% of our total revenue, respectively. We provide services under contracts (or subcontracts) that contain various revenue structures, including contingent revenue and to a lesser extent fixed-fee arrangements as well as cost-plus and time-and-materials pricing. The current terms of many of our federal and state government contracts range from one to five years, including renewal terms at the option of the customer. In many instances, we provide our services pursuant to agreements that are subject to periodic reprocurements. Several of our contracts, including those with some of our largest customers, may be terminated for convenience, in whole or in part, by the customer. Because we provide our services pursuant to agreements that are open to competition from various businesses in the U.S. healthcare arena, we cannot provide assurance that our contracts, including those with our largest customers, will not be terminated for convenience or awarded to other parties. Additionally, we cannot provide assurance that any contracts that are renewed will have the same fee structures as the expiring contracts or otherwise be on satisfactory terms. The early termination of key contracts with significant customers, or the inability to renew such contracts on favorable terms or at all, may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.
In providing solutions and services to our customers, we rely heavily upon our technology systems and networks, as well as on those of third-party providers, to process, transmit, maintain, store and host the confidential, proprietary and sensitive information and data we receive from our customers and other data suppliers, including private insurance plans and financial institutions. The secure processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Although we have spent significant resources to implement security and privacy programs and controls, train our workforce and enhance our security measures with the implementation of new technologies and processes, our information technology and infrastructure, and those of third parties on which we rely , could continue to be potentially subject to various forms of cyber-attacks, as further discussed under the heading “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”
Healthcare Landscape
The market for cost containment solutions is large and growing, driven by increasing healthcare costs, rising program enrollment and payment complexities. Established in 1965 under the Social Security Act, Medicaid provides health insurance and long-term care services and support to low-income families and individuals with disabilities in the United States. Medicaid is funded jointly by the federal and state governments and administered by the states. The Balanced Budget Act of 1997 created CHIP to help states expand coverage primarily to children whose families earned too much to qualify for Medicaid, yet not enough to afford private health insurance. Medicare is a federal program that is administered by CMS, and provides eligible persons age 65 and over and some disabled persons with a variety of hospital, medical insurance and prescription drug benefits. All three of these programs have opted to contract with managed care organizations in whole or in part as a means of delivering quality healthcare to program beneficiaries and controlling costs.
By law, Medicaid programs serve as the payer of last resort and all other sources of coverage must pay for medical costs incurred by a Medicaid-eligible individual. The TPL rules of the Medicaid statute require, among other things, that states take reasonable measures to identify potentially liable third parties and process claims accordingly. Since 1985, we have provided state Medicaid agencies with services to identify third parties with primary liability for paying claims for Medicaid members, and since 2005, we have provided similar services to Medicaid managed care plans.
The Deficit Reduction Act enacted by Congress in 2006 contained provisions to strengthen the TPL rules and created the Medicaid Integrity Program under the Social Security Act to increase the government’s capacity to prevent, detect and address fraud, waste and abuse in the Medicaid program. Later that year, Congress passed the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, which established the Medicare RAC program. These measures, at both the federal and state level, have strengthened our ability to identify and recover erroneous payments on behalf of our customers. We became the Medicare RAC for Region D with our acquisition of HealthDataInsights, Inc. ("HDI") in 2011 and again were awarded a region under the new Medicare RAC contracts in October 2016. We also serve as a Medicaid RAC to certain states pursuant to provisions of the ACA.
The ACA, generally referred to as "Obamacare," was signed into law on March 23, 2010. The law aimed to decrease the uninsured population in the U.S. by expanding Medicaid, enabling access to healthcare coverage through health insurance exchanges, and mandating coverage for pre-existing conditions and other healthcare situations. It is estimated that 20 million people have gained healthcare coverage as a result of the ACA.
For 2020, Medicare and Medicaid are projected to pay approximately 38% of the nation’s healthcare expenditures and serve over 146.3 million beneficiaries. Many of these beneficiaries are enrolled in managed care plans, which have the responsibility for both patient care and claims adjudication. The dual aims of cost containment and quality healthcare outcomes are the same across all at-risk entities, including commercial health plans and government healthcare programs, such as Medicaid and Medicare.
Within the commercial market, health plans sell policies directly to individuals (on the open market or via health insurance exchanges), contract with employers to underwrite their employees’ care, or contract with self-insured employers to oversee benefit administration for their employees. This market also includes a growing number of risk bearing provider-sponsored plans that operate and market health plan benefits. According to CMS NHE projections, private health insurance covered approximately 196.3 million individuals at a cost of approximately $1.28 trillion in 2019.
Several commercial health plans also offer government-sponsored lines of business, including partnering with Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP to oversee care delivery for beneficiaries enrolled in those programs. States continue to focus on improving value, quality and outcomes through arrangements with MCOs. At the end of 2019, 47 Medicaid programs operated with some form of managed care, and North Carolina reported plans to implement a managed care program in 2020. Comprehensive risk-based managed care continues to be the predominant delivery system for Medicaid services in the U.S. Among the 40 programs with comprehensive risk-based MCOs, 33 reported that 75% or more of their Medicaid beneficiaries were enrolled in MCOs as of July 1, 2019. Two states (Maine and Virginia) implemented the ACA Medicaid expansion in 2019, bringing the total number of states to 34. As of July 1, 2019, 29 of these states were using MCOs to cover newly eligible adults. Managed care health plans continue to assume risk for Medicare lives, with approximately one-third (34%) of all Medicare beneficiaries, or 22 million people, enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans in 2019.
HMS continues to serve government agency fee-for-service programs at the state and federal level. These plans are generally reliant on and susceptible to the government appropriations process that determines their budget and governs the number of beneficiaries they serve. According to the CMS NHE projections, Medicare programs in 2019 covered approximately 60.4 million people at a cost of approximately $800.1 billion and Medicaid/CHIP covered approximately 82.4 million people, costing approximately $643.9 billion. Altogether, it is projected that the government programs we serve covered approximately 142.8 million people at a total cost of nearly $1.44 trillion in 2019.
CMS projects that Medicare enrollment growth will increase by 2.81% in 2020, with expenditures to increase by 7.19% in 2020 compared to 2019; and Medicaid/CHIP enrollment growth will increase by 2.18% in 2020, with expenditures to increase by 4.96% in 2020 compared to 2019. As commercial and government health plans focus on strategies to contain costs across their different lines of business, HMS will continue offering solutions to meet their evolving needs.
Competitors
The U.S. healthcare marketplace is a dynamic industry with a range of businesses currently offering cost containment services, both directly or indirectly (through subcontracting), to some or all of the various healthcare payers, providers, employers and consumers. In addition, with improvements in technology and the growth in healthcare spending, new businesses are incentivized to enter this marketplace. Many customers also have the ability to perform some or all of the needed cost containment services themselves and choose to exercise that option to varying degrees. Therefore, competition is robust as customers have many alternatives available to them in their effort to contain healthcare costs.
We compete based on a variety of factors, including our ability to provide a broad range of solutions that span the entire healthcare claims payment and care services continuum. These include payment accuracy solutions focused on COB and PI related functions, as well as PHM solutions that support the ability of payers to better understand and engage consumers, perform effective outreach, and impact both costs and health outcomes.
We have a proven record of delivering results that optimize savings and recoveries, enabled by:
▪in-depth government and commercial healthcare program experience;
▪a nationally-acclaimed technology team with analytics, engineering, infrastructure and security expertise;
▪robust data that drives value solutions;
▪prescriptive and predictive analytics, applied across Medicaid, Medicare and commercial at-risk populations;
▪an experienced team of clinical experts, supported by a panel of credentialed physicians from all specialties with deep healthcare policy and program expertise; 
▪ongoing technology investment in big data, AI, ML, NLP and RPA;
▪long-term relationships with customers and other industry stakeholders; and
▪an ability to provide customers with actionable intelligence to improve clinical outcomes, optimize patient engagement, and better manage costs.
Our competitors range in size from large, diversified national companies, to small, specialized firms. Some of these competitors have significantly greater financial and technical resources, and others have longer operating histories and greater name recognition than we do in certain markets. Within our payment accuracy portfolio of products and services, we compete primarily with large business outsourcing and technology firms, claims processors, healthcare consulting firms, and other vendors who provide some or all of these solutions to payers. In addition, we frequently work with customers who may elect to perform some or all of their cost avoidance and recovery functions in-house. Within the population health management sector, we compete primarily with vendors who provide care management, consumer engagement, and related technology services. Examples of companies with whom we currently compete across our offerings include:

▪ | Accenture plc | ▪ | Casenet LLC | ▪ | Change Healthcare 
▪ | Cotiviti, Inc. | ▪ | DXC Technology Company | ▪ | ExlService Holdings, Inc. 
▪ | IBM Watson Health | ▪ | Inovalon Holdings, Inc. | ▪ | MEDecision, Inc. 
▪ | MHK | ▪ | Performant Financial Corporation | ▪ | Optum, Inc. (subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group; Equian is part of Optum)
▪ | WellTok, Inc. | ▪ | ZeOmega, Inc. | | 

Business Strategy
We believe that the steadily increasing enrollment and rising expenditures for Medicare and Medicaid, with most new enrollees entering managed care plans; an aging U.S. population with an increasing concentration of individuals with high-cost chronic conditions and often co-morbidities; and the overall complexity of the healthcare claims payment system in the U.S. all combine to create substantial growth opportunities for the suite of cost containment solutions we offer.
We also believe these factors present growth opportunities for our PHM services. We are focused on growing our business over the course of 2020 and beyond, both organically and inorganically, by leveraging existing key assets (e.g., our data, analytics, in-house expertise, and distribution channel) and pursuing a number of strategic objectives or initiatives, including:
▪Expanding the scope of our relationship with existing customers – by selling additional solutions and services to our broad customer base, including those designed to improve consumer engagement and improve clinical outcomes.
▪Adding new customers – by marketing to commercial health plans, including Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage plans, at-risk group and individual health lines of business, and ASO plans; government healthcare payers, including Medicaid agencies, state employee health benefit plans and CHIPs; at-risk provider organizations and ACOs; and commercial self-insured employers.
▪Entering new markets for diversification and growth – by expanding into adjacent markets, such as Medicare, Medicare Advantage and risk-bearing providers; leveraging opportunities through our international operations to access new markets overseas; developing and launching new and enhanced PI, PHM and engagement solutions targeted at global and high-growth markets; and executing acquisitions and strategic investments of complementary businesses.
▪Introducing new innovative solutions and services – through internal development initiatives designed to enhance or expand our existing suite of cost containment solutions.
▪Utilizing technology tools to leverage a big data environment – to further enhance our analytics, create a more nimble operating environment, create operating efficiencies, improve the yield on our existing solution suite and identify new revenue opportunities within our current service delivery models.
▪Promoting automation and innovation to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our services – by continuing to implement new technology and process improvements designed to increase recovery yields, increase customer satisfaction and achieve greater operating efficiencies.
▪Prudent deployment of capital – by investing in our IT infrastructure; internal growth initiatives; capabilities, technologies, and assets to complement our cost-containment expertise; building or acquiring adjacent population health management capabilities to complement our PHM solution set; and expanding our data analytics capabilities. Our focus may include acquisitions that represent long-term growth potential, target high-growth areas, are accretive to earnings, enhance our technological capabilities and fill a strategic need in our business portfolio as we seek to provide increasingly comprehensive solutions to our customers. We may also repurchase our shares, pursuant to a two-year $50 million authority granted by our Board of Directors in November 2019.
