 The Companys News and Information Services products compete with a wide range of media businesses, including print publications, digital media and information services. 
 The Companys newspapers, magazines, digital publications and radio stations compete for consumers, audience and advertising with other local and national newspapers, web and application-based media, magazines and radio stations, social media sources, as well as other media such as television and outdoor displays. Competition for subscriptions and circulation is based on news and editorial content, subscription pricing, cover price and, from time to time, various promotions. Competition for advertising is based upon advertisers judgments as to the most effective media for their advertising budgets, which is in turn based upon various factors, including circulation volume, readership levels, audience demographics, advertising rates and advertising effectiveness. As a result of rapidly changing and evolving technologies, distribution platforms and business models, the consumer-focused businesses within the Companys News and Information Services segment, including its newspaper businesses, continue to face increasing competition for both circulation and advertising revenue from a variety of alternative news and information sources. These include both paid and free websites, digital applications, news aggregators, blogs, search engines, social media platforms, digital advertising networks and exchanges, bidding and other programmatic advertising buying channels, as well as other emerging media and distribution platforms. Shifts in consumer behavior, including the widespread adoption of mobile phones, tablets, e-book readers and other portable devices as platforms through which news and information is consumed, require the Company to continually innovate and improve upon its own products, services and platforms in order to remain competitive. The Company believes that these changes will continue to pose opportunities and challenges, and that it is well positioned to leverage its global reach, brand recognition and proprietary technology to take advantage of the opportunities presented by these changes. 
 Dow Jones professional information products that target enterprise customers compete with various information service providers, compliance data providers and global financial newswires, including Thomson Reuters, Bloomberg L.P., LexisNexis, as well as many other providers of news, information and compliance data.

NAM competes against other providers of advertising, marketing and merchandising products and services, including those that provide promotional or advertising inserts, direct mailers of promotional or advertising materials, providers of point-of-purchase and other in-store programs and providers of savings and/or grocery-focused digital applications, as well as other marketing products and services. Competition is based on, among other things, rates, availability of markets, quality of products and services provided and their effectiveness, rate of coupon redemption, store coverage and other factors. The Company believes that based on the scale of NAMs home-delivered products, the reach of its in-store marketing products and the growing audience for its digital marketing platform, NAM provides broader consumer access than many of its competitors. The Company is also actively investing in shopper research and data-based insights that enable an advanced understanding of how to apply the Companys media and incentive network to achieve the greatest impact and value for clients and partners.

 The Companys Book Publishing segment consists of HarperCollins Publishers (together with its subsidiaries and affiliates, HarperCollins), the second largest consumer book publisher in the world based on global revenue, with operations in 18 countries.

HarperCollins publishes fiction and nonfiction, with a focus on general, childrens and religious content. Additionally, in the U.K., HarperCollins publishes titles for the equivalent of the K-12 educational market. 
 As of June 30, 2017, HarperCollins offered approximately 100,000 publications in digital formats, and nearly all of HarperCollins new titles, as well as the majority of its entire catalog, are available as e-books. Digital sales, comprising revenues generated through the sale of e-books as well as digital audio books, represented approximately 19% of global consumer revenues for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2017. With the widespread adoption of electronic formats by consumers, HarperCollins is publishing a number of titles in digital formats before, or instead of, publishing a print edition. 
 During fiscal 2017, HarperCollins U.S. had 184 titles on the New York Times print and digital bestseller lists, with 20 titles hitting number one, including Hillbilly Elegy by J.D. Vance, Commonwealth by Ann Patchett, Settle for More by Megyn Kelly, The Black Widow by Daniel Silva, Hidden Figures by Margot Lee Shetterly, The Magnolia Story by Chip and Joanna Gaines, Carve the Mark by Veronica Roth and The Hate U Give by Angie Thomas. 
 HarperCollins derives its revenue from the sale of print and digital books to a customer base that includes global technology companies, traditional brick and mortar booksellers, wholesale clubs and discount stores, including Amazon, Apple, Barnes & Noble and Tesco. Revenues at the Book Publishing segment are significantly affected by the timing of releases and the number of HarperCollins books in the marketplace, and are typically highest during the Companys second fiscal quarter due to increased demand during the end-of-year holiday season in its main operating geographies. 
 The book publishing business operates in a highly competitive market that is quickly changing and continues to see technological innovations. HarperCollins competes with other large publishers, such as Penguin Random House, Simon & Schuster and Hachette Livre, as well as with numerous smaller publishers, for the rights to 
 
9 
 
 works by well-known authors and public personalities; competition could also come from new entrants as barriers to entry in book publishing are low. In addition, HarperCollins competes for consumers with other media formats and sources such as movies, television programming, magazines and mobile content. The Company believes HarperCollins is well positioned in the evolving book publishing market with significant size and brand recognition across multiple categories and geographies. Furthermore, HarperCollins is a leader in childrens and religious books, categories which have been less impacted by the transition to digital consumption. 
 Digital Real Estate Services 
 The Companys Digital Real Estate Services segment consists primarily of its 61.6% interest in REA Group Limited (REA Group), a publicly-traded company listed on ASX (ASX: REA), and its 80% interest in Move, Inc.

Realtor.com® and its related mobile applications display approximately 98% of all MLS-listed, for-sale properties in the U.S., which are primarily sourced directly from relationships with MLSs across the country. Approximately 95% of its for-sale listings are updated at least every 15 minutes, on average, with the remaining listings updated daily. Realtor.com®s content advantage attracts a highly engaged consumer audience.

These users viewed an average of over two billion pages and spent an average of over one billion minutes on the realtor.com® website and mobile applications each month. 
 Realtor.com® generates the majority of its revenues through the sale of listing advertisement products, including ConnectionsSM for Buyers and AdvantageSM Pro, which allow real estate agents, brokers and franchises to enhance, prioritize and connect with consumers on for-sale property listings within the realtor.com® website and mobile applications. Listing advertisements are typically sold on a subscription basis. Realtor.com® also derives revenue from sales of non-listing advertisement, or Media, products to real estate, finance, insurance, home improvement and other professionals that enable those professionals to connect with realtor.com®s highly engaged and valuable consumer audience. Media products include sponsorships, display advertisements, text links, directories and Digital Advertising Package.

11 
 
 Australia. FOX SPORTS Australia also operates foxsports.com.au, a leading general sports website in Australia, and offers several interactive mobile and tablet applications that extend the reach of its content across multiple platforms. FOX SPORTS Australia is distributed via longstanding carriage agreements with pay-TV providers (mainly Foxtel) in Australia and generates revenue primarily through affiliate fees payable under these carriage agreements, as well as advertising sales. Results at the Cable Network Programming segment can fluctuate due to the timing and mix of the Companys local and international sports programming, as expenses associated with licensing certain programming rights are recognized during the applicable season or event. 
 FOX SPORTS Australia competes primarily with ESPN, beIN SPORTS, the Free-To-Air (FTA) channels and certain telecommunications companies in Australia. 
 Australian News Channel 
 ANC, acquired in December 2016, owns and operates six channels featuring the latest in news, politics, sports, entertainment, public affairs, business and weather. ANC is licensed by Sky International AG to use Sky trademarks and domain names in connection with its operation and distribution of channels and services. ANCs channels consist of SKY NEWS LIVE, SKY NEWS BUSINESS, SKY NEWS WEATHER, SKY NEWS Multiview, A-PAC Australias Public Affairs Channel and SKY NEWS New Zealand. ANC channels are broadcast throughout Australia and New Zealand and available on Foxtel and Sky Television. ANC also owns and operates the international Australia Channel IPTV service and offers content across a variety of digital media platforms, including mobile, podcasts and social media websites. 
 ANC competes primarily with other news providers in Australia and New Zealand via its subscription television channels, third party content arrangements and free domain website. Its Australia Channel IPTV service also competes against over-the-top IPTV subscription-based news providers in regions outside of Australia and New Zealand. 
 Other 
 The Other segment includes the Companys general corporate overhead expenses, corporate Strategy and Creative Group and costs related to the U.K. Newspaper Matters. The Companys corporate Strategy and Creative Group was formed to identify new products and services across the Companys businesses to increase revenues and profitability and to target and assess potential acquisitions, investments and dispositions. Initiatives include News IQ, the Companys new data-driven digital advertising platform that will enable targeting and engagement of audiences at scale across our network of assets. As part of its ongoing role in assessing potential acquisitions and investments, the corporate Strategy and Creative Group also oversaw the Companys acquisitions of Move, a leading provider of online real estate services in the U.S., and Unruly, a leading global video advertising distribution platform, as well as its strategic digital investments in India, including Elara, which owns PropTiger.com, Housing.com and Makaan.com. 
Equity Investments 
 Foxtel 
 The Company and Telstra, an ASX-listed telecommunications company, each own 50% of Foxtel, the largest pay-TV provider in Australia. Foxtel had approximately 2.8 million subscribing households throughout Australia as of June 30, 2017 through cable, satellite and IP distribution. 
 Foxtel delivers 200 channels (including standard definition channels, high definition versions of some of those channels and audio and interactive channels) covering news, sports, general entertainment, movies, documentaries, music and childrens programming. Foxtels premium content includes FOX SPORTS Australias suite of sports channels such as FOX SPORTS 501, FOX LEAGUE, FOX SPORTS 503, FOX 
 
12 
 
 FOOTY, FOX SPORTS 505, FOX SPORTS 506, FOX SPORTS MORE and FOX SPORTS NEWS, and television content from HBO, FOX and Universal, among others. Foxtel also owns and operates 30 channels, including general entertainment and movie channels, and sources an extensive range of movie programming through arrangements with major U.S. studios. Foxtels channels are distributed to subscribers via both Telstras hybrid fibrecoaxial cable network and a long-term contracted satellite platform provided by Optus. Cable and satellite distribution is enabled by Foxtels set-top boxes, including the iQ3. Foxtel also offers versions of its services via the Internet through Foxtel Now, an Internet television service available on a number of compatible devices (including mobile phones, tablets, personal computers, Chromecast, Telstra TV, Sony PlayStation, Xbox One and select smart TVs), and Foxtel App, an Internet television service that allows subscribers to watch Foxtel channels via mobile devices and tablets. Foxtel also offers a triple play bundle product, which consists of Foxtels existing pay-TV services, sold together with broadband and/or home phone services. 
 Foxtel generates revenue primarily through subscription revenue as well as advertising revenue. For the year ended June 30, 2017, in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), Foxtel recorded revenues of $2.4 billion, net income of $59 million and earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, of $568 million. Management believes that EBITDA is an appropriate measure for evaluating the operating performance of this business for the reasons set forth in Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResults of OperationsSegment Analysis with respect to Segment EBITDA. In the year ended June 30, 2017, Foxtels average broadcast residential recurring subscription revenue per user, or ARPU, was A$86 (US$65) per month (as calculated by Foxtel), and its annualized residential subscriber churn rate based on data for the year ended June 30, 2017 was 15.1% (as calculated by Foxtel). In addition, Foxtel had approximately $1.65 billion of indebtedness outstanding as of June 30, 2017 (excluding $740 million of shareholder loans due to Telstra and the Company). The amount included for Foxtel in the Companys Equity earnings of affiliates was $(265) million for the year ended June 30, 2017. 
 The Company and Telstra each have the right to appoint one-half of the board of directors of Foxtel. In addition, the Company has the right to appoint the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer of Foxtel, while Telstra has the right to terminate these officers. 
 Foxtel competes for audiences primarily with FTA TV operators in Australia, including the three major commercial FTA networks and two major government-funded FTA broadcasters, as well as other pay-TV operators, IP television providers and subscription video-on-demand services such as Fetch TV, Netflix, Stan and Amazon Prime Video. Foxtel provides a 200-channel selection with premium and exclusive content and a wide array of digital and mobile features that are not available to viewers on these alternative providers. Through innovations such as digital HD channels, the extension of pay-TV programming to mobile devices, the use of DVR and Electronic Program Guide technology, including the iQ3 set-top box, its investment in On Demand capability and programming and benefits through broadband bundling, the Company believes Foxtel offers subscribers a compelling alternative to its competitors. 
 Governmental Regulation 
 General 
 Various aspects of the Companys activities are subject to regulation in numerous jurisdictions around the world. The introduction of new laws and regulations in countries where the Companys products and services are produced or distributed, and changes in the enforcement of existing laws and regulations in those countries, could have a negative impact on the Companys interests. 
Australian Media Regulation 
 The Companys subscription television interests are subject to Australias regulatory framework for the broadcasting industry. The key regulatory body for the Australian broadcasting industry is the Australian Communications and Media Authority. 
 
13 
 
Key regulatory issues for subscription television providers include: (a) anti-siphoning restrictionscurrently under the anti-siphoning provisions of the Australian Broadcasting Services Act 1992 (Cth), subscription television providers are prevented from acquiring rights to televise certain listed events (for example, the Olympic Games and certain Australian Rules football and cricket matches) unless national and commercial television broadcasters have not obtained these rights 12 weeks before the start of the event or the rights to televise are also held by commercial television licensees who have rights to televise the event to more than 50% of the Australian population or the rights to televise are also held by one of Australias two major government-funded broadcasters; and (b) the Broadcasting Services Act also may impact the Companys ownership structure and operations and restrict its ability to take advantage of acquisition or investment opportunities including, for example, preventing it from exercising control of a commercial television broadcasting license, a commercial radio license and a newspaper in the same license area. 
 Data Privacy and Security 
 Our business activities are subject to laws and regulations governing the collection, use, sharing, protection and retention of personal data, which continue to evolve and have implications for how such data is managed. For example, in the U.S., certain of the Companys websites, mobile applications and other online business activities are subject to the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, which prohibits websites from collecting personally identifiable information online from children under age 13 without prior parental consent. In addition, the Federal Trade Commission continues to expand its application of general consumer protection laws to commercial data practices, including to the use of personal and profiling data from online users to deliver targeted Internet advertisements. Most states have also enacted legislation regulating data privacy and security, including laws requiring businesses to provide notice to state agencies and to individuals whose personally identifiable information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach. 
 Similar laws and regulations have been implemented in many of the other jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including the European Union and Australia. For example, the European Union adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which is intended to provide a uniform set of rules for personal data processing throughout the European Union and to replace the existing Data Protection Directive (Directive 95/46/EC). Fully applicable and enforceable as of May 25, 2018, the GDPR expands the regulation of the collection, processing, use and security of personal data, contains stringent conditions for consent from data subjects, strengthens the rights of individuals, including the right to have personal data deleted upon request, continues to restrict the trans-border flow of such data, requires companies to conduct privacy impact assessments to evaluate data processing operations that are likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, requires mandatory data breach reporting and notification, significantly increases penalties for non-compliance (up to 20 million Euros, or approximately 23 million U.S. dollars, or 4% of an entitys worldwide annual turnover in the preceding financial year, whichever is higher) and increases the enforcement powers of the data protection authorities. The European Union is also considering an update to its Privacy and Electronic Communication (e-Privacy) Directive to, among other things, amend the current directives rules on the use of cookies. 
 In 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-E.U. Safe Harbor framework, one of the legal mechanisms through which personal data could be transferred from the European Union to the United States, and the mechanism relied upon by the Company with respect to certain personal data transfers among the Companys businesses, and between the Company and some of its third party service providers. In 2016, the European Commission adopted a new transfer mechanism between the U.S. and the E.U. called the Privacy Shield. The Company has not certified to, and does not rely on, the Privacy Shield framework for data transfers among the Companys businesses and instead relies on other mechanisms. However, certain of the Companys service providers do rely on the Privacy Shield. The Privacy Shield is subject to significant uncertainty, including an annual review procedure by U.S. and E.U. authorities, that could affect the Companys or its service providers obligations thereunder. The other mechanisms that the Company and certain of its service providers rely on to address the European data protection requirements for transfers of data, including the European Union standard 
 
14 
 
 Model Contractual Clauses, are also subject to uncertainty and legal challenges. Challenges to existing data transfer mechanisms, and any future legal challenges to data transfer mechanisms that may be adopted, could cause the Company to incur additional costs, require us to change business practices or affect the manner in which we provide our services. 
 In Australia, data privacy laws impose additional requirements on organizations that handle personal data by, among other things, requiring the disclosure of cross-border data transfers, placing restrictions on direct marketing practices and imposing mandatory data breach reporting, and additional data privacy and security requirements and industry standards are under consideration. 
 Industry participants in the U.S., Europe and Australia have taken steps to increase compliance with relevant industry-level standards and practices, including the implementation of self-regulatory regimes for online behavioral advertising that impose obligations on participating companies, such as the Company, to give consumers a better understanding of advertisements that are customized based on their online behavior. 
 The interpretation and application of data privacy and security laws are often uncertain, in flux, and evolving in the United States and internationally. The Company continues to monitor pending legislation and regulatory initiatives to ascertain relevance, analyze impact and develop strategic direction surrounding regulatory trends and developments, including any changes required in the Companys data privacy and security compliance programs. 
 U.K. Press Regulation 
 As a result of the implementation of recommendations of the Leveson inquiry into the U.K. press, which was established by former Prime Minister David Cameron in mid-2011, a Royal Charter on Self-Regulation of the Press was granted in 2013, which established a Press Recognition Panel responsible for approving, overseeing and monitoring a new press regulatory body or bodies. Once approved by the Press Recognition Panel, the new press regulatory body or bodies would be responsible for overseeing participating publishers. In addition to the Royal Charter and establishment of the new Press Recognition Panel, legislation has been passed that provides that publishers who are not members of an approved regulator may be liable for exemplary damages in certain cases where such damages are not currently awarded and, if Section 40 of the Crime and Courts Act 2013 is enacted, the payment of costs for both parties in libel actions in certain circumstances. 
 In late 2013, publications representing the majority of the industry in the U.K., including News UK, entered into binding contracts to form an alternative new regulator instead, the Independent Press Standards Organisation, or IPSO. IPSO, which began operating in September 2014, currently has no plans to apply for recognition from the Press Recognition Panel. IPSO has an independent chairman and a 12-member board, the majority of which are independent. IPSO oversees the Editors Code of Practice, requires members to implement appropriate internal governance processes and requires self-reporting of any failures, provides a complaints handling service, has the ability to require publications to print corrections and has the power to investigate serious or systemic breaches of the Editors Code of Practice and levy fines of up to £1 million. IPSO has also introduced a pilot arbitration scheme to resolve claims against publications. The burdens IPSO imposes on the print media, including the Companys newspaper publishing businesses in the U.K., may result in competitive disadvantages versus other forms of media and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance. 
 U.K. Radio Broadcasting Regulation 
 The Companys radio stations in the U.K. and Ireland are also subject to governmental regulation by the relevant broadcast authorities as the Company is required to obtain and maintain licenses from such authorities to operate these stations. Although the Company expects its licenses will, where relevant, be renewed in the ordinary course upon their expiration, there can be no assurance that this will be the case. Non-compliance by the Company with the requirements associated with such licenses or other applicable laws and regulations, including of the relevant 
 
15 
 
 authority, could result in fines, additional license conditions, license revocation or other adverse regulatory actions. 
 Intellectual Property 
 The Companys intellectual property assets include: copyrights in newspapers, books, television programming and other content and technologies; trademarks in names and logos; trade names; domain names; and licenses of intellectual property rights. In addition, its intellectual property assets include patents or patent applications for inventions related to its products, business methods and/or services, none of which are material to its financial condition or results of operations. The Company derives value and revenue from these assets through, among other things, print and digital newspaper and magazine subscriptions and sales, the sale, distribution and/or licensing of print and digital books, the sale of subscriptions to its content and information services, the operation of websites and other digital properties and the distribution and/or licensing of its television programming to cable and satellite television services. 
 The Company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property assets in the U.S., the U.K., Australia and other foreign territories. To protect these assets, the Company relies upon a combination of copyright, trademark, unfair competition, patent, trade secret and other laws and contract provisions. However, there can be no assurance of the degree to which these measures will be successful in any given case. Policing unauthorized use of the Companys products, services and content and related intellectual property is often difficult and the steps taken may not in every case prevent the infringement by unauthorized third parties of the Companys intellectual property. The Company seeks to limit such threat through a combination of approaches, including pursuing legal sanctions for infringement, promoting appropriate legislative initiatives and international treaties and enhancing public awareness of the meaning and value of intellectual property and intellectual property laws. Piracy, including in the digital environment, continues to present a threat to revenues from products and services based on intellectual property. 
 Third parties may challenge the validity or scope of the Companys intellectual property from time to time, and such challenges could result in the limitation or loss of intellectual property rights. Irrespective of their validity, such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources that could have an adverse effect on the Companys operations. Moreover, effective intellectual property protection may be either unavailable or limited in certain foreign territories. Therefore, the Company engages in efforts to strengthen and update intellectual property protection around the world, including efforts to ensure the effective enforcement of intellectual property laws and remedies for infringement. 
 Raw Materials 
 As a major publisher of newspapers, magazines, free-standing inserts and books, the Company utilizes substantial quantities of various types of paper. In order to obtain the best available prices, substantially all of the Companys paper purchasing is done on a regional, volume purchase basis, and draws upon major paper manufacturing countries around the world. The Company believes that under present market conditions, its sources of paper supply used in its publishing activities are adequate. 
Employees 
 As of June 30, 2017, the Company had approximately 26,000 employees, of whom approximately 9,000 were located in the U.S., 4,000 were located in the U.K. and 9,000 were located in Australia. Of the Companys employees, approximately 5,000 were represented by various employee unions. The contracts with such unions will expire during various times over the next several years. The Company believes its current relationships with employees are generally good.
