Item 1. BUSINESS
Overview
 We are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing impactful medicines for patients and families living with rare neurological disorders. We believe these disorders represent an attractive area for drug development as the understanding of the underlying biology has grown meaningfully over the last few years and today represent a substantial opportunity medically and commercially. Based on the rapid increase in scientific understanding of the role of genetics and key biological pathways relevant to diseases of the brain, we aim to identify, discover and develop novel compounds for the treatment of rare neurological disorders. We have built a deep knowledge of such diseases, how to treat them and how to develop the clinically meaningful endpoints required for development of a compound in these disorders. As a result of this knowledge, we have developed a pipeline of first-in-class compounds and programs and have demonstrated our model by progressing compounds through to late-stage development. We continue to execute on our strategy to build this pipeline by discovering, in-licensing and collaborating with leading biopharmaceutical companies and academic institutions.
Our Focus: Rare Neurological Disorders
 Rare neurological disorders are among the most devastating in their impact on patients and their families. Patients suffering from these disorders typically require full-time care, and yet are among the most underserved. We believe that there are at least 100 neurodevelopmental disorders, epileptic encephalopathies and other related rare neurological disorders that we may be able to target. These disorders are characterized by impairments in the growth, development and functioning of the brain. Due to a historical overwhelming preference in the drug industry to develop drugs for broader neurological indications, many of these disorders have no approved therapies. As a result, recent scientific advancements have been overlooked, which we believe presents us with an opportunity to pursue these indications. These reasons include:

• | High penetrance linking genetic defect to disorder pathology. Some rare neurological disorders have a genetic origin and typically have a strong correlation, or penetrance, between the presence of a gene and the manifestation of the corresponding disease pathology. As a result, we believe in those cases we can develop drug candidates that will be efficacious in patients with a given genetic profile.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Predictive genetic and other models. Recent advances in genetics enable us to employ predictive in vitro and in vivo genetic models of certain of these disorders. These models allow us to evaluate and observe a drug candidate’s potential activity prior to initiation of clinical trials. Through these models, we believe we will be able to select the most relevant clinical endpoints for our trials and increase the potential for clinical success.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Overlapping pathophysiology and symptoms. Neurological disorders are often characterized by a number of overlapping symptoms, such as seizures, sleep disturbances, movement deficiencies and behavioral manifestations. We believe these commonalities will enable us to employ clinical endpoints that may be translatable from one disorder to another, and to develop drugs that may provide a clinical benefit across multiple indications.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Early observation of proof-of-concept. By employing clinical endpoints that are highly relevant and are designed to detect meaningful clinical benefits, we anticipate that many of our studies may provide early proof-of-concept in clinical development.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Potential ability to affect disease progression. We are focusing on disorders that are typically diagnosed in early childhood when the brain is still developing. We believe that we may be able to meaningfully address symptoms and potentially alter the progression of disease, especially if the drug can be administered early in life. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Motivated and accessible patient populations. We are targeting our programs for disorders with motivated and accessible patient populations. We believe that the patients and caregivers affected by these disorders are avid users of social media, in order to learn about and share relevant information and experiences. We use digital platforms to efficiently identify new patients for our clinical trials, raise disease awareness and help connect the patient and caregiver communities. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Ovid Strategy
 
Our strategy is to pursue drug discovery and development for rare neurological disorders in a manner that is scientifically driven, patient focused and is coupled with an integrated and discipled approach to research, clinical development and business development. As we build on our understanding of these rare neurological conditions, we gain an appreciation of the way the different molecular mechanisms and pathways underlying these disorders help drive the symptoms patients suffer. This, in turn, benefits us with the knowledge gained about genetics, relevant molecular pathways, physiological impact and clinical endpoints from one disorder to another, which we believe will enable us to build a scalable scientific platform and efficient development capabilities. Ovid has set out to be a leader in this field, and by keeping our focus on neurology, it is our belief that this offers us the potential to produce multiple medicines in the future, and thereby succeed in our mission.

Scientifically Driven
 We take a scientifically driven approach to identify promising drug candidates for our pipeline. We are building our portfolio based on the existence of clear biological rationales, including a focus on disorders that have, where possible, a direct genetic linkage. We use our deep understanding of the area to identify mechanisms of action, appropriate targets and initial drug candidates. As we advance our drug candidates into and through the clinical evaluation, we are building on the emerging body of scientific and clinical insights developed by us and others in the biopharmaceutical industry to target these important disease pathways of the brain. As we evaluate data from previous and ongoing preclinical studies and clinical trials, we intend to refine and improve our scientific approach and apply these insights to continue to build our pipeline and conduct our clinical trials.
 In particular, our approach is driven by the following scientific principles:
  
• | identify the genetic origin of the disorder;
--+---------------------------------------------


• | develop understanding of gene expression and link to pathophysiology;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | target biological pathways or genes for which proof-of-concept has been established via in vitro or animal models;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | focus on the pathways and mechanisms that cause the pathology of the disorder and that generate the symptoms that we can target;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | target optimal mechanism of action for drug candidates; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


• | utilize biomarkers if present that can provide evidence of the activity of our drug candidates.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Patient Focused
 We are focused on the patient communities affected by the rare neurological disorders we address. We believe this aspect of our approach is critical. Each of these disorders affect small populations of patients, but carry serious morbidities and require extensive and specialized involvement from the patients’ families, caregivers, physicians and patient advocacy groups.
 Our strategy is enhanced by the following patient-focused principles:
  
• | develop close relationships with patients, caregivers, families, disease foundations and key opinion leaders, to better understand the history of these disorders, raise awareness, identify patients and facilitate enrollment of clinical trials;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | identify clinically meaningful endpoints based on input from patients and their physicians and caregivers; and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | develop digital capabilities to engage, foster and maintain close relationships with patient communities.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Research and Development Coupled with Business Development
 We have built a broad pipeline of potential drug candidates to treat rare neurological disorders.   Initially we in-licensed or partnered drug candidates. More recently our pipeline has been built through our internal research and development efforts in collaboration with external leaders in the field. The intended result is to develop a diversified pipeline to mitigate development risk and provide for scientific and medical opportunity. Central to the success of this process is coupling a highly focused and disciplined effort to link our research effort in key laboratories around the world aimed at discovering and securing relevant assets in selected rare neurological disorders.
 As a result, we have built a specialized, scalable and robust infrastructure that we believe will make us a leader in rare neurological disorders and the partner of choice for leading biopharmaceutical companies or academic institutions that wish to maximize the value of their neurology drug candidates or research platforms in these areas. This infrastructure spans across critical domains which include but are not exclusive of target discovery, drug delivery and clinical development. If and when our drug candidates are approved, we also plan to establish over time a focused commercial and distribution network dedicated to rare neurological disorders in the United States and Europe, where we believe the patient populations and medical specialists are sufficiently concentrated to effectively market our drug candidates. We believe that we are particularly well positioned to execute on our business development strategy because of both the extensive network of our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dr. Jeremy Levin and other members of our management team, as well as our demonstrated success in collaboration with partners including Takeda.

Our Pipeline
 Our efforts have already brought two drug candidates from proof of concept and either through pivotal trials or to the initiation of pivotal trials. The following table sets forth the status and mechanism of action of our drug candidates:

OV935 (soticlestat) 
 OV935 is being developed in a joint collaboration with Takeda for the treatment of rare epileptic encephalopathies. In January 2017, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Takeda, or the Takeda collaboration agreement, to develop and commercialize OV935 (soticlestat or TAK-935). Under the Takeda collaboration agreement, all costs and all profits are shared on a worldwide basis and Ovid leads development and in addition is responsible for commercialization in North America, Europe and Israel. 
 In March 2021, we entered into a royalty, license and termination agreement, or the Takeda License and Termination Agreement, with Takeda under which Takeda will secure global rights at closing from us to develop and commercialize the investigational medicine OV935 for the treatment of developmental and epileptic encephalopathies, including DS and LGS. Closing of the Takeda License and Termination Agreement is subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. See “Business—License and Collaboration Agreements—Agreements with Takeda—2021 Royalty, License and Termination Agreement with Takeda” for a discussion of the terms of the Takeda License and Termination Agreement.
 OV935 is a potent, highly selective inhibitor of the enzyme cholesterol 24-hydroxylase, or CH24H. We believe, if approved, OV935 has the potential to become a first-in-class and only-in-class compound targeting the metabolism of cholesterol in the brain. We believe that OV935 inhibits a key enzyme in cholesterol metabolism pathway in the brain and may modulate the excitatory signals involved in epilepsy, which may suppress seizures. CH24H is predominantly expressed in the brain, where it plays a central role in cholesterol homeostasis and neuronal physiology. Recent literature suggests that in addition to its impact on membrane cholesterol homeostasis in the central nervous system, modulation of CH24H may have an impact on over-activation of neurotransmitter pathways that have been implicated in a number of neurological disorders, such as epilepsy. Preclinical data suggest that inhibition of brain CH24H indirectly reduces glutamatergic signaling via NMDA receptors and modulates glial function and inflammation, which may impact disease pathology and epileptogenesis. 
 We believe that because OV935 is an inhibitor of CH24H it may modulate the excitatory signals involved in epilepsy, which may suppress seizures. In addition to these effects on seizures and excitability of the brain, we believe that OV935 may reduce inflammation in and neurotoxic damage to the brain, which may lead to long-term, disease modifying effect. As a result, OV935 is being developed in rare and difficult to treat epilepsies with the goal to develop OV935 not just as a potential medicine to treat the seizures but also one that may have long-term disease-modifying potential. We believe that OV935 if successful in these areas may have utility in other areas as well. OV935 is initially being studied in those suffering from severe and often intractable forms of DEE, including Dravet syndrome, or DS, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, or LGS, CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder, or CDD, and Duplication 15q, or Dup15q syndrome. There are limited or no therapeutic options in each of these disorders.

We have completed multiple trials on OV935 and expect to initiate pivotal phase 3 trials in second quarter of 2021.  Previously we completed a Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of OV935 in a mixed group of adults with DEE and announced the results in December 2018. The trial achieved its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability, dose proportional reduction in a potential plasma biomarker called 24HC, and a robust reduction in seizure frequency (61% at day 92), with two patients becoming seizure-free at the end of the treatment period. Following this trial and as further discussed below, we reported the initial data from the Phase 2 open-label extension study (which we refer to as the ENDYMION trial) of OV935 in six patients who previously completed our 12-week Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of OV935 in adults with DEE.
 On August 25, 2020, we, together with Takeda, announced positive topline results from the ELEKTRA trial which was a phase 2 trial in DS and LGS, along with updated findings from the ENDYMION trial. Based on the trial results of ELEKTRA and after presentation of the data and review of the phase 3 pivotal trial approach with regulatory authorities in the US (FDA), EU (CHMP), and Japan (PMDA), we expect to initiate two separate multinational Phase 3 pivotal registrational trials in Dravet syndrome and LGS with OV935 in the second quarter of 2021.
 The FDA has granted orphan drug designation for OV935 for the treatment of Dravet syndrome and LGS.
 Dravet Syndrome
 Dravet syndrome is a severe form of childhood epilepsy largely genetically driven by the mutation of the SCN1A gene that typically presents during the first year of life. Eighty percent of patients have a mutation of the SCN1A-gene. Children experience frequent seizures, loss of muscle control, cognitive deficits and, in approximately 10% of cases, death before the age of 12 years. Children continue to suffer from seizures and severe cognitive and developmental impairment throughout their lifetime. While some patients may survive into adulthood, their long-term intellectual development and seizure outcomes are typically extremely poor. The incidence of Dravet syndrome in the United States ranges from 1 in 15,700 to 1 in 20,900 births. 
 Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome
 Lennox-Gastaut syndrome is a rare disorder that is often diagnosed between three and five years of age. Patients diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome experience a multitude of seizure types that are difficult to manage and have many of the same symptomologies as other rare pediatric epilepsies. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome affects over 30,000 people in the United States with approximately half being children under the age of 18.  Some patients have de novo genetic mutations, including a mutation of the SCN2A gene. The annual incidence of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in childhood is estimated to be two per 100,000 children. It is also estimated that between 1% and 4% of childhood epilepsies are a result of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.
 CDKL5 Deficiency Disorder
 Patients with cyclin-dependent kinase-like 5 (CDKL5) mutations present with early epilepsy. In particular, early drug-resistant epilepsy, usually starting in the first months of life, tends to be the most common feature. Complex partial seizures, infantile spasms, myoclonic, generalized tonic-clonic, and tonic seizures have all been reported. Stereotypic hand movements, severe hypotonia, and impaired psychomotor development are usually associated with CDKL5 mutations and common to the general clinical manifestations. 
 Dup15q syndrome
 Duplications of the proximal arm of chromosome 15q11.2-q13.1 result in the genetic condition Dup15q syndrome. Multiple genes including UBE3A from this region are implicated in the pathogenesis of autism spectrum disorders, epilepsy, and schizophrenia. Increased expression of the UBE3A gene contributes to epilepsy in Dup15q syndrome and it is thought to be the underlying cause of the autistic features of the syndrome as well. The most devastating feature of Dup15q syndrome is difficult to control seizures. The most common seizure types are infantile spasm and generalized tonic–clonic seizures followed by atonic, myoclonic, focal-onset, and tonic seizures. Poorly controlled seizures severely impact the quality of life of both affected individuals and their caregivers. Current treatment options for Dup15q syndrome-associated epilepsy are often ineffective. GABAergic promoting antiepileptics are typically ineffective while broad-spectrum antiepileptic medications such as valproic acid and rufinamide provide some relief.
 OV935 Clinical Data
 Phase 1 Trials
 OV935 has been tested in 86 healthy volunteers across four Phase 1 trials. Single oral doses of up to 1,350mg of OV935 were well-tolerated. The most frequently reported adverse events were headache, ECG electrode application site dermatitis and nausea. All reported events were mild with no apparent dose-response. In a 14-day repeat dosing trial, doses of 100mg QD, 300mg QD and 400mg QD were well-tolerated. One volunteer at the 300mg BID experienced an event of confusional state and another volunteer at the 600mg QD dose experienced acute psychosis. Both volunteers discontinued the trial at day 11. One volunteer receiving placebo reported events of nightmares, spatial disorientation, insomnia and dizziness. All AEs resolved with continued dosing through day 15.

No SAEs were reported. Overall, no safety issues of concern were identified in the Phase 1 trials based on assessments of physical examinations, vital sign measurements, clinical laboratory values or 12-lead electrocardiogram findings.
 The following table summarizes each Phase 1 trial:
 
 
Trial | Purpose | Design | Number of Volunteers | Dosage 
------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------+---------------------------------------------
1 | Safety and tolerability | Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose trial | 48 | 15-1,350mg, oral 
2 | Safety and tolerability | Phase 1, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple ascending dose trial | 40 | 100-600mg QD, and 300mg BID, 14 days, oral 
3 | Brain CH24H enzyme occupancy using positron emission tomography, or PET | Open-label, non-randomized | 11 | 50-600mg, oral 
4 | Relative bioavailability of tablet versus solution formulation; effect of food | Phase 1, randomized, open-label, single dose trial | 9 | 300mg (tablet), oral; 300mg (solution), oral

Phase 1b/2a Trial - 2001
 The Phase 1b/2a trial of OV935 achieved its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability and showed OV935 was generally well tolerated.  The trial was designed to have two parts. Part 1 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled (OV935 vs. placebo with a ratio of 4:1), 30-day phase that included a titration period (20 days: 100 mg, 200 mg twice daily), and treatment period (10 days). 
 
OV935 achieved the primary endpoint of safety and tolerability as measured by incidence of AEs. AEs in patients treated with OV935 were similar to those who received placebo in Part 1. The majority of AEs in both treatment arms were mild. Overall, the data are consistent with a favorable safety and tolerability profile and support the continued clinical development of OV935.
 AEs that occurred more frequently in the OV935-treatment group versus the placebo group were: dysarthria, insomnia, lethargy, seizure cluster, and upper respiratory infection. Four patients discontinued due to an AE or an SAE in the OV935 treatment arm. Of these, in Part 1, one patient discontinued due to difficulty with walking and worsening lethargy and a second discontinued due to weakness. In Part 2, one patient discontinued due to a single episode of seizure cluster and a second experienced multiple seizure clusters.
 
An increase in seizure frequency was seen in three patients, all of whom were on perampanel. This suggests the potential for a drug-drug interaction between medicines acting on different glutamatergic receptors. Accordingly, changes in seizure frequency data for the Phase 1b/2a trial are now reported with the inclusion and exclusion of the three patients on perampanel, respectively. 
 ENDYMION
 ENDYMION is a Phase 2 prospective, multi-center, open-label extension study of OV935 in patients with DEE who have participated in a previous OV935 clinical study. The primary objective is to assess the long-term safety and tolerability of OV935 over four years of treatment in patients with rare epilepsies. A secondary endpoint evaluates the effect of OV935 on seizure frequency over time. ENDYMION enrolled eligible patients from the ELEKTRA and ARCADE trials, each discussed below.  
 In September 2019, we announced initial data from the first six patients in ENDYMION who were previously enrolled in the Phase 1b/2a clinical trial of OV935 in adults with DEE and subsequently ceased taking OV935 for a period of between 6 weeks and 12 months. Therefore, in most cases the seizure frequency increased from the end of the adult DEE trial until they were enrolled in ENDYMION. As shown in Table 1, longer-term data from ENDYMION out to 48 weeks suggest increased seizure reduction with prolonged treatment of OV935 and is consistent with the believed mechanism of action of OV935. Median seizure frequency reductions were 84% following 25 to 36 weeks (n=6) and 90% following 37 to 48 weeks (n=4) of treatment.

* | At the time of data analysis, two patients had not yet completed 48 weeks of dosing.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Patient baseline seizure frequency ranged from 2 to 71 (median=11.5). In general, a greater reduction in seizure frequency was observed in those with higher baseline seizure frequency. In terms of overall seizure-free interval during treatment, one patient experienced 264 consecutive days and one patient experienced 150 consecutive days without a seizure.
 In addition to the six patients from the Phase 1b/2a adult DEE trial included in this data analysis, all patients who have completed the ARCADE and ELEKTRA trials to date have enrolled in ENDYMION. Data from patients who have completed ARCADE, our Phase 2, multi-center, open-label, pilot study evaluating the treatment of OV935 in patients with epileptic seizures associated with CDD or Dup15q syndrome, are not included the above analysis due to their limited treatment duration in ENDYMION. Data from patients previously treated in ELEKTRA are not included in the above analysis due to the ELEKTRA trial being double-blinded and placebo-controlled at the time of the analysis.
 Overall, at 48 weeks, safety observations were consistent with the completed Phase 1b/2a clinical trial in adults with DEE. OV935 continues to show a favorable safety and tolerability profile. The majority of adverse events were mild and comparable with those from the Phase 1b/2a trial. Specifically, adverse events that occurred included upper abdominal pain, pyrexia, bronchial wall thickening and rales. There was one treatment-related adverse event of nausea. No serious adverse events were observed.
 As discussed below, in August 2020 and September 2020, we announced updated findings from ENDYMION from patients who completed the ELEKTRA and ARCADE studies, respectively, and elected to enroll in ENDYMION.
 ELEKTRA
 ELEKTRA was an international, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate treatment with soticlestat in pediatric patients, aged 2 to 17 years, with highly refractory epileptic seizures associated with convulsive seizures (DS) or drop seizures (LGS). The study consisted of a four- to six-week screening period to establish baseline seizure frequency, followed by a 20-week double-blind treatment period, including an 8-week dose optimization period and a 12-week maintenance period. During the 8-week dose optimization period, patients were titrated from 100mg twice daily (BID), to 200mg BID to 300mg BID (mg/kg dosing for <60 kg) of orally administered soticlestat.
 A total of 141 patients were enrolled in ELEKTRA and 126 completed the study. A modified intent-to-treat, or mITT, analysis of 139 patients was performed to evaluate the efficacy endpoints, which includes any patient who enrolled in the study and received at least one dose of study drug. Patients in the study were allowed to be on one to four concomitant anti-epileptic drugs, or AEDs, with the majority of patients concomitantly treated with at least three AEDs. The most common AEDs taken by the patients were valproate, clobazam, levetiracetam and topiramate. Further, all patients who completed ELEKTRA enrolled in the ENDYMION open-label extension study.
 On August 25, 2020, we, together with Takeda, announced positive topline results from ELEKTRA and updated findings from ENDYMION. The ELEKTRA study achieved its primary endpoint with high statistical significance, demonstrating a 27.8% median reduction from baseline in convulsive seizure (DS) and drop seizure (LGS) frequency compared to a 3.1% median increase in patients taking placebo during the 12-week maintenance period (median placebo-adjusted reduction=30.5%; p=0.0007, based on the efficacy analysis set of 120 patients with seizure data in the maintenance period). In addition, DS and LGS patients treated with soticlestat demonstrated a 29.8% median reduction in convulsive seizure (DS) and drop seizure (LGS) frequency compared to 0.0% change in median seizure frequency in patients taking placebo during the full 20-week treatment period (titration plus maintenance) of the ELEKTRA study (placebo-adjusted reduction=25.1%; p=0.0024). Soticlestat was generally well-tolerated in the ELEKTRA study and demonstrated a safety profile consistent with those of previous studies, with no new safety signals identified. All patients who completed the ELEKTRA study elected to enroll into the ENDYMION open-label extension study and findings from ENDYMION were also reported on August 25, 2020.  The ENDYMION study data of rolled-over ELEKTRA patients support results in the ELEKTRA study. The ENDYMION data indicated maintenance of effect over 6 months in those patients originally randomized to soticlestat, and similarly reduced seizure frequency as compared to baseline in those patients previously assigned to the placebo arm. No new safety signals were identified in ENDYMION.
 ARCADE
 ARCADE is a Phase 2 open-label, signal-finding pilot study designed to inform the potential for future development of soticlestat in CDD and Dup15q syndrome. The study enrolled 20 patients, ages 2 to 55 years, with refractory epileptic seizures associated with CDD (n=12) or Dup15q (n=8) and consisted of a four- to six-week screening period to establish baseline seizure frequency, followed by a 20-week treatment period, including an eight-week titration/dose optimization period and a 12-week maintenance period. Patients in the study were allowed to be on one to six concomitant AEDs, with the majority of patients 
 6


concomitantly treated with at least four AEDs, representing a highly refractory patient population. The primary objective of the ARCADE study was to determine percent change from baseline in motor seizure frequency during the 12-week maintenance period.  Further, all patients who completed ARCADE enrolled in the ENDYMION open-label extension study.
 On September 30, 2020, we announced results from ARCADE and updated findings from ENDYMION. Together, data from the ARCADE and ENDYMION studies showed seizure frequency reduction over time. In CDD patients (n=12), median motor seizure frequency reduction was 24% during the 12-week maintenance period in the ARCADE study, increasing to a 50% reduction in the ENDYMION long-term extension study in the five CDD patients who reached nine months of continuous treatment. In Dup15q patients (n=8), there was an increase in median motor seizure frequency in the ARCADE study during the 12-week maintenance period; however, longer-term data from the four Dup15q patients who reached nine months of continuous treatment showed a 74% reduction in median motor seizure frequency. Soticlestat was generally well tolerated in both studies and continues to demonstrate a favorable safety profile. We believe the results are encouraging and next steps are being evaluated with Takeda.
 OV101 (gaboxadol)
 To date, we have been developing OV101 for the treatment of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome, two neurodevelopmental disorders that are characterized by similar symptoms. In December 2020, we reported the primary endpoint of the Pivotal Phase 3 trial in pediatric individuals with Angelman syndrome (the NEPTUNE trial) was not achieved. Based on the results of the NEPTUNE trial, further development of OV101, other than the ongoing long-term extension study with Angelman syndrome patients who had previously been in a trial for OV101 (the ELARA trial), is currently on hold. The data from all trials is under review and further development of OV101, if any, will be the subject of full analysis of this data.
 Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome have overlapping symptoms, including sleep disorder, aberrant behavior, anxiety and cognitive or intellectual disabilities thought to be caused by decreased tonic inhibition, an important mechanism whereby it is believed that the brain distinguishes signal from noise. Both of these disorders are typically diagnosable in early childhood and require full-time care for the patients affected. In September 2016, the FDA granted orphan drug designation for OV101 for the treatment of Angelman syndrome; in October 2017 the FDA granted orphan drug designation for OV101 for the treatment of Fragile X syndrome; in December 2017 the FDA granted fast track designation for the treatment of Angelman syndrome; and in March 2018, the FDA granted fast track designation for the treatment of Fragile X syndrome.  In June 2019, the European Commission granted OV101 orphan drug designation for the treatment of Angelman syndrome based on the results of the STARS clinical trial.
 OV101 and Tonic Inhibition
 Tonic inhibition is a critical physiological regulatory mechanism that allows a healthy human brain to decipher excitatory and inhibitory neurological signals correctly without being overloaded. Defects of this system are thought to play a role in multiple disease states, including Angelman syndrome, Fragile X syndrome and insomnia. Because of its unique mode of action, OV101 represents a promising compound targeting this mechanism.
 Decreased tonic inhibition results in an imbalance in the ratio of excitation to inhibition. If tonic inhibition is reduced, the brain becomes inundated with signals and loses the ability to separate background noise from critical information. This imbalance disrupts normal brain functioning, including sensory processing and integration. Disruption of tonic inhibition can lead to a multiplicity of symptoms including, but not limited to, sleep abnormalities, motor deficiencies, behavioral manifestations, delayed development, intellectual disability and severe speech impairment. By modulating tonic inhibition, OV101 may have the potential to alleviate important symptoms and provide a meaningful clinical benefit to patients across several disorders.
 We believe that OV101 modulates tonic inhibition. Disruption of tonic inhibition can lead to a multiplicity of symptoms including, but not limited to, sleep abnormalities, motor deficiencies, behavioral manifestations, delayed development, intellectual disability and severe speech impairment. We believe modulating tonic inhibition may have a meaningful clinical impact in patients with Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome.

Angelman Syndrome
 Overview.   Angelman syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that is typically diagnosed in the United States after one year of age when parents notice severe developmental delays or the child suffers seizures. Characteristic features of this disorder include delayed development, intellectual disability, severe speech impairment, problems with movement and balance, seizures, sleep disorders and anxiety. Individual patients with Angelman syndrome can have varied symptoms, including the inability to walk or control motor movement, which can limit their ability to handle daily functions such as feeding, dressing or bathing. These patients are also often hyperactive, leading to various behavioral problems. Angelman syndrome symptoms, such as poor sleeping patterns, can lead to serious consequences, including increased frequency of seizures and exacerbation of behavioral manifestations. Different patients with identical genetic defects can show different degrees of these symptoms. Most Angelman syndrome patients require full-time care and are unable to live independently, which can represent a substantial emotional and financial burden on their families. In addition, Angelman syndrome has been associated with poor parental sleep and high parental stress.
 According to the National Organization for Rare Disorders, the approximate prevalence of Angelman syndrome is between 1 in 12,000 and 1 in 20,000 people. There are currently no approved therapies in the United States or ex-US specifically for the treatment of Angelman syndrome. No standard of care exists for Angelman syndrome, and current therapeutic options are symptomatic, suggesting a high unmet clinical need. Given the likely high burden of Angelman syndrome, new treatments targeting the aetiology of the syndrome that result in even small improvements in features of the syndrome may be clinically meaningful for patients and their families.
 Fragile X Syndrome
 Overview.   Fragile X syndrome is a genetic condition that results in intellectual disability, anxiety disorders, behavioral and learning challenges and various physical disabilities. Patients with Fragile X syndrome exhibit autism-like symptoms, including cognitive impairment, anxiety, mood swings, hyperactivity, attention deficit and heightened sensitivity to various stimuli, such as sound. The severity of an individual patient’s impairment can range from mild learning disabilities to more severe cognitive or intellectual disabilities. Fragile X syndrome is one of the most commonly inherited intellectual disability disorders. Children with Fragile X syndrome also often have unusual sleep patterns and may have difficulty with routine activities such as feeding and dressing. The challenges presented by Fragile X syndrome often extend beyond the patient and can lead to significant hardships on the emotional and financial health of their families.
 Fragile X syndrome is caused by mutations in the fragile X mental retardation gene, or FMR1 gene. FMR1 is a gene that leads to the synthesis of the fragile X mental retardation protein, FMRP, which is needed for normal brain development. The FMR1 gene normally contains in its sequence between 5 and 44 copies of a short, repeated motif, or recurring pattern in DNA. In Fragile X syndrome, there are more than 200 copies of this motif in the FMR1 gene, a genetic change that prevents the synthesis of FMRP. Patients with intermediate numbers of repeats are able to make some FMRP and have milder symptoms.
 According to the National Fragile X Foundation, Fragile X syndrome affects approximately 1 in 3,600 to 4,000 males and 1 in 4,000 to 6,000 females. The average age of diagnosis of Fragile X syndrome is approximately three years. Currently, there are no approved therapies for the treatment of Fragile X syndrome. The current standard of care for the psychiatric challenges of Fragile X syndrome is tailored to each patient and may include antipsychotics, antidepressants and drugs to treat attention deficit and sleep disorders. Special education and symptomatic treatments for anxiety and irritability are often employed to lessen the burden of illness. Fragile X syndrome patients also may experience seizures, which are treated with traditional anticonvulsants.
 We have conducted a number of clinical trials with OV101. In 2017, we completed a successful Phase 1 clinical trial in adolescent patients with Angelman and Fragile X syndrome. In 2018, we completed a Phase 2 trial of OV101 in adults and adolescents with Angelman syndrome, which we refer to as the STARS clinical trial. The STARS clinical trial achieved its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability and showed statistically significant improvement in the once-daily OV101 dosing group on the pre-specified physician-rated Clinical Global Impressions-Improvement, or CGI-I, exploratory endpoint as well as improvements in relevant symptoms such as sleep, motor function and behavior.
 Based on the results of the NEPTUNE trial, further development of OV101, other than the ELARA trial, is currently on hold. The data is under review and further development, if any, will be the subject of full analysis of the data from this trial together with the data from ELARA.
 Angelman Syndrome
 STARS
 In July of 2018, we completed the Phase 2 STARS trial, a 12-week, double blind, placebo-controlled study in adults and adolescents with Angelman syndrome that randomized 88 patients aged 13 to 49 years. The study achieved its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability with a similar incidence of adverse events, or AEs, across the OV101 and placebo treatment arms. The investigational medicine showed a favorable safety profile and was well tolerated in adults and adolescents with Angelman syndrome through the 12 weeks of treatment. The most common AEs reported in the trial were vomiting, somnolence, irritability, aggression, and pyrexia. Serious adverse events, or SAEs, of seizure were reported in two patients with a previous history of seizures: one patient 
 8


in the once-daily, QD, dose group experienced a seizure that was deemed unrelated to study drug; one patient experienced a seizure in the twice-daily, BID, dose group that was assessed as possibly related to study drug by the investigator.  At the prespecified efficacy analysis at 12 weeks of treatment, OV101 QD and BID dose groups showed a statistically significant improvement compared to placebo in the CGI-I. CGI-I was ranked first in the prespecified hierarchy of the statistical analysis plan. Data from the full analysis indicate that OV101 positively impacts several relevant clinical features of Angelman syndrome (global functioning, sleep, motor disruption). We met with the FDA in November 2018 to discuss OV101 as part of our End of Phase 2 Meeting. 
 NEPTUNE
 Following the End of Phase 2 Meeting, we initiated the NEPTUNE trial and enrolled our first pediatric patient in September 2019. NEPTUNE was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 study that enrolled and treated 97 pediatric patients diagnosed with Angelman syndrome, four to 12 years of age, and seven patients diagnosed with Angelman syndrome ages two to three years for safety and pharmacokinetic evaluation only. The study was designed to assess the effects of treatment with OV101 (oral, once-daily dosing) versus placebo over 12 weeks. The sole primary endpoint was change in overall score on the Clinical Global Impression-Improvement-Angelman syndrome, or CGI-I-AS, scale. Secondary endpoints included sleep, communication, motor function, socialization, daily living skills and behaviour domains.
 The primary endpoint of the NEPTUNE study was not achieved. Patients given OV101 showed a 0.7-point improvement in CGI-I-AS over baseline while placebo also showed a 0.8-point improvement in CGI-I-AS (p=NS). Secondary endpoints continue to be evaluated, although initial results show no difference between OV101 and placebo.
 OV101 was well-tolerated, with no significant safety issues observed. We plan to complete a full analysis of the results of the NEPTUNE study and discuss these results with the FDA to determine next steps, if any, for the program. We will continue to offer study drug to patients enrolled in the open-label extension trial, ELARA, pending further analysis of the NEPTUNE study. 
 ELARA
 Based on the STARS clinical trial data, we also initiated ELARA, an open-label extension trial which enrolled its first patient in February 2019, and enrollment is ongoing. We expect to report data from the ELARA study in the first half of 2021.
 Based on the results of the NEPTUNE trial, further development of OV101, other than the ELARA trial, is currently on hold. The data is under review and further development, if any, will be the subject of full analysis of the data from this trial together with the data from ELARA.
 Fragile X Syndrome
 ROCKET
 In May 2020, we completed a Phase 2 trial evaluating OV101 in adolescent and young male adults with Fragile X syndrome, which we refer to as the ROCKET clinical trial. The trial met its primary objective and OV101 appeared to be well tolerated over 12 weeks of treatment with no serious adverse events reported across all three dose cohorts. OV101 demonstrated a statistically significant effect on secondary behavioral endpoints in the three combined study groups as follows: 26.2% mean improvement in the Aberrant Behavior Checklist for Fragile X (ABC-CFXS) total score from baseline to week 12 (p=0.002); and a 21.6% mean improvement in the Anxiety, Depression and Mood Scale (ADAMS) total score from baseline to week 12 (p=0.004). Statistically significant improvements were also observed across various ABC-FXS and ADAMS subscales. In addition, OV101 demonstrated a statistically significant mean reduction of 0.4 in the Clinical Global Impressions Scale-Severity (CGI-S) total score (p=0.002) from baseline to week 12.
SKYROCKET
 We also initiated the SKYROCKET study in the fourth quarter of 2018.  SKYROCKET was a 12-week, non-drug study to assess the suitability of several behavioral scales in individuals with Fragile X syndrome. The trial was an observational study designed to provide additional data on the key endpoints that are being explored in the ROCKET trial as well as provide contextual data on the benefit offered by the standard of care. The participating clinicians and caregivers were aware that the trial was non-interventional. The mean changes from baseline to week 12 were evaluated in the ABC total and subscale scores, the ADAMS subscale scores, and the CGI-S subscale scores as well as the mean change in CGI-I score at week 12. Other exploratory scales were also assessed. High variability was seen among caregiver-administered assessments (ABC-c, ADAMS) compared to clinician-assessed scales (CGI-I, CGI-S). The caregiver-administered assessments showed a placebo response as seen with previous Fragile X syndrome trials. In these other trials, placebo response rates were highly variable. Therefore, the SKYROCKET trial data will help inform future study design, including potential endpoints and measures to mitigate placebo response. 
 Based on the results of the NEPTUNE trial, development of OV101 in Fragile X syndrome is under review to enable us to fully understand the ramifications if any, for any potential future trial in Fragile X syndrome.

Previous Clinical Development of OV101 in Insomnia
 We acquired worldwide rights to OV101 from H. Lundbeck A/S, or Lundbeck, in March 2015. Prior to the acquisition, Lundbeck filed an investigational new drug application, or IND, with the FDA for the treatment of insomnia. Pursuant to this IND, Lundbeck and Merck & Co., Inc., or Merck, partnered to conduct several Phase 3 trials for primary insomnia between 2004 and 2007. Over the course of the development of OV101, over 4,000 adults were administered OV101, resulting in an OV101 exposure of approximately 950 patient years. These trials were primarily randomized, placebo-controlled short-term and long-term safety and efficacy clinical studies, using classic sleep parameters such as total sleep time, time to sleep onset, wakefulness after sleep onset, and number of nocturnal awakenings as clinical endpoints.
 The Phase 3 program consisted of three trials: two 3-month placebo-controlled trials conducted in the United States and one 2-week trial conducted in Europe and Canada, each evaluating OV101 against placebo and the active comparator, zolpidem (Ambien). The primary endpoints of the trials included total sleep time and time-to-sleep onset and the secondary endpoints included number of nocturnal awakenings, wakefulness after sleep onset and daytime function. In Phase 3 trials, which were conducted for durations of up to 12 months, OV101 was observed to have efficacy that was largely comparable to zolpidem (Ambien) on several sleep metrics. In the first 3-month trial, a dose of 15mg of OV101 met both of the primary endpoints as well as the secondary endpoints at week one and month three compared to placebo. In the second 3-month trial, the same dose met only total sleep time and number of awakenings at week one, but significance was lost after adjusting for multiplicity at month three. The 2-week trial met all primary endpoints and wakefulness after sleep onset, for 15mg of OV101 at weeks one and two. Additionally, subjects who were administered OV101 showed no evidence of withdrawal symptoms or rebound insomnia after discontinuation of short-term treatment, whereas transient rebound insomnia was observed in subjects receiving zolpidem. In addition, clear differences were observed between OV101 and zolpidem from a sleep architecture perspective. OV101 has shown consistent increases in slow wave sleep compared to zolpidem with no significant effect on stage 2 or REM sleep in healthy adult, elderly subjects. It is believed that slow wave sleep is important for encoding long-term, fact-based memories. Slow wave sleep has been associated with physical changes in neuronal connections.
 Safety and Tolerability
 Overall, OV101 was observed to be well-tolerated in adult patients aged 18-64 years in the Phase 2 and Phase 3 insomnia trials at doses of 5mg to 15mg given as evening doses. Success in these previous trials does not ensure that our clinical trials in OV101 will generate the same results or otherwise provide adequate data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of OV101. The most common reported adverse events were headache, nausea, vomiting, somnolence and dizziness. In general, the adverse events appeared to be dose-related. The majority of the serious adverse events observed were considered to not be related to treatment with OV101. One SAE, fatigue, was considered by Lundbeck and Merck as probably related to OV101 treatment. Among the nine SAEs considered by Lundbeck and Merck to be possibly related to OV101 treatment, there were three cases of fainting and one case each of: radius fracture, abnormal QRS axis, transient ischemic attack, non-cardiac chest pain, unresponsive to stimuli and atrial fibrillation. Across trials there were no apparent clinical trends regarding SAEs with respect to frequency, distribution across system organ classes or preferred terms. Also, there were no apparent clinical differences versus placebo. In the Phase 3 trials at the 15mg dose, at least one SAE was observed in 1.3% of subjects at two weeks and 3 months and 3.0% of subjects at 12 months versus 0.0% to 1.0% on placebo over the same time frame.
 Consistent with the clinical development of other insomnia drugs, the FDA requested that Lundbeck and Merck conduct a series of preclinical and clinical abuse studies as part of their development program. In preclinical studies, OV101 demonstrated low abuse potential. In one clinical trial, the abuse potential of OV101 was investigated in doses up to 45mg in male and female subjects with a history of hypnotic/sedative abuse and other drug abuse. Safety results showed that OV101 administered at doses of 30mg and 45mg in women and 45mg in men was not tolerated in this population of drug abusers, contrary to previous experience with the same doses in healthy volunteers. This indicated that a history of drug abuse decreased tolerability to OV101 in these subjects. Adverse events that were associated with a dose-dependent lack of tolerability in this trial included psychiatric, nervous system, musculoskeletal and gastrointestinal disorders.
 In 2007, following the completion of all clinical trials for OV101 in insomnia, Lundbeck and Merck discontinued the development program for insomnia, and announced that the overall clinical profile did not support further development of OV101 for insomnia.

Early-stage Research Programs
 OV329 (GABA aminotransferase inhibitor) is a preclinical compound being developed by us
 for the treatment of seizures associated with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and Infantile Spasms. OV329 functions by substantially reducing the activity of GABA aminotransferase (GABA-AT), a key enzyme responsible for the degradation of the brain’s major inhibitory neurotransmitter, GABA. OV329 leads to increased concentrations of GABA by inhibiting its metabolism
. Given that epilepsy is characterized by excessive neuronal excitation, the increased levels of GABA may suppress this excitatory signaling and may reduce seizures. If successful, we anticipate OV329 could be used to treat seizures associated with Tuberous Sclerosis Complex and Infantile Spasms and we are currently assessing this approach in the pre-clinical setting. In December 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Northwestern University, or Northwestern, pursuant to which Northwestern granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to patent rights in certain inventions, or the Northwestern Patent Rights, which relate to a specific compound and related methods of use for such compound, along with certain Know-How related to the practice of the inventions claimed in the Northwestern Patents.
 OV882 is a short hairpin RNA (shRNA-551) we are evaluating as a potential disease-modifying gene therapy for Angelman syndrome. The most common cause of Angelman syndrome is the loss of functional UBE3A protein due to a defect in the maternal copy of the UBE3A gene. Our aim is to develop a disease-modifying noncoding RNA vector that reduces expression of UBE3A-antisense and restores UBE3A expression via the paternal gene copy. We are in early stages of our research. This research program is being conducted in collaboration with the University of Connecticut School of Medicine
 
In June 2020, we began a strategic research collaboration with Columbia University Irving Medical Center, or Columbia, to advance genetic based therapies for a range of rare neurological conditions, complementary of our pipeline. This collaboration provides us with the potential to expand our future drug development portfolio and impact individuals living with rare genetic neurological conditions by working closely with the Precision Medicine Resource in the Irving Institute at Columbia. Our first research program with Columbia is OV815 and focuses on the kinesin-family of proteins and KIF1A-associated neurological disorder (KAND), under this research and translational development alliance, Columbia will align its expertise in rare disease genetics and deep clinical understanding of rare neurological diseases with our discovery, translational, and clinical development expertise in neurodevelopmental disorders and rare epilepsies.
 License and Collaboration Agreements
       Collaboration Agreement with Angelini Pharma
 
On July 9, 2020, we entered into the Angelini License Agreement with Angelini, pursuant to which we granted to Angelini exclusive rights to develop and commercialize OV101, a selective agonist of the GABAA receptor, for the treatment of Angelman syndrome in the European Economic Area as well as Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Russia and Turkey, or the European Territory.  The licenses granted to Angelini include sublicenses under the Lundbeck Agreement, as well as licenses under our patents and know-how covering OV101.  Angelini will be responsible for conducting any clinical trials necessary to obtain regulatory approval for OV101 for Angelman syndrome in the European Territory, and we will be responsible for bearing a portion of the costs for such trials.  We will also be responsible, at our expense, for the completion of certain ongoing clinical trials for OV101, to the extent applicable to obtaining regulatory approval for OV101 in the European Territory.  Angelini has the exclusive right, at its election, to develop and commercialize OV101 for the treatment of Fragile X Syndrome in the European Territory.  The parties may also mutually agree to pursue additional indications for OV101 in the European Territory, and in such case, Angelini would have the exclusive rights to commercialize in such additional indications. Angelini is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct development activities for OV101, and following regulatory approval, to commercialize OV101 in each approved indication.
 In conjunction with the entry into the Angelini License Agreement, the parties entered into a separate supply agreement, pursuant to which we will be responsible for supply of OV101 to Angelini for development and commercialization in the European Territory, through Angelini’s existing supply relationship with Lundbeck.  The Angelini License Agreement also provides for a transfer, at Angelini’s expense, of the relevant manufacturing technology from us and Lundbeck to Angelini, in order to enable Angelini to assume responsibility for its own manufacture and supply of OV101 in the future.
 Under the Angelini License Agreement, Angelini made an upfront payment and a milestone payment related to the transfer of a specified amount of compound and related information to the Company of $25.0 million during the year ended December 31, 2020.  Angelini will be required to make additional milestone payments to us upon the completion of the specified components of the technology transfer and achievement of specified regulatory milestones for OV101 in Angelman syndrome of up to $55.0 million in the aggregate, as well as up to €162.5 million ($199.9 million) in sales milestone payments for achievement of specified levels of net sales in the European Territory.  In addition, Angelini will be required to pay tiered royalties on net sales by Angelini, its affiliates or sublicensees at double-digit percentages above the teens, subject to certain reductions and offsets.  Royalties will be payable on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the latest of the expiration of the licensed patents covering such product in such country, the expiration of market exclusivity for such product in such country, and fifteen years from first commercial sale of such product in such country.
 11


Either party may terminate the Angelini License Agreement for an uncured material breach of the other party or in the case of insolvency.  We may terminate the Angelini License Agreement if Angelini challenges any of the licensed patents.  Angelini may terminate the Angelini License Agreement for convenience during specified notice periods, which are determined based upon whether the product has been commercially launched in the European Territory.
 License Agreement with H. Lundbeck A/S
 In March 2015, we entered into a license agreement with Lundbeck, which we subsequently amended in May 2019, or the Lundbeck agreement, pursuant to which we obtained from Lundbeck an exclusive (subject to certain reserved non-commercial rights), worldwide license to develop, manufacture, and commercialize OV101, also known as gaboxadol, for the treatment of human disease. Under the Lundbeck agreement, we are responsible for and will use commercially reasonable efforts to carry out all future development and commercialization of OV101. Initially, we will purchase OV101 compound from Lundbeck’s existing inventory at a specified price. Following the depletion of the existing inventory, we may purchase the compound from a third party or, if the parties agree, Lundbeck may continue to supply the compound to us. We are also obligated to make certain manufacturing-related payments to Lundbeck, including for its preparation of a drug master file for OV101. 
 
In connection with the Lundbeck agreement, we issued 489,756 shares of our common stock to Lundbeck. We also agreed to pay to Lundbeck milestone payments up to an aggregate of $189.0 million upon the achievement of certain global development, regulatory and sales milestone events. Pursuant to the Lundbeck agreement, the first milestone payment is $1.0 million, which is due upon the successful completion of the first Phase 3 trial for a product in which OV101 is an active ingredient.  In addition, if we successfully develop and commercialize OV101, we will be obligated to pay to Lundbeck tiered royalties based on single-digit and low-double digit percentage of net sales of OV101, subject to certain reductions for generic product sales and for royalties paid for licenses to third party intellectual property. If Lundbeck manufactures OV101 compound for us after the expiration of the royalty term, we will pay to Lundbeck, in addition to the fully burdened cost of such manufacture, a low, single-digit manufacturing royalty on the net sales of OV101 manufactured by Lundbeck.
 The Lundbeck agreement will continue until the expiration of all relevant royalty terms and may be earlier terminated by either party for the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency. In addition, we can terminate the Lundbeck agreement upon advance notice for convenience at any time prior to first regulatory approval of OV101. If the Lundbeck agreement is terminated by us for convenience or by Lundbeck for our breach or insolvency, the OV101 compound will revert to Lundbeck and we will grant Lundbeck an exclusive license to develop and commercialize OV101; such license will be royalty-bearing if we filed an application for regulatory approval prior to termination. If we terminate the Lundbeck agreement for Lundbeck’s breach or insolvency, our license will continue and our obligations to make royalty payments to Lundbeck and to share Asian Partner payments with Lundbeck will continue but we will not be obligated to make further milestone payments to Lundbeck or to purchase any additional quantities of OV101 compound from Lundbeck’s existing inventory.
 Agreements with Takeda
 2017 License and Collaboration Agreement with Takeda
 In January 2017, we entered into the Takeda collaboration agreement with Takeda. All activities of the collaboration regarding OV935 will be guided by the Takeda/Ovid “One Team” concept, an integrated and interdisciplinary team from both companies devoted to the successful advancement of OV935 across rare epilepsy syndromes. Pursuant to the Takeda collaboration agreement, we will take the lead in nonclinical and clinical development activities and commercialization of the compound OV935 and products containing this compound (as well as certain other similar compounds, including any prodrug where TAK-935 is the primary pharmacologically active metabolite) for the treatment of certain rare neurological diseases in the United States, Canada, the European Union and Israel. Takeda will take the lead in commercialization of OV935 in Japan and has the option to lead in Asia and the rest of the world, or the Takeda Territory. While we and Takeda have agreed to initially focus on certain rare neurological disorders, the scope of the collaboration may in the future include other mutually agreed upon rare neurological disorders.
 Under the Takeda collaboration agreement, Takeda granted to us an exclusive license in our territory under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by Takeda to commercialize OV935 and products containing OV935 for the treatment of certain rare neurological disorders. Takeda also granted to us a worldwide, co-exclusive license to develop, manufacture and otherwise exploit (but not commercialize) OV935 and products containing OV935 for the treatment of certain rare neurological disorders.
 Under the Takeda collaboration agreement, we granted to Takeda an exclusive license in the Takeda Territory under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by us to commercialize OV935 and products containing OV935 for the treatment of certain rare neurological disorders. We also granted to Takeda a worldwide, co-exclusive license to develop, manufacture and otherwise exploit (but not commercialize) OV935 and products containing OV935 for the treatment of certain rare neurological disorders and a co-exclusive license in certain countries to commercialize OV935 and products containing OV935 for the treatment of certain rare neurological disorders that are subsequently included in the collaboration.
 12


We and Takeda are collaborating in the development of OV935. Pursuant to the terms of the Takeda collaboration agreement, each party is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop OV935 for the treatment of certain rare neurological disorders in accordance with a mutually agreed upon development plan. We are primarily responsible for activities related to the development of OV935, and as such Takeda will transition certain development activities to us. Takeda is initially responsible for regulatory activities in all countries (excluding Israel). We are initially responsible for regulatory activities in Israel, and, upon regulatory approval in the United States, Canada, and the European Union, we will assume responsibility for further regulatory activities in such jurisdictions.
 We and Takeda are collaborating in the commercialization of OV935. Pursuant to the terms of the Takeda collaboration agreement, each party is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to commercialize OV935 for the treatment of certain rare neurological disorders in its territory. We are responsible for commercialization of OV935 in the United States, Canada, the European Union and Israel, and Takeda is responsible for commercialization of OV935 in Japan and has the first right to elect to commercialize the products in the Takeda Territory. Additionally, Takeda has the right to jointly commercialize the products with us in the United States and/or the European Union for any additional mutually agreed upon rare neurological indication.
 Under the Takeda collaboration agreement, we and Takeda initially share equally all development and commercialization costs and expenses prior to launch of a product and all revenues and commercialization costs and expenses after launch. In the event that we and Takeda agree to expand the scope of the collaboration to include additional rare neurological disorders, either party may elect not to fund all or a portion of the development of such indication, in which case such party’s overall share of revenues and commercialization costs and expenses after launch of a product may be reduced under certain circumstances.
 During the period commencing on the effective date of the Takeda collaboration agreement, we and Takeda have both agreed that we will not, directly or indirectly, and will cause all of our respective affiliates, not to, alone or with others, commercialize any competing product in the field of rare neurological disorders. For these purposes, a competing product is any product or compound directed against CH24H as its primary, intended mode of action. If, during such period, we or any of our affiliates is acquired by a third party that is commercializing a competing product, then we must divest our interest or terminate the commercialization of the competing product or cause our affiliate to do so.
 The Takeda collaboration agreement will expire upon the cessation of commercialization of the products by both us and Takeda. Either party may terminate the Takeda collaboration agreement as a result of the other party’s uncured material breach or insolvency, for safety reasons, or, after completion of the first proof of mechanism clinical trial, for convenience. Takeda may terminate the Takeda collaboration agreement for our (or our sublicensee’s) challenge to the patents licensed under the Takeda collaboration agreement. If the agreement is terminated by Takeda for our material breach, bankruptcy or patent challenge or by us for convenience or safety reasons, our rights to the products will cease, we will transition all activities related to the products to Takeda, and we will grant Takeda an exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by us to commercialize OV935 and products containing OV935 for the treatment of certain rare neurological disorders. If the agreement is terminated by us for Takeda’s material breach or bankruptcy or by Takeda for convenience or safety reasons, Takeda’s rights to the products will cease, Takeda will transition all activities related to the products to us, and Takeda will grant us an exclusive, royalty-bearing license under certain patents and other intellectual property controlled by Takeda to commercialize OV935 and products containing OV935 for the treatment of certain rare neurological disorders.
 Under the Takeda collaboration agreement, in the event of an acquisition of us by certain types of acquirers prior to the final dosing of a patient in the first Phase 3 trial, Takeda would have the right to elect to take over all development and commercialization activities with respect to the products, so long as Takeda at such time has (or will have) sufficient commercial infrastructure to commercialize the products. Even if Takeda exercises such right to take over all development and commercialization activities with respect to the products, we and Takeda will continue to share equally all development and commercialization costs and expenses prior to launch of a product and all revenues and commercialization costs and expenses after launch, unless otherwise set forth in the agreement.
 In connection with the Takeda collaboration agreement and in consideration of certain license rights granted to us by Takeda, we issued 1,781,996 shares of our Series B-1 convertible preferred stock to Takeda. The shares of Series B-1 preferred stock held by Takeda automatically converted into 1,781,996 shares of our common stock in May 2017. Under the Takeda collaboration agreement, we are obligated to pay Takeda future payments if and when certain milestones are achieved. Upon the first patient enrollment in the first Phase 3 trial for the first of the initial disorders we and Takeda are focusing on, we are obligated to issue to Takeda the number of unregistered shares of our common stock equal to the lesser of (a) 8% of our outstanding capital stock on the issuance date or (b) $50.0 million divided by the applicable share price, unless certain events occur. In the event such payment would cause Takeda to own over 19.99% of our outstanding capital stock or other events occur, such payment must be paid in cash. The remaining potential global commercial and regulatory milestone payments equal approximately $35.0 million and can be satisfied in cash or unregistered shares of our common stock at our election.
 2021 Royalty, License and Termination Agreement with Takeda
 On March 2, 2021, we entered into a royalty, license and termination agreement, or the Takeda License and Termination Agreement, with Takeda, relating to the Takeda collaboration agreement described above. Under the terms of the Takeda License and Termination Agreement, upon closing of the transaction, the Takeda collaboration agreement will be terminated by mutual agreement, and Takeda will secure rights to our 50% global share in OV935 (soticlestat), and an exclusive license under our relevant intellectual property rights, in exchange for an upfront payment, development and commercial milestone payments, and royalties.  Takeda will 
 13


assume all responsibility for, and costs of, both development and commercialization of soticlestat following closing. At closing, we will receive an upfront payment of $196.0 million and are eligible to receive up to an additional $660.0 million in development, regulatory and sales milestones.  In addition, if soticlestat achieves regulatory approval, we will receive tiered royalties on net sales of soticlestat at percentages ranging from the low double-digits up to 20%, subject to standard reductions in certain circumstances.  Royalties are payable on a country-by-country and product-by-product basis during the period beginning on the date of the first commercial sale of such product in such country and ending on the later to occur of the expiration of patent rights covering the product in such country and a specified anniversary of such first commercial sale. The Takeda collaboration agreement will remain in effect until Takeda’s cessation of commercialization of soticlestat.  We expect to close the Takeda License and Termination Agreement in the first half of 2021, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including regulatory review by the appropriate regulatory agencies under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. The Takeda License and Termination Agreement may be terminated upon the mutual agreement of the parties, or by either Takeda or the Company, if the closing has not occurred on or before May 14, 2021.
Northwestern License
In December 2016, we entered into a license agreement with Northwestern, pursuant to which Northwestern granted us an exclusive, worldwide license to patent rights in certain inventions, or the Northwestern Patent Rights, which relate to a specific compound and related methods of use for such compound, along with certain Know-How related to the practice of the inventions claimed in the Northwestern Patents.
 Under the Northwestern agreement, we were granted exclusive rights to research, develop, manufacture and commercialize products utilizing the Northwestern Patent Rights for all uses. We have agreed that we will not use the Northwestern Patent Rights to develop any products for the treatment of cancer, but Northwestern may not grant rights in the technology to others for use in cancer. We also have an option, exercisable during the term of the agreement to an exclusive license under certain intellectual property rights covering novel compounds with the same or similar mechanism of action as the primary compound that is the subject of the license agreement.  Northwestern has retained the right, on behalf of itself and other non-profit institutions, to use the Northwestern Patent Rights and practice the inventions claimed therein for educational and research purposes and to publish information about the inventions covered by the Northwestern Patent Rights.  
 Upon entry into the Northwestern agreement, we paid an upfront non-creditable one-time license issuance fee of $75,000, and we are required to pay an annual license maintenance fee of $20,000, which will be creditable against any royalties payable to Northwestern following first commercial sale of licensed products under the agreement.  We are responsible for all ongoing costs of filing, prosecuting and maintaining the Northwestern Patents, but we also have the right to control such activities using our own patent counsel.  In consideration for the rights granted to us under the Northwestern agreement, we are required to pay to Northwestern up to an aggregate of $5.3 million upon the achievement of certain development and regulatory milestones for the first product covered by the Northwestern Patents, and, upon commercialization of any such products, will be required to pay to Northwestern a tiered royalty on net sales of such products by the Company, its affiliates or sublicensees, at percentages in the low to mid-single-digits, subject to standard reductions and offsets.  Our royalty obligations continue on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis until the later of the expiration of the last-to-expire valid claim in a licensed patent covering the applicable product in such country and 10 years following the first commercial sale of such product in such country.  If Ovid sublicenses a Northwestern Patent Right, it will be obligated to pay to Northwestern a specified percentage of sublicense revenue received by us, ranging from the high single digits to the low-teens.  
 The Northwestern agreement requires that we use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize at least one product that is covered by the Northwestern Patent Rights.  
 Unless earlier terminated, the Northwestern agreement will remain in force until the expiration of our payment obligations thereunder.  We have the right to terminate the agreement for any reason upon prior written notice or for an uncured material breach by Northwestern.  Northwestern may terminate the agreement for our uncured material breach or insolvency. 
 Sales and Marketing
 Given our stage of development, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities, however, in November 2019 we hired a Chief Commercial Officer to begin planning to establish a commercial organization. We plan to build focused capabilities in the United States and European Union to commercialize our development programs focused on rare disorders of the brain. In other markets for which commercialization may be less capital efficient for us, we may selectively pursue strategic collaborations with third parties in order to maximize the commercial potential of our drug candidates.
Manufacturing and Supply
 We currently outsource all manufacturing, and we intend to use our collaborators and contract manufacturers for the foreseeable future. However, certain members of our management have broad experience in manufacturing, which we believe may provide a competitive advantage.

Competition
 We believe Sage Therapeutics, Inc., Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc. are our most direct competitors with respect to OV101 in Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome. Biogen Inc. in collaboration with Ionis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Roche Holding AG, PTC Therapeutics, Inc. and Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. in collaboration with GeneTx Biotherapeutics LLC are working on genetic approaches to Angelman syndrome. 
 We believe Zogenix, Inc., GW Pharmaceuticals plc, Sage Therapeutics, Inc., Marinus Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Zynerba Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Stoke Therapeutics, Inc. and PTC Therapeutics, Inc. are our most direct competitors with respect to OV935.
Drug development is highly competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological advancements. Our ability to compete will significantly depend upon our ability to complete necessary clinical trials and regulatory approval processes, and effectively market any drug that we may successfully develop. Our current and potential future competitors include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and government agencies. The primary competitive factors that will affect the commercial success of any drug candidate for which we may receive marketing approval include efficacy, safety and tolerability profile, dosing convenience, price, coverage and reimbursement. Many of our existing or potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and human resources than we do and significantly greater experience in the discovery and development of drug candidates, as well as in obtaining regulatory approvals of those drug candidates in the United States and in foreign countries.
 Our current and potential future competitors also have significantly more experience commercializing drugs that have been approved for marketing. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries could result in even more resources being concentrated among a small number of our competitors.
 Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining regulatory approval for therapies and in achieving widespread market acceptance of their drugs. It is also possible that the development of a cure or more effective treatment method for the disorders we are targeting by a competitor could render our current or future drug candidates non-competitive or obsolete or reduce the demand for our drug candidates before we can recover our development and commercialization expenses.
 Intellectual Property
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our current and future drug candidates, novel discoveries, product development technologies and know-how, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, copyright protection, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. For example, the proprietary map of disease-relevant biological pathways underlying orphan disorders of the brain that we developed would not be appropriate for patent protection and, as a result, we rely on trade secrets to protect this aspect of our business.
 While we seek broad coverage under our existing patent applications, there is always a risk that an alteration to the product or process may provide sufficient basis for a competitor to avoid infringement claims. In addition, the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before a patent is issued and courts can reinterpret patent scope after issuance. Moreover, many jurisdictions including the United States permit third parties to challenge issued patents in administrative proceedings, which may result in further narrowing or even cancellation of patent claims. Moreover, we cannot provide any assurance that any patents will be issued from our pending or any future applications or that any potentially issued patents will adequately protect our intellectual property.
 We currently own issued U.S. patents directed to treatment of Angelman syndrome and Fragile X syndrome with OV101 that expire in 2035, excluding any regulatory extensions. We also have exclusively licensed a portfolio of issued U.S. and international patents from Lundbeck directed to polymorphic forms of OV101 and their preparation, and these patents expire on dates ranging from 2025 to 2028. In addition, we have exclusively licensed from Lundbeck an issued U.S. patent that will expire in 2036 and a pending application directed to an OV101 manufacturing processes that, if issued, would have a statutory expiration in 2036. We have also filed, and own, multiple patent families directed to methods of treatment and formulations with OV101. Additional issued patents and pending applications are directed to methods of treating neurodegenerative diseases and developmental disorders. We are seeking or will seek patent protection for these inventions in numerous countries and regions including, among others, Europe, Australia, Canada, Mexico, Israel, Japan, China, and Korea.
 15


We licensed from Takeda a portfolio of U.S. and international patents and applications directed to the OV935 composition of matter, and these patents and applications expire in 2032, excluding any regulatory extensions.
 Individual patents extend for varying periods depending on the date of filing of the patent application or the date of patent issuance and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, utility patents issued for applications filed in the United States are granted a term of 20 years from the earliest effective filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the USPTO, delay in issuing the patent as well as a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period. However, as to the FDA component, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term including the restoration period must not exceed 14 years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also 20 years from the earliest effective filing date. The actual protection afforded by a patent may vary on a product-by-product basis, from country to country and can depend upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
 Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets and know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants and any potential commercial partners and collaborators and invention assignment agreements with our employees. We also have or intend to implement confidentiality agreements or invention assignment agreements with our selected consultants and any potential commercial partners. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
 Our commercial success will also depend in part on not infringing upon the proprietary rights of third parties. It is uncertain whether the issuance of any third-party patent would require us to alter our development or commercial strategies, or our drugs or processes, obtain licenses or cease certain activities. Our breach of any license agreements or failure to obtain a license to proprietary rights that we may require to develop or commercialize our future drugs may have an adverse impact on us. Since patent applications in the United States and certain other jurisdictions are maintained in secrecy for 18 months or potentially longer, and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications. Moreover, we may have to participate in Interference, Derivation, Reexam, Post-Grant Review, Inter Partes Review, or Opposition proceedings brought by third parties or declared by the USPTO.
 Government Regulation
 The FDA and regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of drugs and drug candidates.
U.S. Government Regulation
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending New Drug Applications (NDAs) or Biologics License Applications (BLAs), withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties.
 The process required by the FDA before a drug product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | approval by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 16


 
• | performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA.
--+----------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA.
--+-------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence.
Clinical Trials
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human patients under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research patients provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website.
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined:
  
• | Phase 1 clinical trial: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human volunteers or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2 clinical trial: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3 clinical trial: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 17


Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Each of Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
 Marketing Approval
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA or BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision.
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity.
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, or PREA, as amended and reauthorized, certain must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements.
 The FDA also may require submission of a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools.  
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements.
 After evaluating the application and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA or BLA and may require additional clinical or preclinical testing in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications.
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that particular contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval.
 18


Orphan Drug Act
 Under the Orphan Drug Act of 1983, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biologic intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the United States a drug for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the United States for that drug. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the name of the sponsor, identity of the drug or biologic and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. The orphan drug designation does not shorten the duration of the regulatory review or approval process, but does provide certain advantages, such as a waiver of PDUFA fees, enhanced access to FDA staff and potential waiver of pediatric research requirements.
 If a product that has orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications, including a full NDA or BLA, or an abbreviated NDA (ANDA) or Biosimilar application, to market a drug or biologic with the same active moiety for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan drug exclusivity. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving a different drug or biologic for the same disease or condition, or the same drug or biologic for a different disease or condition. Among the other benefits of orphan drug designation are tax credits for certain research and a waiver of the application user fee. A designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. In addition, exclusive marketing rights in the United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantities of the product to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.
 Fast Track Designation 
 The FDA is required to facilitate the development and expedite the review of pharmaceutical products that are intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition for which there is no effective treatment, and which demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Under the fast-track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request the FDA to designate the product for a specific indication as a fast-track product concurrent with or after the filing of the IND for the product candidate. The FDA must determine if the product candidate qualifies for fast-track designation within 60 days after receipt of the sponsor’s request. 
 In addition to other benefits, such as the ability to have more frequent interactions with the FDA, the agency may initiate review of sections of a fast-track product’s NDA or BLA before the application is complete. This rolling review is available if the applicant provides and the FDA approves a schedule for the submission of the remaining information and the applicant pays applicable user fees. However, the FDA’s PDUFA review period for a fast-track application does not begin until the last section of the application is submitted. In addition, the fast-track designation may be withdrawn by the FDA if the agency believes that the designation is no longer supported by data emerging in the clinical trial process. 
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data.
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of a marketing authorization. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization.
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance.
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of 
 19


post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things:
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve related pending applications or supplements to approved applications, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability.
 Coverage and Reimbursement
 Sales of our drug candidates, if approved, will depend, in part, on the extent to which such products will be covered by third-party payors, such as government health care programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly limiting coverage or reducing reimbursements for medical products and services. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures, and foreign governments have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Third-party payors decide which therapies they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own coverage and reimbursement policies. Further, no uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement exists in the United States. Therefore, decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided for any drug candidates that we develop will be made on a payor-by-payor basis. Each payor determines whether or not

 it will provide coverage for a therapy, what amount it will pay the manufacturer for the therapy, and on what tier of its formulary it will be placed. The position on a payor’s list of covered drugs, or formulary, generally determines the co-payment that a patient will need to make to obtain the therapy and can strongly influence the adoption of such therapy by patients and physicians. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our drug candidates or a decision by a third-party payor to not cover our drug candidates could reduce physician usage of our drug candidates, once approved, and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. C
overage policies and third-party payor reimbursement rates may change at any time. Therefore, even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Other Healthcare Laws
 Because of our current and future arrangements with healthcare professionals, principal investigators, consultants, customers and third-party payors, we will also be subject to healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and the states and foreign governments in which we will conduct our business, including our clinical research, proposed sales, marketing and educational programs. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil, criminal, and administrative penalties.
 The U.S. laws that may affect our ability to operate, among others, include: the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information; certain state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts; the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; federal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent; federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters; the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics, and medical supplies to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, and ownership and investment 
 20


interests held by physicians and their immediate family members. Beginning in 2022, applicable manufacturers also will be required to report such information regarding their payments and other transfers of value to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, anesthesiologist assistants, certified registered nurse anesthetists and certified nurse midwives during the previous year.
 In addition, many states have similar laws and regulations, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws that may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of payor, in addition to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs. Additionally, to the extent that our product is sold in a foreign country, we may be subject to similar foreign laws.
 Healthcare Reform
 Current and future legislative proposals to further reform healthcare or reduce healthcare costs may result in lower reimbursement for our products. The cost containment measures that payors and providers are instituting and the effect of any healthcare reform initiative implemented in the future could significantly reduce our revenues from the sale of our products.
 For example, implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, collectively the Affordable Care Act, or the PPACA, has substantially changed healthcare financing and delivery by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the pharmaceutical industry. The PPACA, among other things, established an annual, nondeductible fee on any entity that manufactures or imports certain specified branded prescription drugs and biologic agents, revised the methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers to the state and federal government for covered outpatient drugs under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by most manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, extended the Medicaid Drug Rebate program to utilization of prescriptions of individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, provided incentives to programs that increase the federal government’s comparative effectiveness research and created a licensure frame work for follow-on biologic products. Since its enactment there have been executive, judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the PPACA. For example, President Trump has signed several Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of certain provisions of the PPACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the PPACA. Concurrently, Congress considered legislation to repeal or repeal and replace all or part of the PPACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the PPACA have been signed into law. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 includes a provision repealing, effective January 1, 2019, the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the PPACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the “individual mandate”. Additionally, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the PPACA-mandated “Cadillac” tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. Further, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amends the PPACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50 percent to 70 percent the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the “donut hole.” 
Moreover, on December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court Judge ruled that the PPACA is unconstitutional in its entirety because the “individual mandate” was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the PPACA are invalid as well. 

The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing this case

but it is unknown when a decision will be reached. Although the Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the PPACA, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the PPACA marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the PPACA. 
It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation, and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the PPACA.
 In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. In August 2011, then President Obama signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals for spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect in April 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2030

 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, COVID-19 relief support legislation suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021. Additionally, in January 2013, then President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. Further, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products. For example, there have been presidential executive orders and several recent Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, review the relationship between pricing and

manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products.  It is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives.  
 We expect that additional federal and state, as well as foreign, healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, particularly in light of the new presidential administration, any of which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
