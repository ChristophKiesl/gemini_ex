ITEM 1. BUSINESS
General

We were incorporated in the State of Nevada on October 5, 2015 to develop a business that specializes in marketing health and wellness vacations to both individuals and corporate groups looking to revitalize and develop a fuller day-to-day life. We were not successful in our efforts and discontinued that line of business.

On February 4, 2021, Kynson closed stock purchase and sale transactions pursuant to which Kynson sold an aggregate of 9,985,329 restricted shares of the Company’s Common Stock to eleven purchasers at a purchase price of $0.030044 per share, or an aggregate purchase price of $299,998.60. Upon the closing of the stock purchase and sale transaction, Ms. Yang resigned from all positions she held with the Company and, in connection with her resignation, she relinquished her roles as the Company’s “Principal Executive Officer” and “Principal Financial and Accounting Officer.” Effective immediately upon Ms. Yang’s resignation, John D. Rollo was appointed as the Company’s President, Secretary and Treasurer, and as the sole member of the Company’s board of the directors (“Board”). In connection with his appointments, Mr. Rollo was designated as the “Principal Executive Officer” and “Principal Financial and Accounting Officer” of the Company for SEC reporting purposes. In connection with and as a condition to, the consummation of this stock purchase and sale transaction, eleven shareholders of the Company returned an aggregate of 4,345,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock to the Company for cancellation, in consideration for $0.001 per share. As a result of this stock and purchase transaction and simultaneous cancellation of 4,345,000 shares by eleven stockholders, there was a change in control of the Company.

On May 21, 2021, Mr. Rollo resigned as the Company’s President, Treasurer, Secretary, and sole member of the Board.

Because we were not able to raise sufficient capital to execute our original business plan, the Company ceased that line of business and is a shell company, as that term is defined in Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Going forward, our main business operations consist of seeking a business combination with a private entity whose business would present an opportunity for its shareholders.

Our objectives discussed below are extremely general and are not intended to restrict discretion of our Board of to search for and enter into potential business opportunities or to reject any such opportunities.

We will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business, industry or geographical location and, thus, may acquire any type of business. Further, we may acquire or combine with a venture that is in its preliminary or early stages of development, one that is already in operation, or one that is in a more mature stage of its corporate existence. Accordingly, business opportunities may be available in many different industries and at various stages of development, all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities difficult and complex.

With respect to any merger or acquisition, negotiations with target company management are expected to focus on the percentage of our company that the target company shareholders would acquire in exchange for all of their shareholdings in the target company. Depending upon, among other things, the target company’s assets and liabilities, our existing shareholders will in all likelihood hold a substantially lesser percentage ownership interest in our company following any merger or acquisition. The percentage ownership of our existing shareholders may be subject to significant reduction in the event we acquire a target company with substantial assets. Any merger or acquisition effected by us can be expected to have a significant dilutive effect on the percentage of shares held by our shareholders at such time.

We will participate in a business opportunity only after the negotiation and execution of appropriate agreements. Although the terms of such agreements cannot be predicted, generally such agreements will require certain representations and warranties of the parties thereto, will specify certain events of default, will detail the terms of closing and the conditions which must be satisfied by the parties prior to and after such closing, will outline the manner of bearing costs, including costs associated with our attorneys and accountants, and will include miscellaneous other terms.

It is anticipated that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation, drafting and execution of relevant agreements, disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial cost for accountants, attorneys and others. If a decision is made not to participate in a specific business opportunity, the costs theretofore incurred in the related investigation would not be recoverable. Furthermore, even if an agreement is reached for the participation in a specific business opportunity, the failure to consummate that transaction may result in our loss of the related costs incurred.

Competition

We expect to encounter substantial competition in our efforts to identify and consummate a transaction with a business opportunity. The primary competition will be from other companies organized and funded for similar purposes, small venture capital partnerships and corporations, small business investment companies and wealthy individuals, all of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. In view of our limited financial resources and limited management availability, we may be at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors.
Employees

We presently have no employees apart from Irwin Schneidmill, our sole officer and director. Mr. Schneidmill is engaged in outside business activities and anticipates that he will devote to our business limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified. We expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes, if any, incident to a business combination.

We intend to hire additional management and other support personnel when we have reached a point in our proposed growth that would allow for such employment. In the interim, we will rely upon consultants to assist us in identifying and investigating acquisition opportunities.
