We Are Uniquely Positioned to Address Transformative Shifts across the Healthcare Continuum
The shift to digital transformation. The proliferation of data is well-known across all industries, and this is particularly true in healthcare. Every medical device, network and platform is creating and consuming data at a staggering rate. We believe this presents both a challenge and an opportunity. The abundance of data makes it overwhelming to manage, and an even greater challenge is to extract business value embedded in data. Turning data into something businesses can use to their advantage can be a complex, manual task, and the time, effort and energy required can zero out the benefits. If businesses are unable to extract meaning, then data continues to accumulate, becoming a hinderance to business efficiency and effectiveness. It is precisely because it is challenging to make data actionable, that it becomes an opportunity for businesses to build competitive advantage.
We believe we possess six key capabilities needed to help our customers unlock the value that resides in their data. NantHealth has the ability to: 1) move data efficiently, 2) interpret it accurately, 3) visualize it intuitively while keeping the data 4) safe, 5) secure and 6) scalable. That is what we do at NantHealth. We provide enterprise solutions that help businesses transform complex data into actionable insights. These capabilities are delivered through a comprehensive suite of products and services unique to NantHealth. In addition to the acquisition of OpenNMS, which added network monitoring to our solutions catalog, we are expanding our data science capabilities and AI competencies to drive further innovation across our existing product lines and to explore new product and service offerings in the data analytics field.

The shift to value-based care and precision medicine. The efficiency and effectiveness of the current healthcare system is often hindered by the complex, dynamic interplay of three uncoordinated and segregated domains: the knowledge domain, the care delivery domain, and the payer domain. The disparate nature of these domains, and their often-inconsistent incentives and conflicting priorities, can inhibit interoperability and coordination. We believe two simultaneous, transformative shifts are highlighting these critical deficiencies of the current healthcare environment:
1.A rapid evolution from traditional fee-for-service to patient-centered and patient-empowered, value-based models driven by quantifiable measures of outcomes relative to cost. Unsustainable escalating healthcare costs, which we believe are due to broken fee-for-service models, are driving many stakeholders and governments toward alternative delivery models. Despite significant investments in Electronic Health Records ("EHRs") and other technologies designed to enable the transition to more value-based care, we believe that, in a fee-for-service model, the economic incentives generally discourage coordination among healthcare stakeholders and encourage volume-driven (rather than outcomes-driven) decision-making. This model results in healthcare and financial data that remains largely segregated into “walled gardens.” Thus, patient data often remains static and cannot be easily shared or interpreted due to siloed legacy proprietary platforms that lack interoperability.
2.A shift to molecularly precise medicine, with both massive volumes and rapidly expanding repositories of complex data from traditional and novel sources. Advances in molecular medicine require healthcare providers to promptly aggregate, evaluate and synthesize hundreds to thousands of relevant facts in real time to arrive at a single patient decision. Molecular profiling often generates hundreds of gigabytes of data per patient, which must then be transported, stored, analyzed and interpreted with supercomputing and/or high-performance computing environments. We believe the rapid pace of medical advancements and the massive amount of molecular data being generated is overwhelming many providers’ ability to process that information at the point of care, thereby inhibiting the growth of individualized medicine.
We believe these shifts, and the associated challenges, require advanced technology systems and data expertise that our customers cannot quickly and easily develop on their own. Our unique portfolio of technology solutions allow us to collect, interpret and deliver data insights that help our customers improve their businesses, provide decision support with a comprehensive knowledge base of evidence-based treatment options, and help both payers and providers effectively transition to value-based care. Given the magnitude of these shifts and the difficulty involved in addressing the associated challenges, we believe our solution platforms serve to position NantHealth at the forefront of multiple growing market opportunities. We have invested significant capital, software development, data, healthcare and biotechnology expertise over a decade to develop, acquire and integrate the components that we believe address many of the challenges faced by stakeholders across the continuum of care.
Our Strategy
Our goal is to become the leading provider of solutions that enable enterprises to leverage actionable data insights. In the healthcare space, we seek to facilitate payer and provider collaboration, and to leverage clinical data and knowledge towards delivering improved patient outcomes and more effective treatment decisions for critical illnesses. To accomplish this goal, we plan to deploy NantHealth solutions designed to address and accelerate the transformational shifts occurring in healthcare (empowering the extraction of value from the growing abundance of data; rapid evolution from traditional fee-for-service to value-based models; and, the shift to molecularly precise medicine), while also expanding our network monitoring solution capabilities to support the underlying infrastructure necessary to enable transformational shifts in healthcare and other industries.

•Increasing sales of NantHealth solutions to healthcare payers, providers, and self-insured employers. We are marketing NantHealth solutions to healthcare payers and providers transitioning from fee-for-service reimbursement models to value-based care models in pursuit of improved patient outcomes and lower costs. We believe we are positioning NantHealth as a next-generation payer intermediary and partner with healthcare payers and self-insured employers as they roll out value-based model partnerships and transition to value-based precision care.
•Growing the market for open source-based network monitoring services. We are working to grow the on-premise install base for the OpenNMS network monitoring platform and expand sales of OpenNMS maintenance, support and professional service offerings. We are also expanding the OpenNMS service suite to include SaaS based monitoring services and easier to manage “no-touch” remote appliance services.
•Developing new features and functionality for NantHealth solutions. We are continuing to make significant R&D investments to create new features and functionality within NantHealth’s solutions. For example, we are exploring the expansion of our Eviti decision support product line to cover additional diseases and chronic conditions and are furthering the integration of artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based analytics into our network monitoring solutions to provide insights into alarm/event correlation, anomaly detection, and root cause analysis (RCA). We are also continuing the development of data analytics capabilities and assets so that we can expand the products and services offered to our healthcare clients and partners.
•Complementing internal growth with strategic acquisitions. We believe opportunities exist for us to enhance our competitive position by acquiring additional companies with complementary products and technologies and/or acquiring rights to proprietary products or technologies from third parties.
•Exploring industry partnerships for companion diagnostics, while continuing to pursue enhanced reimbursement for our molecular analysis services. We have pursued FDA 510(k) authorization and Medicare coverage for the core elements of our GPS Cancer laboratory developed test offering. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we received FDA 510(k) authorization for “Omics Core”, the nation’s first FDA authorized whole exome tumor-normal in vitro diagnostic (IVD) that measures overall tumor mutational burden (TMB) in cancer tissue, completing a key step towards achieving Medicare coverage. In May 2020, we received notice from Molecular Diagnostic Services (MolDx) of a limited coverage determination for Omics Core. Going forward, we intend to explore opportunities to commercialize our test capabilities with pharmaceutical partners through companion diagnostics and to improve overall reimbursement coverage.
Our Industry
Today, the explosion in the quantity, frequency and complexity of data and the ability to measure data in terms of outcomes relative to cost, demands to mature, specialized software platforms, and expertise to address transformative shifts and challenges.
Every device, network and platform is creating and consuming data at a staggering rate, making it overwhelming to manage, and extract business value embedded in the data.
Nearly 100% of C-level executives surveyed by PricewaterhouseCoopers said they see data on customers and clients as “critical or important” to getting an edge on competitors in the years ahead. Businesses must learn how to uncover actionable insights hidden in their data, or risk being left behind. But turning bits and bytes of data into something businesses can use to their advantage can be a complex, manual task that involves the ability to:
•Connect systems
•Normalize data
•Interpret outputs
•Make it actionable
Developing the capabilities needed for businesses to undertake the challenge of managing, analyzing, and interpreting data is difficult. Those able to tap the insights hidden within their data and make it actionable for their employees and stakeholders will unearth a new source of value and differentiation.

In the U.S. healthcare industry, a rapid evolution from traditional fee-for-service to patient-centered and patient-empowered, value-based models driven by quantifiable measures of outcomes relative to cost.
In response to the rising cost of healthcare, government and private payers and providers are introducing value-based care models. In value-based models, providers assume increased levels of clinical and financial responsibility for patient outcomes, instead of being reimbursed strictly based on the quantity of services provided. We believe that healthcare platforms that efficiently assist healthcare stakeholders to transition to these value-based models will be best positioned to capture this opportunity.
Challenges associated with the adoption of value-based models
The healthcare continuum can be viewed as an aggregation of three distinct domains:
•The knowledge domain, including academic centers, scientific institutions and companies that discover and commercialize medical and scientific knowledge;
•The care delivery domain, including hospitals, community practices, physicians and other constituents that deliver healthcare to patients; and
•The payer domain, including insurers, governments and self-insured employers that administer and provide funding to the healthcare system.
The disparate and fragmented nature of these domains and economic incentives under traditional fee-for-service models frequently result in overtreatment, high costs and suboptimal patient outcomes. Fee-for-service models are as a general matter inherently site-centric, volume driven, reactive in nature and uncoordinated. In contrast, value-based models are generally more patient-centric, outcomes-focused, proactive and coordinated across the care continuum.
Despite a clear need, the design and implementation of next-generation interoperable systems has been limited due to reliance on legacy, site-specific, fee-for-service technology systems and infrastructure. Since the passage of the HITECH Act in 2009, providers and payers have made significant investments in EHRs, and other technologies meant to enable the transition to value-based care. Despite extensive investment and coordination, the introduction of value-based models has been limited due to the shortcomings of legacy, proprietary systems and the reliance on unstructured data that hinders interoperability and cannot be sufficiently shared or manipulated to produce actionable findings. Value-based models require collection and analysis of longitudinal treatment, outcomes and financial data at the patient level, regardless of treatment site. Critically, these systems must also securely safeguard patient data in compliance with stringent HIPAA and other privacy regulations. We believe that there is a significant need for interoperability platforms that dynamically access, normalize, integrate and update information from disparate sources across the healthcare continuum in real time. Secure interoperability platforms can allow for more comprehensive solutions development that proactively connect, deliver business and clinical intelligence and enable enhanced provider and patient engagement.
A shift to molecularly precise medicine, with both massive volumes and rapidly expanding categories of complex data from traditional and novel sources.
The collection and interpretation of molecular profiles has the potential to dramatically improve quality and outcomes.
Evolution to comprehensive molecular analysis
Advances in genomic sequencing and the associated cost efficiencies have led to the development of targeted therapeutics initiating the transformation from “one size fits all” treatments to personalized, molecularly precise medicine. Oncology is leading the rapid advances in molecular testing and the development of targeted therapeutics based on increasing understanding of the impact of molecular profile on disease progression. Recent publications, including The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network genomic and molecular characterization studies, support selection of treatment regimens based on the underlying molecular pathways and related genomic alterations in the genetic profile of the tumor compared with the patient’s own germline, as opposed to the anatomical location of the cancer in the patient’s body. Cancer is increasingly understood to be a heterogeneous collection of rare diseases, with hundreds of patient-specific, cancer-promoting mutated proteins, some known and many more unknown, called neoepitopes. Identifying and targeting these mutated proteins is requiring more comprehensive genomic analysis (including tumor-to-germline comparison and RNA expression as confirmation of the presence of variants), which is increasingly becoming embedded in drug approvals. As a result, we believe comprehensive genomic analysis is positioned to become the standard of clinical care, replacing single marker or gene panels in treating cancer patients.

While oncology represents an immediate opportunity for the application of comprehensive genomic analysis, other disease areas are beginning to experience a similar evolution. We believe technologies that enable the capture, aggregation and analysis of massive volumes of genomic data will further bolster the growth of precision medicine and its expansion from cancer to additional disease states. Over time, we believe this will lead to identification of drugs that target specific pathways by using a universal personalized companion diagnostics platform, ultimately resulting in improved clinical outcomes.
Growth in complexity and its promise for value-based models
Advances in data collection and molecular medicine require healthcare providers to promptly aggregate, evaluate and synthesize hundreds to thousands of relevant facts to arrive at a single patient decision. With the pace of medical advancements, the significant amount of data being created every day by patient care, payment and regulatory compliance systems, and the enormous complexity of genomics and expression analysis derived from comprehensive molecular analysis, it is nearly impossible for a practicing physician to interpret and synthesize the deluge of complex information required for patient treatment.
We believe there is a considerable need for collaboration and decision support platforms, along with advanced adaptive machine learning algorithms, to collect, index and analyze rich phenotypic and genomic data at scale to support physician decision-making. Although this complexity creates significant challenges, it also presents opportunities for developers of systems infrastructures, platforms and learning systems that can identify clinically meaningful correlations that can be employed to improve patient outcomes in a cost-effective manner.
Managing massive volumes of data requires specialized infrastructure, and making data meaningful and actionable requires it to be processed by advanced systems operating in scalable and reliable environments.
The network monitoring market is moving away from corporate managed, on premise solutions towards hybrid and cloud solutions with a focus on platform services expansion and artificial intelligence/machine learning (AI/ML)-based analytics to provide intelligent alarm/event management.
Key trends include:
•Expansion of the network edge to include IoT components and the migration of the network core to the cloud requires that network performance monitoring and diagnostics tools provide visibility in hybrid environments, including edge and cloud network monitoring.
•Implementation of cloud native applications and microservices for platform management and orchestration to optimize performance and cost in the cloud.
•Increasing appetite for flexible deployment models include SaaS and on-demand pricing, and use of virtual machines, software appliances, and hardware appliances to enable these deployments.
•Evolution of traditional network monitoring platforms beyond the basic levels of infrastructure monitoring, and incorporating APIs for easy extension of additional services such as Digital Experience Monitoring, flows/flowlogs, and other applications that support business users and understanding of end-user experience.
•Increasing focus on AI/ML advanced analytics to support AIOPs (e.g., for anomaly detection, event correlation and root cause analysis (RCA)).
•Focus on network security and alignment between network operations and security operations.
With our highly scalable, reliable, and extensible platform solution for network monitoring, OpenNMS is well positioned to address these market trends. Our zero touch appliance solution enables remote monitoring of edge components and enables additional hybrid and cloud integrations. Our traffic analysis (flows) and route monitoring solutions provide deep understanding of network performance. Our Architecture for Learning Enabled Correlation (ALEC) AI/ML solution provides valuable insights and visualizations for interpreting complex faults/alerts. 
Our Market Opportunity
We believe the increasing focus on managing, analyzing and interpreting the large amounts of generated data, and on value-based reimbursement models and evidence-based, personalized medicine will drive validation and adoption of NantHealth solutions. 
•Proliferation of Data: Over 44T gigabytes of data have been amassed by companies as of 2020, with a 581% increase in new data by 2025. Given the challenges and specialized capabilities required to manage, analyze, and derive insights from the vast amounts of data, we believe NantHealth is uniquely positioned to address this market need. 
•Cost of Cancer Care: Recent statistics show that 39.5% of Americans will be diagnosed with cancer at some point in their lives, resulting in an estimated cost of $246 billion by 2030. As the cost of cancer care continues to grow, there will be an ongoing need to balance cost efficiency with improved outcomes. Our evidence-based decision support solutions can help providers and payers better manage oncology care for the patients and members they serve. 
- 7 -


•Transition to Digital: Reports show that 75% of all medical communications still happen over fax in addition to phone calls, emails and other manual channels. NantHealth’s payer/provider collaboration platforms can significantly improve the efficient, accurate and timely exchange of information.
•Precision Medicine: Comprehensive diagnostics and evidence-based medicine is becoming increasingly important across multiple disease areas and likely assuming greater share of the combined biopharmaceutical and diagnostics markets. Our molecular analysis solutions enable an increased understanding of molecular pathways and the ability to treat diseases at the individual level.
We believe the potential addressable market for NantHealth solutions will continue to grow in relation to the market-share gains of value-based models, the continuing transition to digital only clinical communications and collaboration and the adoption of precision medicine.

GPS Cancer and Omics Core
GPS Cancer is a comprehensive molecular profile that integrates whole genome/exome (DNA) sequencing of tumor and normal germline samples and whole transcriptome (RNA) sequencing, providing oncologists with insights into the unique molecular signature of a patient’s cancer to inform personalized treatment strategies. The results of the GPS Cancer profile can provide oncologists with insight into cancer therapies that may have potential benefit - including active clinical trials - and those therapies to which the cancer may be resistant. GPS Cancer profiling is conducted in CLIA-certified and CAP-accredited laboratories.
GPS Cancer compares a total of 6 billion DNA base pairs between a patient’s healthy normal (or germline) sample and the tumor sample (usually Formalin-Fixed, Paraffin-Embedded-FFPE or fresh frozen tissue) each encoding for over 20,000 genes. All the RNA (over 200,000 transcripts) from the tumor sample is sequenced to confirm and give evidence of expression of mutations found in the genome. We identify affected molecular pathways that are drivers of a patient’s cancer by analyzing DNA and RNA sequence data against our curated database of over 15,000 nodes within approximately 1,500 protein pathways.
Omics Core is an FDA authorized in-vitro diagnostic built on a custom-targeted whole exome sequencing platform that reports both overall tumor mutation burden in tumor specimens from 19,396 protein-coding genes (whole exome) and somatic alterations (point mutations, small insertions and deletions) in 468 cancer-relevant genes.
Cancer is increasingly understood to be a heterogeneous collection of rare diseases. As such, understanding genomic alterations in tumor samples can help to identify potential treatment options for the personalized management of people with cancer.
Whole genome/exome sequencing of a person’s tumor sample against their normal sample highlights molecular alterations that are specific to their tumor DNA, and RNA sequencing subsequently confirms the alterations identified in the DNA of a person’s tumor. Whole genome/exome sequencing and RNA sequencing can provide vital clinical information about individual molecular alterations in tumors that result in abnormal proteins, which can be important targets for many cancer therapies.
Molecular profiling identifies genomic alterations with high clinical relevance to each person’s tumor. The alterations are then matched to drugs that might be effective against tumors containing the specific change. By identifying the totality of alterations from whole genome/exome sequencing, homing in on alterations that are associated with protein expression from RNA sequencing, a more accurate and comprehensive molecular profile is assembled that can inform the therapeutic options available to oncology care providers and their patients.
Our GPS Cancer test results includes information on a patient’s pharmacogenomic profile to provide insight on germline alterations implicated in increased toxicity or altered metabolism of anti-cancer drugs. This information is presented in a patient’s GPS Cancer test report.

By enabling informed therapy selection and utilization, GPS Cancer and Omics Core bring various opportunities to impact both cost and quality of care for individuals with cancer, such as:
•Avoiding ineffective therapy usage: By providing molecular insight into sensitivity or resistance to specific drugs, GPS Cancer may help oncologists identify regimens that are unlikely to benefit the patient. This insight may help avoid use of high-cost therapies that are unlikely to help the patient.
•Decreasing treatment cycles through improved therapy selection: Therapies selected based on molecular evidence of likely benefit may require fewer cycles to achieve response.
•Increasing clinical trial participation: For many advanced cancers, standard-of-care drug options are quickly exhausted, and clinical trials represent a source of additional options for patients. GPS Cancer helps identify trials that may be applicable to the patient based on their tumor’s molecular profile.

Our Relationship with NantOmics and Allscripts
We have worldwide rights from NantOmics to resell the proprietary GPS Cancer and Omics Core products to institutional clients, including payers, self-insured employers and healthcare providers.NantOmics provides whole genome/exome and RNA sequencing, along with related computational and data management and bioinformatics services. We provide these services as part of our comprehensive molecular analysis offering. Under the agreement, we are responsible for various aspects of delivering our sequencing and molecular analysis solutions, including patient engagement and communications with providers such as providing interpretations of our GPS Cancer reports and resolving any disputes, ensuring customer satisfaction, and managing billing and collections. Our agreement for exclusive rights from NantOmics expired in December 2020, subject to renewal for up to an additional nine years if certain thresholds are met. The terms of the agreement included an annual minimum of $2.0 million in fees for years 2016-2020 paid to NantOmics. On December 31, 2020, we entered into an agreement with NantOmics to automatically renew at the end of December 2020 for a non-exclusive renewal term and to waive the annual minimum of $2.0 million in fees for the 2020 calendar year and without an annual minimum in each year thereafter.
On August 3, 2017, we entered into an asset purchase agreement with Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, Inc. ("Allscripts"), pursuant to which we agreed to sell to Allscripts substantially all of the assets of the Company’s provider/patient engagement solutions business, including our FusionFX solution and components of its NantOS software connectivity solutions. The sale was completed on August 25, 2017. 
- 13 -


Concurrent with the sale to Allscripts and as contemplated by the asset purchase agreement, we and Allscripts modified the amended and restated mutual license and reseller agreement dated June 26, 2015, which was further amended on December 30, 2017, such that, among other things, we committed to deliver a minimum of $95.0 million of total bookings over a ten-year period (“Bookings Commitment”) from referral transactions and sales of certain Allscripts products under this agreement. We also agreed that Allscripts shall receive at least $0.5 million per year in payments from bookings (the “Annual Minimum Commitment”). If the total payments received by Allscripts from bookings during such period are less than the Annual Minimum Commitment, we shall pay to Allscripts the difference between the Annual Minimum Commitment and the total amount received by Allscripts from bookings during such period. In the event of a Bookings Commitment shortfall at the end of the ten-year period, we may be obligated to pay 70% of the shortfall, subject to certain credits. We will earn 30% commission from Allscripts on each software referral transaction that results in a booking with Allscripts. We account for the Bookings Commitment at its estimated fair value over the life of the agreement and, as of December 31, 2020, we estimate the total liability to be $33.9 million.
Our Clients
NantHealth solutions and technology platforms are used by key healthcare stakeholders, including healthcare providers, payers, self-insured employers, academic institutions and biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, and our network monitoring solutions are used by stakeholders in the logistics, telecommunication, and other industries, to automate, understand, and act on data while keeping it secure and scalable. NantHealth solutions, coupled with our engagement methodology, is designed to be tailored to meet the large-scale needs of governmental organizations and private entities while remaining convenient, intuitive and configurable at the user level. We believe that this provides us with a significant advantage over a siloed, single vendor approach, which often requires the removal or replacement of existing information technology infrastructure and applications.
Our total revenue was $73.2 million and $77.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were four and three customers, respectively, each accounting for more than 10% of our revenue.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales organization is primarily comprised of direct sales executives and pre-sales support teams organized by account type and domain and subject matter expertise. We also leverage strategic reseller arrangements and a channel relationship coverage team.
•Direct sales organization: We leverage domain and subject matter expertise, market credibility, thought leadership, and relationships of our executives, senior management, and product leaders in our sales efforts. Our direct sales organization is by product ownership. These direct coverage teams include both sales professionals searching for new accounts and client engagement sales professionals responsible for developing existing accounts. Furthermore, sales professionals have unique expertise and specialized coverage for health plans, self-insured employers, health systems, and individual providers. Our account management organization is responsible for the continuity of current client relationships and the expansion of those relationships to include additional solutions and services.
We have a pre-sales organization that includes clinical, business and technical customer alignment teams to support our sales organization in addition to executive sponsorship with members of our senior management team.
•Resale and channel partnership: In the United States, we have entered into strategic resale arrangements with major partners, including EHR vendors (including Allscripts), in-hospital medical devices manufacturers and health plans who resell our solutions to their customer base. Internationally, we have entered into resale arrangements with other strategic distributors to accelerate our market adoption. Reseller revenue in 2020 and 2019 was $2.9 million and $4.4 million, respectively.
We also maintain business relationships with individuals and organizations that promote or support our sales or services. We refer to these individuals and organizations as our channel partners. These channel partners generally do not make sales directly like our resale partners, but instead provide us with leads that we use to develop new business through our direct sales force. These relationships enable access to broader hospital and physician clients, leading software solutions and multiple cross-selling opportunities.
We complement our sales efforts with a marketing organization that plans and execute marketing and communication strategies that are centered on initiatives that drive awareness of our company and solutions. These initiatives include educating the market about our company broadly, as well as solutions-specific campaigns for lead generation. Marketing efforts also include participation in speaking engagements and strategic interfacing with key business and trade media personnel. We employ a broad array of specific events to facilitate these initiatives, including, but not limited to, sponsorship and partnership of key industry conferences such as HIMSS and or AHIP, events and client-focused programs such as key partner user groups.

Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are commercially important to our business, including seeking, maintaining, and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or acquired from third parties. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing patent applications in the United States and in jurisdictions outside of the United States related to our proprietary technology, inventions, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets and know-how relating to our proprietary technology, continuing innovation, and acquisition and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen, and maintain our proprietary position in the field of molecular diagnostics and healthcare technology products and services.
Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for our technology, inventions, and improvements; to preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; to defend and enforce our proprietary rights, including our patents; and to operate without infringing on the valid and enforceable patents and other proprietary rights of third parties.
We have developed and acquired patents and patent applications and we possess know-how and trade secrets relating to the development and commercialization of healthcare technology products and services. As of December 31, 2020, our patent portfolio consisted of the following matters relating to our proprietary technology and inventions: (i) thirteen (13) issued U.S. utility patents and two (2) issued U.S. design patents; (ii) nineteen (19) pending U.S. utility patent applications; (iii) thirteen (13) issued patents in jurisdictions outside the United States; and (iv) seven (7) patent applications pending in jurisdictions outside the United States. Five (5) of these assets are jointly owned. We believe we have intellectual property rights that are necessary to commercialize our healthcare technology products and services. However, our patent applications may not result in issued patents, and, even if issued, the patents may be challenged and invalidated. Moreover, our patents and patent applications may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or developing competing products. We also face the risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or may design around our proprietary property.
Individual patents extend for varying periods of time, depending upon the date of filing of the patent application, the date of patent issuance, and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained.
Generally, patents issued for applications filed in the United States are effective for 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. The patent term may be adjusted to compensate for delayed patent issuance, when such delays are caused by the patent office or successful appeals against patent office actions. The duration of patents outside of the United States varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but often is also 20 years from the earliest effective non-provisional filing date. We estimate that our issued U.S. patents will expire on dates ranging from 2022 to 2036. If patents are issued on our pending U.S. patent applications, the resulting patents are projected to expire on dates ranging from 2026 to 2040. However, the actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a product-by-product basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country, and the validity and enforceability of the patent.
The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. No consistent policy regarding the scope of claims allowable in patents in the field of healthcare information technology has emerged in the United States. The patent situation outside of the United States is even more uncertain. Changes in either the patent laws or their interpretation in the United States and other countries may diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights, and more generally could affect the value of our intellectual property. In particular, our ability to prevent third parties from making, using, selling, offering to sell, or importing products that infringe our intellectual property will depend in part on our success in obtaining and enforcing patent claims that cover our technology, inventions, and improvements.
- 16 -


With respect to our intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our products and the processes involved in using those products. Moreover, even our issued patents do not guarantee us the right to practice our technology in relation to the commercialization of our products. In particular, the area of patent and other intellectual property rights in healthcare and network monitoring technology is an evolving one with many risks and uncertainties, and third parties may have blocking patents that could be used to prevent us from commercializing our products and practicing our technology. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or limit the length of the term of patent protection that we may have for our products. In addition, the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technologies. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop similar technologies that effectively compete with our technology. For these reasons, third-parties may compete with our products and services. Moreover, because of the extensive time required for development and testing of a potential product or service, it is possible that, before any particular product or service can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a relatively short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.
We may also rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We seek to protect our technology and product candidates, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with those who have access to our confidential information, including our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our proprietary technology and processes by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. Although we have confidence in these individuals, organizations, and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or may be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our employees, contractors, consultants, collaborators, and advisors use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
For this and more comprehensive risks related to our proprietary technology, inventions, improvements and products, please see the section captioned “Risk Factors-Risks Related to Intellectual Property.”
Human Capital and Culture
Our key human capital management objectives are focused on attracting, retaining, and developing the highest quality talent. To support these objectives, our human resources programs are designed to develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions for the future; reward and support employees through competitive pay, benefit, and recognition programs; enhance our culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more engaging and inclusive; acquire talent and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing, diverse workforce; engage employees as brand ambassadors of the Company’s products and services; and evolve and invest in technology, tools, and resources to enable employees at work.
We view our employees and company culture as integral to the successful execution of our vision and mission. As a result, our leadership team prioritizes establishing trusting relationships with our clients, our partners, and each other. We encourage our employees to “rise up” to the challenge and believe that this collective mindset has enabled us to attract and retain some of the best minds in technology, bioscience and healthcare to build and advance our offering. Our core values, which we seek to reflect in our work are:
•Clarity: conveying our mission clearly, coherently and intelligibly, and empowering our stakeholders with information required to make good decisions.
•Empathy: understanding and sharing the feelings of others by putting yourself in another’s place.
•Collaboration: working with others to create solutions.
•Pioneering: exploring and developing original solutions that make a meaningful impact on our community, the market, or society at large.
•Community: creating a feeling of identity and fellowship with others resulting from common values and goals.
•Integrity: always being honest, honorable and accountable with adherence to moral and ethical principles.
As of December 31, 2020, we employed a total of 356 employees in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. Our global workforce is comprised of approximately 99% full-time and 1% part-time employees. Employee engagement and retention are core tenets of our leadership focus and are monitored and measured as gauges of our corporate performance and organizational health.
- 17 -


None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
Government Regulation
The healthcare industry and the practice of medicine are governed by an extensive and complex framework of federal and state laws, which continue to evolve and change over time. The costs and resources necessary to comply with these laws are high. Our profitability depends in part upon our ability, and that of our affiliated providers and independent contractors, to operate in compliance with applicable laws and to maintain all applicable licenses. A review of our operations by courts or regulatory authorities could result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations, or the healthcare laws and regulations could change in a way that restricts our operations. To the extent any of our employees or third-party contractors engages in any misconduct or activity in violation of an applicable law, we may be subject to increased liability under the law or increased government scrutiny. If any such action is instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, such action could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions. Complying with any new legislation and regulations could be time-intensive and expensive, resulting in a material adverse effect on our business. 
As a digital health company, our operations are subject to comprehensive United States federal, state and local and international regulation in the jurisdictions in which we do business. Our ability to operate profitably will depend in part upon our ability, and that of our affiliated providers, to maintain all necessary licenses, permits, certifications, or other regulatory authorizations and to operate in compliance with applicable laws and rules. Those laws and rules continue to evolve, and we therefore devote significant resources to monitoring developments in healthcare and medical practice regulation. As the applicable laws and rules change, we are likely to make conforming modifications in our business processes from time to time. In some jurisdictions where we operate, neither our current nor our anticipated business model has been the subject of formal judicial or administrative interpretation. We cannot be assured that a review of our business by courts or regulatory authorities will not result in determinations that could adversely affect our operations or that the healthcare regulatory environment will not change in a way that impacts our operations.
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, state and federal regulatory authorities have temporarily loosened or waived certain regulatory requirements in order to increase the availability of telehealth services for the duration of the COVID-19 public health emergency. For example, many state governors issued executive orders permitting physicians and other health care professionals to practice in their state without any additional licensure or by using a temporary, expedited or abbreviated licensure or registration process so long as they hold a valid license in another state. In addition, changes were made to the Medicare and Medicaid programs (through waivers and other regulatory authority) to increase access to telehealth services by, among other things, increasing reimbursement, permitting the enrollment of out of state providers and eliminating prior authorization requirements. It is uncertain how long these COVID-19 related regulatory changes will remain in effect and whether they will continue beyond this public health emergency period. A return to the status quo could have a materially negative impact on any commercial agreements we have entered into during 2020 or any time before the termination of the COVID-19 public health emergency. For example, we may be required to change our operations or terminate certain services when the government reinstates certain healthcare regulatory requirements or restrictions that were in place before the COVID-19 public health emergency, including certain restrictions on the reimbursement of telehealth visits to Medicare beneficiaries and state licensure requirements for healthcare professionals who practice medicine across state lines.
The products and services that we provide are regulated by federal, state and foreign governmental authorities. Failure to comply with the applicable laws and regulations can subject us to significant administrative or enforcement actions by the government, government investigation, repayment of amounts previously paid to us, significant civil and criminal penalties, loss of licensure, certification, or accreditation, exclusion from government healthcare programs, corporate integrity agreements, or litigation. The significant areas of regulation are summarized below.
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 and State Regulation
The Omics services we perform fall under CLIA. A clinical laboratory is required to hold certain federal and state licenses, certifications, and permits to conduct business. As to federal certifications, Congress passed CLIA in 1988, establishing quality standards for all laboratory testing to ensure the accuracy, reliability, and timeliness of patient test results regardless of where the test was performed. The laboratory that performs our Omics services is CLIA-certified and is also required to meet certain laboratory licensing requirements for states with regulations beyond CLIA.
- 18 -


Under CLIA, a laboratory is any facility which performs laboratory testing on specimens derived from humans for the purpose of providing information for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of disease, or the impairment or assessment of health. CLIA regulates virtually all clinical laboratories by requiring they be certified by the federal government and comply with various operational, personnel, facilities administration, quality, and proficiency requirements intended to ensure that their clinical laboratory testing services are accurate, reliable, and timely. Laboratories must register and list their tests with CMS, the agency that oversees the CLIA program. CLIA compliance and certification is also a prerequisite to be eligible to bill for services provided to governmental payer program beneficiaries and for many private payers. CLIA is user-fee funded. Therefore, all costs of administering the program must be covered by the regulated facilities, including certification and survey costs.
Clinical laboratories are subject to survey and inspection every two years to assess compliance with program standards and may be subject to additional unannounced inspections. Laboratories performing high complexity testing are required to meet more stringent requirements than laboratories performing fewer complex tests. In addition, a laboratory, like the one which performs our Omics services, that is certified as “high complexity” under CLIA, may develop, manufacture, validate, and use proprietary tests referred to as laboratory developed tests, or LDTs. CLIA requires full validation, including accuracy, precision, specificity, sensitivity, and establishment of a reference range for any LDT used in clinical testing.
In addition to the federal certification requirements under CLIA, certain states require clinical laboratories to maintain a state license. State licensure authorities typically regulate the day-to-day operations of a clinical laboratory, including the training and skills required of its personnel and quality control. Certain states may also mandate proficiency testing, which requires the clinical laboratory to verify the accuracy of any test or procedure it performs. In addition, certain states require out-of-state laboratories to be licensed if they accept specimens from those states. CLIA provides that a state may adopt laboratory regulations that are more stringent than those under federal law. In some cases, state licensure programs substitute for the federal CLIA program. In other instances, the state’s regulations may be in addition to the CLIA program. If a laboratory is out of compliance with state laws or regulations governing licensed laboratories, penalties for violation vary from state to state but may include suspension, limitation, revocation or annulment of the license, assessment of financial penalties or fines, or imprisonment.
FDA
The FDA regulates the sale and distribution in interstate commerce of medical devices under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or the FDCA, including in vitro diagnostic devices, reagents, and instruments used to perform diagnostic testing. Devices must undergo premarket review by the FDA prior to commercialization unless the device is of a type exempted from such review by statute, regulation, or pursuant to the FDA’s exercise of enforcement discretion. Although historically the FDA has not exercised its authority to actively regulate the development and use of LDTs, which are tests that are designed, manufactured, validated, and used within a single laboratory, more recently, the FDA has issued warning letters to certain genomics labs for illegally marketing genetic tests that claim to predict patients’ responses to specific medications, noting that the FDA has not created a legal “carve-out” for LDTs and retains discretion to take action when appropriate, such as when certain genomics tests raise significant public health concerns. As manufacturers develop more complex genetic tests, it is likely that the FDA will more actively regulate LDTs in the future, which will impose greater burdens on laboratories to obtain the necessary premarket notification or approval from the FDA as well as comply with applicable post-market regulatory obligations. Such requirements will likely delay market entry and will require more resources and time commitment from clinical laboratories in the in vitro diagnostic space. 
In October 2014, the FDA issued draft guidance documents stating that the FDA intends to change its policy and describing an approach to regulating LDTs using a risk-based, phased-in approach. In November 2016, the FDA stated that it had decided to delay finalizing its draft guidance on regulating LDTs, and it would be seeking input from the new presidential administration and Congress on the subject. Based on the request of stakeholders and the significant amount of feedback to the 2014 Draft Guidance, in January 2017, the FDA issued a Discussion Paper on LDTs in which it announced that it would not issue a final guidance on the oversight of LDTs and provided a prospective oversight framework that focuses on new and significantly modified high and moderate risk LDTs. Subject to certain limitations, the proposed focused oversight appears to exempt a wide range of LDTs from FDA's oversight, which include, but are not limited to, previously marketed LDTs (these “grandfathered” LDTs would still be subject to adverse event reporting), traditional LDTs, and low risk LDTs (also subject to adverse event reporting). In the Discussion Paper, the FDA proposes a risk-based, phased in approach for premarket review of new and significantly modified LDTs and such premarket review would not be duplicative of CMS’s post-market oversight of laboratory operations or clinical utility determinations. The FDA also proposes to leverage existing CMS/CLIA requirements related to quality systems, while focusing its assessment on FDA Quality System requirements not covered by CLIA, and expanding third party premarket review, including coordination with a range of programs, including New York’s Clinical Laboratory Evaluation Program. 
Recently, the Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, announced rescission of guidance and other informal issuances of FDA regarding premarket review of LDT absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, stating that, absent notice-and-comment rulemaking, those seeking approval or clearance of, or an emergency use authorization, for an LDT may nonetheless 
- 19 -


voluntarily submit a premarket approval application, premarket notification or an Emergency Use Authorization request, respectively, but are not required to do so. However, laboratories opting to use LDTs without FDA premarket review or authorization would not be eligible for liability protection under the Public Readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act, or the PREP Act. While this action by HHS is expected to reduce the regulatory burden on clinical laboratories certified under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) that develop LDTs, it is unclear how this action as well as future legislation by federal and state governments and FDA will impact the industry, including our business and that of our customers. HHS’ rescission policy may change over time. Congress or the Biden administration could also enact legislation restricting LDTs. Any restrictions on LDTs by the FDA, HHS, Congress, or state regulatory authorities may decrease the demand for our products.
That said, based on the November 2018 FDA Statement and warning letters issued by the FDA in 2019 to certain genomics labs for illegally marketing genetic test that claims to predict patients’ responses to specific medications, the FDA may increase its scrutiny and regulation of certain LDTs. In the meantime, NantHealth has obtained 510(k) clearance from the FDA for its Omics Core assay and the laboratory that performs the molecular diagnostic testing (including the Company’s LDT offering, GPS Cancer) will maintain its CLIA certification.
The FDA regulations pertaining to medical devices govern, among other things, the research, design, development, pre-clinical and clinical testing, manufacture, safety, effectiveness, clearance or approval, record-keeping, packaging, labeling, storage, adverse event reporting, advertising, promotion, marketing, sales, distribution, and import and export of medical devices. Pursuant to the FDCA, and its implementing regulations, medical devices are subject to varying degrees of regulatory control and are classified in one of three classes depending on the controls the FDA determines necessary to reasonably ensure their safety and effectiveness.
In general, Class I devices are those for which reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness can be provided by adherence to the FDA’s general controls for medical devices, which include applicable portions of the FDA’s Quality System Regulation ("QSR"), facility registration and product listing, reporting of adverse medical events, and appropriate, truthful, and non-misleading labeling, advertising and promotional materials. Many Class I devices are exempt from premarket regulation; however, some Class I devices require premarket clearance by the FDA through the 510(k) premarket notification process described below.
Class II devices are generally subject to the FDA’s general controls, and any other special controls, such as performance standards, post market surveillance, and FDA guidelines, deemed necessary by the FDA to provide reasonable assurance of the devices’ safety and effectiveness. Premarket review and clearance by the FDA for Class II devices are accomplished through the 510(k) premarket notification procedure, although some Class II devices are exempt from the 510(k) requirements. Premarket notifications are subject to user fees, unless a specific exemption applies. To obtain 510(k) clearance, a manufacturer must submit a premarket notification demonstrating that the proposed device is “substantially equivalent” to a predicate device, which is a previously cleared 510(k) device or a pre-amendment device that was in commercial distribution before May 28, 1976, for which the FDA has not yet called for the submission of a premarket approval, or PMA, application. In determining substantial equivalence, the FDA assesses whether the proposed device has the same intended use and technical characteristic as the predicate device, or whether the proposed device has different technological characteristics, and the information submitted in the premarket notification demonstrates the device is as safe and effective as a legally marketed device and does not raise new questions of safety and effectiveness than the predicate device. The FDA may request additional information, including clinical data. Under the Medical Device User Fee Amendment of 2012, the FDA’s performance goal for reviewing a 510(k) submission is 90 days, but the FDA’s review of the premarket notification can take significantly longer if the FDA requests additional information or raises new questions during the review process. If the FDA determines that the device is substantially equivalent to the predicate device(s), the subject device may be marketed upon grant of FDA clearance. If a manufacturer obtains a 510(k) clearance for its device and then makes a modification that could significantly affect the safety or effectiveness of the device, or a major modification in the intended use of the device, a new premarket notification must be submitted and cleared by the FDA.
Class III devices are those deemed by FDA to pose the greatest risk, such as those that are life-sustaining or life-supporting and for which reasonable assurance of the device’s safety and effectiveness cannot be assured solely by the general controls and special controls described above. Some pre-amendment Class III devices for which the FDA has not yet required a PMA require the FDA’s clearance of a premarket notification in order to be marketed. However, most Class III devices are required to undergo the PMA process in which the manufacturer must demonstrate reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the device to the FDA’s satisfaction. A PMA application must provide valid scientific evidence, typically extensive preclinical and clinical trial data, and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, manufacturing, and labeling. PMA applications (and supplemental PMA applications) are subject to significantly higher user fees than are 510(k) premarket notifications. Some PMA applications are exempt from a user fee, for example, a small business’s first PMA.

If a new medical device does not qualify for the 510(k) premarket notification process because no predicate device to which it is substantially equivalent can be identified, the device is automatically classified into Class III. The Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act of 1997 established a new route to market for low to moderate risk medical devices that are automatically placed into Class III due to the absence of a predicate device, called the “Request for Evaluation of Automatic Class III Designation,” or the de novo classification process. This process allows a manufacturer whose novel device is automatically classified into Class III to request down-classification of its medical device into Class I or Class II on the basis that the device presents low or moderate risk, rather than requiring the submission and approval of a PMA. If the manufacturer seeks reclassification into Class II, the manufacturer must include a draft proposal for special controls that are necessary to provide a reasonable assurance of the safety and effectiveness of the medical device. The FDA may reject the reclassification petition if it identifies a legally marketed predicate device that would be appropriate for a 510(k) or determines that the device is not low to moderate risk and requires PMA or that general controls would be inadequate to control the risks and special controls cannot be developed.
Even if regulatory approval or clearance of a device is granted, the FDA continues to impose limitations on the uses and indications for which the device may be labeled and promoted, and the device remains subject to significant regulatory requirements. Medical devices may be marketed only for the uses and indications for which they are cleared or approved by the FDA. Device manufacturers must register their facilities and list their devices with the FDA within 30 days of an establishment beginning an activity or putting a device into commercial distribution. A device manufacturer’s manufacturing processes and those of some of its suppliers are required to comply with the applicable portions of the QSR, which covers quality management, design controls, production and process controls, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, shipping, complaint handling, and adverse event reporting. Device manufacturers must submit to the FDA medical device reports for deaths, serious injuries, and certain malfunctions and report certain field corrections and product recalls or removals. Some manufacturers also may be subject to post-market surveillance regulations. Medical device establishments, including their facility records and manufacturing processes, are subject to periodic unscheduled inspections by the FDA.
Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in enforcement action by the FDA, which may include any of the following sanctions: public warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties, recall or seizure of products, operating restrictions, partial suspension or total shutdown of production, delays in or denial of 510(k) clearance or PMA applications for new products, challenges to existing 510(k) clearances or PMA applications, and a recommendation by the FDA to disallow a device manufacturer from entering into government contracts. The FDA also has the authority to request repair, replacement, or refund of the cost of any device manufactured or distributed. If a supplier fails to maintain compliance with a device manufacturer’s quality requirements, the manufacturer may have to qualify a new supplier and could experience manufacturing delays as a result.
HIPAA and HITECH
Under the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the HITECH Act, the HHS issued regulations that establish uniform standards governing the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protecting the privacy and security of protected health information used or disclosed by healthcare providers and other covered entities. Three principal regulations with which we are required to comply have been issued in final form under HIPAA: privacy regulations, security regulations, and standards for electronic transactions, which establish standards for common healthcare transactions. The privacy and security regulations were extensively amended in 2013 to incorporate requirements from the HITECH Act.
The privacy regulations cover the use and disclosure of protected health information by healthcare providers and other covered entities. They also set forth certain rights that an individual has with respect to his or her protected health information maintained by a covered entity, including the right to access or amend certain records containing protected health information, or to request restrictions on the use or disclosure of protected health information. The security regulations establish requirements for safeguarding the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of protected health information that is electronically transmitted or electronically stored. The HITECH Act, among other things, makes certain of HIPAA’s privacy and security standards applicable to business associates of covered entities, and established certain protected health information security breach notification requirements. A covered entity must notify affected individual(s) and the HHS when there is a breach of unsecured protected health information. The HIPAA privacy and security regulations establish a uniform federal “floor” that covered entities and their business associates must meet and do not supersede state laws that are more stringent or provide individuals with greater rights with respect to the privacy or security of, and access to, their records containing protected health information. HIPAA also governs patient access to laboratory test reports. Effective October 6, 2014, individuals (or their personal representatives, as applicable), have the right to access test reports directly from clinical laboratories and to direct that copies of those test reports be transmitted to persons or entities designated by the individual.
These laws contain significant fines and other penalties for wrongful use or disclosure of protected health information. Additionally, to the extent that we submit electronic healthcare claims and payment transactions that do not comply with the electronic data transmission standards established under HIPAA and the HITECH Act, payments to us may be delayed or denied.

In addition to the federal privacy regulations, there are several state laws regarding the privacy and security of health information and personal data that are applicable to our operations. The compliance requirements of these laws, including additional breach reporting requirements, and the penalties for violation vary widely and new privacy and security laws in this area are evolving. Massachusetts, for example, has a state law that protects the privacy and security of personal information of Massachusetts residents that is more prescriptive than HIPAA. Many states have also implemented genetic testing and privacy laws imposing specific patient consent requirements and protecting test results. In some cases, we are prohibited from conducting certain tests without a certification of patient consent by the physician ordering the test. For example, California recently enacted the Genetic Information Privacy Act, California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, and California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA, which will increase our compliance costs and potential liability with respect to personally identifying and genetic information we may collect about consumers in California. Requirements of these laws and penalties for violations vary widely. We believe that we have taken the steps required of us to comply with health information privacy and security statutes and regulations in all jurisdictions, both state and federal. However, we may not be able to maintain compliance in all jurisdictions where we do business. Failure to maintain compliance, or changes in state or federal laws regarding privacy or security, could result in civil and/or criminal penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business.
Federal, State and Foreign Fraud and Abuse Laws
In the United States, there are various fraud and abuse laws with which we must comply and we are potentially subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities, including CMS, other divisions of the HHS (e.g., the Office of Inspector General), the U.S. Department of Justice, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. We also may be subject to foreign fraud and abuse laws.
In the United States, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for patient referrals for, or purchasing, leasing, ordering, recommending or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of, any healthcare item or service reimbursable under a governmental payer program. Courts have stated that a financial arrangement may violate the Anti-Kickback Statute if any one purpose of the arrangement is to encourage patient referrals or other federal healthcare program business, regardless of whether there are other legitimate purposes for the arrangement. The definition of “remuneration” has been broadly interpreted to include anything of value, including gifts, discounts, credit arrangements, payments of cash, consulting fees, waivers of co-payments, ownership interests, and providing anything at less than its fair market value. Recognizing that the Anti-Kickback Statute is broad and may technically prohibit many innocuous or beneficial arrangements within the healthcare industry, the HHS issued a series of regulatory “safe harbors.” These safe harbor regulations set forth certain provisions, which, if met, will assure healthcare providers and other parties that they will not be prosecuted under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute. Although full compliance with these safe harbor provisions ensures against prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, the failure of a transaction or arrangement to fit within a specific safe harbor does not necessarily mean that the transaction or arrangement is illegal or that prosecution under the federal Anti-Kickback Statute will be pursued. That said, non-compliance with all the requirements of a safe harbor can increase the risk of the transaction or arrangement and may increase the risk of government scrutiny. Many states also have anti-kickback statutes, some of which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including commercial insurers.
In addition, federal false claims laws, including the federal civil False Claims Act, prohibit, among other things, any person or entity from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to, or approval by, the federal government or knowingly making, using, or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim to the federal government. As a result of a modification made by the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009, a claim includes “any request or demand” for money or property presented to the U.S. government. Recently, several pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal programs for the product. Other companies have been prosecuted for causing false claims to be submitted because of the companies’ marketing of the product for unapproved, and thus generally non-reimbursable, uses. The civil monetary penalties statute imposes penalties against any person or entity who, among other things, is determined to have presented or caused to be presented a claim to a federal health program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent.
HIPAA created additional federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud or to obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations or promises, any money or property owned by, or under the control or custody of, any healthcare benefit program, including private third-party payers and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by trick, scheme or device, a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious or fraudulent statement in connection with the delivery of or payment for healthcare benefits, items or services.
- 22 -


In addition, various states have enacted false claim laws analogous to the federal False Claims Act, although many of these state laws apply where a claim is submitted to any third-party payer and not merely a governmental payer program. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of the federal and state healthcare laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including without limitation, civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, exclusion from participation in government programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, injunctions, private “qui tam” actions brought by individual whistleblowers in the name of the government, or refusal to allow us to enter into government contracts, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens, diminished profits and future earnings, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. The costs of defending such claims, as well as any sanctions imposed, could significantly affect our financial performance.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, prohibits any United States individual or business from paying, offering, or authorizing payment or offering of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, political party or candidate for the purpose of influencing any act or decision of the foreign entity in order to assist the individual or business in obtaining or retaining business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the United States to comply with accounting provisions requiring us to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the corporation, including international subsidiaries, if any, and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls for international operations.
In Europe, various countries have adopted anti-bribery laws providing for severe consequences, in the form of criminal penalties and/or significant fines, for individuals and/or companies committing a bribery offence. Violations of these anti-bribery laws, or allegations of such violations, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations and reputation. For instance, in the United Kingdom, under the Bribery Act 2010, which went into effect in July 2011, a bribery occurs when a person offers, gives or promises to give a financial or other advantage to induce or reward another individual to improperly perform certain functions or activities, including any function of a public nature. Bribery of foreign public officials also falls within the scope of the Bribery Act 2010. Under the new regime, an individual found in violation of the Bribery Act 2010 faces imprisonment of up to 10 years. In addition, the individual can be subject to an unlimited fine, as can commercial organizations for failure to prevent bribery.
Federal and State Physician Self-Referral Prohibitions
Under a federal law directed at “self-referral,” commonly known as the “Stark Law,” there are prohibitions, with certain exceptions, on referrals for certain designated health services, including laboratory services, that are covered by the Medicare and Medicaid programs by physicians who personally, or through a family member, have an investment or ownership interest in, or a compensation arrangement with, an entity performing the tests. The prohibition also extends to payment for any testing referred in violation of the Stark Law. Sanctions for violating the Stark Law include denial of payment, civil monetary penalties of up to $25,820 per submitted claim, subject to periodic adjustments for inflation, and exclusion from the federal health care programs. Failure to refund amounts received as a result of a prohibited referral on a timely basis may constitute a false or fraudulent claim and may result in civil penalties and additional penalties under the False Claims Act (FCA). The statute also provides for a penalty of up to $172,137 for a circumvention scheme. The Stark Law is a strict liability statute, which means proof of specific intent to violate the law is not required. In addition, the government and some courts have taken the position that claims presented in violation of the various statutes, including the Stark Law, can be considered a violation of the federal FCA, as described further below, based on the contention that a provider impliedly certifies compliance with all applicable laws, regulations and other rules when submitting claims for reimbursement. A determination of liability under the Stark Law could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Bills submitted in violation of the Stark Law may not be paid by Medicare or Medicaid, and any person collecting any amounts with respect to any such prohibited bill is obligated to refund such amounts. Many states have comparable laws that are not limited to Medicare and Medicaid referrals.

Physician Payment Sunshine Act
The Physician Payment Sunshine Act, or the Sunshine Act, which was enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act, requires applicable manufacturers and certain distributors of prescription drugs, devices, biologics or other medical supplies available for coverage by Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the Secretary of HHS: (i) payments or other transfers of value made by that entity, or by a third-party as directed by that entity, to physicians and teaching hospitals or to third parties on behalf of physicians or teaching hospitals; effective January 1, 2022, reporting on payments and transfers of value made in the previous year to covered recipients will be expanded to include physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologist assistants, and certified nurse-midwives; and (ii) physician ownership (including immediate family ownership) and investment interests in the entity. The statute requires the federal government to make reported information available to the public starting September 2014, which it has. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of $11,766 per failure up to an aggregate of $176,495 per year. Knowingly failing to submit the required information may result in a civil money penalty of up to $1,176,638. Such failures may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Additionally, there are criminal penalties if an entity intentionally makes false statements in such reports. Upon commercialization of covered products, we will be subject to the Sunshine Act and the information we disclose may lead to greater scrutiny, which may result in modifications to established practices and additional costs. Additionally, similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level domestically, and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with healthcare professionals.
Corporate Practice of Medicine
Numerous states have enacted laws prohibiting business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine and employing or engaging physicians to practice medicine, generally referred to as the prohibition against the corporate practice of medicine. Many states also have fee splitting laws that prohibit splitting or sharing medical professional fees with other persons or entities who did not perform the medical services unless an exception applies. These laws are designed to prevent interference in the medical decision-making process by anyone who is not a licensed physician. For example, California’s Medical Board has indicated that determining what diagnostic tests are appropriate for a particular condition and taking responsibility for the ultimate overall care of the patient, including providing treatment options available to the patient, would constitute the unlicensed practice of medicine if performed by an unlicensed person. Violation of these corporate practice of medicine laws may result in civil or criminal fines, as well as sanctions imposed against us and/or the physician through licensure proceedings. Typically, such laws are only applicable to entities that conduct business or interact with patients located in that state. Additionally, claims that violate the corporate practice of medicine or other FDA or healthcare laws may increase our liability under the federal False Claims Act and comparable state false claims laws.
Healthcare Reform
The United States and some foreign jurisdictions are considering or have enacted several legislative and regulatory proposals designed to change the healthcare system in ways that could affect our business. In the United States, there is significant interest in promoting changes in the health care system with the stated goal of containing healthcare costs, improving quality or expanding access. For example, the ACA contains certain measures that may be significant for our business. The ACA includes, among other things, provisions regarding initiatives to revise Medicare payment methodologies; the coordination and promotion of research on comparative clinical effectiveness of different technologies and procedures; and initiatives to promote quality indicators in payment methodologies. The ACA also includes an annual excise tax on device manufacturers of 2.3% of the price for which manufacturers sell their devices. The excise tax was on a 4-year moratorium for calendar years 2016 through 2019. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 H.R. 1865 (Pub.L.116-94), signed into law on December 20, 2019, repealed the medical device excise tax previously imposed by Section 4191 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the "Code"), for sales of medical devices after December 31, 2019.
There have been other health reform measures taken since the enactment of the ACA. For example, the Budget Control Act of 2011, among other things, created measures for spending reductions by Congress. A Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction, tasked with recommending a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for fiscal year 2013 through fiscal year 2021, was unable to reach required goals, thereby triggering the legislation’s automatic reduction (known as sequestration) to several government programs. This includes aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, beginning April 1, 2013, which will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension implemented under various COVID-19 relief legislation from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, unless additional Congressional action is taken. Furthermore, on January 2, 2013, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 was signed into law, which, among other things, increased the statute of limitations for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three years to five years.

In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. The healthcare industry has been a particular focus of these efforts and has been significantly affected by major legislative initiatives. We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the ACA, including as a result of executive orders and legislative actions. The impact of those legislative and regulatory changes on us and potential effect on the participants in the health care system as a whole is currently unknown. But, any changes to the ACA are likely to have an impact on our results of operations and may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect of any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business.
Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs and subject us to additional regulatory requirements that may interrupt commercialization of our current and future solutions. Changes in healthcare policy could increase our costs, decrease our revenues and impact sales of and reimbursement for our current and future solutions. The Affordable Care Act substantially changes the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impact our industry. The Act contains a number of provisions that impact our business and operations, some of which in ways we cannot currently predict, including those governing enrollments in federal healthcare programs and reimbursement changes.
Other Regulatory Requirements
We are subject to federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and policies governing the use, generation, manufacture, storage, emission, effluent discharge, handling and disposal of certain hazardous and potentially hazardous substances used in connection with our operations. The laboratory performing the Omics services is subject to federal, state and local regulations relating to the handling and disposal of regulated medical waste, hazardous waste and biohazardous waste, including chemical, biological agents and compounds, blood and bone marrow samples, and other human tissue. Typically, the laboratory uses outside vendors who are contractually obligated to comply with applicable laws and regulations to dispose of such waste. These vendors are licensed or otherwise qualified to handle and dispose of such waste.
The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety for healthcare employers, including requirements to develop and implement programs to protect workers from exposure to blood-borne pathogens by preventing or minimizing any exposure through needle stick or similar penetrating injuries.
Backlog
We have no material backlog of orders.
Geographic and Segment Information
During 2020, substantially all of our long-lived assets were located within the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. 
Revenue from international markets were approximately 1% and 2% of our consolidated revenue for 2020 and 2019, respectively.
We operate in one segment. The Company has one business activity and does not segregate its business for internal reporting. Accordingly, management has determined that the Company operates in one reportable segment.
Seasonality
Our revenues are not seasonal in nature.
