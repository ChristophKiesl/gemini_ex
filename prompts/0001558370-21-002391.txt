Our Mission
Our mission is to help organizations succeed with Apple.
Overview
We are the standard in Apple Enterprise Management, and our cloud software platform is the only vertically-focused Apple infrastructure and security platform of scale in the world. We help organizations, including businesses, hospitals, schools and government agencies, connect, manage and protect Apple products, apps and corporate resources in the cloud without ever having to touch the devices. With Jamf’s software, Apple devices can be deployed to employees brand new in the shrink-wrapped box, set up automatically and personalized at first power-on and administered continuously throughout the life of the device.
Jamf was founded in 2002, around the same time that Apple was leading an industry transformation. Apple transformed the way people access and utilize technology through its focus on creating a superior consumer experience. With the release of revolutionary products like the Mac, iPod, iPhone and iPad, Apple built the world’s most valuable brand and became ubiquitous in everyday life.
We believe employees have come to expect the same high-quality Apple user experience at work as they enjoy in their personal lives. This is often not possible as many organizations rely on legacy solutions to administer Apple devices or do not give employees a choice of device. Jamf’s software solutions preserve and extend the native Apple experience, allowing employees to use their Apple devices as they do in their personal lives, while retaining their privacy and fulfilling IT’s enterprise requirements around deployment, access and security.
We have built our company through a singular focus on being the primary solution for Apple in the enterprise. Through our long-standing relationship with Apple, we have accumulated significant Apple technical experience and expertise that give us the ability to fully and quickly leverage and extend the capabilities of Apple products, operating systems and services. This expertise enables us to fully support new innovations and operating system releases the moment they are made available by Apple. This focus has allowed us to create a best-in-class user experience for Apple in the enterprise and grow to more than 47,000 customers deploying 20.4 million Apple devices in more than 100 countries and territories as of December 31, 2020.

We sell our SaaS solutions via a subscription model, through a direct sales force, online and indirectly via our channel partners, including Apple. Our multi-dimensional go-to-market model and cloud-deployed offering enable us to reach all organizations around the world, large and small, with our software solutions. As a result, we continue to see rapid growth and expansion of our customer base as Apple continues to gain momentum in the enterprise. Our customers include many highly recognizable brands and organizations including Apple itself, 8 of the largest 10 Fortune 500 companies, 7 of the top 10 Fortune 500 technology companies, 23 of the 25 most valuable brands (according to the Forbes Most Valuable Brands rankings) and 10 of the 10 largest U.S. banks (based on total assets according to bankrate.com) as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, we see opportunities to sell add-on products from our software platform into our current install base in order to provide greater value for our customers. Our focus on customer success and innovation has resulted in a Net Promoter Score of 54.6 as of December 31, 2020, which significantly exceeds industry averages. 
Complementing our software platform is Jamf Nation, the world’s largest online community of IT professionals focused exclusively on Apple in the enterprise. This active, grassroots community of over 100,000 members serves as a highly-qualified and efficient crowd-sourced Q&A engine for anyone with questions about Apple deployments.

Industry Background
Key trends impacting how enterprises use and manage technology to engage employees and drive productivity include:
Apple’s democratization of technology
Apple is ubiquitous. It is the most valuable brand in the world according to Forbes, and in 2018, it became the first company to cross a market capitalization of US$1 trillion. Apple’s success has been driven by delivering the best user experience to its customers through its innovative combination of hardware, software and cloud services. It has transformed the technology landscape by placing the user first and designing everything around maximizing the Apple user experience.
In the 1990s and early 2000s, endpoint technology was dominated by Microsoft Windows, particularly in the workplace. Many enterprises prioritized standardization over user experience in order to facilitate the deployment, security and management of massive numbers of Windows PCs. Employees were not typically given a choice in their devices. In the 2000s, Apple introduced a series of revolutionary products that transformed how the world interacts with technology. Apple released the iPod in 2001, followed by the iPhone in 2007 and the iPad in 2010. These products, which utilized Apple iOS (Apple’s proprietary mobile OS), shared a design element that placed the user first. The rapid rise in popularity of iOS devices, combined with the proliferation of web-based applications, created a “halo effect,” leading to a resurgence of Apple’s Mac computer. These devices empowered users to easily leverage powerful technology regardless of their technical expertise. Apple’s consumer-focused technology provided a significantly more capable, intuitive and faster experience than the technology many employees previously had in the workplace.
Apple’s focus on the user experience has transformed employees’ expectations for technology overall. Employees expect a simple, intuitive, seamless experience that fosters creativity, productivity and collaboration. Apple currently offers an entire ecosystem of desktops, laptops, tablets, phones and wearable devices designed to interoperate seamlessly at home, at work and everywhere in-between. This has made Apple the leading technology brand overall, with a third of Apple users “not being able to live without the brand,” according to a 2020 brand intimacy study by MBLM.
The consumerization of IT
The consumerization of IT refers to the migration of software and hardware products originally designed for personal use into the enterprise. Today, employees are often less inclined to draw a line between work and personal technology and commonly prefer not to settle for enterprise solutions that are harder to use than what they have at home. In response to the consumerization of IT movement, enterprises are transforming digitally to create a more engaged workforce, offering employees consumer-like tools and choice of technology. As the competition for talent escalates, we believe technology will play a central role in either improving or degrading the employee experience. Empowering employees to use their preferred devices is important to attract, engage and retain productive employees. Today, with more organizations than ever before managing and onboarding new employees remotely, the technology experience and the employee experience are synonymous.
Rapidly evolving workplace demographics are also accelerating the consumerization of IT. Millennials currently represent the largest segment of the U.S. workforce, and have been since 2016, according to a 2018 study by the Pew Research Center. Millennials are the first digitally-native generation that has grown up with broadband, smartphones, tablets, laptops and a massive library of apps through which they interact with the world and each other. Millennials demand more from their enterprise IT organizations. They expect to work from anywhere at any time. They expect to be able to collaborate instantly. They expect to have a choice in the technology they use.
This trend is expected to continue as younger generations enter the workforce and workplace technology continues to directly impact employment decision-making. In a 2019 survey conducted by Vanson Bourne and commissioned by us, approximately 70% of surveyed college students in five countries said they would be more likely to 

7



choose or stay at an organization that offers a choice in work computer, and if upfront cost was not a consideration, 71% said they would prefer to use a Mac computer.
Consumerization of IT has been one of the most significant trends impacting enterprise IT over the past decade. This trend is exemplified by Apple’s iPhone, introduced in 2007. The iPhone was quickly preferred by many employees for its superior user experience compared to the corporate issued mobile phones controlled by enterprise IT departments. Mass consumer adoption of the iPhone pushed organizations to develop corporate policies that support the use of personal devices for work. As a result, Apple — the ultimate consumer technology company — has become critically important to enterprise IT organizations.
Apple’s momentum in enterprise IT
Fueled by Apple’s popularity and the consumerization of IT, Apple devices have gained widespread acceptance across the enterprise, from the executive suite to new hires. As a result, Apple market share in the enterprise has grown significantly. According to Apple CEO Tim Cook, Apple is now in every Fortune 500 company, and “eight in ten companies are writing custom apps for their enterprise.” Apple’s enterprise revenue, disclosed as $25 billion in 2015, is estimated to have grown to over $40 billion in 2019 according to Atherton Research. Apple’s commitment to the enterprise has expanded through partnerships with enterprise giants, such as Accenture, Cisco, Deloitte, General Electric, IBM, Salesforce and SAP.
Evidence of this momentum is further supported by Statcounter, an organization that aggregates data based on web traffic. According to Statcounter, Apple OSs comprised 24% of global web traffic (both business and consumer) in December 2020, up from 4% in January 2009. Apple’s gains in the US have been even more significant, with Apple OSs now representing over 46% of web traffic in December 2020, compared to 30% for Microsoft and 23% for Google. Over that same period, the market share of Microsoft has declined from 92% to 30%.
The increased use of mobile devices to access the internet is largely responsible for the decline in market share of Windows over the past decade. Over this same decade, however, the Mac computer has grown in popularity and market share, further demonstrating that Apple’s increased use is not limited to iOS devices. While the Mac computer was once primarily associated with creative or artistic activities, it now represents a growing share of computers within the enterprise. According to a 2021 IDC Report (Worldwide Unified Endpoint Management Software for Apple Devices 2021 Vendor Assessment), adoption of Mac usage in the enterprise (firms with 1,000+ employees according to IDC) is growing by many measures. In the United States, average penetration of macOS devices is around 23%, compared with 17% in 2019, according to IDC's 2020 and 2019 Enterprise Mobility and Workspace Software Surveys. Driven partly by the COVID-19 pandemic and the sudden need for devices for home workers, shipments of Mac devices into the enterprise sector jumped 34% year over year in the second quarter of 2020, according to IDC's Worldwide Personal Computing Device Tracker. This wave of new Mac devices suddenly requiring access to business apps and resources is causing some disruption among many enterprise end-user computing support and management teams, which have historically focused more on Windows device management. Macs, of course, are not the entire story around Apple devices in the enterprise. According to IDC's 2020 enterprise survey, iPhones account for 49% of the smartphone installed base among U.S. enterprises, and iPads make up the majority of tablets used in business.
Given the expectations of both current and future employees, offering employees a choice in technology is becoming imperative for many enterprises. When given a choice, more than 70% of employees surveyed worldwide would choose Mac over PC and iOS over Android, according to a 2018 survey conducted by us. Considering IDC’s estimate of current Mac enterprise penetration, we believe there is significant opportunity to fill the gap between how many employees want a Mac and how many currently use one.
Digital transformation in response to COVID-19
The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the need for solutions to empower remote work, distance learning and telehealth. While these trends were gaining mind share prior to the pandemic, recent challenges have added momentum to these digital transformation changes that will last long after the struggles related to COVID-19 have passed. Workflows that were once aspirational have become essential. For example, many companies with remote 

8



workforces want to ship devices directly from the manufacturer to the end user and have all the enterprise requirements fulfilled without IT ever touching the devices. While this workflow has been used by some organizations in the past to increase IT efficiency and smooth the user experience, it now has become a logistical and scalable advantage for device distribution and employee safety. In healthcare, providers are attempting to conserve personal protective equipment and generally minimize in-person patient contact. As such, providers have used iPads to facilitate virtual inpatient care, serve patients at home and connect isolated patients with loved ones, with some providers even loaning the required devices to patients. In education, digital technology has never played a more important role. Many school districts have provided or are working to provide iPads to all their students in order to deliver equitable and engaging at-home learning experiences. These school districts require a solution that helps educators, students and parents embrace distance learning technology. This sudden and significant shift from in-person to virtual interactions is forcing these modern workflows into the mainstream. The vision of employee or student empowerment delivered through Jamf solutions can help organizations operate at the level they did before the necessity to conduct their business or function in a remote environment.
We believe these trends will continue. According to a 2020 PricewaterhouseCoopers study, 68% of CFOs said that work flexibility (e.g., flexible hours and location) will make their company better in the long run, and 43% plan to implement remote work as a permanent option for roles that allow it. According to a 2020 Gallup study, 62% of employed Americans said they have worked from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, a number that doubled since mid-March 2020, and three in five U.S. workers who have been doing their jobs from home during the COVID-19 pandemic would prefer to continue working remotely as much as possible once public health restrictions are lifted. More organizations than ever before are examining their remote employee and work-from-home policies and looking for solutions to guide them. Now, the technology experience and the employee experience are synonymous.
The limitations of legacy enterprise solutions
Legacy solutions do not deliver the full Apple user experience because they are either outdated, overly Windows-centric or treat all devices the same across operating systems. In particular, cross-platform solutions that treat devices the same tend to rely on the lowest common denominator technology that is shared across the relevant ecosystems. Apple, Microsoft and Google have each introduced device-specific cloud services to automate enterprise IT processes. Fully embracing these cloud services demands specific focus on the respective ecosystem. Legacy solutions do not leverage the native capabilities of Apple and do not deliver the full Apple experience across several key areas, including the following:

● | Provisioning and deployment. Legacy solutions commonly rely on processes, such as disk imaging, that are manual or time-intensive for IT departments and diminish the Apple user experience. As a result, IT departments need to spend additional time and effort setting up and configuring devices similar to a traditional PC deployment, and users receive a muted Apple experience that is overly complex and falls short of expectations. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Operating system updates. Cross-platform legacy solutions are unable to allocate sufficient resources to always support the latest operating systems from all manufacturers. As a result, IT departments are forced to place moratoriums on operating system upgrades (through manually distributed emails) so they can test and then slowly roll out operating system upgrades weeks or months after they become available. This approach is contrary to Apple user expectations and also delays deployment of potentially important security updates which often results in such solutions not supporting the latest Apple OS features and can cause security vulnerabilities that put an organization at risk. This is exacerbated with the release of the Apple M1 chip on new Mac devices which revolutionizes its performance. Those not aligned with Apple and same-day support – be it management or security solution provider – are unable to support this new hardware which prevents users from being productive and protected. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Application licensing and lifecycle. Cross-platform solutions offer limited options for application distribution and installation, which often require hands-on IT oversight. Microsoft, Apple and Google each possess their own commerce solutions for third-party application purchases and distribution. Enterprise integrations for these commerce solutions require deep understanding of the platform and associated 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9




service. Cross-platform solutions have historically struggled to stay current with the standards of each platform’s features.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Additionally, the enterprise requirements for security and privacy result in the need to wrap applications with middleware, such as containers, degrading Apple’s intended user experience. License tracking in the cross-platform solution environment can also be manual. All of this effort creates extra and error-prone work for IT departments and dilutes the Apple user experience.

● | Endpoint protection. Legacy solutions do not leverage Apple’s native security tools and Endpoint Security framework, thereby providing limited visibility into an organization’s fleet of Apple devices and limited identification of potential security threats. Those not fully aligned with Apple’s native security tools and Endpoint Security framework are unable to support the Apple M1 chip for Mac and cannot apply new restrictions in Apple’s latest operating system, macOS Big Sur, on M1 Mac devices. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In most cases, legacy solutions rely on endpoint protection solutions that were originally designed for Windows. As a result, these solutions deliver endpoint protection to Apple devices in a manner which degrades the Apple user experience and performance and may not function properly in an Apple environment. In addition, the signature-based approach utilized by these solutions can only identify backward-looking threats specific to Microsoft, and does not communicate with native Apple security tools that could identify more relevant and immediate threats.

● | Identity-based access to resources. The concept of a workplace perimeter is quickly fading as employees demand flexibility to work from anywhere with seamless access to enterprise applications and resources. Enterprises need to make it simple for users to authenticate and access enterprise resources from anywhere with a single identity. To provide users access to corporate resources, many organizations bind their devices with Azure Active Directory (“AAD”). While binding devices to AAD works well with Windows-based devices, it does not create an efficient experience for other ecosystems, including Apple. Additionally, to be able to service Apple devices in the enterprise, IT often creates a secondary administrator account on each device that tends to become a management headache, user experience burden and security risk. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For enterprise Apple deployments, the limitations of legacy solutions all add up to higher operational and support costs, greater security vulnerability, lower productivity and a degraded user experience. While Apple devices may have higher upfront costs, implementing the full Apple experience results in higher productivity and lower total cost of ownership. Realizing these potential benefits requires an enterprise software solution specifically built for the Apple ecosystem.

● | Identity-based access to resources. We enable users to easily and securely connect to enterprise resources with a single cloud-based identity credential, simplified using biometrics on the Apple device. Users can then immediately access all of their corporate applications and shared resources. This eliminates the time-consuming need for multiple logins, reduces the number of IT tickets for password-related issues (which are frequently the leading cause of IT tickets) and removes the need for IT administrators to bind devices to AAD. Additionally, Jamf is able to dynamically block or grant administrative rights on the Apple device itself based on a user’s cloud-based identity, thus removing the need for additional administrator accounts on the device. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Self-service. We extend the Apple experience with an enterprise self-service app that empowers end-users to satisfy their own IT needs.

Our self-service app empowers users to be productive and self-sufficient while simultaneously reducing the labor burden on IT. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our software platform provides value to both end-users and IT departments. Users receive the legendary Apple experience they have come to expect, and IT departments are able to empower employees, enhance productivity and lower total cost of ownership. According to an October 2019 Apple-commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting, The Total Economic Impact Of Mac In The Enterprise, a Mac in the enterprise results in $678 cost savings 

11



per device versus a comparable PC (when considering three-year hardware, software, support and operational costs), a 20% improvement in employee retention and a 5% increase in sales performance for sales employees. A Mac also results in 48 hours of increased productivity per employee over three years. These metrics result in a payback period of less than 6 months for a Mac.
Furthermore, research by Hobson & Company commissioned by us consisting of 15 interviews with Jamf customers found benefits from simplifying IT management, reducing the time spent provisioning devices and the time spent managing apps by 80% and 90%, respectively. Additionally, that research found Jamf improved end-user experience, reducing end-user productivity loss due to technical problems by 60% and volume of helpdesk tickets by 15%. Jamf also helped mitigate risk by reducing the time IT spent creating inventory reports and time spent managing policy and settings changes by 90% and 65%, respectively. Overall, Hobson & Company found that a typical organization could expect a 217% five-year return on investment and a 5.8 month payback period when using Jamf.
Our Relationship with Apple
Jamf was founded in 2002 with the sole mission of helping organizations succeed with Apple, making it the first Apple-focused device management solution. Today, we have become the largest infrastructure and software platform built specifically for enterprise deployments of the Apple ecosystem. Our relationship with Apple has endured and grown to be multi-faceted over the past 19 years.
To continuously offer a software solution built specifically for Apple, we have always worked closely with Apple’s worldwide developer relations organization in an effort to support all new Apple innovations the moment their hardware and software is released. Additionally, throughout the course of our relationship, Jamf and Apple have formalized several contractual agreements:

● | Apple as a customer. In 2010, Apple became a Jamf customer, using our software solution to deploy and secure its fleet of Apple devices internally. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Apple as a customer represented less than 1% of our total revenue. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Apple as a channel partner in education and in retail. In 2011, Apple became a Jamf channel partner in the education market, reselling our software solution to K-12 and higher education organizations within the United States. In 2012, Apple expanded their channel relationship by offering our software solution to businesses through Apple retail stores in the United States. For the year ended December 31, 2020, Apple as a channel partner facilitated approximately 7% of our bookings. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Mobility Partner Program. In 2014, we became a member of Apple’s Mobility Partner Program, which focuses on solution development and effective go-to-market activities. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each of these contractual relationships continue to this day and span all enterprise technology across the Apple ecosystem, including Mac, iPad, iPhone and Apple TV. In addition to these contractual relationships, Apple and Jamf personnel frequently join forces to influence and collaborate as we work with customers, helping them succeed with Apple.
Market Opportunity
We believe our solution addresses a large and growing market covering the use of Apple technology in the enterprise. According to Frost & Sullivan, the global TAM for Apple Enterprise Management was estimated to be $12.2 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.7% to $23.4 billion by the end of 2024. This market represents the potential number of Apple mobile phones (iPhones), tablets (iPads), laptop and desktop computers (Macs), media streaming devices (Apple TVs) and portable media players (iPods) based on growing acceptance by education and business IT departments. Frost & Sullivan includes both devices purchased and provided by enterprises as well as BYODs owned by end-users that may require Apple Enterprise Management to provide necessary access to resources or services from the enterprises. The potential device numbers are multiplied by the Jamf average selling price (ASP) for each Apple device and enterprise type.

The combination of our strong partner ecosystem (including Apple and Microsoft), our e-commerce capability and our extensive enterprise and inside sales organizations, have created a differentiated and powerful go-to-market approach. We believe this robust go-to-market structure can allow us to effectively and efficiently reach our entire addressable market, including both large and small organizations in all geographic regions throughout the world. This also allows us to “land and expand” within our customer base by beginning with a limited engagement at each customer and increasing that customer relationship over time.

● | Differentiated technology. While Jamf technology has many powerful capabilities built to help promote digital transformation and satisfy the challenging requirements of connecting, managing and protecting Apple in the enterprise, specific innovations that set us apart from others in the market include: 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Powerful architected-for-Apple agent. Apple IT administrators can access remote computers and file systems, collecting attributes and intelligence as if they were physically sitting with each and every Apple device in their fleet. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enterprise attributes and smart grouping. Through our smart grouping technology, Jamf can dynamically group Apple devices, based on standard attributes, enterprise attributes or a combination thereof to target and execute business workflows at scale. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Industry-specific workflows. We have created industry-specific workflows that go beyond device management to solve issues for particular industries such as education, healthcare and hospitality, including solutions built around remote work, distance learning and telehealth.

--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enterprise self-service. Our simple-to-use enterprise self-service solution enables IT to empower end-users with a privately brandable application that allows users to install approved apps or perform complex tasks from a personalized enterprise catalog. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Growth Strategy
We help organizations succeed with Apple by connecting the Apple experience with the needs of the enterprise. By preserving and enhancing the Apple experience in an enterprise context, we believe we can drive our growth within the current Apple ecosystem as well as fuel further Apple penetration in enterprises, which will extend our opportunity. The key elements of our growth strategy include:

● | Extend technology leadership through R&D investment and new products. We intend to continue investing in research and development and pursuing select technology acquisitions in order to enhance our existing solutions, add new capabilities and deployment options and expand use cases. For example, over the last two years, we launched two new products, Jamf Connect and Jamf Protect, adding capabilities to provide both secure access to enterprise resources that users need through a single identity, and Mac-native endpoint security, respectively. We believe this strategy of continued innovation will allow us to reach new customers, cross-sell to existing customers and maintain our position as the standard for Apple in the enterprise. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Deliver unique industry-specific innovation. All industries today are experiencing new challenges related to social distancing, such as remote work, distance learning and telehealth. We intend to continue developing and enhancing Apple-specific functionality for certain verticals, such as education, healthcare

and hospitality, to help these organizations serve the changing needs of their students, teachers, patients and workers. For example, our patented mobile-to-mobile management technology provides teachers and parents control over school-issued iPads — whether they are ten feet away or ten miles. We have patent-pending healthcare listener functionality that empowers hospitals to launch device workflows based on events in the electronic medical record, giving patients access to their care plans and control over their room environment through a hospital-issued iPad. In reaction to the global shortage of personal protective equipment, we have also launched a patented telehealth workflow, Virtual Visits, aimed to protect providers while still connecting patients to care and their communities. Providers are able to virtually round to their patients, and patients can simply connect with families outside the hospital without IT ever having to touch the device. Once patients are discharged, Virtual Visits can help to automatically digitally wipe the device to prepare it for the next patient. We believe targeted, vertical-specific functionality can help us further penetrate industries which already use Apple devices, or provide a differentiated solution to enter a new industry or solve a new use case.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Grow customer base with targeted sales and marketing investment. We aim to expand our customer base by continuing to make significant and targeted investments in our direct sales and marketing in an effort to attract new customers and drive broader awareness of our software solutions. In addition, with our expanded platform, we can reach beyond our historical sales efforts focused on IT executives and administrators, and sell to CIOs, CISOs and line-of-business leaders. We also plan to increase our channel sales and marketing organization to deepen and expand our joint go-to-market efforts with channel partners in order to reach new territories and opportunities. We believe the channel is an efficient way to sell to smaller customers and reach new jurisdictions in a cost-effective manner. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Increase sales to existing customers. We believe our base of more than 47,000 customers as of December 31, 2020 represents a significant opportunity for sales expansion. Our opportunities to deliver further value to existing customers include (1) growing the customers’ number of Apple devices currently in use; (2) selling additional Jamf products; (3) expanding customers’ use of Jamf from one Apple product, like Mac, to additional Apple products used within the organization, like iPad, iPhone and Apple TV; and (4) expanding the way customers use Apple products by showcasing capabilities available once customers fully embrace Jamf for deployment. Additionally, Apple continues to grow their ecosystem of solutions that can bring value to organizations, as they did with the introduction of tvOS management in 2017, making the Apple TV an attractive product to deliver new use cases in conference rooms, classrooms, hospitality environments, and for digital signage across a range of industries. The strength of Jamf’s “land and expand” strategy is evidenced by our dollar-based net retention rate, which has exceeded 115% as of the end of each of the twelve fiscal quarters ended December 31, 2020, calculated on a trailing twelve months basis. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Expand global presence. We have a large international presence which we intend to continue growing. For the year ended December 31, 2020, approximately 32% of our new subscriptions originated outside of North America, compared to 27% for the prior year. We intend to continue making investments in our international sales and marketing channels to take advantage of this market opportunity, while refining our go-to-market approach based on local market dynamics. Furthermore, we will invest in our products and technology to fulfill the unique needs of the market we target. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Grow and nurture Jamf Nation. Jamf Nation is the world’s largest online community of IT professionals focused exclusively on Apple in the enterprise. It consists of a knowledgeable and active community of over 100,000 Apple-focused administrators and Jamf users who come together to gain insight, share best practices, vet ideas with fellow administrators and submit product feature requests. We intend to continue investing in our community platform and these relationships to ensure that our Jamf Nation community remains a vibrant forum for discussion and problem-solving for our users. We believe this community will continue to be a focal point for the Apple ecosystem and can also be helpful in introducing Jamf to potential new customers. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Cultivate relationships with developer partners. We believe one of the most powerful elements of our software platform is the ability to use published APIs to extend its value with other third-party or custom solutions. As of December 31, 2020, more than 200 integrations and value-added solutions were published on the Jamf Marketplace. These solutions extend the value of Jamf, protect customers’ existing IT investments and encourage greater use and expansion of Jamf within the enterprise. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Products
We provide industry-leading software solutions that help empower users with Mac, iPad, iPhone and Apple TV. We deploy our solutions through five main products:

Jamf Pro
Jamf Pro offers a robust Apple ecosystem management software solution for complex IT environments, serving both commercial businesses and educational institutions. Since its introduction in 2002, Jamf Pro has been our flagship product, serving the largest portion of Jamf’s customer base.
Key capabilities of Jamf Pro include:

● | providing a seamless initial device deployment, giving companies the ability to choose between a zero-touch experience or offering a more hands-on device enrollment and deployment;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | enabling customization of devices beyond configuration profiles, use policies and scripts for the optimal user experience;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | facilitating pre-configuration of user settings before deployment;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | providing app management flexibility wherein apps can be made available automatically to users or through an enterprise self-service catalog;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | granting users the ability to update software and maintain their own devices through Jamf’s brandable self-service application without a help desk ticket;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

16




● | automating ongoing inventory management, such as automatic collection of hardware, software and security configuration details from Apple devices, creating custom reports and alerts, and managing software licenses and warranty records; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | securing Apple devices by leveraging native security features, such as encryption, managing device settings and configurations, restricting malicious software and patching all Apple devices without the need for user interaction.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Jamf Now
Launched in 2015, Jamf Now is an intuitive, pay-as-you-go Apple device management software solution for small-to-medium-sized businesses (“SMBs”). Jamf Now prioritizes simplicity through a design that is targeted for organizations with limited or no IT resources, and it can be adopted by such organizations without engaging Jamf sales, training, or services personnel. Jamf Now allows customers to set up their own accounts to enroll their Apple devices and immediately benefit regardless of any prior experience with Jamf. Jamf Now facilitates the consistent configuration of devices remotely, provides a 360-degree view of inventory and remotely enforces passcodes, encryption, installed software and locking or wiping of Apple devices.
Jamf School
Jamf School is a purpose-built software solution for educators and is supported by apps that empower teachers to create an active and personal learning environment. We have a long and successful presence in the education market, dating back to the early 2000s, and we introduced Jamf School in early 2019 following the acquisition of ZuluDesk B.V. (“ZuluDesk”). Launching Jamf School significantly increased our value in the classroom and allows us to further empower teachers, students and even parents.
Teachers using Jamf School are able to quickly and easily control all Apple devices in their classroom, which ultimately aids the focus of students. Teachers design lesson plans leveraging content from Apple’s App Store and are able to easily deploy these lessons to students. They can also restrict specific functions during assessments, and control what content and resources students have access to on their iPads at a specific time. This functionality works seamlessly whether the teacher and student(s) are in the same physical classroom or if they are learning from home or in different locations.
With Jamf School, parents can use their personal iPhone, iPad or Apple Watch to govern the access children have when using their school-issued iPads at home. Parents can control and limit their children’s device usage, applications and functionality when the student is not in the school lessons. Jamf School transforms processes that once required IT involvement into dynamic interactions that put the power in the hands of the people who have the greatest impact on meeting each student’s learning needs.
Jamf School also engages and connects the student. Students can gain automatic access to subject-specific materials and applications, while unrelated or irrelevant content is hidden to avoid distraction. Through a self-service portal, students are also able to choose applications from an approved list of content, empowering them to have control over their learning. Teachers and parents can be confident students are focused and connected, which is specifically important in situations where students may bring their devices home or have prolonged control of their devices outside of the school district’s possession.
Jamf Connect
Jamf Connect, launched in 2018, gives users the ability to provision their new Apple devices by simply entering their cloud identity the first time the device is powered on. The Apple account is then automatically set up, synchronized and used to grant rights on the device itself, providing immediate value to the user. Jamf Connect transforms how users connect to their corporate identity and therefore provides users with a seamless connection to corporate resources.

17



Jamf Connect gives IT administrators the ability to monitor all company Mac devices and control who is accessing them, providing comfort that both the device and corporate information are protected. Jamf Connect substantially improves the user experience by reducing IT help desk tickets for password resets. Additionally, IT administrators are able to service each device using their cloud identity without requiring a separate admin account on the device, which is a management headache, security vulnerability and a user experience hazard.
Jamf Protect
Jamf Protect, launched in 2019, creates customized telemetry and detections that give enterprise security teams unprecedented visibility into their Macs, extending Apple’s security and privacy model to the enterprise while upholding the Apple user experience. 
Based on historical needs, most endpoint security products have been designed for Windows and ported to Apple environments only when necessary. Jamf Protect differs from these products and was specifically designed to protect a customer’s fleet of Mac computers.
As market share for the Mac computer has grown in the enterprise, it is no longer sufficient to protect these devices with a solution designed for a different platform.
Capabilities of Jamf Protect include:

● | mapping the security posture of a customer’s Mac fleet against the Center for Internet Security benchmarks;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | extending information security visibility into macOS built-in security tools for awareness and improved reporting, compliance and security;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | receiving real-time alerts to analyze activity on the device and choose whether to proactively block, isolate, or remediate threats;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | preventing execution of known macOS malware and quarantine the applications to keep end users safe;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | providing granular control to information security teams over what data is collected and where it is sent, and allowing companies that monitor endpoint activity for compliance reasons to gather authentication and other activity tracked by macOS into their system of record; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | supporting the latest OS from the first day it’s available to ensure users receive the latest and most pressing security updates, while providing a best-in-class macOS experience.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Technology
Our software platform was purpose-built to help organizations succeed with Apple, ensuring the highest standards for security and performance while preserving the Apple user experience. Our platform is built on the following core tenets:
Optimized for cloud
We build products that provide Apple-focused device management, identity and access management and endpoint protection solutions optimized for cloud environments. Our products are built on the market-leading cloud platform, or AWS, but are architected for flexibility to utilize other cloud platforms. This foundation has enabled us to scale and support millions of devices since our SaaS offering launched in 2012.

18



Global availability
Our products are designed to deploy worldwide, using regional AWS servers to deliver the performance required by our customers. We are able to rapidly expand our global cloud footprint as demand for our products grows in new regions.
Scalable and reliable
Our products are designed to remove customers’ worry about availability, scalability and maintenance of the infrastructure that powers their solution. Our customers are responsible for their fleet of Apple devices, while Jamf handles all back-end management and scaling operations at the software layer and on a global basis for infrastructure management. Jamf employees are located worldwide to ensure we are available whenever and wherever our customers need us.
We are able to quickly provision new capacity and scale operations through automation on top of our cloud software platform. We continually demonstrate the success of our offering by supporting numerous Fortune 500 customers and large-scale education customers even at their most demanding peak periods.
Our SaaS offerings are designed for reliability with a highly available infrastructure design spanning numerous data centers for all regions in which we have operations. Jamf is built to be “always on” to all of our cloud customers. If infrastructure becomes unavailable for any reason, our offering reroutes traffic to a secondary location to ensure we deliver on our Service Level Agreements. This availability is monitored externally from an outside provider, and Jamf employees are proactively notified if availability is ever impacted.
Jamf empowers customers to seamlessly upgrade to our latest software. Our software platform streamlines automated backups, upgrades and enables roll-back if required for any reason. Our extensive experience running distributed systems at scale helps our customers remain focused on meeting their organizational needs.
Enterprise-grade security
Security is a critical customer requirement and a guiding principle at Jamf. Our customers frequently use our products to manage integral platforms, which informs our approach to security and compliance. We integrate security principles into development processes, test product code and infrastructure for potential security issues, and deploy security technologies. We have access controls to data in our production environments that are strictly assigned, monitored and audited. To ensure our processes remain innovative and secure, we undergo continuous third-party testing for vulnerabilities within our software architecture. We also engage with a third-party audit firm to audit our security program against well-known security standards like SOC2 Type II and ISO27001.
Differentiated technology
While there are many powerful capabilities of our technologies, the following are a few that set us apart from others in the market:

● | Powerful architected-for-Apple agent. Jamf has been perfecting its Apple device agent for eighteen years. Using the Jamf agent, Apple IT administrators can access remote computers and file systems, collecting attributes and intelligence as if they were physically sitting with each and every Apple device in their fleet. The Jamf agent is written at the user-level and therefore does not require loading code into the OS kernel, known as a kernel extension (“kext”). Most Windows-based cross-platform competitors employ kexts when they are ported to the Mac, which results in a slower, less secure and less stable solution. Jamf’s agent is able to quickly and safely consolidate and scale Apple inventory data beyond any cross-platform solution. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enterprise attributes and smart grouping. Not only does Jamf have more inventory information about Apple devices than anyone else, but because of our extensible enterprise attributes, we can consolidate data based on device usage or user. Through our patented smart grouping technology, Jamf is then able to dynamically group 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

19




Apple devices, based on standard attributes, enterprise attributes or a combination thereof to target and execute business workflows at scale. These workflows can be extremely advanced when tapping into the Jamf policies engine, which includes full scripting capabilities for maximum flexibility.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Industry workflows. Part of filling the gap between what Apple provides and what the enterprise requires is providing technology that extends far beyond basic management to meet the unique needs of specific industries. For example, Jamf’s patented mobile-to-mobile management technology provides teachers the control of student iPads in the classroom they need. Jamf’s patent-pending healthcare listener functionality empowers hospitals to launch device workflows based on events in the electronic medical record. Jamf also has developed a new patented telehealth workflow, Virtual Visits, aimed to protect providers while still connecting patients to care and their communities during the COVID-19 pandemic. And Jamf’s patented setup and reset iOS applications create a shared device workflow that is required in these industries as well as retail, hospitality, field services and more. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | High performance native Apple APIs. Jamf creatively utilizes extensive APIs from published Apple technologies. Using native Apple APIs also allows us to be ready instantly with each new Apple operating system as Apple preserves forward-moving compatibility of their native APIs. We have filed a patent application for this innovative solution. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Enterprise self-service. Jamf’s value is more than simply retaining the legendary Apple user experience as devices are deployed throughout the enterprise. We believe Jamf actually improves upon the Apple experience with a simple-to-use enterprise self-service solution. This application enables IT to empower end-users with a privately brandable application that allows users to install approved apps or perform complex tasks with a single mouse click from a personalized enterprise catalog. Jamf’s self-service app empowers users to setup resources, update configurations, apply policies and troubleshoot common issues with a single click. The self-service app taps into Jamf’s underlying technologies, allowing end-users to simply and quickly solve their own problems without submitting an IT ticket. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sales and Marketing
Sales
We have a global, multi-faceted go-to-market approach that allows us to efficiently sell to and serve the needs of organizations of varying sizes. By offering a range of products and routes to the market, including through a direct sales force, online and indirectly via our channel partners (including Apple), we can serve many types of organizations across the world.
Our direct sales force services larger organizations and those with more complex requirements. The direct sales organization is divided into inside and outside sales teams, organized by customer size, and is further segmented with teams focused on acquiring new logos or growing spend in our existing customer base. Our direct sales force is supported by sales development representatives that provide qualified leads as well as other technical resources.
To complement our direct sales teams, we have a large network of over 200 channel partners globally that resell our products located across the world. These channel partners provide us with expanded market coverage and an efficient way to reach smaller or emerging geographies, providing us with additional sales capacity and the ability to be present in more global markets. Approximately 55% of our bookings were facilitated via our channel partners for the year ended December 31, 2020.
One of our notable channel partners is Apple, which, as a channel partner, facilitated approximately 7% of our bookings for the year ended December 31, 2020. Apple education became a Jamf channel partner in 2011, and resells Jamf to K-12 and higher education organizations within the United States. In 2012, Apple expanded its channel relationship by offering Jamf products to businesses through Apple retail, which includes their stores in the U.S. and sales teams that are focused on SMBs. In 2014, we became a member of Apple’s Mobility Partner Program that focuses 

20



on solution development and effective go-to-market activities. We work closely with these various Apple teams across both sales and marketing to develop close relationships and expand our customer base.
For smaller businesses or those with less complex requirements, we provide an online self-service e-commerce model that allows organizations to find products best suited for their needs. This provides an efficient way to introduce smaller organizations to Jamf, with an opportunity for the relationship to grow over time.
Our global, multi-faceted go-to-market approach combined with the ability for customers to easily trial our products has allowed us to build an efficient, high velocity sales model.
Marketing
A key ingredient to our sales effectiveness and efficiency is our marketing engine. Our global marketing team builds market awareness of Jamf, generates preference and demand for our products and enables our sales teams and channel partners to efficiently develop business with new and existing customers.
We focus our marketing strategy on building recognition of the Jamf brand through thought leadership and differentiated messaging that emphasizes the business value of our products. Our efforts include content marketing, social media, search engine optimization (“SEO”), events and public and analyst relations. We leverage this brand awareness to acquire new customers and cross-market our software solutions to our existing customer base through global campaigns that integrate digital, social, web, email, customer advocacy and field marketing tactics, such as regional customer/prospect conferences. To create maximum impact, these campaigns are created and adapted to serve all geographic regions and routes to market. We then accelerate prospects or customers through the buying journey by enabling our sales team and channel partners with a range of product/solution content, internal tools, such as ROI calculators, competitive intelligence and case studies. Finally, we capitalize on the voices of our highly satisfied and loyal customers using a variety of customer advocacy tactics including case studies and videos, software reviews, social amplification, references and referrals.
The Jamf brand further benefits from Jamf Nation, the world’s largest Apple IT online community. With over 100,000 members, Jamf Nation is our active community of Apple IT professionals, including Jamf customers and potential customers, who share ideas and solutions related to their Apple deployments. Jamf Nation’s large volume of user-generated content serves as a great source of organic search traffic, introducing prospective customers to the Jamf brand and Jamf products. Complementing Jamf Nation, we host JNUC, the world’s largest enterprise Apple IT administrator conference. With thousands of attendees, publicly streamed keynotes and over 100 customer and Jamf-led sessions, we further tap into the power of our passionate customer base and garner significant market attention as the leader in our space.

We value customer engagement and have a dedicated team of customer success professionals who work within three tiers of engagement models to proactively drive adoption, foster communication and ensure the success of our products. We offer success planning exercises for our high-tier enterprise customers, and all customers benefit from our health scoring algorithm that uses multiple factors of product usage and company engagement to determine how we can best support their needs.
It is important to us that our customers have the resources they need to succeed with Apple, and customers are encouraged to connect and engage with the larger community of Apple administrators. This is best evidenced by Jamf Nation. Complementing our world-class technical support, this active, grassroots community serves as a highly-qualified and efficient crowd-sourced Q&A engine for anyone with questions about Apple and Jamf deployments. Jamf Nation members come together to gain insight, share best practices, vet ideas with fellow administrators and submit product feature requests. We intend to continue investing in these relationships and ensure that our Jamf Nation community remains a vibrant forum for discussion and problem-solving for our customers.
Research and Development
Our research and development department is focused on enhancing our existing products and developing new products to maintain and extend our leadership position. Our department is built around small teams who practice agile development methodologies that enable us to innovate at a rapid pace and at scale on a global basis. The teams are organized to support our mission of helping organizations succeed with Apple and ensuring that we continue to deliver same-day support for Apple across our portfolio. In order to provide same day support for Apple, we deliberately schedule our annual efforts around Apple’s anticipated product release schedules and we reserve engineering capacity accordingly. This nimble approach enables us to successfully support the Apple enterprise by staying current on Apple releases and delivering differentiated solutions, many of which form the core of our intellectual property portfolio. Approximately 22% of our global employee base is dedicated to research and development. Our research and development teams are organized into teams that are focused by product and based principally in Minneapolis, MN, Eau Claire, WI and Katowice, Poland.

22



Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark, trade dress and trade secret laws in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights. These laws, procedures and restrictions provide only limited protection. As of December 31, 2020, we owned seven issued U.S. patents and twelve issued patents in foreign jurisdictions. Excluding any patent term adjustments or patent term extensions, our issued U.S. patents will expire between 2034 and 2040. We cannot be assured that any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of a patent or whether the examination process will require us to narrow the scope of the claims sought. Our issued patents, and any future patents issued to us, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, may not provide sufficiently broad protection and may not prove to be enforceable in actions against alleged infringers.
We have registered “Jamf” and the “Jamf” logo as trademarks in the United States and other jurisdictions. We have also registered numerous Internet domain names related to our business.
We enter into agreements with our employees, contractors, customers, partners and other parties with which we do business to limit access to and disclosure of our technology and other proprietary information. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will be sufficient or effective to prevent the unauthorized access, use, copying or the reverse engineering of our technology and other proprietary information, including by third parties who may use our technology or other proprietary information to develop products and services that compete with ours. Moreover, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive with ours or that infringe on, misappropriate or otherwise violate our intellectual property and proprietary rights, and policing the unauthorized use of our intellectual property and proprietary rights can be difficult. The enforcement of our intellectual property and proprietary rights also depends on any legal actions we may bring against any such parties being successful, but these actions are costly, time-consuming and may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated.
Furthermore, effective patent, copyright, trademark, trade dress and trade secret protection may not be available in every country in which our products are available, as the laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property and proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. In addition, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property and proprietary rights are uncertain and still evolving.
Companies in the software industry or non-practicing entities may own large numbers of patents, copyrights, trademarks and other intellectual property and proprietary rights, and these companies and entities have and may in the future request license agreements, threaten litigation or file suit against us based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of their intellectual property and proprietary rights.
See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Our Business” for a more comprehensive description of risks related to our intellectual property.
Competition
Our competition is generally comprised of large cross-platform enterprise providers and early stage providers of Apple enterprise solutions. Large enterprise providers, such as VMWare, Microsoft and IBM typically compete with us on one particular solution (e.g. device management, identity or endpoint-security) intended for cross-platform use and not specialized for Apple. Given Jamf’s success, a number of early-stage companies are following our approach to deliver on an Apple ecosystem vision. While the latter category of competitors are Apple-focused, they are still single-product companies and none have grown to a meaningful scale to be considered material competitors.
Key competitive factors in our market include:

● | user experience;
--+-----------------


● | breadth of product offerings;
--+------------------------------

● | IT efficiency;

● | total cost of ownership;
--+-------------------------


● | reliability and performance of solutions;
--+------------------------------------------


● | turnkey product capabilities;
--+------------------------------


● | interoperability with other software solutions;
--+------------------------------------------------


● | speed, compatibility and feature support of new operating systems;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


● | quality and availability of global service and support; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------


● | brand awareness, reputation and influence among IT professionals.

We believe that we compete favorably on these factors.
Human Capital Resources
Jamf is a culmination of passionate, committed and bright people who shape our culture and live our core values of Selflessness and Relentless Self-Improvement. We do not say we are the best, but we strive to be the best — for our customers, our employees and our communities. Our leaders encourage autonomy, exploration and innovation with spirit and enthusiasm. Through transparency, openness and humility, we embrace the opportunity to challenge ourselves. We are a group of curious self-starters who thrive on taking initiative and are excited by global impact. Our employees enjoy the freedom to be themselves and work how they work best. As of December 31, 2020, our voluntary retention rate for employees was 96%. Additionally, in our annual employee engagement survey conducted in September, 96% of over 1,200 employees responding agreed that they would recommend Jamf as a great place to work. Furthermore, in December 2020, Jamf was certified by Great Place to Work®, a global leader in workplace culture, as a “Great Place to Work®,” with 96% of employees saying Jamf is a great place to work.
We can only be our best selves when given the freedom to be ourselves. To that end, we believe it is important that we create a safe space where everyone is able to express their unique needs to propel Jamf to be a global leader of equality and fairness in the workplace. Our employee-led Inclusion & Diversity Global Steering Committee’s goal is to help others feel empowered for safe and authentic expression, to lead the projects, events and groups that they are passionate about, and take action on issues related to inclusion and diversity at Jamf. Our Employee Resource Groups, Womxn@Jamf, Accessibility@Jamf, The Shades of Jamf and PROUD@Jamf, provide a safe space for empowerment and cultural education. As of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, based on employees who chose to identify their gender, approximately 31.4% of our workforce and 41.9% of new hires were women.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 1,496 employees, of which 1,091 were employed in the United States and 405 were employed outside of the United States. We have high employee engagement and consider our current relationship with our employees to be good. In certain countries in which we operate we are subject to, and comply with, local labor law requirements, which automatically make our employees subject to industry-wide collective bargaining agreements. We have not experienced any work stoppages. 
In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have implemented a number of measures designed to protect the health and safety of our workforce. We instituted a global work-from-home policy and invested in a new home office setup for all our employees. Since the beginning of the pandemic, we have onboarded the majority of our new employees remotely. Other measures include restrictions on business travel, the implementation of strategies for workplace safety at our facilities that remain open, new operating guidelines for our offices based on local conditions, and additional wellness benefits for employees.
