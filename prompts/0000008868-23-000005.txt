ITEM 1. BUSINESS
(U.S. dollars in millions, except per share data)
When used in this report, the terms "Avon," "Company," "we," "our" or "us" mean, unless the context otherwise indicates, Avon Products, Inc. and its majority and wholly owned subsidiaries.
General
We are a global manufacturer and marketer of beauty and related products. We commenced operations in 1886 and were incorporated in the State of New York on January 27, 1916. We conduct our business in the highly competitive beauty industry and compete against other consumer packaged goods ("CPG") and direct-selling companies to create, manufacture and market beauty and non-beauty-related products. Our product categories are Beauty and Fashion & Home. Beauty consists of skincare, fragrance and color (cosmetics). Fashion & Home consists of fashion jewelry, watches, apparel, footwear, accessories, gift and decorative products, housewares, entertainment and leisure products, children’s products and nutritional products. 
Our business is conducted primarily in one channel, direct selling, and our strategy is to expand to omnichannel. Since our merger with Natura Cosméticos S.A., we have updated our reportable segments to align with how the business is currently operated and managed. We have identified two reportable segments based on geographic operations: Avon International and Avon Latin America. In prior periods, the Company reported four segments: Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific, South Latin America and North Latin America. Financial information relating to our reportable segments is included in "Segment Review" within Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, which we refer to in this report as "MD&A,", and in Note 14, Segment Information, to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. We refer to each of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein as a "Note." Information about geographic areas is included in Note 14, Segment Information to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein. All of our consolidated revenue is derived from operations of subsidiaries outside of the United States ("U.S.").
In May 2019 we and Natura Cosméticos S.A., a Brazilian corporation (sociedade anônima) ("Natura Cosméticos"), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Mergers (the "Merger Agreement"), pursuant to which the Company and Natura Cosméticos were acquired by and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Natura &Co, Holding S.A., a Brazilian corporation (sociedade anônima) ("Natura &Co") in January 2020. Natura has stock listed on the B3 S.A. - Brasil, Bolsa, Balcão stock exchange in Brazil and American Depositary Shares traded on the New York Stock Exchange ("NYSE"). With the completion of this transaction, our common stock was removed from trading on the NYSE, and we became a privately held company.
Distribution
During 2022, we had sales operations in 51 countries and territories, and distributed our products in 23 other countries and territories. At December 31, 2022, we had sales operations in 49 countries.
Unlike most of our CPG competitors, which sell their products through third-party retail establishments (e.g., drug stores and department stores), we primarily sell our products to the ultimate consumer through the direct-selling channel, with a strategy to expand to omnichannel. Our priority in the omnichannel model is to accelerate digital social selling through Representative engagement, activation, training, direct customer delivery service, and e-commerce. In our case, sales of our products are made to the ultimate consumer principally through direct selling by Representatives, who are independent contractors and not our employees. On average we had approximately 4 million Active Representatives during the year ended December 31, 2022, which represents the number of Representatives submitting an order in a sales campaign, totaled for all campaigns during the year and then divided by the number of campaigns. Representatives earn by purchasing products directly from us at a discount from a published brochure price and selling them to their customers, the ultimate consumer of our products. Representatives can start their Avon businesses for a nominal fee, or in some markets for no fee at all. We generally have no arrangements with end users of our products beyond the Representative, except as described below. No single Representative accounts for more than 10% of our net sales globally.
A Representative contacts their customers directly, selling primarily through our brochure (whether paper or online), which highlights new products and special promotions (or incentives) for each sales campaign. In this sense, the Representative, together with the brochure, are the "store" through which our products are sold. A brochure introducing a new sales campaign is typically generated every three to four weeks. A purchase order is processed and the products are picked at a distribution center and delivered to the Representative usually through a combination of local and national delivery companies. Historically, the Representative then delivers the merchandise and collects payment from the customer for her own account. Several of our larger countries have begun to offer direct to customer delivery of the ordered products. A Representative generally receives a refund of the price the Representative paid for a product if the Representative chooses to return it.
We employ certain web-enabled systems to increase Representative support, which allow a Representative to run her or his business more efficiently and also allow us to improve our order-processing accuracy. For example, in many countries, 
Representatives can utilize the Internet to manage their business electronically, including order submission, order tracking, payment and communications with us. In addition, in many markets, Representatives can further build their own business through personalized web pages provided by us, enabling them to sell a complete line of our products online. Self-paced online training also is available in certain markets. We are actively deploying and training the Representatives on additional digital tools and sales methods to help increase its customer reach.
While we continue to grow the penetration of our Representative mobile application, AvonON, we are proud to have increased the usage by 24% in the year ended December 31, 2022, with a 12% increase in engaged users who access the app on a regularly basis in that year, which we believe will eventually lead to an increased number of Hybrid Representatives (who serve customers online & offline). We believe this will be key to our retention & growth of sellers’ segment at Avon since Hybrid Representatives have higher average sales and order more frequently. 
In some markets, particularly in Asia Pacific, we use decentralized branches, satellite stores and independent retail operations (e.g., beauty boutiques) to serve Representatives and other customers. Representatives come to a branch to place and pick up product orders for their customers. The branches also create visibility of the Avon brand, channel with consumers and help reinforce our beauty image. In certain markets, we allow our beauty centers and other retail-oriented and direct-to-consumer opportunities to reach new customers in complementary ways to direct selling. Avon increasingly utilizes e-commerce and markets its products through consumer websites.
The recruiting or appointing and training of Representatives are the primary responsibilities of independent leaders supported by zone managers. Depending on the market and the responsibilities of the role, some of these individuals are our employees and some are independent contractors. Those who are employees are paid a salary and an incentive based primarily on the achievement of a sales objective in their district. Those who are independent contractors are rewarded primarily based on total sales achieved in their zones or downline team of recruited, trained and managed Representatives. Personal contacts, including recommendations from current Representatives (including the sales leadership program) and local market advertising constitute the primary means of obtaining new Representatives. The sales leadership program is a multi-level compensation program which gives Representatives, known as independent leaders, the opportunity to earn discounts on their own sales of our products, as well as commissions based on the net sales made by Representatives they have recruited and trained. This program generally limits the number of levels on which commissions can be earned to three. The primary responsibilities of independent leaders are the prospecting, appointing, training and development of their downline Representatives while maintaining a certain level of their own sales. As described above, the Representative is the "store" through which we primarily sell our products and, given the high rate of turnover among Representatives, which is a common characteristic of direct selling, it is critical that we recruit, retain and service Representatives on a continuing basis in order to maintain and grow our business. 
From time to time, local governments and others question the legal status of Representatives or impose burdens inconsistent with their status as independent contractors, often in regard to possible coverage under social benefit laws that would require us (and, in most instances, the Representatives) to make regular contributions to government social benefit funds. Although we have generally been able to address these questions in a satisfactory manner, these questions can be raised again following regulatory changes in a jurisdiction or can be raised in other jurisdictions. If there should be a final determination adverse to us in a country, the cost for future, and possibly past, contributions could be so substantial in the context of the volume and profitability of our business in that country that we would consider discontinuing operations in that country.
Promotion and Marketing
Sales promotion and sales development activities are directed at assisting Representatives, through sales aids such as brochures, product samples, demonstration products and training. In order to support the efforts of Representatives to reach new customers, specially designed sales aids, digital content and tools, promotional pieces, customer flyers and various forms of advertising may be used. In addition, we seek to motivate the Representatives through the use of special incentive programs that reward superior sales performance. Periodic sales meetings with Representatives are conducted by the district sales or zone managers. We believe that the training meetings are an integral part of enabling the Representatives to provide customers with the advice and tools to better service her customer base as well as teach sales techniques and provide recognition for sales performance.
We use a number of merchandising techniques, including promotional pricing for new products, combination offers, trial sizes and samples, and the promotion of products packaged as gift items. In most markets, for each sales campaign, we publish a distinctive brochure (whether paper or online), in which we introduce new products and special promotions on selected items or give particular prominence to a particular category. 
Competitive Conditions
We face competition from various products and product lines. The beauty and beauty-related products industry is highly competitive and the number of competitors and degree of competition that we face in this industry varies widely from country 
to country. We compete against products sold to consumers in a number of distribution methods, including direct selling, through the Internet, and through the mass market retail and prestige retail channels.
Specifically, due to the nature of the direct-selling channel, we often compete on a country-by-country basis with our direct-selling competitors. Unlike a typical CPG company, which operates within a broad-based consumer pool, direct sellers compete for representative or entrepreneurial talent by providing a more competitive earnings opportunity or "better deal" than that offered by the competition as well as significant competition from other non-direct selling earnings opportunities for which the existing Representatives or potential Representatives could avail themselves. Providing a compelling earnings opportunity for the Representatives is as critical as developing and marketing new and innovative products. As a result, in contrast to a typical CPG company, we must first compete for a limited pool of Representatives before we reach the ultimate consumer.
Within the broader CPG industry, we principally compete against large and well-known cosmetics (color), fragrance and skincare companies that manufacture and sell broad product lines through various types of retail establishments and other channels, including through the Internet. In addition, we compete against many other companies that manufacture and sell more narrow beauty product lines sold through retail establishments and other channels, including through the Internet.
We also have many global branded and private label competitors in the accessories, apparel, housewares, and gift and decorative products industries, including retail establishments, principally department stores, mass merchandisers, gift shops and specialty retailers. Our principal competition in the fashion jewelry industry consists of a few large companies and many small companies that sell fashion jewelry through department stores, mass merchandisers, specialty retailers and e-commerce.
We believe that the personalized customer service offered by the Representatives; the Representatives’ earnings opportunity as well as the amount and type of field incentives we offer the Representatives on a market-by-market basis; the high quality, attractive designs and prices of our products; the high level of new and innovative products; our easily recognized brand name; and our guarantee of product satisfaction are significant factors in helping to establish and maintain our competitive position.
International Operations
During 2022, our international operations, outside of the U.S., were conducted primarily through subsidiaries in 51 countries and territories. At December 31, 2022, this had reduced to 49 countries and territories. Outside of the U.S., our products were also distributed in 23 other countries and territories. In March 2016, we separated from our North America business, which had consisted of the Company's operations in the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico; this business has been presented as discontinued operations for all periods presented. As a result, all of our consolidated revenue is derived from operations of subsidiaries outside of the U.S. During 2022, approximately 48% of our consolidated revenue was derived from Avon Latin America, and approximately 52% was derived from Avon International. Further, approximately 21% of our consolidated revenue during 2022 was derived from Brazil, which is our largest market and is included within the Avon Latin America reportable segment.
Our international operations are subject to risks inherent in conducting business abroad, including, but not limited to, the risk of adverse foreign currency fluctuations, foreign currency remittance restrictions, the ability to procure products, pandemic situations, unfavorable social, economic and political conditions, and other developments such as natural disasters. On February 6, 2023, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake occurred in a region of Turkey where approximately 25% of our Turkey-based Representatives and Sales Leaders are located. We are monitoring the impact of this event, which may adversely affect our revenues and levels of bad debt.
For more information, see "Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our International Operations—Our ability to conduct business in our international markets may be affected by economic, political, legal, tax and regulatory risks" and "—We are subject to financial risks as a result of our international operations, including exposure to foreign currency fluctuations and the impact of foreign currency restrictions."
Manufacturing and Sourcing
We manufacture and package the majority of our Beauty products, which are formulated and designed by our staff of chemists, designers and artists. Raw materials, consisting chiefly of essential oils, chemicals, containers and packaging components required for our Beauty products are purchased from a range of third-party suppliers. The remainder of our Beauty products and all of our Fashion & Home products are purchased from various third-party manufacturers. 
Our products are affected by the cost and availability of materials such as glass, fragrance and fuel. For the vast majority of items we have more than one source of supply available. We believe that we can continue to obtain sufficient raw materials and supplies to manufacture and produce our Beauty products for the foreseeable future. However, our ability to source the raw materials underlying our product offerings has been adversely affected by events beyond our control in recent years, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia, both events which significantly affected the reliability of global supply chains for a wide range of consumer products.
Additionally, we design the brochures (whether paper or online) that are used by the Representatives to sell our products. The brochures are then produced on our behalf by a range of printing suppliers. 
The loss of any one supplier would not have a material impact on our ability to source raw materials for the majority of our Beauty products or source products for the remainder of our Beauty products and all of our Fashion & Home products or paper for the brochures. However, our ability to source raw materials would be adversely affected if we were to lose multiple suppliers at once.
See "Item 2. Properties" for additional information regarding the location of our principal manufacturing facilities.
Product Categories
Both of our product categories individually account for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in 2022. The following is the percentage of net sales by product category for the years ended December 31: 

 | 2022 | | 2021 | | 2020
Beauty | 78 | % | | 74 | % | 74 | %
Fashion & Home | 22 | % | | 26 | % | 26 | %

2022 and 2021 were impacted by certain indirect tax items in Brazil and is excluded from net sales in our calculation above. See Note 5: Revenue for more information.
Trademarks and Patents
Our business is not materially dependent on the existence of third-party patent, trademark or other third-party intellectual property rights, and we are not a party to any ongoing material licenses, franchises or concessions. We do seek to protect our key proprietary technologies by aggressively pursuing comprehensive patent coverage in major markets. We protect our Avon name and other major proprietary trademarks through registration of these trademarks in the relevant markets, monitoring the markets for infringement of such trademarks by others, and by taking appropriate steps to stop any infringing activities.
Seasonal Nature of Business
Our sales and earnings are typically affected by seasonal variations, a characteristic of many companies selling beauty, gift and
decorative products, apparel and fashion jewelry. For instance, our sales are generally highest during the fourth quarter due to
seasonal and holiday-related patterns. However, the sales volume of holiday gift items is, by its nature, difficult to forecast, and
taken as a whole, seasonality does not have a material impact on our financial results.
Research and Product Development Activities
New products are essential to growth in the highly competitive cosmetics industry. Our research and development ("R&D") department’s efforts are vital to developing new products, including formulating high performing beauty products relevant to women’s needs, and improving existing products. As part of our Open Up & Grow strategy and to improve our brand competitiveness, we are focusing on developing breakthrough new technology and product innovation to deliver accessible Beauty products that provide visible consumer benefits while also delivering the Company’s ambitious sustainability goals. R&D also works extensively with third party companies to bring in new ideas, help accelerate development time and deliver against local market trends.
Our global R&D innovation center is located in Suffern, New York, which, as described in “Item 2. Properties,” will have its current activities transferred to Brazil and Poland by the end of its fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2024. There is a team of expert scientists, researchers and technicians applying the disciplines of science to developing and bringing products to market around the world. Relationships with dermatologists, scientists and other specialists enhance our ability to deliver new formulas and ingredients to market. Additionally, we have R&D centers located in Brazil, China, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland, South Africa and the UK.
The amounts incurred on research activities relating to the development of new products and the improvement of existing products were $40.8 in 2022, $39.3 in 2021 and $36.5 in 2020. This research included the activities of product research and development and package design and development. Most of these activities were related to the design and development of Beauty products.
Environmental Matters
Compliance with environmental laws and regulations impacting our global operations has not had, and currently is not anticipated to have, a material adverse effect on our financial position, capital expenditures or competitive position. As part of the Natura &Co group, we are now in the process of working towards our B Corp accreditation, as set by B Lab, Inc., which we aim to achieve by 2026.
As a B Corp, our board of directors would be required to promote the success of the Company for the benefit of our shareholders as a whole and, through our business and operations, to have a material positive impact on society and the environment, taken as a whole. As a result of the fact that our board of directors would be required to consider other stakeholders and issues in addition to shareholders’ interests, we may take in the future actions that we believe will benefit some or all of our stakeholders, even if those actions do not maximize our financial performance. For example, we may choose to revise our policies in ways that we believe will further promote environmental, social and governance issues, even though such changes may be more costly than other alternatives. Nonetheless, we believe that obtaining B Corp certification, and other environmental, social and governance certifications that we may obtain from time to time, would strengthen our credibility and trust among our customers, employees and business partners as well as within our industry by bolstering our commitment towards our stakeholders.
Human Capital Resources 
At December 31, 2022, Avon employed approximately 13,000 employees. Of these, approximately 150 were employed in the United States. In Avon International females constituted approximately 66.5% of our workforce and 68.5% of our managerial employees and in Avon Latin America females constituted approximately 59.6% of our workforce and 56.5% of our managerial employees.
At Avon, we’re the company that strives to put purpose, people and relationships at the heart of everything we do and we’re committed to generating a positive environmental, economic and social impact for our communities across the globe.
We believe beauty is for everyone and that it is beautiful to be you. We celebrate our differences, champion self-expression and are committed to inclusion for all. We embrace diversity and individuality to build a culture that represents our communities and enables everyone to bring their best self to work. Our Avon Expectations for all Associates and Management clearly outline a minimum standard for appropriate behavior. Our employee resource groups enable Associates to have a safe space for learning, honest conversations, coaching and hold the business to account – highlighting areas for improvement and providing feedback on policy and decision-making. 
At Avon we are committed to protecting human rights and being humankind. Our aim is to close the gender pay equity gap by 2023 ensuring that associates who perform the same role in the same location with the same responsibilities, experience and performance should be paid equally whatever their gender is, which we have achieved. We also commit to 50% of women in senior management roles, which we are currently meeting. We are also committed to paying living wage or above to all our employees by 2023, which is also true. 
We continue with our focus on inclusive hiring to accelerate diverse representation at all levels as well as building an inclusive culture through our employee networks and educational events throughout the year. Building a culture of psychological safety has been at the heart of our culture transformation, with a keynote and recommended learning for all associates as well as the start of our senior leader team effectiveness model to increase psychological safety in teams across the organization. 
In 2022, we have also continued to strive for an inclusive and equitable culture through eliminating bias and discrimination in our practices and policies – committing to equally honoring all family structures and relationships through our equity and inclusion position and our global menopause policy, supporting women through perimenopause and menopause through optimizing working conditions, flexible working and additional paid leave. 
Avon International
In 2022, we demonstrated our purpose with our support to associates around the Ukrainian War to support people there with creative financial support packages, offers of relocation and help from neighboring countries (especially Poland and Romania). Many of our Polish and Romanian associates took up the opportunity of our new volunteering policy to support Ukrainian refugees as they arrived in the first few weeks of the war. We also ran webinars to support people with their mental well-being through times of crisis – with over 1 000 people joining. Additionally, we also ran separate sessions with an external psychologist and crisis management consultant dedicated to People Managers to support provide them tools so they could support their teams in this stressful situation. 
We continued focus on our Employee Value Proposition (EVP) - ‘The Beauty of Doing Good’, tracking progress every 6 months through our employee engagement survey, Glint. We have continued to focus on the growth of our associates, launching LinkedIn Learning in February and were delighted to achieve top quartile activation versus industry peers in the first year of launch. During last year we spent almost 10 000 hours learning and gaining new skills through LinkedIn Learning, 58% of our associates keep using the platform and we continue to engage them in gaining new skills. 
We have continued to invest in building leaders at all levels of the organization The “Leading with Heart” program for first -time people managers covers key concepts critical to being an effective and compassionate leader. 274 associates attended this program. Through the “Leading with Purpose” program, participants learn how to leverage their personal strengths while 
maximizing impact as senior leaders. 442 associates attended this program. We have invested in executive coaching for leaders stepping up into critical leadership roles and continue to support leadership teams with ongoing team development support.
In July we held a “Simple and Agile” Hackathon – to engage the whole organization to remove some of the pain points and bureaucracy in the organization, The first day was a day of learning with over 4887 hours of learning and on day 2, over 1473 associates joined session to hack 8 problems or opportunities.
One of the Hackathon topics was flexible working and associates worked together to explore different ways we can continue to deliver on our EVP promise to support associates to “work in a way that works for you” and we used the ideas to relaunch our flexible working philosophy – trusting associates to manage their work, to work flexibly between the office and home to enable them to manage their whole lives.
We are really pleased that despite a year of people challenges, we have increased overall Engagement up 2 points and have continued to make progress against our key areas of focus. This has been reflected in our Glint scores, Feedback score up by 1 point, Manager up 2, Career stayed the same, Growth up 2, Equal Opportunity up 3. 
Avon Latin America
By 2022, Glint's focus was to evolve the culture of continuous listening and ensure that steps were taken to increase engagement. There was a strong focus on internal movements of talent in managerial positions and above, with 87% of new roles in 2022 being filled by internal hires (administrative public only). We have also invested in executive coaching for leaders stepping up into critical leadership roles and continue to support leadership teams with ongoing team development support. We hold workshops with Avon leadership boards to focus on excellence on execution and to unleash the power of collaboration between areas. 
Transformation Plan, Open Up & Grow and Avon Integration
In January 2016, we announced a transformation plan (the "Transformation Plan") which was completed in 2018. In September 2018, we initiated a new strategy to return Avon to growth ("Open Up Avon"). In May 2020, the new leadership of Avon International refreshed our strategy ("Open Up & Grow") which aims to return Avon International to growth over the next three years. 
In addition, subsequent to the merger of Natura and Avon in January 2020, an integration plan (the "Avon Integration") was established to create the right global infrastructure to support the future vision of the Natura &Co Group, while also identifying synergies primarily between Avon LATAM and Natura &Co Latin America.
See "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview" for more information on these items.
Acquisitions and Dispositions 
In May 2019 we and Natura Cosméticos, a Brazilian corporation entered into the Merger Agreement, pursuant to which the Company and Natura Cosméticos were acquired by and became wholly-owned subsidiaries of Natura &Co Holding, S.A. ("Natura &Co" or "Natura &Co Holding") in January 2020. With the completion of this transaction, our common stock was removed from trading on the NYSE, and we became a privately held company.
During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we disposed of businesses and assets as part of the Open up Avon strategy and later the Open Up & Grow strategy. In February, May and June 2019, we completed the sale of Avon Manufacturing (Guangzhou), Ltd, Maximin Corporation Sdn Bhd ("Malaysia Maximin") and the Rye office, respectively. In April and August 2020, we completed the sale of the Hungary distribution center and the China Wellness Plant, respectively. In June, September, November and December 2021, we completed the sale of a branch of our Italian business, the Spanish distribution center, the manufacturing business in India and the business in Saudi Arabia, respectively. 
On July 1, 2021, the Company sold Avon Luxembourg, including our Mexican business, to a subsidiary of Natura &Co Holding for $150, with the proceeds used to repay maturing loans of $150 borrowed under the $250 Revolving Credit Facility with a subsidiary of Natura &Co Holding.
Refer to Note 3, Discontinued Operations and Assets and Liabilities Held for Sale to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein, for additional information.
COVID-19 Pandemic
Beginning with the first quarter of 2020, there has been a worldwide impact from the COVID-19 pandemic as during 2020, many markets were subject to lockdown restrictions to varying degrees, which limited our ability to recruit and enroll Representatives, operate manufacturing facilities and distribution centers and to process and deliver orders. In 2021 and 2022, 
the continuing economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic also resulted in inflationary pressures on the cost of certain raw materials used in the production of essential items due to the increased demand for these inputs worldwide.
These inflationary pressures were compounded in 2022 by the ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia which adversely impacted energy prices around the globe and further increased inflationary pressures. As of the date of this report, we are unable to estimate the longer-term economic impact of the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war and of any further impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. We will continue to review our revenue, investments, expenses and cash outflows, as well as adjusting our relationships with suppliers. 
Furthermore, the actions outlined above are continuously being re-evaluated in light of global developments relating to COVID-19. See also “Item 1A. Risk Factors—The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our operations, manufacturing, supply chains and distribution systems, and we have experienced and expect to continue to experience unpredictable negative effects associated with the pandemic".
Ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia
On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a military invasion of Ukraine. The ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia has provoked strong reactions from the United States, the UK, the European Union (the “EU”) and various other countries around the world, including the imposition of broad financial and economic sanctions against Russia. 
As a result of the ongoing war in Ukraine, our Ukraine Distribution center operations are currently suspended for an indeterminate period with orders being shipped to the market from the Polish Distribution center instead. For more information, see "Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview—Ongoing war between Ukraine and Russia."
