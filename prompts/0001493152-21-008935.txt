Our Business
 
Prior to the completion of the Share Exchange, BIG Token was an operating segment of SRAX. On February 4, 2021 we completed the Share Exchange. As a result, BIG Token became our wholly owned subsidiary and we adopted BIG Token’s business plan. We anticipate formally changing our name to BIG Token in the future. In connection with the Share Exchange, we also entered into certain agreements with SRAX including but not limited to the TSA and MSA, as more fully described below. The terms of these agreements may be more or less favorable to us than if they had been negotiated with unaffiliated third parties.
 
We were initially incorporated as M Street Gallery, Inc. in March of 2011, in the state of Florida. On September 25, 2013, we changed our name to Enhance-Your-Reputation.com, Inc. On February 1, 2015, we changed our name to Force Protection Video Equipment Corporation. Our headquarters are located in Westlake Village, California, but we work as a virtually distributed organization. On February 4, 2021 we completed a share exchange with BIG Token, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of SRAX. As a result of the exchange, BIG Token became our wholly owned subsidiary. Additionally, simultaneous with the exchange, we adopted BIG Token’s business plan.

Company Overview
 
We are a data technology company offering a consumer based mobile application that allows consumers to own and earn from their digital data. We generate revenue by anonymizing the data, and using it to extract consumer insights that we sell to brand advertisers. Our consumer- based platform and technologies offer tools and services to identify and reach the target consumers of our brand advertisers. Our technologies assist our clients to identify their core consumers and such consumers’ characteristics across various channels in order to discover new and measurable opportunities that amplify the performance of marketing campaigns and maximize a return on marketing spend.
 
When consumers download our app, we ask them some questions, engage them with surveys, and ask them to connect their various online accounts including their bank accounts, credit card accounts, and social media accounts. Based on the amount of information they provide directly by answering questions or taking surveys, or passively, by connecting accounts, we’re able to track more than 4,000 attributes per consumer. 
 
We derive our revenues from applying the data we collect, and deriving insights and audiences that we use to increase the efficiency of the online advertising of our clients. We then share the revenue generated with our consumers based on their activity and various other parameters. 
 
To date, there have been more than 16 million accounts registered on BIG Token. The vast majority of our registrations have been driven by referrals from existing users who get rewards for driving new users. Of the 16 million, we’ve “verified” over 9 million through emails and bot detection techniques. 
 
Our Market Opportunity – Data Economy
 
The global big data market is forecasted to grow to $103B by 2027, more than double its market size in 2018. A consumer’s digital footprint includes everything they search for, view, read, listen to, purchase, like or comment on.
 
Data spending keeps rising - The majority of survey respondents (69.2%) said their organizations increased spending on data and related services in 2018 (relative to 2017), while over three-fourths (78.2%) anticipate investing even more in the coming year.
 

Companies are prioritizing data-driven insights in order to develop marketing strategy and allocate marketing spend.

Government Regulation On Data Privacy Is Driving Major Tech Companies To Restrict Or Eliminate Traditional Data Collection Techniques
 
Regulation is changing the way businesses and tech can use data. In 2016, the European Union (EU) passed the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) to give individuals control over their personal data and to unify regulations within the EU. Other seminal regulatory events include the 2018 passage of the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) intended to enhance privacy rights and consumer protection for Californians. 
 
In response to the changing global regulatory environment around data privacy, major tech companies are changing how they allow their customers to collect user data. Notably, the major browsers, including Google’s Chrome and Apple’s Safari, are eliminating, or severely restricting, the use of 3rd party cookies. Those cookies have been a principal way that brands have been able to identify and market to consumers. In addition, in iOS 14, Apple is changing the Identifier For Advertiser (IDFA) tags used by mobile apps to identify users from opt out, to opt-in. 
 
As a result of the intensifying regulatory landscape, and the tech industry’s response, first-party opt-in data, like that collected by BIGtoken, is becoming increasingly valuable. As we scale our compliant first party data set, BIGtoken will be strongly positioned to capitalize on the rapidly evolving data marketplace. We are currently focused on increasing registered users on the platform, increasing the engagement of our users, monetizing our data driven insights, and rewarding our users for sharing their data.
 
Given the massive tailwinds in data privacy, and our focus on first-party opt-in data, we believe BIGtoken is well positioned to accelerate growth as we play an increasingly larger role in ensuring data privacy is treated as a human right.
 
For additional information about government regulation applicable to our business, see Risk Factors in Part I, Item 1A.

Our Growth Strategy
 
Our business is currently based on using our mobile app to aggregate users who opt-in to provide us their data via direct and passive actions, anonymizing that data, and using that data to provide unique consumer insights that enable marketers to advertise more efficiently. We believe that as the information gathered through the BIGtoken platform scales, we will be able to introduce new products, and monetize our growing user base at increasingly higher rates.
 
We are currently focused on increasing registered users on the platform, increasing the engagement of our users, monetizing our data driven insights, and rewarding our users for sharing their data. As part of this strategy, we continue to explore partnership opportunities that would allow us to leverage the capabilities of the BIGtoken platform to effectively grow the platform and increase and enhance our user experience and user rewards / compensation.
 
Examples of how we plan to use BIGtoken and the proprietary consumer data derived therefrom include:
 

● | The use of BIGtoken user surveys and the sale of such information received from surveys. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | The creation and management of targeted rewards and loyalty programs based on information and buying trends ascertained by data captured on our BIGtoken platform. We offer this solution both on and off the BIGtoken app. 
● | The ability to assist our customers in conducting market research based on analytics received from users of the BIGtoken platform. 
● | The ability to identify specific audiences for our customers and to target questions, surveys and data analytics geared toward our customers’ products / industries. Additionally, if we are unable to scale the needed information for a customer’s target audience, we may utilize our proprietary analytics to gain insight to further focus and refine user segments that need to be targeted in order to optimize data and media spend. 
● | The use of Lightning Insights that allow our customers to conduct research around specific audience groups through both long and short research studies. 
● | The creation of customized loyalty programs that utilize rewards to drive consumer purchasing habits. 
● | We plan to increasingly embrace crypto-currencies, including, but limited to, offering to reward our users with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency, offering to pay our employees and vendors with such currency. offering our users digital wallets to store their crypto, enabling our users to store rewards in interest bearing stablecoins, holding cryptocurrency in our Treasury, developing our own Layer One Protocol optimized for users to own and monetize data, developing our own cryptocurrency to be used as rewards. 

 
Marketing and sales
 
We market our services through our in-house sales team, with a focus today on the largest brand advertisers with the biggest advertising budgets. Our customers include 8 of the 10 largest brand advertisers, each poised to dramatically increase their spend with BIGtoken in 2021. We believe that our focus on the largest brand advertisers will not only drive meaningful revenue growth but will help build the BIGtoken brand as the leader in privacy focused, opt in, first-party data, positioning us well when we expand our focus to mid-market agencies and brands.
 
On the client side, our in-house marketing is focused on positioning BIGtoken as a thought leader in data privacy, via social media, including Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter, public relations (PR), industry events and the creation of white papers which assist in our marketing efforts and are used as lead generation tools for our sales team.
 
On the consumer side, we are focused on marrying our privacy leadership, with a reward system that provides meaningful value to our users who provide us with meaningful data.

Intellectual property
 
We currently rely on a combination of trade secret laws and restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights. Our success depends on the protection of the proprietary aspects of our technology as well as our ability to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We also enter into proprietary information and confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants and commercial partners and control access to, and distribution of, our software documentation and other proprietary information. We have one Trademark, “BIGtoken.”
 
Competition
 
We operate in a highly competitive digital media and ad tech environment. We compete based on our ability to: assist our customers in obtaining the best available prices, data, and analytics, our customer service and, the quality and accessibility of our innovative products and service offerings. We believe our platform provides for a competitive advantage. We expect an increasing number of other companies to provide similar services, leading to an increasingly competitive landscape.
Government Regulations
 
We are subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and abroad that involve matters central to our business. Many of these laws and regulations are still evolving and being tested in courts and could be interpreted in ways that could harm our business. These may involve privacy, data protection and personal information, rights of publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection of minors, consumer protection, product liability, taxation, economic or other trade prohibitions or sanctions, anti-corruption law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. In particular, we are subject to federal, state, and foreign laws regarding privacy and protection of people’s data. Foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the United States. U.S. federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which in some cases can be enforced by private parties in addition to government entities, are constantly evolving and can be subject to significant change. As a result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in the new and rapidly evolving industry in which we operate, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices.
 
Proposed or new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 and applies to all of our products and services used by people in Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive or process personal data of residents of the European Union that are different from those previously in place in the European Union and includes significant penalties for non-compliance. The California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, also establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users. Similarly, there are a number of legislative proposals in the European Union, the United States, at both the federal and state level, as well as other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations or limitations in areas affecting our business, such as liability for copyright infringement. In addition, some countries are considering or have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements or requiring local storage and processing of data or similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity of delivering our services.
 
We may become the subject of investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits by government authorities and regulators in the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly in the areas of privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, and competition, as we continue to grow and expand our operations. We are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory orders or consent decrees, including the modified consent order we entered into in July 2019 with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC) which is pending federal court approval and which, among other matters, will require us to implement a comprehensive expansion of our privacy program. Orders issued by, or inquiries or enforcement actions initiated by, government or regulatory authorities could cause us to incur substantial costs, expose us to unanticipated civil and criminal liability or penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt or require us to change our business practices in a manner materially adverse to our business, divert resources and the attention of management from our business, or subject us to other remedies that adversely affect our business.

We anticipate embracing crypto and digital assets in the future. The regulatory regime governing blockchain technologies, cryptocurrencies, digital assets, utility tokens, security tokens and offerings of digital assets is uncertain, and new regulations or policies may materially adversely affect our development and the value. Regulation of digital assets, like cryptocurrencies, blockchain technologies and cryptocurrency exchanges, is currently undeveloped and likely to rapidly evolve as government agencies take greater interest in them. Regulation also varies significantly among international, federal, state and local jurisdictions and is subject to significant uncertainty. Various legislative and executive bodies in the United States and in other countries may in the future adopt laws, regulations, or guidance, or take other actions, which may severely impact the permissibility of tokens generally and the technology behind them or the means of transaction or in transferring them. Failure by us to comply with any laws, rules and regulations, some of which may not exist yet or are subject to interpretation and may be subject to change, could result in a variety of adverse consequences, including civil penalties and fines.


Employees and Human Capital Resources
 
As of March 26, 2021, we had 86 full-time employees. 7 are engaged in executive management such as our Chief Executive Officer, 57 in information technology including those participating in our research and development efforts, 7 in sales and marketing, 8 in integration and customer support and 7 in administration. All employees are employed “at will.” We believe our relations with our employees are generally positive and we have no collective bargaining agreements with any labor unions.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees. The principal purposes of our equity and cash incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel, whether existing employees or new hires, through the granting of stock-based and cash-based compensation awards. We believe that this increases value to our stockholders and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives.
 
As the success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our employees, we are committed to their health, safety and wellness. We provide our employees and their families with access to convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security giving them peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented significant changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the community in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations, including working in a remote environment where appropriate or required.
 
Relationship with SRAX
 
We have operated as an operating segment of SRAX since April 1, 2020. SRAX currently provides certain services to us, and costs associated with these functions are billed to us. These services relate to: executive management, information technology, legal, finance and accounting, human resources, tax, treasury, research and development, sales and marketing, shared facilities and other services.
 
On February 4, 2021, we completed the share exchange transaction (“Share Exchange”) as described in the share exchange agreement (“Exchange Agreement”). The Exchange Agreement and proposed Share Exchange was disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K that was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “Commission” or “SEC”)) on October 5, 2020.
 
Pursuant to the Share Exchange, we acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of BIG Token. As a result, we became a majority owned subsidiary of SRAX, BIG Token became our wholly owned subsidiary and Force Protection Video Equipment Corporation adopted BIG Token’s business plan. In connection with the Share Exchange, we entered into the following agreements:

Transition Services Agreement
 
On January 27, 2021, we entered into the Transition Services Agreement (“TSA”) with SRAX and BIG Token. Pursuant to the TSA, SRAX will provide us with certain transitional related services for such period of time as needed. Pursuant to the TSA, we pay SRAX, on a monthly basis, for certain services required to run the BIG Token business and platform, including but not limited to: (i) general and administrative services, (ii) finance and accounting services, (iii) technical operations, (iv) software services, (v) human resources services, (vi) use of facilities, (vii) and other services on an as needed basis if requested by the Company.
Master Separation Agreement
 
On January 27, 2021, we entered into a Master Separation Agreement (“MSA”) with SRAX. Pursuant to the MSA: (a) SRAX transferred all of the BIG Token assets required to run the BIG Token business including but not limited to (i) SRAXauto, SRAXcore, and SRAXshopper advertising tools and software, (ii) the BIG Token platform, (iii) associated BIG Token software and hardware; (iv) contracts associated with BIG Token, (v) intellectual property rights associated with BIG Token, (vi) bank accounts and certain inventory of BIG Token, and (vii) other assets required in the BIG Token business; and (b) certain liabilities and obligations related to the BIG Token business including but not limited to (v) liabilities related to the BIG Token business, (w) certain BIG Token accounts payable, (x) liabilities resulting from BIG Token contracts, (y) liabilities arising out of third-party claims against the BIG Token business and its assets, and (z) other liabilities that arise out of or result from the BIG Token business prior or subsequent to the closing of the Share Exchange. SRAX and the Company further agreed to take such steps necessary to facilitate the transfers, including continued efforts on each party if there is any delay in the assignment of any asset or liability.
 
The MSA also requires, for as long as SRAX is required to consolidate our results of operations and financial position, that we agree to: (i) prepare its annual and quarterly financial statements in accordance with the general accepted accounting principles (GAAP), (ii) undertake certain internal controls and procedures over financial reporting, (iii) provide our preliminary financial statements to SRAX for review, (iv) file all required quarterly and annual reports with the Commission on a timely basis, (v) provide SRAX with all annual budgets and periodic financial projections related to our operations on a consolidated basis, (vi) cooperate with SRAX on all public filings, press releases, and proxy statements filed or disseminated by SRAX as needed, and (vii) to use the same certified public accountant as SRAX.
 
Provided that SRAX owns at least fifty percent (50%) of the total voting power of our capital stock, without the prior consent of SRAX, we (i) will not restrict the ability of SRAX to sell, transfer or dispose of the Common Stock, (ii) will not breach certain contraction obligation to which SRAX is a party to and pursuant to which we receive a benefit pursuant to the TSA, and (iii) will not make any acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or assets in excess of $3,000,000 in the aggregate, or acquire shares, or interest in any company or partnership or loans in excess of $3,000,000 in the aggregate.
 
SRAX as our Controlling Stockholder
 
SRAX currently owns 149,562,566,584 shares of our Common Stock or approximately 95% of the voting power of the Company. For as long as SRAX continues to control more than 50% of our outstanding common stock, SRAX or its successor-in-interest will be able to direct the election of all the members of our board of directors. Similarly, SRAX will have the power to determine matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders without the consent of our other stockholders, will have the power to prevent a change in control of us and will have the power to take certain other actions that might be favorable to SRAX. In addition, the master separation agreement will provide that, as long as SRAX beneficially owns at least 50% of the total voting power of our outstanding capital stock entitled to vote in the election of our board of directors, we will not (without SRAX’s prior written consent) take certain actions, such as incurring additional indebtedness and acquiring businesses or assets or disposing of assets in excess of certain amounts. To preserve the tax-free treatment of the separation, the master separation agreement will include certain covenants and restrictions to ensure that, until immediately prior to the share exchange, SRAX will retain beneficial ownership of at least 80% of our carve-out voting power and 80% of each class of nonvoting capital stock, if any is outstanding. In addition, to preserve the tax-free treatment of the separation, we will agree in the tax matters agreement to restrictions, including restrictions that would be effective during the period following the distribution, that could limit our ability to pursue certain strategic transactions, equity issuances or repurchases or other transactions that we may believe to be in the best interests of our stockholders or that might increase the value of our business.
