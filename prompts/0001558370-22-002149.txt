Overview
Black Knight is a premier provider of integrated, innovative, mission-critical, high-performance software solutions, data and analytics to the U.S. mortgage and real estate markets. Our mission is to transform the markets we serve by delivering innovative solutions that are integrated across the homeownership lifecycle and that result in realized efficiencies, reduced risk and new opportunities for our clients to help them achieve greater levels of success. 
Innovation. Integration. Urgency. Whether developing new solutions, integrating new and acquired solutions or responding to our client’s requests – we do everything with urgency. It is why we are a trusted partner and leading provider of software solutions, data and analytics to the mortgage and real estate markets.
We believe businesses leverage our robust, integrated solutions across the entire homeownership lifecycle to help retain existing clients, gain new clients, mitigate risk and operate more efficiently. Our clients rely on our proven, comprehensive, scalable solutions and our unwavering commitment to delivering exceptional client support to achieve their strategic goals and better serve their customers.
We have a focused strategy of continuous innovation across our business supported by strategic acquisitions – and even more importantly, the integration of those innovations and acquisitions into our broader ecosystem. Our scale allows us to continually invest in our business, both to meet ever-changing industry requirements and to maintain our position as a leading provider of platforms for the mortgage and real estate markets.
Deep business and regulatory expertise and an unparalleled, holistic view of the markets we serve allow us the privilege of being a trusted advisor to our clients, who range from the nation’s largest lenders and mortgage servicers to institutional portfolio managers and government entities, to individual real estate agents and mortgage brokers. Clients leverage our software ecosystem across a range of real estate and housing finance verticals through multiple digital channels, using our offerings to drive more business, reduce risk and deliver a best-in-class customer experience, all while operating more efficiently and cost-effectively.
We have long-standing relationships with our clients – a majority of whom enter into long-term contracts that include multiple, integrated products embedded into mission-critical, client-side workflow and decision processes. This speaks to the confidence our clients, which include some of the largest financial institutions in the world, have in our solutions and our commitment to serve them. The contractual nature of our revenues and stickiness of our client relationships make our revenues both highly visible and recurring in nature. Our scale and integrated ecosystem of solutions drive significant operating leverage and cross-sell opportunities, enabling our clients to continually benefit from new and greater operational efficiencies while simultaneously allowing us to generate strong margins and cash flows.
Overview of the Markets We Serve
The Black Knight ecosystem stretches across four core “pillar” verticals: mortgage loan servicing, mortgage origination, capital markets and real estate; with our data and analytics flowing throughout and between the interconnected ecosystem of solutions. As we integrate our innovations and acquired technologies, we are committed to continually improving the end consumer experience, driving further efficiencies for our clients and helping them to win new customers and retain existing customers.
Mortgage Loan Servicing
Once mortgage loans have been originated, the loans are onboarded to a servicing platform for servicers to manage the loan as well as borrower and investor relationships. Mortgage servicers (and sub-servicers) operate within a highly regulated 

3



industry segment and are responsible for overseeing the ongoing loan maintenance, payment collection and application process, escrow management, investor management, tax and insurance payments, etc. for approximately 65 million active first and second lien mortgage loans and lines of credit in the U.S. Mortgage servicing typically creates a long-term relationship between the customer and the servicer; however, the customer’s servicing experience can have a direct impact on the servicer’s ability to retain loans in their portfolios when faced with refinance prepayment risk.
As an industry segment, the number of first lien mortgage loans being serviced in the U.S. remains relatively consistent even through housing and economic downturns. The number of second lien mortgage loans being serviced can fluctuate according to factors such as available, or “tappable,” equity levels, interest rates and individual portfolio appetite for such loans.
The table below summarizes market data for active first and second lien mortgage loans (in millions):

Second lien(2) | ​ | 12.2

​
In times of economic stress, a servicers’ ability to manage their workload is often tested by distressed mortgages, defaults, foreclosure and bankruptcy actions. In such periods, loss mitigation, default processing, bankruptcy and more must be contended with, along with an ever-changing slate of regulatory requirements. The mortgage default process is long and complex and involves multiple parties, a significant exchange of data and documentation and extensive regulatory requirements. Technology is essential in navigating this process efficiently and effectively.
The recent flood of COVID-19-related forbearance plans – and subsequent loss mitigation workouts – serves as a current example of fluctuating challenges the sector has faced and to which it has adapted via the expeditious deployment of software solutions, data and analytics.
Mortgage Origination
Mortgage lending is a complex process with multiple stages involving various parties, all of which are under increased regulatory scrutiny. Historically, many aspects of this process have been managed manually by lenders and other parties involved in the process, increasing the cost and complexity to originate a loan. The shift of consumer expectations and demands resulting from the pandemic have accelerated the pace of innovation and acceptance of digital technologies to meet the needs of market participants.
The U.S. mortgage origination market consists of both purchase and refinance loans, including cash-out refinances and – to a lesser extent – second lien, equity-centric products such as home equity lines of credit (“HELOCs”). Participants in this market range from the largest U.S. banks, nonbanks and credit-union lenders; to independent and mid-sized banks; to wholesale and correspondent lenders; to mortgage brokerages and even the individual mortgage broker.
The table below summarizes origination market estimates from the Mortgage Bankers Association (“MBA"), Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA") and Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("FHLMC") (in billions):

Capital Markets
The mortgage capital markets, both primary and secondary, play a critical role as providers of funding and liquidity that enable lenders to make home loans to borrowers. Mortgage loans are made possible in large part by market participants buying, selling or holding mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) and loan portfolios.
Preeminent among capital market participants are the government-sponsored enterprises (“GSEs”), the Federal National Mortgage Association (“FNMA” or “Fannie Mae”) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (“FHLMC” or “Freddie Mac”), who, along with the Government National Mortgage Association (“GNMA” or “Ginnie Mae”), the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) and the Veterans Administration (“VA”), provide back-stop guarantees to support market stability and help minimize systemic risk.
Market oversight is performed by federal and state regulators with the Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Federal Finance Housing Agency (“FHFA”), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (“OCC”) and the Consumer Financial Protection Board (“CFPB”) all playing major roles in ensuring market transparency, financial institution safety and soundness and consumer protection.
The informed investment in and trading of mortgage loans and MBS is dependent upon reliable, quality data – at both the pool and loan level – plus robust analytics and the tools to use them effectively. An incredible amount of information gathering and assessing goes into making these investment decisions. Dealing with pools or portfolios of real estate or mortgage-related assets requires even more information. Loan-level mortgage performance, real estate price trends and credit-risk data are valuable and necessary insights needed by capital market participants to make informed decisions.
In the age of “big data,” this level of detailed information equates to many terabytes of data points, which can be an overwhelming amount of data to shift through and analyze without the right tools and solutions; however, that data can provide critical insights for those who can effectively decipher it.

Real Estate
The consumer journey to homeownership starts with identifying a property to purchase. The marketing, sales and purchase of real estate in the U.S. involves many participants. Black Knight supports all participants in this process with technology to increase efficiencies, create new opportunities, manage complex workflows and help improve margins for all involved.
Needs exist for digital workflow, seamless data transfer between multiple sources and parties, and marketing and communication tools at the agent, broker and multiple listing service (“MLS”) levels.
Market Trends
Market trends that have spurred lenders and servicers to seek software, data and analytics solutions are as follows:
Integral role of technology in the U.S. mortgage market. As consumer expectations help drive a more digital homebuying process, lenders and servicers have become increasingly focused on automation, workflow management and the overall customer experience. Operating more efficiently has gone beyond a business optimization goal and become critical to maintaining a competitive edge. With growing frequency, new and important industry-specific AI applications, robotic process automation and adaptive learning are being developed and deployed, producing significant benefits along the real estate and mortgage continuum.
For market participants to effectively manage the complex and dynamic nature of the U.S. housing market, they need technology providers who are nimble but scalable, possess deep industry knowledge and expertise and the financial resources to make necessary ongoing investments in innovation to support lenders, servicers and other market participants. Industry expertise paired with technological innovation and market penetration is key to continued digital transformation of the mortgage industry, as well as realization of a fully digital, end-to-end real estate transaction.
Heightened demand for enhanced transparency and analytic insight. As the U.S. mortgage market works to continue minimizing risk while maximizing opportunities in lending, servicing and capital markets, solutions with integrated data and analytics enhance and inform the decision-making process. Industry participants rely on large comprehensive third-party databases coupled with enhanced analytics to achieve these goals.
As conditions can shift rapidly, sometimes daily, market participants are eager for more timely data and insights to help them plan proactively and react nimbly to these changes. We have seen our clients embrace a shift to “near real-time” daily market data around key metrics, cognizant of the urgency current market conditions require.
Regulatory changes and oversight. The U.S. mortgage industry is subject to a particularly high level of governmental oversight and a correspondingly large number of regulatory requirements. The complexity of these guidelines increases over time as federal and state governments enact and change various new laws, rules and regulations. We expect this trend to continue as additional governmental programs and regulations have been enacted to address the economic concerns resulting from the pandemic, and our clients have had to adapt their systems and processes in record time to the shifting landscape.
It is our experience that lenders, servicers and other market participants have a strong focus on minimizing compliance risk and are looking for solutions that can systematically assist them in meeting applicable regulatory requirements. In addition, our clients and their regulators have elevated their focus on privacy and data security in light of an increased level of cybersecurity incidents. We expect the industry focus on privacy and data security to continue to increase.
Lenders increasingly focused on core operations. We believe lenders will become more focused on their core operations and customers as refinance origination volumes decline due to a rising interest rate environment. In an effort to reduce origination costs, we believe lenders are increasingly shifting from in-house solutions to third-party solutions that provide a more comprehensive and efficient solution. Lenders require these providers to deliver best-in-class solutions and deep domain expertise and to assist them in maintaining regulatory compliance.

Solutions for the Markets We Serve
Our business is organized into two segments: Software Solutions and Data and Analytics. Together they represent an integrated ecosystem that spans the entirety of the real estate and mortgage continuum, from homebuying and selling to loan origination, through loan servicing and capital markets and back again.
The Black Knight ecosystem lets clients access a comprehensive, integrated software and workflow management solution set via multiple segment-specific digital channels. Enhanced by massive mortgage-specific datasets and robust proprietary analytics, our ecosystem helps our clients achieve greater levels of success from a trusted provider that continually delivers innovative technologies across our ecosystem.

Software Solutions
Our Software Solutions segment includes proven and trusted platforms that facilitate, automate and enhance many mission-critical business processes across the real estate and mortgage continuum. Our offerings help clients in this segment – primarily mortgage lenders, servicers and investors – reduce costs, improve operations and provide an exceptional customer experience. Our software solutions are developed to meet the current and future needs of the markets we serve. In developing and delivering our products and solutions, we leverage any combination of private cloud, public cloud, application programming interfaces (“APIs”) and a host of other technology-forward approaches to best meet the needs of our vast and strong client base. 
Servicing Software Solutions
Servicing is where the success or failure of the long-term customer relationship is truly determined.
MSP® is a SaaS solution that supports first lien mortgages, as well as home equity loans and lines of credit, on a single platform. This complete, scalable, end-to-end system is used by financial institutions to manage all servicing processes, including loan setup and maintenance, escrow administration, investor reporting, regulatory requirements and more. MSP® helps servicers increase efficiency, reduce operating costs and improve risk mitigation for approximately 36 million active loans currently serviced on the system.
As a result of our leadership, combined with our extensive knowledge of the mortgage industry and technology, we are uniquely positioned to drive innovation in this space and bring the digital revolution to mortgage servicing for both borrowers and servicers alike. While we relentlessly pursue the enhancement of the consumer experience throughout the real estate and mortgage continuum, we are equally focused on innovating on the back end for servicers as well. 
MSP® serves as the core system of record and is enhanced with innovative digital solutions, all of which were developed using the most appropriate, forward-leaning technologies and are seamlessly integrated into the system of record. Servicing DigitalSM has seen tremendous adoption since its launch in 2018, with roughly three-quarters of MSP® clients now offering the white-labeled, consumer facing application to their customers.

Servicing DigitalSM is an interactive, user-friendly web and mobile solution for consumers that provides easy access to customized, timely information about their mortgages. This powerful application supports deeper customer relationships for our clients and engagement by enabling their customers to make mortgage payments and explore opportunities for refinancing and more – all from the convenience of the web or a mobile device. By providing value-added services and information to borrowers, Servicing DigitalSM helps improve customer retention and serves as a direct communication channel between servicer and borrower.
Servicing DigitalSM is integrated with Black Knight’s Customer Service solution, which allows our clients’ customer service representatives to have access to the same information and layout a customer sees to better facilitate successful interactions and outcomes, which is key to increasing borrower retention.
Black Knight also offers an advanced Loss MitigationSM solution to facilitate more efficient loss mitigation processes. This feature-rich, web-based solution supports industry-standard retention and liquidation workouts to streamline the loss mitigation process and reduce risk. It is also available to consumers through Servicing DigitalSM and uses advanced rules and logic to guide users through processes step-by-step, including validation points throughout the workflow, to reduce missed steps and overlooked information. When loans move through the loss-mitigation process and become non-performing loans, Black Knight’s suite of innovative default servicing solutions help servicers reduce cycle times, decrease operating costs and improve efficiencies throughout the bankruptcy, foreclosure and claims stages.
Origination Software Solutions
Our Empower® loan origination system (“LOS”) was developed to be hosted in a public or private cloud or on premise in our secure data centers, based on client preference. The platform’s advanced automation capabilities, lights-out processing and seamless integrations with other Black Knight and third-party services help fulfill, streamline and improve upon the many pieces of the origination process. Integrated pipeline analytics, AI-powered underwriter efficiency tools, fee services, settlement services fulfillment, an advanced eClosing platform and more all combine to create a frictionless process that benefits both borrower and lender alike. In recognition of the dynamic nature of modern mortgage markets, Empower® offers maximum flexibility: giving lenders the ability to originate first lien mortgages, second lien equity loans and HELOCs on a single, unified platform.
Our Borrower Digital solution enables lenders to offer our AI-enhanced digital point of sale to walk their loan applicants through a friendly and intuitive prequalification/qualification Q&A, with seamless data transfer to lender systems. Customer engagement is active, immediate and targeted, and presents a smooth front-end to a process that will carry the loan applicant – and a single source/repository of their data – all the way through to closing and beyond. We also drive the full origination and underwriting workflow for lenders of all sizes via our Empower® LOS.
Additionally, Black Knight’s digital loan officer technology makes the day-to-day lives of loan officers more productive through vastly simplified workflows while also helping them provide an exceptional level of service to loan applicants. With the same anytime, anywhere convenience provided by all of our consumer-facing digital products, Loan Officer Digital facilitates seamless interaction between the loan officer and loan applicant throughout the entire process, from application to close. With the loan applicant engaged via the Borrower Digital interface, Loan Officer Digital enables loan officers to remain connected with their customers, providing timely updates and assistance when needed. Again, all data is captured and can be shared with our Empower® LOS.
After loan approval, loan applicants can view their loan status, review their closing package and eSign documents using our Expedite® Close solution. Loan applicants can also leverage our DocVerify remote online notarization solution, making fully digital closings possible where legally permissible, with all activity tracked and logged for audit purposes.
For clients using both Empower® and MSP®, onboarding funded loans to the servicing system is seamless and instantaneous.
Recent trends show that consumers have been turning to mortgage brokers more often than before. Our LoanCatcherSM cloud-based LOS, designed specifically for the needs of brokers, is both innovative and easy-to-use. It gives brokers affordable 

8



access to a robust software solution, integrated with the data and customer support solutions they need to provide exceptional levels of service to their customers. 
In support of our mantra of integration - LoanCatcherSM is integrated with our LoanSifter PPE – also designed to meet the very specific needs of the broker community by providing access to hundreds of investors and thousands of loan products. All of this combined with system-agnostic delivery to whatever LOS their wholesale lender partners are using provides brokers with a truly end-to-end solution to manage and grow their businesses.
Data and Analytics
Our Data and Analytics segment is comprised of our extensive data offerings, proven credit and prepayment models, custom and proprietary analytics, valuation, title and MLS solutions and much more. In addition, the integration of data and insights from solutions in this segment informs, supports and enhances our other software solutions to help lenders and servicers make more informed decisions, improve performance, identify and predict risk and generate more qualified leads. 
We have aggregated one of the largest residential real estate data sets available. This data set is derived from both proprietary and public record sources. From nationwide MLS listings to our industry-leading McDashSM loan-level mortgage loan performance data, to public property records covering more than 99.9% of the U.S. population, Black Knight’s datasets are indispensable for those working with housing assets.
Leveraging this data – subject to any applicable restrictions – alongside our long history and deep understanding of the housing market, we have created detailed real estate data solutions that assist in portfolio management, valuations, property records, lead generation and improved risk analysis for all aspects of servicing, origination, default and capital markets. In addition, we deliver data and analytics to clients in real estate, title insurance, MLS and other verticals that rely on property data-centric solutions to make informed decisions and run their businesses.
We also offer a highly accurate behavioral model built on our datasets and other third-party sources that forecasts prepayments, default, delinquencies and losses on residential mortgage loans and securities. Used for portfolio analysis, our AFTSM solution can serve as a powerful risk mitigation tool as well as a key component of any data-driven retention efforts.
Accurate valuations are critical to any real-estate transaction. Our automated valuation models (“AVMs”) are built on the foundation of our property data, proprietary information, proven methodologies and advanced user and performance testing and deliver exceptionally reliable automated property valuations. 
To better understand the housing market, we also leverage MLS and property data to provide near-real-time daily data views of the housing market, looking at home prices, inventory levels, days on market and other key indicators at the state, core based statistical areas and zip code levels.
We also provide data solutions that enable our clients to analyze big data sets through the synergistic convenience of a single data science workspace. Our cloud-based enterprise data and analytics solution, RAPSM, is an interactive data science platform that allows clients to quickly aggregate data from our extensive mortgage and housing data marketplace with their own data sources to execute both custom and proprietary queries. 
Our real estate focused clients leverage our market-leading software solution for regional MLS associations to manage property listings. The platform also enables membership management, provides tools for collaboration with loan officers and other affiliates and marketing tools to effectively meet dynamic market challenges.
Focus on Value-Driven Innovation
The value our clients place on innovation can be seen in the adoption rates of the next-gen products we have delivered. When developing and delivering our products, we leverage a combination of private cloud, public cloud, APIs and a host of other technology-forward options that allow us to deliver innovative solutions to market quickly in response to address our client’s biggest challenges.

Our solutions are designed to be scalable, secure, flexible, standards-based and web-connected for easy use. Further, we have a proven history of bringing solutions to market quickly due to investments we have made in integrating and streamlining our software and development processes.
Our Competitive Strengths
We believe our competitive strengths include the following:
Market leadership with comprehensive and integrated solutions. We are a leading provider of comprehensive and integrated solutions to the markets we serve. This leadership position is the result of strong client relationships, our knowledgeable employees who are focused on delivering superior solutions and support and delivering innovative solutions. Our innovations have propelled the industry forward over many years.
We have used this insight to develop a comprehensive, integrated ecosystem of proprietary software, data and analytics solutions to automate many of mortgage and real estate markets’ mission-critical business processes. These integrated solutions reduce manual processes, help improve organizational compliance and mitigate risk, and ultimately deliver significant cost savings to our clients.
Broad and deep client relationships with significant recurring revenues. We have long-standing, sticky relationships with our largest clients. We frequently enter long-term contracts with our software solutions clients that contain a base subscription fee with additional fees that are activity-based. Our products are typically embedded within our clients’ mission-critical workflow and decision-making processes across various parts of their organizations.
Extensive data assets and analytics capabilities. We develop and maintain large, accurate and comprehensive data sets on the real estate and mortgage industries that we believe are competitively differentiated. Our unique data sets provide a combination of public and proprietary data, and each of our data records features many attributes. Our data scientists bring comprehensive analytical capabilities to bear against these data sets, subject to any applicable use restrictions, to create highly customized reports. These reports include models of customer behavior for originators and servicers, portfolio analytics for capital markets and government agencies and proprietary market insights for real estate agencies. As mentioned, our data and analytics capabilities are also embedded into our software solutions and workflow products to provide actionable insights.
Scalable and cost-effective operating model. Our market leadership, hosted software solutions and large client base have allowed us to develop a highly attractive and scalable operating model that provides us with significant benefits. Our scale and operating leverage allow us to add clients to our existing platforms with limited incremental cost. As a result, our operating model drives attractive margins and generates significant cash flow. Also, by leveraging our scale and leading market position, we can make cost-effective investments in our software solutions to assist with complex regulatory and compliance requirements, which we believe increases our value proposition to clients.
Our Strategy
Our comprehensive integrated solutions ecosystem; unique, robust data and analytic capabilities; differentiated business model; broad and deep client relationships; and other competitive strengths put us in a very strong position to pursue multiple avenues for growth opportunities. We intend to continue to expand and grow our business through the following key strategies:
Win new clients. We intend to attract new clients by demonstrating the value proposition provided by our software and comprehensive solutions offering. In addition to top tier mortgage loan originators and servicers, where we have had and continue to have success, we believe there continues to be a significant opportunity to penetrate the mid-tier mortgage loan originators and servicers, as well as mortgage broker, markets. We believe these institutions can benefit from our proven solutions suite to address complex regulatory requirements and compete more effectively in the evolving mortgage loan market. We intend to continue to pursue all of these channels and benefit from the low incremental cost of adding new clients to our scalable applications and infrastructure.
Cross-sell existing products. The Black Knight ecosystem offers a wide variety of opportunities for existing clients to reap further benefits when they increase their use of our solutions across the real estate and mortgage continuum due to the 

10



integrations and seamless data sharing. It therefore also represents a substantial opportunity for growth as we seek to capitalize on familiarity and proven benefits. We intend to broaden and deepen existing client relationships through cross sales of solutions, data and analytics that reveal opportunity for client-side improvement of one form or another. We aim to help our clients see the true benefit of our fully integrated solutions ecosystem and the compound value of leveraging multiple solutions simultaneously. Helping our clients better focus on their core businesses and customers will put us in a better position to expand those existing relationships while adding value.
Solution development and innovation. Our long-term vision is to continue to lead through innovation and to solidify our role as the clear leader in providing software, data and analytics to the mortgage and real estate markets. We intend to continue to innovate with urgency and integrate new solutions with our platforms in ways that bring the most value to our clients and their customers. We have a strong track record of introducing and developing new solutions that are tailored to specific industry trends and enhance our clients’ core operating functions. By working in partnership with key clients, we have been able to develop and market new and advanced solutions that meet the evolving demands of the mortgage and consumer loan, real estate and capital markets verticals. In addition, we will continue to develop and leverage insights from our large public and proprietary data assets to further improve our client value proposition.
Selectively pursue strategic acquisitions. The core focus of our strategy is to grow organically. However, we may selectively evaluate strategic acquisition opportunities that would allow us to expand our footprint, broaden our client base and deepen our product and service offerings. We believe there are meaningful synergies that result from acquiring companies that provide best-in-class single point solutions. Integrating and cross selling these point solutions into our broader client base and integrating acquisitions into our efficient operating environment would potentially result in revenues and cost synergies. Additionally, new directions for product development often materialize when acquired companies are integrated into the wider ecosystem.
Our Clients
We provide solutions to financial institutions, mortgage lenders and servicers, mortgage brokers, investors, attorneys, trustees and real estate professionals.
The U.S. mortgage loan industry is concentrated among the top 25 institutions, and our most significant and long-term relationships tend to follow the industry landscape. The number of solutions being used by each client in this category continues to grow, as the compounded value of multiple Black Knight products becomes clearer over time. Because of the depth of these relationships, we derive a significant portion of our revenues from our largest clients.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, one of our clients accounted for approximately 10% of our Data and Analytics segment revenues. No client accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.
For the year ended December 31, 2021, our five largest clients accounted for approximately 26% of our consolidated revenues and approximately 28% of our Software Solutions segment revenues. However, the revenues in each case are spread across a range of services and are subject to multiple, separate contracts. Although the diversity of the services we provide to each of these clients reduces the risk that we would lose all of the revenues associated with any of these clients, a significant deterioration in our relationships with or the loss of any one or more of these clients could have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition. See Item 1A. Risk Factors of Part I of this Report.
Sales and Marketing
Our sales and marketing efforts are focused on generating new leads to both securing new clients in our target markets, as well as cross sell the integrated Black Knight solutions ecosystem to existing clients.
Regardless of the market we are serving, our sales and marketing strategy remains the same: communicate how our solutions address the challenges facing a specific market and deliver those messages where the companies we serve are engaging. We establish relationships, deliver proven solutions and continually build trust. Our experienced sales personnel are subject matter experts in our services, the needs of our clients and the markets we serve.

11



We are able to effectively communicate the value of the Black Knight ecosystem by developing and delivering solutions that move the needle by helping our clients achieve greater levels of success. We know that references from colleagues in the industry are one of the top reasons a provider is selected, so we remain committed to delivering powerful solutions that cultivate those references.
Our relationships with so many different companies across the real estate and mortgage sectors provide us with a unique opportunity to gain insight into trends and challenges facing the industry. We couple that with thoughtful analysis of our vast data assets to develop solutions and provide industry insights others cannot. We are also focused on sharing that thought leadership with our clients, the media, the public and our entire industry.
To understand what will help our various and disparate market segments succeed, we also conduct market research through conversations with clients and prospects, market surveys, industry reports and discussions with other industry leaders. Likewise, we also host client user groups and participate in user forums to understand the needs and concerns of the everyday users of our solutions.
We deliver our messages where the companies we serve are congregating – through tradeshows, events, publications, digital channels, etc. – and engage them in conversations that highlight the many differentiators/competitive advantages we provide through our continual innovations. We engage with existing clients on a regular basis and continually focus on engaging with prospective clients. Given the broad range of solutions we offer, we have significant opportunity to expand our sales to our existing client base through cross-selling efforts.
We have a core team of account managers who cross-sell solutions to existing clients at the top-tier and mid-tier U.S. mortgage loan originators and servicers, as well as a number of other financial institutions, investors and real estate professionals. We engage in strategic account reviews, during which our executives share their knowledge of clients and the market to determine the best sales approach on a client-by-client basis. As a result, we believe we have created an effective cross-selling culture within our organization.
Research and Development
Our research and development activities are core to our corporate mission of transforming the industry through innovation. As such, they relate to the design, development, integration and enhancement of the software applications that make up the Black Knight ecosystem. We expect to continue our practice of investing an appropriate level of resources to maintain, enhance and extend the functionality of our existing proprietary systems and software applications; to develop new and innovative systems and software applications in response to the needs of our clients as well as market and regulatory conditions and to enhance the capabilities of the ecosystem infrastructure. We work with our clients to determine the appropriate timing and approach to introducing technology or infrastructure changes to our applications and services.
Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
We rely on a combination of contractual restrictions, internal security practices and copyright and trade secret laws to establish and protect our software, technology, data and expertise. Further, we have developed strong brand recognition, which has helped us accumulate goodwill in the marketplace, and we rely on the above to protect our rights in that area. We intend to continue our policy of taking all measures we deem necessary to protect our copyright, trade secret and trademark rights.
Competition
The multiple business verticals in which we engage are highly competitive. We believe that compounded benefits of our integrated ecosystem of software solutions represent a value proposition that is strong and wholly unique to Black Knight. Our economies of scale in the mortgage loan origination and servicing markets also provide us with a distinct competitive advantage in each of these categories. Based on our knowledge of the industry and competitors, we believe that no single competitor is capable of delivering the depth and breadth of solutions we are able to offer.

Competitive factors in processing businesses include the quality of the technology-based application or service, application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, ability of the provider to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services and pricing. 
Software Solutions. Our Software Solutions segment competes with a) our clients’ internal technology departments and b) other providers of similar systems, such as Intercontinental Exchange’s Mortgage Technology segment and Sagent Lending Technologies. Competitive factors include the quality of the technology-based application or service, application features and functions, ease of delivery and integration, ability of the provider to maintain, enhance and support the applications or services and pricing. We believe that our ability to deliver proven solutions, integrated software solutions, adoption rate of our solutions and the economies of scale we offer in the mortgage loan processing business provide us with a competitive advantage in each of these categories.
Data and Analytics. In our Data and Analytics segment, we compete primarily with CoreLogic and in-house capabilities and certain niche providers. We compete based on the breadth and depth of our data; the exclusive nature of some of our key data sets; robust proprietary analytics and the capabilities to produce highly customized reports. We believe that the quality of the data we offer is distinguished by the broad range of our data sources, including non-public sources; the volume of records we maintain; our ability to integrate our data and analytics across the Black Knight ecosystem; and the ability to leverage our market leading position in the mortgage loan origination and servicing industries.
Government Regulations
Various aspects of our businesses are subject to federal and state regulations. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could result in restrictions on our ability to provide certain services, as well as the possible imposition of civil fines and criminal penalties.
As a provider of electronic data processing to financial institutions, such as banks and credit unions, we are subject to regulatory oversight and examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council ("FFIEC"), an interagency body of the Federal Reserve Board ("FRB"), the CFPB, the OCC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC") and various other federal and state regulatory authorities. We also may be subject to possible review by state agencies that regulate banks in each state in which we conduct our electronic processing activities.
Our financial institution clients are required to comply with various privacy laws and regulations under state and federal law, including the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. These laws and regulations place restrictions on the use of non-public personal information. All financial institutions must disclose detailed privacy policies to their customers and offer them the opportunity to direct the financial institution not to share information with third parties. The regulations, however, permit financial institutions to share information with non-affiliated parties who perform services for the financial institutions. As a provider of services to financial institutions, we are required to comply with the same privacy regulations and are generally bound by the same limitations on disclosure of the information received from our clients as those that apply to the financial institutions themselves.
Increased scrutiny of all parties involved in the mortgage loan industry by governmental authorities has included federal and state government review of all aspects of the mortgage lending business, including an increased legislative and regulatory focus on consumer protection practices. Future legislative or regulatory changes are difficult to predict and new laws or regulations that may be implemented by the CFPB or other regulatory bodies may require us to change our business practices or cause us to incur increased costs to comply.
Many consumer advocates, privacy advocates and government regulators believe that existing laws and regulations do not adequately protect privacy or ensure the accuracy of consumer-related data. As a result, they have implemented or are seeking to implement further restrictions, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA"), the California Privacy Rights Act ("CPRA"), the New York Department of Financial Services Cybersecurity Requirements for Financial Services Companies ("NY DFS Cybersecurity Regulation") and the Vermont Act Relating to Data Brokers and Consumer Protection ("Vermont Data Broker Law"), on the acquisition, dissemination or commercial use of personal information within the public and private sectors and are also contemplating requirements relative to data accuracy and the ability of consumers to opt to have their personal data removed from databases such as ours. We are also subject to these state regulations.

Information Technology and Security
We are highly dependent on information technology networks and systems to securely process, transmit and store electronic information. Attacks on information technology systems continue to grow in frequency, complexity and sophistication and we expect this trend to continue. Such attacks have become a point of focus for individuals, businesses and governmental entities. These attacks can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, consumer data and proprietary business information. Refer to the "Risks Related to Information Security" section of Item 1A. Risk Factors for additional information.
We protect our data assets by providing centralized security solutions and enforcing a defense-in-depth, centralized model that includes deterring, detecting, preventing, analyzing and containing security incidents. We focus on all areas of cybersecurity including threat and vulnerability management, security monitoring, identity and access management, phishing awareness, risk oversight, third-party risk management, disaster recovery and continuity management. We make strategic investments in information security to protect our clients and our information systems. This includes both capital expenditures and operating expenses for hardware, software, personnel and consulting services.
As our primary solutions and services evolve, we apply a comprehensive approach to the mitigation of identified security risks. We have established policies, including those related to privacy, information security and cybersecurity, and we employ a broad and diversified set of risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques.

● | Enterprise Risk Management: We maintain a comprehensive Enterprise Risk Management ("ERM") program that provides the framework to align our risk appetite and strategy to enhance management of enterprise risks, including information security risks. Through our ERM program, we analyze risks inherent to our products, services and businesses, and develop appropriate plans to mitigate those risks. The executive-level Enterprise Risk and Compliance Committee convenes regularly to discuss matters relating to our enterprise risk position and risk management, such as third-party risk, phishing, security incident response, application resiliency, environmental, social and governance responsibilities and external and internal vulnerabilities. The Risk Committee of our Board of Directors oversees the ERM and Compliance programs through regular reports from our Chief Risk Officer, Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Compliance Officer, and reports on these matters to our board of directors.

● | Internal Audit: Our Internal Audit function provides independent and objective assurance services designed to improve the Company’s operations. Internal Audit focuses a significant portion of their time and resources to the audit of information technology and security. The Internal Audit department is established by the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, and it directly oversees its results and operations.

Human Capital Management
We power the markets we serve by delivering cutting-edge solutions. Our employees are a key factor of our success. Since March 2020, substantially all of our employees have been working from home. We are closely monitoring the facts and circumstances surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic, including the guidance and protocols published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control, the World Health Organization and country, state and local governments. Our most important priorities are the health and safety of our employees and helping the communities where we work and live. A return-to-office plan has been created, which outlines when and how we will begin to lift the actions put in place as part of our business continuity plans. The plan will be enacted at each location when the risk to re-open has been reduced to an acceptable level. In addition, we expanded our employee benefits and other online resources to enable employees to focus on their physical, emotional and social well-being.
We are passionate about giving our employees the tools to equip them for success in their careers, providing the health and wellness benefits needed for physical, mental and social well-being, and delivering on diversity and inclusion initiatives to let every employee know they are valued and respected.

We realize our individual differences are what strengthen us collectively. We are committed to supporting a culture that is representative of the unique values, opinions, cultures and needs of our employees, clients and communities. Through internal programs, including employee training and leadership development, affinity groups, comprehensive benefits and a hands-on leadership team, we support our employees throughout their career.
We strive to attract and retain the most talented employees in the industry by offering competitive compensation and investing in our employees’ physical, mental and social well-being to help them achieve goals inside and outside of the office.
As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 6,400 employees. None of our workforce is unionized. We have not experienced any work stoppages, and we consider our relations with employees to be good.
