           The following description of our business contains forward-looking statements relating to future events or our future financial or operating performance that involve risks and uncertainties, as set forth above under "Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements." Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of certain factors described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those set forth above in the Special Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements or in Section 1A under the heading "Risk Factors" or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Introduction
We are an online retailer and incubator of blockchain technology. Through our online retail business we offer a broad range of price-competitive brand name, non-brand name and closeout products, including furniture, home decor, bedding and bath, housewares, jewelry and watches, apparel and designer accessories, health and beauty products, electronics and computers, and sporting goods, among other products. We also sell hundreds of thousands of best seller and current run books, magazines, CDs, DVDs and video games (“BMMG”). We sell these products and services through our Internet websites located at www.overstock.com, www.o.co and www.o.biz (referred to collectively as the “Website”). Although our three websites are located at different domain addresses, the technology and equipment and processes supporting the Website and the process of order fulfillment described herein are the same for all three websites. 
In late 2014, we began working on initiatives to develop and advance blockchain technology, which we refer to collectively as Medici, and which includes our majority-owned subsidiary tØ.com, Inc. (formerly Medici, Inc.). As part of our Medici initiatives, we have formed a wholly-owned subsidiary Medici Ventures, Inc. and acquired a majority interest in a financial technology company and two related registered broker-dealers. We have also made minority investments in several blockchain technology companies. In 2015, we were the first public company to issue a private security using blockchain technology and in December 2016, as a successful demonstration of our technology, we issued publicly traded blockchain preferred shares of Overstock.com, Inc.
Our company, based near Salt Lake City, Utah, was founded in 1997. We launched our initial website in March 1999 and were re-incorporated in Delaware in 2002. As used herein, “Overstock,” “Overstock.com,”, “O.co,” “we,” “our” and similar terms include Overstock.com, Inc. and our majority-owned subsidiaries, unless the context indicates otherwise.
Our Business
In our retail business, we deal primarily in price-competitive, new and replenishable merchandise and use the Internet to aggregate both supply and demand to create an efficient marketplace for selling these products. We provide our customers an opportunity to conveniently shop for a broad range of price-competitive products. We continually add new, and sometimes limited, inventory to our Website in order to create an atmosphere that encourages customers to visit frequently and purchase products before our inventory sells out. We provide suppliers with access to a large customer base and convenient services for order fulfillment, customer service, returns handling, and other services. The merchandise offered on our Website is from a variety of sources including well-known, brand-name manufacturers. We have organized our retail business (sales of product offered through the Shopping Section of our Website) into two principal segments-a "direct" business and a "partner" business. We currently offer approximately 1.9 million non-BMMG products and approximately 742,000 BMMG products. Consumers and businesses are able to access and purchase our products 24 hours a day from the convenience of a computer, Internet-enabled mobile telephone or other Internet-enabled device. Our team of customer service representatives assists customers by telephone, instant online chat and e-mail. We also derive revenue from other businesses advertising products or services on our Website. Our sales are primarily to customers located in the United States. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 no single customer accounted for more than 1% of our total net revenue.
Retail direct business
Our direct business includes sales made to individual consumers and businesses from our owned inventory and that are fulfilled primarily from our warehouse in Salt Lake City, Utah. During the year ended December 31, 2016, approximately 6% of our order volume was generated through our direct business. Our warehouses primarily fulfill orders from our direct business, but also fulfill orders on behalf of our partners through our Supplier Oasis offering described below. Our warehouses generally ship between 2,000 and 5,000 packages per day and up to approximately 10,000 packages per day during peak periods.
Retail partner business
6

For our partner business, we sell merchandise from manufacturers, distributors and other suppliers ("partners") primarily through our Website. We are considered to be the primary obligor for the majority of these sales transactions and we record revenue from the majority of these sales transactions on a gross basis. Our use of the term "partner" does not mean that we have formed any legal partnerships with any of our partners. We currently have relationships with approximately 4,100 third parties who supply approximately 1.9 million non-BMMG products, as well as most of the BMMG products, on our Website. These third party partners generally perform the same fulfillment operations as our warehouses, such as order picking and shipping; however, we handle returns and customer service related to substantially all orders placed through our Website. Revenue generated from sales on our Shopping site from both the direct and partner businesses is recorded net of returns, coupons and other discounts.
Both direct and partner revenues are seasonal, with revenues historically being the highest in the fourth quarter, which ends December 31, reflecting higher consumer holiday spending. We anticipate this will continue for the foreseeable future. To the extent possible we maintain supplier relationships, and seek new supplier relationships, for both our direct and partner businesses, and also use our working capital, to ensure a continuous allotment of product offerings for our customers. Because a portion of our product offerings are closeout merchandise, some of our suppliers cannot supply products to us on a continuous basis.
Generally, we require verification of receipt of payment, or authorization from credit card or other payment vendors whose services we offer to our customers (such as PayPal), before we ship products to consumers or business purchasers. From time to time we grant credit to our business purchasers with normal credit terms (typically 30 days). For sales in our partner business, we generally receive payments from our customers before our payments to our suppliers are due.
Medici business
Our Medici business initiatives leverage the security, transparency and immutability of cryptographically protected, distributed ledgers, such as the Blockchain, and are focused on solving important problems, including financial transaction issues, particularly in the area of securities settlement. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Medici Ventures Inc., we hold minority investments in several technology companies which, at December 31, 2016, included Peer Nova, Bitt, IdentityMind and Factom, whose focus include commercial blockchain applications, digital currency solutions, Know Your Customer and Anti Money Laundering compliance, voting and land titling. Medici Ventures also holds a majority interest in tØ.com, Inc., which includes a financial technology company and two related registered broker-dealers.
As described further in Item 15 of Part IV, "Financial Statements"—Note 21. Business Segments, contained in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we determined our segments based on how we manage our business, which, in our view, consists primarily of our Retail and Medici businesses. As described above, our Retail business consists of our Direct and Partner reportable segments. We use gross profit as the measure to determine our reportable segments because there is not discrete financial information available below gross profit for our Direct and Partner segments. As a result, our Medici business is not significant as compared to our Direct and Partner segments and is included in Other. Our Other segment consists of Medici.
Other offerings
We offer additional products or services that may complement our primary offerings, but are not significant to our revenues. These include:

• | Worldstock Fair Trade, a store within our Website that offers handcrafted products made by artisans all over the world to help improve the lives of people in emerging economies;


• | Main Street Revolution, a store within our Website that features products from small businesses who offer their products using our national marketing and distribution channels;


• | Farmers Market, a tab within our Website where our customers, in certain locations, can order locally grown fresh produce and other food products;


• | Pet Adoptions, a free service and tab within our Website that leverages our technology to display pets available for adoption from shelters across the United States;


• | Insurance, a tab within our Website where our customers can shop for insurance from major carriers for both personal and business insurance policies; and


• | Supplier Oasis, a single integration point through which our partners can manage their products, inventory and sales channels, while tapping into our distribution network; and


• | our international business where we offer products to customers outside the United States using third party logistics providers.

Manufacturer, Supplier and Distribution Relationships
7

Generally, we do not enter into contracts with manufacturers or other suppliers that guarantee the availability of merchandise for a set duration. Our manufacturer and supplier relationships are based on historical experience with manufacturers and other suppliers and do not obligate or entitle us to receive merchandise on a long-term or short-term basis. In our direct business, we purchase the products from manufacturers or other suppliers using standard purchase orders. Generally, suppliers do not control the terms under which products are sold through our Website.
Products
Our Website Shopping section is organized into product and service lines or featured categories, including: Furniture, Rugs, Decor, Bed & Bath, Home Improvement, Kitchen, Outdoor, Jewelry, Watches, Women, Men, Kids & Baby, Worldstock, Main Street, Farmers Market, Pet Adoptions, o.info and Insurance. We frequently reorganize our departments and/or categories to better reflect our current product offerings.
For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, the percentages of sales contributed by similar classes of products were as follows:

Product Lines | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Home and garden(1) | | | | | 
Furniture | 34 | % | | 33 | % | 32 | %
Home decor | 22 | % | | 19 | % | 18 | %
Other | 23 | % | | 25 | % | 24 | %
Total home and garden | 79 | % | | 77 | % | 74 | %
Jewelry, watches, clothing and accessories | 10 | % | | 11 | % | 12 | %
BMMG, electronics and computers | 3 | % | | 3 | % | 4 | %
Other | 8 | % | | 9 | % | 10 | %
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

(1) Home and garden includes furniture, home decor, garden and patio, kitchen and dining, bedding, home improvement, housewares and other related products.
Sales and Marketing
We use a variety of methods to target our retail consumer audience, including online campaigns, such as advertising through keywords, product listing ads, display ads, search engines, affiliate marketing programs, social coupon websites, portals, banners, e-mail, direct mail and viral and social media campaigns. We also do brand advertising through television, radio, print ads, and event sponsorships.
Customer Service
We are committed to providing superior customer service. We staff our customer service department with dedicated in-house and outsourced professionals who respond to phone, instant online chat and e-mail inquiries on products, ordering, shipping status, returns and other areas of customer inquiry.
Technology
We use our internally developed Website and a combination of proprietary technologies and commercially available licensed technologies and solutions to support our retail operations. We use the services of multiple telecommunications companies to obtain connectivity to the Internet. Currently, our primary computer infrastructure is located in a co-location facility in Utah. We also have other data centers which we use for backups, redundancy, development, testing, disaster recovery, and our corporate systems infrastructure.
Competition
Internet retail is intensely competitive and has relatively low barriers to entry. We believe that competition in this industry is based predominantly on:

• | price;


• | product quality and assortment;


• | shopping convenience;


• | website organization and load speed;


• | order processing and fulfillment;


• | order delivery time;

8


• | customer service;


• | website functionality on mobile devices;


• | brand recognition; and


• | brand reputation.

We compete with other online retailers, traditional retailers and liquidation "brokers," some of which may specifically adopt our methods and target our customers. We currently or potentially compete with a variety of companies that can be divided into several broad categories:

• | online discount general retailers;


• | online private sale sites;


• | online specialty retailers;


• | liquidation e-tailers;


• | traditional general merchandise and specialty retailers and liquidators, many of which have a significant online presence; and


• | online retailers who are developing significant "brick and mortar" capabilities.

Many of our current and potential competitors have greater brand recognition, longer operating histories, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources than we do. Further, any of them may enter into strategic or commercial relationships with larger, more established and well-financed companies, including exclusive distribution arrangements with our vendors or service suppliers that could deny us access to key products or needed services, or acquisitions of our suppliers or service providers, having the same effect. Many of them do or could devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns and devote substantially more resources to their website and systems development than we do. Many have supply chain operations that decrease product shipping times to their customers, or have options for in-store product pick-up options or allow in-store returns and offer other delivery and returns options that we do not have. New technologies and the continued enhancement of existing technologies and developments in related areas, such as same-day product deliveries and the development of proprietary delivery systems, are also increasing competitive pressures on us. Our competitors include Amazon.com, Inc and Wayfair, Inc. We cannot ensure that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or address increased competitive pressures (see Item 1A—"Risk Factors").
Seasonality
Our retail business is affected by seasonality because of the holiday season, which historically has resulted in higher sales volume during our fourth quarter, which ends December 31. We recognized 29.2%, 29.0% and 31.4% of our annual revenue during the fourth quarter of 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.
Financial Information about Business Segments and Geographic Areas
See Item 15 of Part IV, "Financial Statements"—Note 21. Business Segments for information regarding our business segments and geographical areas.
Intellectual Property and Trade Secrets
We regard our domain names and other intellectual property as critical to our success. Included in our intellectual property is some of the financial technology we have developed as part of our Medici initiatives. We rely on a combination of laws and contractual restrictions with our employees, customers, suppliers, affiliates and others to establish and protect our proprietary rights, including the law pertaining to trade secrets. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for a third party to copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or trade secrets without authorization. In addition, we cannot ensure that others will not independently develop similar intellectual property. Although we have registered and are pursuing the registration of our key trademarks in the United States and some other countries, some of our trade names may not be eligible to receive registered trademark protection. In addition, effective trademark protection may not be available or we may not seek protection in every country in which we market or sell our products and services, including in the United States. Additionally, our efforts to protect our trade secrets may not succeed.
Third parties have in the past recruited and may in the future recruit our employees who have had access to our proprietary technologies, processes and operations. These recruiting efforts expose us to the risk that such employees and those hiring them will misappropriate and exploit our intellectual property and trade secrets.
Legal and Regulatory Matters
From time to time, we receive claims and become subject to regulatory investigations or actions, consumer protection, employment, intellectual property and other commercial litigation related to the conduct of our business. We also prosecute lawsuits to enforce our legal rights. Such litigation is costly and time consuming and can divert our management and key 
9

personnel from our business operations. The uncertainty of litigation increases these risks. In connection with such litigation, we may be subject to significant damages, associated costs, or equitable remedies relating to the operation of our business and the sale of products on our Website. Any such litigation may materially harm our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.
These and other types of claims could result in increased costs of doing business in the form of legal expenses, adverse judgments or settlements or require us to change our business practices in expensive and significant ways. In addition, litigation could result in interpretations of the law that may limit our current or future business, require us to change our business practices, or otherwise increase our costs.
Additional litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could materially harm our business (see Item 1A—"Risk Factors").
For further information, see the information set forth under Item 15 of Part IV, "Financial Statements"—Note 12. Commitments and Contingencies, Legal Proceedings, contained in the "Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements" of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Government Regulation
Our main business is subject to general business regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet, e-commerce and other services. Existing and future laws and regulations may result in increasing expense and may adversely affect our business. These regulations and laws may cover taxation, privacy, data protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, supply chain monitoring and transparency, mobile communications, electronic device certification, electronic waste, energy consumption, environmental regulation, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, consumer protection, information reporting requirements, the design and operation of websites, and the characteristics and quality of products and services. New state tax regulations in states where we do not now collect state and local taxes may subject us to the obligation to collect and remit state and local taxes, or subject us to additional state and local sales and income taxes, or to requirements intended to assist states with their tax collection efforts. New legislation or regulations, the application of laws and regulations from jurisdictions whose laws do not currently apply to our business or the application of existing laws and regulations to the Internet and commercial online services could result in significant additional taxes on our business. These taxes or tax collection obligations could have an adverse effect on us. Further, there is a possibility that we may be subject to significant fines or other payments for any past failures to comply with these requirements. In addition, it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, libel, and personal privacy apply to the Internet, e-commerce and digital content. Laws and regulations may diminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business. Certain of our services are subject to federal and state consumer protection laws, including laws protecting the privacy of consumer information and regulations prohibiting unfair and deceptive trade practices. In particular, under federal and state financial privacy laws and regulations, we must provide notice to consumers of our policies on sharing non-public information with third parties, advance notice of any changes to our policies and, with limited exceptions, we must give consumers the right to prevent sharing of their non-public personal information with unaffiliated third parties. Further, the growth and demand for online commerce could result in more stringent consumer protection laws that could impose additional compliance burdens on us. These consumer protection laws could result in substantial compliance costs.
In addition, the broker-dealers in which we hold a majority interest are subject to additional extensive regulatory requirements under federal and state laws and regulations and self-regulatory organization (“SRO”) rules. Broker-dealers are subject to regulation, examination and disciplinary action by the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators, as well as other governmental authorities and SROs with which they are registered or licensed or of which they are members. See Item 1A - “Risk Factors - Medici has acquired registered broker-dealers, which are subject to extensive regulation.”
Our efforts to expand our sales outside of the U.S. expose us to additional U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including but not limited to, laws and regulations relating to taxation, business licensing or certification requirements, advertising practices, online services, the use of cryptocurrency, the importation of specified or proscribed items, importation quotas, consumer protection, intellectual property rights, consumer and data protection, data transfer across borders, privacy, encryption, restrictions on pricing or discounts, and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable U.S. and foreign laws prohibiting corrupt payments to government officials and other third parties.
Employees
10

At December 31, 2016, we had approximately 1,800 full-time employees. We seasonally augment our workforce with temporary employees during our fourth quarter to handle increased workload in both our warehouse and customer service operations. We have never had a work stoppage, and none of our employees are represented by a labor union. We consider our employee relationships to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in our industry is intense, particularly for software engineers and other technical staff.
