Everi is a leading supplier of imaginative entertainment and trusted technology solutions for the casino and digital gaming industry. Everi’s mission is to transform the casino floor through innovative gaming and financial technology and loyalty solutions.

Everi reports its financial performance, and organizes and manages its operations, across the following two business segments: (i) Games; and (ii) FinTech. 
Everi Games provides gaming operators with gaming technology products and services, including: (i) gaming machines, primarily comprising Class II and Class III slot machines placed under participation or fixed-fee lease arrangements or sold to casino customers; (ii) providing and maintaining the central determinant systems for the video lottery terminals (“VLTs”) installed in the State of New York and similar technology in certain tribal jurisdictions; (iii) business-to-business (“B2B”) and business-to-consumer (“B2C”) digital online gaming activities.

For additional information on our segments and the revenues generated by our products and services see “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Results of Operations” and “Note 18 — Segment Information” included elsewhere in this Annual Report.
Impact of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) Pandemic
The COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, temporarily lowered equity market valuations, created significant volatility in the financial markets, increased unemployment levels, caused temporary, and in certain cases, closures of many businesses. The gaming industry was not immune to these factors as our casino customers closed their gaming establishments, and as a result, our operations experienced significant disruptions. At the immediate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were affected by various measures, including, but not limited to: the institution of social distancing and sheltering-in-place requirements in many states and communities, which significantly impacted demand for our products and services, and resulted in office closures, the furlough of a majority of our employees, the implementation of temporary base salary reductions for our employees and the implementation of a work-from-home policy. 
In connection with the uncertainty facing our customers as a result of COVID-19, we evaluated our business strategies in the second quarter of 2020 and implemented measures to reduce our ongoing operating costs. As a result of this evaluation, we permanently reduced our employee base, with most of the departures resulting from our furloughed employees, to accommodate the current and future operating needs of our customers and our business. 
During the second quarter of 2020, businesses began to adapt to social-distancing measures and various phases of reopening pursuant to government-mandated guidelines. As our gaming customers reopened, a number of their properties initially experienced an elevated level of activity as compared to what was originally anticipated. The revenues generated by this initial pent-up demand flattened to slightly below pre-COVID levels as more casinos reopened through the second quarter of 2020. Revenues improved further throughout the third and fourth quarter of 2020, though they remained below pre-COVID levels. With a majority of our gaming customers reopening properties by the end of September 2020 and our activity rates and results continuing to improve through the third and fourth quarter, we have, among other measures: (i) returned nearly all of our furloughed employees to work on primarily a work-from-home basis; (ii) reinstated base compensation to pre-COVID levels for the employee base; (iii) reversed nearly all compensation reductions for both our Executives and Directors; and (iv) fully paid down the outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit. 
It is unclear when and if customer volumes will return consistently to pre-COVID levels, if a resurgence of COVID-19 could result in the closure of casinos by federal, state, tribal or municipal governments, regulatory agencies, or by the casino operators themselves in an effort to contain the COVID-19 global pandemic or mitigate its impact and the impact of vaccines on these matters; however, we continue to monitor the impacts of COVID-19 and make adjustments to our business accordingly.
The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbates the risks disclosed in this Annual Report, including, but not limited to: our ability to comply with the terms of our indebtedness, our ability to generate revenues, earn profits and maintain adequate liquidity, our ability to service existing and attract new customers, maintain our overall competitiveness in the market, the potential for significant fluctuations in demand for our services, overall trends in the gaming industry impacting our business, as well as potential volatility in our stock price, among other consequences such as cybersecurity exposure.
For more information about the operational and financial impacts of COVID-19 on our results of operations and liquidity, refer to “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”
Our Products and Services 
Everi Games 
Our products and services include electronic gaming devices, such as Native American Class II offerings and other electronic bingo products, Class III slot machine offerings, VLTs, B2B and B2C digital online gaming activities, accounting and central determinant systems, and other back office systems. We conduct our Games segment business based on results generated from the following major revenue streams: (i) Gaming Operations; (ii) Gaming Equipment and Systems; and (iii) Gaming Other.
Gaming Operations
With respect to our Gaming operations revenue stream, we primarily provide: (i) leased gaming equipment, both Class II and Class III offerings, on a revenue participation or a daily fixed-fee basis, including standard games and hardware and premium games and hardware, inclusive of local-area progressive, wide-area progressive (“WAP”); (ii) accounting and central determinant systems; and (iii) digital online gaming activities. 
In connection with our leased gaming equipment, we retain ownership of the machines installed at customer facilities. We receive recurring revenue based on a percentage of the net win per day (cash-in less jackpots paid) generated by the leased gaming equipment or a daily fixed-fee based upon the number of gaming machines placed. We expect to continue to (i) increase our investment in research and development in order to innovate and introduce new gaming hardware and theme content; (ii) expand our offering of new standard and premium game hardware and theme content; and (iii) extend and expand our game placements into additional jurisdictions. From our historical focus on game placements in the Oklahoma tribal market, Everi Games has diversified its installed base in recent years with entry into additional commercial and tribal markets. As of December 31, 2020, approximately 9,291 units, or 59.0% of the total installed base, was outside of the Oklahoma tribal market. Additionally, Everi Games has grown its premium game installations, with approximately 6,478 units installed (representing approximately 41.1% of our total installed base as of December 31, 2020) since entering the premium category approximately eight years ago.
In connection with our WAP offering, machines placed under such arrangements fall into the premium leased gaming equipment category and we retain ownership of such machines. Currently spanning four product lines, our WAP is offered to customers on the Player Classic, Core HDX, Empire MPX, and Empire DCX cabinets. 
Gaming operations also include revenues generated under our arrangement to provide the New York State Gaming Commission with a central determinant, monitoring, and accounting system for the VLTs in operation at licensed State of New York gaming facilities. In November 2019, a new agreement between Everi Games and the New York State Gaming Commission was approved and became effective on January 1, 2020. Under this agreement, Everi Games will continue to provide and maintain the central determinant system for the New York Lottery through December 2029. As of December 31, 2020, there were approximately 17,000 VLTs connected to our central determinant system for the New York Lottery, of which approximately 9,400 VLTs were actively connected to this system as a result of the impact of COVID-19, in which the system can interface with, provide outcomes to and manage. Pursuant to our agreement with the New York State Gaming Commission, we receive a portion of the network-wide net win (generally, cash-in less prizes paid per day) in exchange for provision and maintenance of the central determinant system. We also provide the central determinant system technology to Native American tribes in other licensed jurisdictions, for which we receive a portion of the revenue generated from the VLTs that are connected to the system. 
In connection with our digital online gaming activities, Everi operates in the following two areas: (i) B2B; and (ii) B2C. Our B2B operations provide games to our business customers, including both regulated real money and social casinos, which offer the games to consumers on their apps. Everi has developed its own remote gaming server (“RGS”) that leverages our extensive library of land-based content to offer a selection of games available to be connected online through our RGS. This RGS library contains casino-themed games available for real money gaming (“RMG”) that are offered to regulated online casinos that operate in the RMG regulated markets, and social games that are offered to our business customers that operate play-for-fun social casinos on their mobile apps and web sites. We enter into revenue share agreements with these online business customers. Our B2C operations offer games directly to consumers for play with virtual currency. The B2C games are limited to free-to-play apps, which are also referred to as social or play for fun casinos. The games are offered on our two Social Casino apps – Super Jackpot Slots and High Rollin’ Vegas Slots — through connectivity on mobile platforms, such as the Apple App Store for Apple devices and the Google Play Store for Android devices, as well as on Facebook and web-based platforms. The Company earns revenues by providing the virtual currency to the consumers, or players, whenever the consumers purchase additional virtual currency on our mobile and web apps. 
Gaming Equipment and Systems
Gaming equipment and systems revenues are derived from the sale of some combination of: (i) gaming equipment and player terminals; (ii) game content; (iii) license fees; and (iv) ancillary equipment, such as signage and lighting packages.
Gaming Other
Gaming other revenues are generated from fees paid by casino customers that participate in our TournEvent of Champions® national slot tournament. Casinos, in partnership with Everi, host local and regional slot tournaments throughout the year, for which winners of these events participate in a national tournament that results in the determination of an ultimate champion. We did not conduct these tournaments throughout the year ended December 31, 2020 as a direct result of the circumstances surrounding the global pandemic.
Games Products
Our Games products include mechanical and video reel games in both Class II and Class III configurations and are offered in a variety of differentiated cabinets:
Classic Mechanical Reel Games. Our full range of classic mechanical reel games provides players with a traditional, high denomination slot gaming experience. These games leverage our long-standing experience in building enduring brands, such as Black Diamond® and Wild Wild Gems®, and feature a unique perspective on traditional slot games with eye-catching features, such as Cash Machine™, a three-reel, one-line mechanical slot game that offers “win what you see” gameplay. Our premium mechanical linked products include both original and licensed game themes such as Zoltar 5X Pay™ and Zoltar Triple Jackpot™. Our premium linked products include merchandising options for casino operators that can include overhead signs, backlit plexiglass, pod-fillers, wedge kits, and more. Our mechanical reel games are consistently ranked among the best-performing units in industry reports. 
Video Reel Games. We offer a growing range of dual-screen and portrait single-screen video reel games that provide entertaining slot gaming experience. Below is a list of our video gaming cabinets and select games on these platforms.
•Empire 5527. The Empire 5527 cabinet features a portrait-oriented 55-inch upper display and a landscape-oriented 27-inch lower display, game-controlled lighting on the base-game display, and a high-quality sound system. The cabinet is also designed to occupy less space on the casino floor, allowing for more flexible configurations. The Empire 5527 includes the high-performing licensed game Smokin’ Hot Stuff Wicked Wheel®. We expanded the Empire 5527 into a banked product called Empire Arena™ that offers flexibility in banking configurations for casino operators, with three units and up to a total of eight units. The product is currently supported by two successful game themes – Discovery Channel’s Shark Week®, which launched in October 2018, and The Vault™, which launched in October 2019. These titles offer base games as well as competitive community-style bank-wide bonus features.
•Empire Flex. The Empire Flex cabinet, released in December 2019, is the latest video cabinet that is part of the Empire Cabinet Series.

•Core HDX. The Core HDX cabinet features dual widescreen 23-inch monitors with 1080p HD capability, integrated touchscreens, and premium three-way sound system. To deepen our library of games on the Core HDX cabinet, we have transitioned several of our best performing high-denomination three-reel mechanical games to this cabinet. We are also supporting lower-denomination video games, with titles such as High Voltage Jackpot Jolt™ and Jackpot Respin Ice on Fire®. 
•The Texan HDX®. The Texan HDX® is an 8-foot tall cabinet with dual 42-inch HD video screens that features a two-person bench seat, integrated touch screens, and a premium three-way sound system. The cabinet is designed to showcase the Everi standard video library in an oversized format. Cash Machine™ and Dragon Zap™ were recently made available for play on The Texan HDX® cabinet. 
TournEvent®. Our slot tournament terminals and system allow gaming operators to switch from in-revenue gaming to out-of-revenue tournaments and to design and build a variety of flexible tournament formats, such as individual or team tournament play, session or round winner advancement, and cumulative or maximum scoring, including providing bonus opportunities in tournament games that improve scores or automatically move a player to first place. We introduced TournEvent® 6.0 in late 2019 with several new system enhancements, including the TournEvent Now™ feature that enables operators to offer on-the-fly tournaments via their player tracking system. Casino operators can move large numbers of players through the first round of tournaments on the player’s time, at the player’s pace, and then host a traditional final round for top-scoring players.
Everi FinTech
Our FinTech products and services include solutions that we offer to gaming establishments to provide their patrons with cash access and deposit-based services supporting digital, cashless and physical cash options across mobile, assisted and self-service channels along with related loyalty and marketing tools, and other information-related products and services. In addition, we provide an end-to-end security suite to protect against an application and cyber-related attack and maintain the necessary secured environments to maintain compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. These solutions include: access to cash and cashless funding at gaming facilities via ATM debit withdrawals, credit card cash access transactions, and POS debit card purchase at casino cage, kiosk and mobile POS devices; federally insured deposit accounts for the CashClub Wallet, check warranty services, self-service ATM’s and fully integrated kiosk and maintenance services; self-service loyalty tools and promotion management software; compliance, audit, and data software; casino credit data and reporting services; marketing and promotional offering subscription-based services; and other ancillary offerings. We conduct our FinTech segment business based on results generated from the following major revenue streams: (i) Cash Access Services; (ii) Equipment; and (iii) Information Services and Other.
Cash Access Services
In connection with our Cash Access Services, we offer the following:
ATM Cash Withdrawals. ATM cash withdrawal transactions represent the largest category of electronic payment transactions that we process, as measured by dollars processed and transaction volume. In an ATM cash withdrawal transaction, a patron directly accesses funds from either a standalone ATM or a device enabled with our ATM service by using a debit card to withdraw funds from the patron’s demand deposit account, or using a credit card to access the patron’s line of credit. In either event, the patron must use the personal identification number (“PIN”) associated with such card. Our processor then routes the transaction request through an electronic funds transfer (“EFT”) network to the patron’s bank or card issuer, as applicable. 
Depending on several factors, including the patron’s account balance or credit limit and daily withdrawal limit (which limits are set by the card issuer), the card issuer will either authorize or decline the transaction. If the transaction is authorized, then the ATM-enabled device dispenses the cash to the patron. For a transaction using a debit card, the patron’s demand deposit account is debited by the amount of cash disbursed plus a service fee that we assess the patron for the use of the ATM service. For a transaction using a credit card with a PIN, the patron’s credit card account is charged by the amount of the cash disbursed plus service fees assessed by the card issuer and by the Company for the use of the ATM service. In both cases, our service fee is currently a fixed dollar amount and not a percentage of the transaction size. We also receive a fee from the card issuer, which we refer to as interchange reimbursement fee, for accommodating the card issuer’s customer (the patron). In most circumstances, we pay a percentage of the service fee received from the patron and, in many circumstances, a portion of the reverse interchange fees received from the card issuer, as a commission to our gaming establishment customers for the right to operate on their premises.
Credit Card Cash Access Transactions and POS Debit Card Cash Access Transactions. Patrons can perform credit card cash access transactions and POS debit card cash access transactions using many of our enabled devices. A patron’s credit card cash access limit is usually a sub-limit of the total credit line and is set by the card issuer, not Everi FinTech. These limits vary significantly and can be larger or smaller than the POS debit cash access limit. A credit card cash access transaction obligates the patron to repay the card issuer over time on terms that are preset by the cardholder agreement. A patron’s POS debit card allows the patron to make cash withdrawals at the POS-enabled device in an amount equal to the lesser of the amount of funds in the account, or a daily limit that is generally five to ten times as large as the patron’s daily ATM limit.
When a patron requests either a credit card or POS debit card cash access transaction, our processor routes the transaction request through one of the card associations, or EFT networks, to the card issuer. Depending upon several factors, such as the available credit or bank account balance, the transaction is either authorized or declined by the card issuer. If authorized, the patron’s bank account is debited or the patron’s credit card balance is increased, in both cases, by an amount equal to the funds requested plus our service fee. Our service fee is a fixed dollar amount, a percentage of the transaction size, or a combination of a fixed dollar amount and percentage of the transaction size. If the transaction is authorized, the device informs the patron that the transaction has been approved. The device then further instructs the patron to proceed to the gaming establishment’s cashier cage (“financial services center”), to complete the transaction, because both credit card and POS debit card cash access transactions must, in most circumstances, be completed in a face-to-face environment and a unique signature received in order to comply with rules of the card associations. We receive the transaction amount and the service fee from the card issuer, and we reimburse the gaming establishment for the cash amount that it provided to the patron, and in addition, will pay the gaming establishment a portion of the service fee we collected as a commission for the right to operate on its premises. We are also obligated to pay interchange fees to the card issuer and processing costs related to the electronic payment transaction to card associations.
Check Warranty Services. Everi provides a check warranty service that allows gaming establishments to accept personal and/or payroll checks without the risk of default. When a patron presents a check to the cashier at a gaming establishment, the check and patron information is sent through Everi’s system to our third-party partner. The partner evaluates the information and returns to the cashier a warranty limit that a check or multiple checks can be cashed for on that business day. The partner may also return a decline code telling the cashier not to accept the check. 
For a gaming establishment that subscribes to the check warranty service, Everi will warranty any dishonored check that was approved, eliminating any risk for the gaming establishment. Everi’s partner facilitates and manages the check processing, deposits, redeposits, and collections for any checks. 
On our behalf, our third-party provider charges our customers a fee for the check warranty services, which is typically a percentage of the face amount of the check being warranted. In such circumstances, we receive the check warranty revenue associated with the fees we charge our customers for the initial check warranty services. We are exposed to risk for the losses associated with warranted checks that cannot be collected from patrons issuing the items. Warranty expenses are defined as any amounts paid by the third-party provider to gaming establishments to purchase dishonored checks that will not be collectible from patrons. We also pay certain fees and operating expenses to our third-party provider in connection with the provision of such services.
CashClub® is a software payments platform that provides gaming establishments with a personal computer workstation software user interface and point-of-sale terminal that streamlines credit and debit card cash access transaction processing and check warranty transactions for casino patrons. It allows for electronic signature capture and dynamic currency conversion. It also interfaces with our Everi Compliance solutions (defined below) to assist casino operators with meeting regulatory requirements under Title 31 of the Bank Secrecy Act.
Equipment
Fully Integrated Kiosks are a complete line of products that provide multiple functions to gaming operators on their casino floors. This includes cash access functionality that enables ATM cash withdrawals, POS debit card and credit card cash access transactions directly or by using our patented “Seamless Transition” technology, which is the Europay, MasterCard, and Visa global standard for cards equipped with security chip technology (“EMV”) corollary of our 3-in-1 Rollover functionality. The kiosks also provide functionality to perform check cashing transactions, slot machine ticket redemption, bill breaking, slot ticket purchase from a debit card, and loyalty program access, as well as integration with mobile and wallet technology. The availability of our cash access platform on these slot ticket redemption devices provides us with additional points of contact with gaming patrons at locations that are typically closer to gaming devices than traditional cash access devices that are generally located on the periphery of the gaming area and also provides gaming patrons with more opportunities to access their cash with less cashier involvement.
Other Integrated Kiosk Solutions provide casinos with more efficient and streamlined methods for cash handling and transaction processing. These products are designed to be integrated with our cash access products and cage compliance software ensuring compliance with anti-money laundering regulations, and provide an automated way to process common tax forms, such as the Internal Revenue Service Form W-2G or Form 1042-S. In addition, we offer equipment in the form of standalone, non-ATM terminals that perform authorizations for credit card cash access and POS debit card cash access transactions. Our kiosk solutions include the following products:
•JackpotXchange family of kiosks, JXC 4.0, and JXC-L, enable casino personnel to efficiently access funds to pay winning slot machine jackpots for their patrons. These kiosks are integrated with all major slot accounting systems to offer jackpot processing and payout in a combination of cash or slot tickets. These kiosks offer gaming operators the ability to reduce workload for cage operations and for slot personnel. 
•CageXchange is a cash dispensing device that helps streamline casino cage operations. With CageXchange, cash is securely vaulted, creating increased security while also reducing cash shrinkage and helping to improve cashier accuracy. Additional efficiencies are achieved from accelerating the process of cage cashiers obtaining money from the vault. CageXchange is integrated with CashClub® to create an efficient transaction for casino patrons.
•Our Cash Recycling Solutions allow casinos to fully automate the check in and check out process of money, saving time and expense. As gaming establishments vary in size and complexity, these Cash Recycling Solutions support a number of diverse resort operations such as retail, food and beverage, entertainment, and gaming operations. 
Loyalty Kiosk and Related Equipment provide gaming operators with self-service loyalty enrollment, player card issuance, and marketing equipment that manages and delivers a gaming operator’s marketing programs through the patron interfaces. This loyalty-related equipment allows the customer to utilize and interact with the loyalty platform as the central hub for all of the marketing offerings. 
•Enrollment Kiosk is a self-service kiosk that allows casino patrons to either sign up for an initial loyalty card or print a replacement card. These kiosks provide an enhanced level of customer service when the club desk is busy or closed by creating patron self-service locations throughout the casino floor without costly infrastructure or additional overhead costs. Such kiosks also assist with updating contact information of card holders and to verify email or phone contact with a two-step verification process.
•Promotional Kiosk is a kiosk that engages casino patrons with the casino’s loyalty programs, unifying patron service functions into a simple self-service solution. With a range of promotions and offers, the kiosk enables the customer to better manage their marketing efforts. A flexible interface and control panel functionality enable the kiosk to be responsive to customers’ changing business conditions or plans. With the drawings feature, multiple point to entry conversion ratios can be controlled by the hour, as well as scheduled prize earnings. Customized content is shared throughout the solution with property amenities that include menus, photos, and video content. With a graphic-rich, statistically-optimized, and exciting promotions catalog library of more than 300 games, critical assets for instant win, episodic board games, and earn and wins, customers’ patrons can easily access differentiated content. 
Information Services and Other
JackpotXpress is a full-featured jackpot payout and tax form management platform that allows casino personnel to work through the complex jackpot process using a mobile tablet or kiosk. JackpotXpress allows gaming operators to reduce jackpot payout wait times, increase slot play, eliminate manually filling out cumbersome paper documents, and perform “know your customer” checks. It is fully integrated with our Everi Compliance, CageXchange, and JackpotXchange products. In addition to making jackpot operations more efficient, JackpotXpress also helps operators increase customer engagement which leads to improved loyalty and service. 
Loyalty Platform provides a software solution that enables gaming operators to deliver and adopt new promotional strategies to attract, retain, engage, and reward their patrons. Gaming operators utilize the platform to deliver content and promotions on kiosks, tablets, and mobile devices. The software platform engages with patrons by being more relevant and more personalized by integrating with other casino applications. We provide the operators with a control panel to assist with the planning, personalization, and optimization of delivering messages and content via interactions within our platform depending on patron’s value to the casino. Our platform allows our customers to unify the patron experience across all touchpoints within the casino and replaces outdated promotional and enrollment tactics by utilizing our content for promotions, drawings, targeted alerts, card signups, reprints, and geo fencing. By providing a comprehensive set of integrated applications within our platform, we offer gaming operators the ease of use and simplicity to interact with their patrons. Additionally, our loyalty platform is integrated with other Everi applications for cash access and compliance tools.
Maintenance provides various levels of support and maintenance services for our fully integrated kiosks, loyalty kiosks, and related equipment. Our support operations, field service, and customer engagement teams provide quarterly and annual maintenance on these products and software systems to help maximize the efficiency of our products.
Everi Compliance is a leading AML management tool for the gaming industry. Everi Compliance encompasses many elements including filing Suspicious Activity Reports (“SARs”), Currency Transaction Reports (“CTRs”), and Know Your Customer (“KYC”) activities. Everi Compliance automates much of the manual processes gaming establishments employ to be compliant with those requirements, thus saving time, improving accuracy, and allowing operators to manage their compliance programs much more efficiently. In addition, Everi Compliance gives operators the ability to enter Multiple Transaction Log (“MTL”) and Negotiable Instrument Log (“NIL”) transactions, file FinCEN reports electronically, conduct transaction analysis, complete compliance audits, and review reports. 
Central Credit is our gaming patron credit bureau service which, on a subscription basis, allows gaming establishments to improve their credit-granting decisions by obtaining access to a database containing credit information and transaction data on millions of gaming patrons. Our gaming credit reports comprise information recorded from patron credit histories at hundreds of gaming establishments. We provide such information to gaming establishments that subscribe to the service. These establishments then use that data, among other things, to determine how much credit, if any, they will grant to a gaming patron. We typically charge our customers for access to gaming patron credit reports on a monthly basis and our fees are generally comprised of a fixed minimum amount plus per-transaction charges for certain requests.
Other marketing solutions include database services that allow gaming establishments access to information from our proprietary patron transaction database for purposes of player acquisition, direct marketing, market share analysis, and a variety of other patron promotional uses. Our proprietary patron transaction database includes information that is captured from transactions we process. Patrons may “opt out” of having their names included in such marketing services. 
Sales 
As of December 31, 2020, we served more than 1,600 casinos and other gaming properties primarily in the United States and Canada, with additional customers in the United Kingdom, Europe, the Caribbean, Central America, and Asia. 
In our Games and FinTech businesses, we sell and market our products and services primarily through the use of a direct sales force, which targets regulated gaming establishments in the United States, Canada, and in certain international markets. Our sales and marketing efforts are directed by a team of customer service executives, each of whom has business development responsibility for gaming establishments in specified geographic regions. These customer service executives direct their efforts at various gaming establishment personnel, including: senior executives, finance professionals, marketing staff, slot directors, and cashiers, and seek to educate them on the benefits of our products and services. In some cases, our customer service executives are supported by field service and customer engagement teams, who provide on-site customer service. In other cases, our sales executives directly maintain the customer relationships. These customer service executives and field service and customer engagement teams generally reside in the vicinity of the specific gaming establishments they support to provide a prompt response to the needs of those gaming establishments. In some situations, we also have joint sales efforts with a number of strategic partners, including independent sales organizations, which allow us to market our products and services to gaming establishments through channels other than our direct sales force.
Markets 
Development Activities
We conduct research and development activities for both our Gaming and FinTech lines of business. 
Our Gaming research and development activities are primarily to develop gaming systems, game engines, casino data management systems, central determination and other electronic bingo-outcome determination systems, video lottery outcome determination systems, gaming platforms and gaming content, and to enhance our existing product lines. 
Our FinTech research and development activities are primarily to develop: (i) payments products, systems, and related capabilities such as security, encryption, and business rule engines that deliver differentiated patron experiences and integrate with our other products; (ii) compliance products that increase efficiencies, profitability, enhance employee/patron relationships, and meet regulatory reporting requirements; and (iii) loyalty products, systems, and features that attract, engage, and retain patrons in more intuitive and contextual ways than our competition.
We believe our ability to deliver differentiated, appealing products and services to the marketplace is based on our research and development investments, and we expect to continue to make such investments in the future. Research and development costs consist primarily of salaries and benefits, consulting fees, certification and testing fees. Once the technological feasibility has been established, the project is capitalized until it becomes available for general release.
Competitive Conditions 
With respect to our Games business, we compete across different gaming markets with a variety of gaming technology and equipment suppliers. Competition is generally based upon the: (i) amount of revenue our products generate for our customers relative to the amount of revenue generated by our competitors’ products, which correlate directly to the appeal of these products to gaming patrons and (ii) prices and fees we and our competitors charge for products and services offered. To improve product attractiveness and drive customer demand, we work to develop a consistent pipeline of new game themes, game platforms, hardware cabinets, and systems that are expected to appeal to gaming patrons; obtain appropriate gaming regulatory approvals for such products; and offer these new products to the marketplace in a timely manner.
With respect to our FinTech business, we compete with other providers of cash access services to the gaming industry as well as with financial institutions and other regional and local banks that operate ATMs on the premises of gaming establishments. Some of these other providers have established cooperative relationships with each other to expand their service offerings. We also face competition from: (i) other manufacturers that provide similar goods and services; (ii) independent sales organizations, which provide basic services and often aggressive pricing; and (iii) traditional transaction processors that have entered the gaming patron cash access services market. This competition amongst these various providers can result in pricing pressure and margin erosion with respect to our core cash access products and services. In addition to competing with various providers of cash access services, FinTech experiences competition from either those same providers or standalone providers of anti-money laundering (“AML”) compliance products and self-service kiosks for ticket and jackpot redemption.
Resources
Manufacturing
We have assembly facilities in Austin, Texas and Las Vegas, Nevada, where we assemble gaming machines and kiosk products, which comprise a variety of components, including cabinet hardware, computer assemblies, LCD screens, printers, bill validators and acceptors, power transformer and wiring harnesses. We believe that our sources of supply of component parts and raw materials for our products are generally adequate and we have few sole-sourced parts. We utilize contract manufacturers to produce the cabinet hardware that make up our gaming machines, kiosk products, and certain other sub-assemblies.
Intellectual Property 
We believe the ability to introduce and respond to technological innovation in the gaming industry will be an increasingly important qualification for the future success of any provider of cash access and gaming-related products and services. Our continued competitiveness will depend on: (i) the pace of our new product development; (ii) our patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection; and (iii) our relationships with customers. Our business development personnel work with gaming establishments, our technology and other strategic partners, and the suppliers of the financial services upon which our cash access services rely, to design and develop innovative products and services that appeal to gaming patrons.
We rely on a combination of patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. The expiration dates of these patents vary and are based on their filing and issuances dates. We intend to continue to actively file for patent protection, when such filings are commercially reasonable, within and outside the United States. We also seek trademark protection for our names and products and have registered hundreds of trademarks in the United States and various foreign countries. Under permission or license agreements with third parties, we also sell gaming products covered by independently filed copyrights, trademarks, or patents. Typically, these contracts require us to pay royalties to the licensing party. Royalty expenses are included in the cost of gaming and systems in our Financial Statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition to our patents, trademarks, and copyrights, we also rely on a broader scope of intellectual property including trade secrets, in-house know-how, and innovation.
Human Capital 
Composition of our workforce
As of December 31, 2020, we had approximately 1,300 employees, a vast majority of which work domestically, and are comprised of approximately 600 and 700 employees, for our Games and FinTech segments, respectively. We have not experienced a work stoppage and none of our employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement.
Culture of our workplace
Our mission statement, which is fundamental to our purpose, is to transform the casino floor through innovative gaming, financial technology and loyalty solutions. At Everi, we are guided by our values: (i) collaboration; (ii) integrity; (iii) inclusion; and (iv) excellence. When we deliver on these values consistently, we truly: (i) Harness the power of collaboration; (ii) Act with integrity; (iii) Value all; and (iv) Exceed expectations and be bold, (collectively referred to as “HAVE”) fun.
Diversity and Inclusion of our workforce
We recognize that we can only be at our best when we embrace and reflect the customers and communities that we serve. We believe diverse backgrounds, perspectives and talents will enable us to continue to be successful and drive shareholder value. We are an equal opportunity employer and are committed to maintaining a diverse and inclusive work environment. Our employees are to be treated with dignity and respect in an environment free from harassment and discrimination regardless of race, color, age, gender, disability, minority, sexual orientation or any other protected class. 
To build this culture, we have invested in programs and implemented standards to promote ethical business conduct, diversity, sustainability, giving and volunteerism and responsible gaming that we believe will support our long-term business success, while also empowering our team members. 
We have implemented mandatory employee-wide diversity and inclusion training initiatives to continue to cultivate a respectful workplace. These training initiatives address some of the diversity and inclusion concepts biggest challenges, such as unconscious bias and micro inequities and offer employees suggestions for navigating diversity and inclusion challenges to help us create a workplace where contributions are valued and voices are heard throughout the organization.
In 2017, we launched our Women’s Leadership Initiative (“WLI”) to develop and advance diversity throughout the organization and to create opportunities and a path for advancement. WLI is committed to promoting and advocating for gender diversity at all levels of leadership through awareness, development and inspiration, recruiting high-potential female candidates from a wide array of areas of the Company.
Furthermore, our efforts start at the top of the organization as nearly 30% of our independent Board of Directors are comprised of females and we were recognized by 2020 Women on Boards for achieving at least 20% females on our Board of Directors prior to the 2020 target date. More than half of our independent directors are either female or racially diverse.
Employee Engagement
We value continuous dialogue with our employees about their experiences. We have several employee feedback mechanisms including opinion surveys, Company-wide email communications and quarterly town hall meetings, among other mediums. Each year, we directly address employee feedback through these mechanisms to increase employee confidence that their feedback will lead to action by management.
Employee Development
We develop our employees through a variety of means, both internally and externally. We offer a leadership program to provide employees training and related resources in a wide variety of managerial skills topics, such as: conflict management, delegation, talent acquisition, eliminating bias behaviors, employee relations and compliance. In addition, we encourage employees to pursue external education and certification opportunities, many of which are eligible for cost and tuition reimbursement by the Company, to supplement their career development goals.
Employee Health and Safety
The health and safety of our employees play an important role in the ongoing success of our Company. They are vital to maintaining our brand image through daily positive interactions with customers. We have policies in place to monitor the working conditions of our employees and implement measures to protect their health, safety and well-being. Our benefits are designed to recognize the diverse needs of our workforce. Our program provides: (i) competitive and comprehensive benefit options; (ii) a program that considers individual needs; and (iii) long-term financial security for our employees and their families. We focus on compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding workplace health and safety as well as on our efforts with respect to emergency and disaster recovery plans.
Seasonality
Our revenues and cash flows may fluctuate throughout the year driven by seasonality, among other factors. Historically, we have generally experienced higher operating income during the first half of a year and lower operating results during the second half of a year; however, such fluctuations do not have a material impact on our revenues and cash flows. 
Government Regulation
General
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the material gaming and financial institution laws applicable to our business. We have a diligent internal compliance program governing our business activities, as well as legal requirements generally applicable to publicly traded companies. The compliance program is directed on a day-to-day basis by our Chief Legal Officer, who also serves as Chief Compliance Officer. Legal advice is provided by attorneys from the Company’s legal department and outside experts. The compliance program is overseen by the Corporate Compliance Committee, which includes a gaming law expert as an independent member. While complying with these regulations can require significant time and resources, we do not believe it results in costs that materially impact our earnings. Despite our compliance efforts, we can give no assurance, however, that our business activities or the activities of our customers in the gaming industry will not be subject to any regulatory or legal enforcement proceedings in the future.
Gaming Regulation 
The gaming industry is highly regulated under legal systems that frequently evolve and change based on governmental public policies. Various aspects of our business are subject to comprehensive laws, regulations, and ordinances applicable to the ownership, management, and operation of gambling establishments as well as certain financial services conducted at such establishments. The stated policies and other purposes behind such laws, regulations, and ordinances are generally to: (i) secure the public’s trust and confidence in legalized gambling through a system of mandated regulation, internal controls, accounting practices, and operating procedures; and (ii) promote economic activity for the state, county, and local governments through revenue opportunities emanating from taxes, licensing fees, and other economic benefits arising out of gambling and related activities.
A description of the material regulations to which we are subject is set forth below.
Gaming Authorities. We are regulated by various city, county, state, provincial, federal, tribal, and foreign government agencies (collectively, “Gaming Authorities”) in the jurisdictions where we conduct business as either a: (i) manufacturer of gaming devices, in those jurisdictions where we manufacture gaming devices and systems; (ii) supplier of “associated equipment,” in those jurisdictions where we sell and service fully integrated kiosks and other integrated kiosk solutions; and (iii) non-gaming supplier or vendor, in those jurisdictions where we provide cash access and Central Credit services only. We must maintain those licenses, registrations, or other approvals in good standing to continue our business. Gaming Authorities have broad discretion in determining whether to grant a license, registration, or other approval. Subject to complying with certain procedural requirements, Gaming Authorities may deny any application, or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability, qualification, or other approval for any cause deemed reasonable to them. 
Approvals, Licensing, and Suitability
The process of obtaining necessary licenses, registrations, or other approvals often involves substantial disclosure of confidential or proprietary information about us and our officers, directors, key personnel and, in certain instances, beneficial owners of our debt or equity securities, and requires a determination by the regulators as to our suitability as a manufacturer, supplier, or vendor to gaming establishments. Gaming regulatory authorities have broad discretion and may require any beneficial holder of our securities, regardless of the number of shares of common stock or amount of debt securities owned, to file an application, make personal or confidential disclosures, be investigated, and be subject to a determination of suitability. Many jurisdictions require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities of a gaming company and, in some jurisdictions, non-voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to Gaming Authorities, and Gaming Authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability, subject to limited exceptions for “institutional investors” that hold a company’s voting securities for investment purposes only.
Product Approvals
Our gaming devices and certain other products and technologies must be certified or approved by Gaming Authorities in many jurisdictions where we conduct business. These Gaming Authorities test the gaming devices, systems, and related equipment directly or through an independent testing laboratory and may also require a field trial under the regulator’s technical standards before allowing us to sell the product. Although we collaborate closely with the Gaming Authorities and independent testing laboratories, we cannot control whether our products will be approved or the length of time taken to review our products for sale to third parties. Moreover, there are no guarantees that we will be successful in obtaining and maintaining all necessary licenses, permits, and approvals; and to continue to hold other necessary gaming licenses, permits, and approvals to conduct our businesses either as currently being conducted by us or to expand our businesses.
Our Native American customers are regulated by the National Indian Gaming Commission (“NIGC”), which was established by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 (“IGRA”). The NIGC has regulatory authority over certain aspects of Native American gaming and defines the boundaries of our dealings with the Native American marketplace and the level of regulatory authority to which these games are subject. IGRA establishes three classes of gaming, each with a different regulatory framework:

Class | Type of Games | Regulatory Oversight 
I | Social gaming for minimal prizes and traditional Native American gaming. | Exclusive regulation and oversight by tribal governments. 
II | Bingo (both in traditional and electronic form). | Regulation by tribal governments with NIGC oversight. 
III | Casino style games (including slot machines, blackjack, craps, and roulette). | Must be permitted by the state in which the tribe is located. The state and the tribe must have negotiated a compact approved by NIGC, and the tribe must have adopted a gaming ordinance approved by the NIGC.

We provide our gaming devices and systems in both Class II and Class III markets.
Class III gaming on Native American tribal lands is usually subject to the negotiation of a compact between the tribe and the proximate state attendant to where the tribe intends to operate a gaming facility. These tribal-state compacts typically include provisions entitling the state to receive significant sums of money in exchange for the tribe’s operation of Class III gaming. While tribal-state compacts are intended to document the agreement between the state and a tribe, these tribal-state compacts can be subject to disputes relative to permitted Class III gaming operations.
The Johnson Act. The Johnson Act, as amended by the federal Gambling Devices Act of 1962 (the “Johnson Act”), requires that we register annually with the Criminal Division of the United States Department of Justice, and requires a wide variety of record keeping and equipment identification efforts on our part. Registration is required in order for us to sell, distribute, manufacture, transport, or receive gaming equipment, machines, or components across state lines. If we fail to comply with the requirements set forth under the Johnson Act, we could become subject to a variety of penalties, including, but not limited to, the seizure and forfeiture of equipment.
Internet and Online Gaming Regulation. Several states have passed legislation and regulations to allow certain intra-state, wager-based, online casino, or lottery games, such as online poker, online lottery, lottery ticket purchases, or lottery ticket subscriptions. To date, several states have authorized some form of Internet or online gaming or lottery activities. However, the legislative and regulatory framework governing these activities may continue to evolve in the future.
Financial Services Regulation 
Our FinTech business is also subject to a number of financial services regulations:
Durbin Amendment. Rules promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, required as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), including the so-called Durbin Amendment (the “Durbin Amendment”), establish, among other things, standards for assessing whether debit card interchange fees received by certain debit card issuers are reasonable and proportional to the costs incurred by issuers for electronic debit transactions. Debit card interchange fees are established by payment card networks and ultimately paid by merchants to debit card issuers for each debit transaction.
Anti-Money Laundering and Sanctions. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001, other federal statutes, generally referred to as the Bank Secrecy Act, and implementing federal regulations require us to establish and maintain an anti-money laundering program. Our anti-money laundering program includes: internal policies, procedures, and controls designed to identify and report money laundering, a designated compliance officer, ongoing employee training programs, an independent audit function to test the program, and customer due diligence. In addition, the cash access services we provide are subject to record keeping and reporting obligations under the Bank Secrecy Act. Our gaming establishment customers are required to file a Suspicious Activity Report (“SAR”) with the U.S. Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network to report any suspicious transactions relevant to a possible violation of law or regulation. We are also required to file a SAR where we provide our cash access services directly to patrons through financial services centers that we staff and operate. To be reportable, such a transaction must meet criteria that are designed to identify the hiding or disguising of funds derived from illegal activities. Our gaming establishment customers, in situations where our cash access services are provided through gaming establishment cashier personnel, and we, in situations where we provide our cash access services through a financial services center, are required to file a Currency Transaction Report (“CTR”) of each deposit, withdrawal, exchange of currency, or other payment or transfer by, through, or to us which involves a transaction in currency of more than $10,000 in a single day. Our CashClub® product can assist in identifying transactions that give rise to reporting obligations. 
We also have a program designed to comply with applicable economic and trade sanctions programs, including those administered and enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”). These sanctions are usually targeted against foreign countries, terrorists, international narcotics traffickers and those believed to be involved in the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Regulations generally require either the blocking of accounts or other property of specified entities or individuals, but they may also require the rejection of certain transactions involving specified entities or individuals. We maintain policies, procedures and other internal controls designed to comply with these sanctions programs.
Fund Transfers. Our POS debit card cash access transactions, credit card cash access transactions, and ATM services are subject to the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, which provides cardholders with rights with respect to electronic fund transfers, including the right to dispute unauthorized charges, charges that list the wrong date or amount, charges for goods and services that are not accepted or delivered as agreed, math errors, and charges for which a cardholder asks for an explanation or written proof of transaction along with a claimed error or request for clarification. We believe the necessary policies and procedures have been implemented throughout our organization in order to comply with the regulatory requirements for fund transfers.
State Money Transmission Laws. Many states where we complete credit card cash access and POS debit card cash access transactions or offer our online payment processing solution require us to have a money transmitter license. These state laws subject us to, among other requirements, examinations by state regulatory agencies, reporting requirements, net worth and bonding requirements, and consumer disclosure requirements. 
Credit Reporting. Our Central Credit gaming patron credit bureau services and check verification and warranty services are subject to the Fair Credit Reporting Act (the “FCRA”) and the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act of 2003 (the “FACTA”) and their implementing rules, which require consumer credit bureaus, such as Central Credit, to provide credit report information to businesses only for certain purposes and to otherwise safeguard credit report information, to disclose to consumers their credit report on request, and to permit consumers to dispute and correct inaccurate or incomplete information in their credit report. These laws and rules also govern the information that may be contained in a consumer credit report. We continue to implement policies and procedures as well as adapt our business practices in order to comply with these laws and regulations. In addition to federal regulations, our Central Credit gaming patron credit bureau services are subject to the state credit reporting regulations that impose similar requirements to the FCRA and the FACTA.
Debt Collection. We currently outsource most of our debt collection efforts to third parties. However, we do engage in debt collection to collect on chargebacks on our cash access products and unpaid balances for services performed for our check services, Central Credit services, compliance services, receivables relating to the sale and service of our fully integrated kiosks and other integrated kiosk solutions, and other amounts owing to us in connection with performing various services for our customers. All such collection practices may be subject to the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (the “FDCPA”), which prohibits unfair, deceptive, or abusive debt collection practices, as well as consumer-debt-collection laws and regulations adopted by the various states.
Consumer Financial Services. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and other federal, state, and local law enforcement and regulatory agencies have the authority to regulate consumer financial products. These agencies have broad statutory powers, including to promulgate rules, issue interpretations, and take enforcement actions that may affect our business. 
Privacy Regulations. Our collection of information from patrons who use our financial products and services, such as our cash access services, are subject to the financial information privacy protection provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (the “GLBA”) and its implementing federal regulations. We gather, as permitted by law, non-public, personally-identifiable financial information from patrons who use our cash access services, such as names, addresses, telephone numbers, bank and credit card account numbers, and transaction information. The GLBA requires us to safeguard and protect the privacy of such non-public personal information and also requires us to make disclosures to patrons regarding our privacy and information sharing policies and give patrons the opportunity to direct us not to disclose information about them to unaffiliated third parties in certain situations. We are also subject to state privacy regulations which, in some cases, may be even stricter than federal law, including without limitation, the California Consumer Privacy Act which became effective as of January 1, 2020. We continue to implement policies and programs as well as adapt our business practices in order to comply with federal and state privacy laws and regulations. In addition, we are subject to foreign data protection and privacy laws including, but not limited to, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, which became effective in May 2018 and requires companies to meet certain requirements regarding data privacy and security. 
ATM Operations. The Electronic Fund Transfer Act requires us to disclose certain notices regarding the fees that we charge for performing an ATM transaction as well as to incorporate such notices on the ATM screens to notify patrons of such fees prior to completing an ATM transaction. Our ATM services are also subject to applicable state banking regulations in each jurisdiction in which we operate ATMs which require, among other things, that we register with the state banking regulators as an operator of ATMs, that we provide gaming patrons with notices of the transaction fees assessed upon use of our ATMs, that our transaction fees do not exceed designated maximums, that we offer gaming patrons a means of resolving disputes with us, and that we comply with prescribed safety and security requirements. In addition, the ATMs we operate are subject to requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act, which in general require that ATMs be accessible to individuals with disabilities, such as visually-impaired persons.
Check Cashing. In jurisdictions in which we provide check cashing services, we are required to be licensed by the applicable state banking regulator to operate as a check casher. Some states also impose restrictions on this activity, such as limits on the amounts of service fees that may be imposed on the cashing of certain types of checks, requirements as to records that must be kept with respect to dishonored checks, and requirements as to the contents of receipts that must be delivered to gaming patrons at the time a check is cashed.
Network and Card Association Regulations. In addition to the governmental regulation described above, some of our services are also subject to rules promulgated by various payment networks, EFT networks, and card associations. For example, we must comply with the Payment Card Industry (“PCI”) Data Security Standard. We have been designated as a compliant service provider under the PCI Data Security Standard. We must be certified to maintain our status as a compliant service provider on an annual basis.
EMV is designed to deter fraudulent card transactions related to identity theft, counterfeit cards, and the misuse of lost or stolen cards via enhanced card authentication, transaction authorization, and cardholder verification using chip-based smart-cards. EMV has been adopted in many regions of the world as the global standard for fraud deterrence in chip-based smart-card payments. In October 2015, the network and card associations began shifting liability for fraudulent POS and ATM transactions generated through EMV-capable cards onto merchants whose devices are not capable of processing chip-based smart-card EMV transactions. This shifts the responsibility for chargebacks due to fraudulent transactions on such cards from the card issuer onto the merchant.
As a merchant of cash access transactions processed through MasterCard, Visa, Discover, and American Express, all who have adopted the EMV standard, and as an operator of ATMs, our POS, fully-integrated kiosk, and ATM devices are subject to the EMV standard. This requires us to maintain our fleet of U.S.-based POS, fully-integrated kiosk, and ATM devices to support the EMV standard.
International Regulation
We are also subject to a variety of gaming and financial services regulations and other laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in the international markets in which we operate. We expect to become subject to additional gaming and financial services regulations and other laws in the jurisdictions into which we expand our operations. Our expansion into new markets is dependent upon our ability to comply with the regulatory regimes adopted by such jurisdictions. 
In addition, refer to “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to the Regulation of Our Industry” for more information regarding industry, state, and federal regulations impacting our business and related risks and uncertainties.
