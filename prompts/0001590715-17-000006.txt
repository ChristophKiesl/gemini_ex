ITEM 1. DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS
OVERVIEW

NGFC Equities, Inc. (NGFC the Company our us) began on October 2, 2013 and changed our name from Natural Gas Fueling and Conversion Inc. to NGFC Equities, Inc. on February 25, 2015. When we formed our company our focus was to (i) construct and/or purchase and manage a chain of combined gasoline, diesel and natural gas (NG) fueling and service stations (initially, in the Miami, FL area); (ii) construct conversion factories to convert NG to liquefied natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG); and (iii) construct conversion factories to retrofit vehicles currently using gasoline or diesel fuel to also run on NG in the United States and also to build a convenience store to serve our customers in each of our locations. 

At a Board of Directors meeting held on February 16, 2015, the Company chose to diversify its operations by adding two additional divisions to its original business strategy to set up three divisions as follows:

1.
 Energy and Retail Division
 2.
 Healthcare Division
 3.
 Consulting Division

However, we have not been able to expand in the above divisions except in our healthcare division so far due to lack of capital to do so. We plan to continue with our effort to find the capital and expand these divisions. In general the Company plans to conduct businesses through subsidiaries that we plan to acquire or being managed by an experienced management team with NGFC providing administrative support. 

We began our Health Care Division by acquiring ECI-LATAM Inc. (ECIL) in February of 2015 which is in the business of maintaining medical equipment.In May 2015 ECIL set up an Animal Health Division, to manufacture, package, market and distribute globally, an infection healing cream for dairy animals. In August 2015, this Animal Health Division was transferred to a separate corporation incorporated in the state of Florida entitled La Veles Inc. (LVI) with NGFC owning 73% of LVI. La Veles was planning on setting up a factory in the Republic of Serbia to manufacture this cream with Mr. Goran Antic acting as the Chief Executive Officer of La Veles Inc. However, the activation of this strategy did not proceed smoothly and in order to save time and cost, the Board on January 23, 2016 decided to be involved only with distribution of this anti-infection cream and also let ECIL directly handle the work through ECIL and not get La Veles Inc. involved with it. ECIL currently has no formal agreement with the manufacturer of this Cream to distribute it. Currently LVI remains an inactive 100% owned subsidiary of NGFC. The cost of setting up LVI and making it inactive had been minimal for us due to the expertise of our staff in forming the corporation, handling most administrative and filing obligations through our internal team.

On March 24, 2015, the Company set up NGFC Limited Partnership (NGLP, the Partnership) with the Company acting as the General Partner. One objective of the Partnership was to raise funds in the private market through any exempt offerings to acquire gasoline stations that the Partnership would lease back to the Company to earn a fixed return. The Partnership also has invested a portion of its funds in the financial markets. One of the unique features of the Partnership is an option the limited partners to the partnership will have to convert 100% of their contributed capital regardless of the balance of the capital account to shares of NGFC at a pre-agreed strike price within a pre-agreed period. 

On May 20, 2016 we filed a Form 8-K deconsolidating NGLP from NGFC because in the event the investment by NGLP in public company stocks to be more than 40% of the total assets, that may require us to register NGFC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which we desire to avoid since the purpose of NGFC is to acquire companies to operate through subsidiaries and not be a passive investor. It is more practical for NGLP to make a better return on the money NGLP is holding by investing in any alternative investments while NGLP still considers acquiring land and buildings that house operating gasoline stations to rent to the Energy and Retail division of NGFC to get a fixed return on their money. NGFC gave 30-day written notice to all limited partners of NGLP on July 19, 2016 informing them of NGFCs intention to resign as the general partner of NGFC effective August 19, 2016. Concurrently Andrew Weeraratne the CEO of NGFC was appointed as the general partner of NGLP.

Also the Board, in the meeting held on May 20, 2016 approved to keep the option the current Limited Partners of NGLP have as of May 20, 2016 to convert 100% of their capital to NGFC shares at $0.30 per shares by March 31, 2017 effective even after deconsolidation of NGLP. If this conversion feature was executed by all 14 limited partners then their total capital (if any of them did not withdraw prior to March 31, 2017) of $535,350 could be converted at $0.30 cents per share to 1,784,500 shares of Class A Common Stock of NGFC.

On May 18, 2015 we formed Vanguard Energy Inc. (VE) in San Clemente, California as 55% stockholder with an individual Michael Laub as a 45% stockholder to conduct some of the business in our Energy and Retail Division through VE. Mr. Laub is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of CNG United LLC based in San Clemente, California that deals in training installation of engines for gasoline vehicles to run on Natural Gas as well as safety and maintenance of hybrid engines and vehicles. On the 23rd of January 2016, the Board of Directors decided to discontinue the operation of VE, due to recent price decline in gasoline and until we assess the cost benefit of the vehicle conversion division, and have Mr. Laub who currently manages CNG United LLC work as a consultant for NGFC. The financial cost of setting up and discontinuing VE had been minimal for us due to the expertise of our staff in forming the corporation, handling most administrative and filing obligations through our internal team.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

Since inception, the majority of our work and our expenditures have been on research and development. To establish our Energy Division we attended a few conferences that specialize in natural gas vehicles both in the USA and in Europe to learn of the developing technology in natural gas vehicles and natural gas fueling stations. We also met with a few European companies that own and operate both natural gas-driven vehicles and also operate multiple natural gas stations successfully. So far, we have located a few gasoline and diesel service stations with garages and convenience stores in Miami, Florida that we may be able to buy at a fair price once we raise funds. We believe we can locate more similar gasoline stations to buy in the future. We also discovered a company that produces mobile natural gas fueling stations that we could install for about $200,000 each in the gasoline stations that we plan to buy (once the funds are available). Installing mobile NG stations will give us a temporary solution to providing NG for any vehicles until NG become prominent in the USA rather than constructing NG fueling stations at a cost we estimate to be about a million dollars per station.

Also when we began our business in late 2013, we were planning to operate a vehicle conversion business through a joint venture relationship with Shenzhen HJ Technology Company Ltd. (HJT), which is, according to its management, currently operating a series of factories converting vehicles to operate on LNG and CNG in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC or China), using its patented Gas Intelligent Electric Control System (GIECS) technology. Since then we have discovered a few other conversion kits from other manufacturers and looked into using other conversion kits in our planned vehicle conversion division. However, due to the current decline in price of gasoline, we feel the vehicle conversion business may no longer be profitable and thus plan to hold off on that strategy until we assess the situation further.

We also located various gasoline, diesel and propane distribution companies and we have begun discussions with them to acquire majority ownership of these companies (once we have raised funds) and add natural gas distribution using their infrastructure. If our discussions continued in a positive path, we plan to offer them cash and shares of our Company as the purchase price to buy the majority ownership of these companies after we have conducted our due diligence and required audits (please read Risk Factors where we have discussed the limitations we have in making any significant acquisitions until we raise adequate funds, since the funds we have currently would not be enough to make any significant acquisition and that there is no guarantee that we may be able to raise any funds).

When we began, our plan was to set up NG Operational Units both in the USA and in some overseas locations since we believe NG will overtake gasoline and diesel as the premier energy form for vehicles due to its anti-pollution nature and also due to its economic benefit. So far we have visited Sri Lanka, Japan, China and United Arab Emirates as potential locations to expand such operations. We have met with both potential management and investors in those nations for us to begin such operations in joint venture with local institutions.

Our research pointed us to the fact that in 2015, about 140.43 billion gallons (or about 3.34 billion barrels1) of gasoline were consumed in the United States, a daily average of about 384.74 million gallons (or about 9.16 million 
 
2

barrels per day). This was about 1.5% less than the record high of about 390 million gallons per day (or about 9.29 million barrels per day) consumed in 2007. (US department of Energy Information Administration (EIA). Also according to EIA only 40% of the crude oil used by U.S. refineries is produced in the United States, the rest is imported from other countries. Additionally, according to the EIA, gasoline is the predominant fuel used by most passenger vehicles in the United States today. There are approximately 254 million vehicles that use gasoline, and on average each vehicle travels approximately 11,600 miles per year. Currently, there are about 162,000 fueling stations that provide refueling services for these consumers.

Our research has illustrated to us that that crude oil, gasoline and diesel fuel prices that are high relative to historical averages, combined with increasingly stringent federal, state and local air quality regulations, create a favorable market opportunity for alternative vehicle fuels in the United States. NG as an alternative fuel has been widely used for many years in other parts of the world such as in Europe and Latin America, based on the number of NG vehicles in operation in those regions. According to the Alternative Fuels Data Center of the U.S. Department of Energys Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (the OEE), there are approximately 112,000 NG powered vehicles currently in the United States and approximately 14.8 million NG powered vehicles worldwide.

According to NGV America, website report in 2015, the station count in the USA has grown dramatically in the last three years, and there are now 1,591 CNG and 116 LNG natural gas stations operating in the U.S. While only a little more than half of these stations are public access. Investments are being made to upgrade older stations to increase capacity and improve the fueling experience. New stations are being built with an emphasis on creating a traditional fueling experience for the customer. According to corporate website of Cummins Westport Inc. (Cummins), a worldwide leader in the design, engineering and marketing of automotive natural gas engines for commercial transportation applications such as truck and buses, there are approximately 1,200 CNG fueling stations in the United States, compared to approximately 164,292 gasoline fueling stations in the United States as of 2007, according to the OEEs website. 

We have discovered that natural gas usage by Americans is increasing at a steady pace. According to the EIA, in 1950, US residents used 5,766,542 million cubic feet (MMcF) of NG. In 2012, they used 25,533,448 MMcF of NG, almost 4.5 times more than the consumption level in 1950. EIA's forecast of U.S. total natural gas consumption averages 76.3 Bcf/day (Bcf/d) in 2015 and 76.8 Bcf/d in 2016, compared with 73.1 Bcf/d in 2014. EIA projects natural gas consumption in the power sector to increase by 16.8% in 2015 and then to decrease by 1.2% in 2016. Natural gas spot prices, which are expected to remain below $3/MMBtu through mid-2016, support high consumption of natural gas for electricity generation in 2015 and 2016. Industrial sector consumption of natural gas remains flat in 2015 and increases by 4.2% in 2016, as new industrial projects, particularly in the fertilizer and chemicals sectors, come online in the next few months. Natural gas consumption in the residential and commercial sectors is projected to decline in both 2015 and 2016, which largely reflects lower heating demand this winter compared with last winter.

We believe this trend of increase demand and usage will continue, as is consistent with historical data, as the United States remains the biggest NG producer in the world and NG remains as a much cheaper alternative to gasoline.

According to our research, LNG is safer than petrol or diesel since LNG combustion point is about 650 centigrade while about 260 degrees C for diesel and petrol.

Also we looked into expanding into the industry that deals in cell therapy for cancer. We attended the industry event SITC 2015 on November 6-8, 2015 in Maryland and net with a few start-up companies we believe we could acquire for consideration of some cash and stock of our company. Our research indicates that Cell Therapy for cancer is a fast growing business that would provide many lucrative opportunities for investors to join in an industry as it is breaking through and benefit from the upside as cell therapy becomes the most accepted cure for cancer. 

OUR STRATEGY

As stated elsewhere in this report we have broken down our company to three divisions as follows:

Energy and Retail Division
 Healthcare Division
 
3

Consulting Division

However, due to our inability to raise enough capital to expand the Company to above divisions so far we have been only able to focus on the healthcare division. We plan to continue with our efforts to find the capital and focus on expanding the business through the following divisions.

On March 24, 2015, the Company set up NGFC Limited Partnership (NGLP, the Partnership) with the Company acting as the General Partner. One objective of the Partnership was to raise funds in the private market through any exempt offerings to acquire gasoline stations that the Partnership would lease back to the Company to earn a fixed return. The Partnership also has invested a portion of its funds in the financial markets. One of the unique features of the Partnership is an option the limited partners to the partnership will have to convert 100% of their contributed capital regardless of the balance of the capital account to shares of NGFC at a pre-agreed strike price within a pre-agreed period. 

On May 20, 2016 we filed a Form 8K deconsolidating NGLP from NGFC because in the event the investment by NGLP in public company stocks was to be more than 40% of the total assets, that may require us to register NGFC under the Investment Company Act of 1940, which we desire to avoid since the purpose of NGFC is to acquire companies to operate through subsidiaries and not be a passive investor while it is more practical for NGLP to make a better return on the money NGLP is holding by investing in any alternative investments while NGLP still consider acquiring land and building that house operating gasoline stations to rent to the Energy and Retail division of NGFC to get a fixed return on their money. NGFC gave 30-day written notice to all limited partners of NGLP on July 19, 2016 informing them of NGFCs intention to resign as the general partner of NGFC effective August 19, 2016. Concurrently Andrew Weeraratne the CEO of NGFC was appointed as the general partner of NGLP. Also the Board, in the meeting held ion May 20, 2016 approved to keep the option the current Limited Partners of NGLP have as of May 20, 2016 to convert 100% of their capital to NGFC shares at $0.30 per shares by March 31, 2017 effective even after deconsolidation of NGLP. If this conversion feature was executed by all 14 limited partners then their total capital (if any of them did not withdraw prior to March 31, 2017) of $535,350 could be converted at $0.30 cents per share to 1,784,500 shares of Class A Common Stock of NGFC.

Energy and Retail Division

Through our Energy and Retail Division, we have been conducting due diligence on several existing fueling stations in the Miami, Florida area which the Company believes are suitable acquisition targets. However, it remains the Companys preference to purchase land and build an Operational Unit based on our own designs. With the proceeds in this offering, we plan to acquire land and a building that houses a gasoline and diesel fuel station with a convenience store and collect rent if possible while our consulting division handles all accounting so as to keep an eye on the business (if it would be acceptable to the owners) that we eventually can put through an audit and acquire, while we raise additional money to build our Operational Units that we estimate to cost about $5,800,000 to build one Operational Unit. Currently we have no other commitments to get the funds to build our operational units and thus it may depend on us building a track record in owning a smaller gasoline and diesel fuel station that we would rent successfully and/or due to our exposure to potential investors by being in the business, for which there is no guarantee.
 
Our initial primary focus will be distributing gasoline and diesel fuel to customers once we build or purchase a fueling station, as we believe there are not enough NG driven vehicles in the market at this time to substantiate building only a NG station. We also plan to have liquefied natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) available for NG driven vehicles as we think NG vehicles will be as common as gasoline-driven vehicles in the future. Therefore, we may acquire existing gasoline and diesel fueling stations and expand them to include NG fueling capabilities. In certain stations we plan to build (or acquire and expand), we may have gasoline and LNG only, in some stations we may have gasoline and CNG only and in other stations we may have the means to distribute gasoline, diesel, LNG and CNG. Such determination will be made based on different factors such as the demand for LNG and/or CNG in each location and easy access to LNG and CNG supplies. We believe that the NG business is poised to go through significant changes in the near future and we plan to operate an extensive research department dedicated to our company adopting relevant changes as the market evolves.

When we began we were planning to construct, own and operate factories to convert NG from its gaseous state to LNG (through a process of cooling NG) to be distributed to our own fueling stations and also to fueling stations owned by other independent owners and companies. However, due to the current decline of prices in energy, we do not believe it would be viable for us to continue with this strategy and thus we plan to hold off our plans on that.
 
Also when we began our business in late 2013, we were planning to operate a vehicle conversion business through a joint venture relationship with Shenzhen HJ Technology Company Ltd. (HJT), which is currently operating a series of factories converting vehicles to operate on LNG and CNG in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC or China), using its patented Gas Intelligent Electric Control System (GIECS) technology. Since then we have come across a few other conversion kits from other manufacturers and looked into using other conversion kits in our planned vehicle conversion division. However, due to current decline in price of gasoline, we believe the vehicle conversion business may no longer be profitable and thus plan to hold off on that strategy as well.

On May 18, 2015 we formed Vanguard Energy Inc. (VE) in San Clemente, California as a 55% stockholder with an individual Michael Laub as a 45% stockholder to conduct some of the business in our Energy and Retail Division through VE. Mr. Laub is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of CNG United LLC based in San Clemente, California that deals in training installation of engines for gasoline vehicles to run on Natural Gas as well as safety and maintenance of hybrid engines and vehicles. On the 23rd of January 2016, the Board of Directors decided to discontinue the operation of VE, due to the same reasons we have mentioned elsewhere in this Form 10-K for holding off the vehicle conversion division, and have Mr. Laub who currently manages CNG United LLC work as a consultant for NGFC. The financial cost of setting up and discontinuing VE had been minimal to us due to the expertise of our staff in handling most administrative and filing obligations through our internal team.

Healthcare Division

As part of our change in our strategy, adopted in February 2015, the Company acquired 55% of the equity interest of ECI-LATAM Inc. (ECIL). Began by an entrepreneur Goran Antic, ECIL was incorporated in the State of Florida on March 25, 2014 and is engaged in installation and performing maintenance and repairs of large medical equipment that deal in sterilization and disinfection. ECIL also sells spare parts, consumables and service contracts for medical establishments. As of now 100% of ECIL sales and services are performed outside the USA. Also 100% of the maintenance and repairs for the period of these financial statements have been done only for the medical equipment belonging to Getinge Group, a public company based in Sweden who manufactures and distributes their own large medical equipment. Currently Mr. Antic is the sole employee of ECIL and acts as its Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board. 

In May 2015 ECIL set up an Animal Health Division, to manufacture, package, market and distribute globally, an infection healing cream made of natural products for dairy animals in joint venture with a group of people in Serbia who, according to them, use a homemade cream to treat dairy animal suffering from mastitis and udder edema. 

In August 2015, this Animal Health Division was transferred to a separate corporation incorporated in the state of Florida entitled La Veles Inc. (LVI) with Mr. Antic acting as the Chief Executive Officer of La Veles Inc. However, after further discussions we have decided not to get involved with production of the infection-curing Cream but allow the group in Serbia to manufacture, package with our Company, most probably through ECI, focus only on distribution of such natural cream and also look to distribute similar natural creams being produced by other producers in the world.

In October 2015, we discovered a group of scientists dealing in Cell Therapy for cancer who began discussions with us to join our holding company as a subsidiary. We attended an industry event (SITC 2015) and came across number of entities with huge promise, we believe we may be able to acquire once we have raised enough capital. We believe this is a cutting edge industry with enough major investment bankers seeking to invest in the next break-through company and thus may create our stockholders good opportunities to increase their stock value.

Consulting Division

Since our main strategy is to find businesses with significant upside to merge with or acquire to expand our operation, buying an existing business with an experienced management team in place, we believe, is the most 
 
5

practical strategy. However, due to our size we can afford to buy only small businesses and often these small businesses do not keep proper accounting to put themselves through an audit under the SEC guidelines set forth by Public Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB). We discovered that often it would cost too much money for a small business to hire an outside service to prepare their records acceptable enough to be audited by a PCAOB certified CPA firm under the guidelines set forth by PCAOB, precluding us from acquiring such companies due to not being able to audit them. Since we began searching for management teams to join us we found it more practical to acquire a company along with the management team to join as a wholly owned or majority owned subsidiary of our Company. That strategy requires us to get them audited under PCAOB guidelines since a company is required to go through such an audit before a public company such as ours can acquire them. Hence, since we began, our management team, especially the CEO Andrew Weeraratne (who has extensive experience as a CPA, CFO and as a consultant), have been spending long hours going through and making needed adjustments to bring financial statements to be in accordance with accounting standards and writing accounting and procedures for a few companies that we have considered potential acquisitions targets. These actions have led us to set up our own consulting division, whereby we will invoice the businesses who would request us to help them get their records ready for PCAOB audits with us collecting such fees in cash or in the event we agree to acquire them by reducing the purchase price by the amount of unpaid consulting service fees.

Our Consulting Division will focus on identifying and organizing currently operating businesses to set up their accounting system to run them efficiently with the help of accurate and timely financial and management reports. We also plan to implement internal control procedures that will safeguard their assets and accounting procedures that will make their operation efficient and transparent that in turn will help them in the event they choose to get listed on the public market through joining us or on their own in the future. We also plan to write operating and internal control procedure manuals and disclosure check list manuals that will help small business owners to prepare for expansion as they find the needed capital to expand. We believe that these services will provide us cash flow and also introduce us to businesses we believe we may be able to acquire in exchange for cash and stock of our company. We believe our current management team has necessary experience to guide small businesses to overcome their problems and build successful businesses. We have provided such consulting services to two companies.

Since we began in October 2013 through June 2014 when our original form S-1 we filed with the Security and Exchange Commission (SEC) to raise fund was declared effective, our operations have been limited to our organizational activities, early stage implementation of our business plan and focusing on filing the S-1 and related documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since June 2014 to-date we have been filing various applications and documents with various States of the USA and Post Effective Amendments with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Also we have spent considerable time installing internal control and administrative procedures for our company, installing and learning software to facilitate fling our periodic reports with the SEC through EDGAR system and also to create the XBRL files for our financial. In addition, we have spent considerable time seeking out businesses for which we can either buy 100% or the equity or the majority ownership to begin our operations. As of September 30, 2016, we have not been able to find any clients that we could invoice to receive any cash for such consulting work but we hope to begin collecting for such services in the future.

COMPETITION

Energy and Retail Division

The market for vehicular fuels is highly competitive. The biggest competition for CNG, LNG and other alternative fuels is gasoline and diesel fuel, the production, distribution and sale of which are dominated by large integrated oil companies. The vast majority of vehicles in the United States are powered by gasoline or diesel fuel. There is no assurance that we can compete effectively against other fuels, or that significant, more resourceful competitors will not enter the NG fuel market.

Within the United States, we believe the largest enterprises engaged in CNG sales are: (i) Trillium USA/Pinnacle CNG, a privately held provider of CNG fuel infrastructure and fueling services, which focuses primarily on transit fleets in California, Arizona and New York, and (ii) Hanover Compressor Company, a large publicly-traded international provider of NG compressors and related equipment, which focuses its CNG vehicle fuel business 
 
6

primarily on transit fleets in California, Maryland, Massachusetts and Washington D.C. These companies are significant competitors in the market for transit fleets.

Within the U.S. LNG market, one of the largest competitors is Earth Biofuels, Inc., a public company that distributes LNG in the western United States. Another major competitor, Clean Energy Fuels Corporation, is one of the biggest natural gas fuel station owners and operators in the United States. They own, operate or supply over 300 CNG and LNG fueling stations. In addition, potential entrants to the market for natural gas vehicle fuels include the large integrated oil companies, other retail gasoline marketers and natural gas utility companies. The integrated oil companies produce and sell crude oil and natural gas, and they refine crude oil into gasoline and diesel. They and other retail gasoline marketers own and franchise retail stations that sell gasoline and diesel fuel. In international markets integrated oil companies and other established fueling companies sell CNG at a number of their vehicle fueling stations that sell gasoline and diesel. Natural gas utility companies own and operate the local pipeline infrastructure that supplies natural gas to retail, commercial and industrial customers.

In addition, potential entrants to the market for NG vehicle fuels include the large integrated oil companies, other retail gasoline marketers and natural gas utility companies. The integrated oil companies produce and sell crude oil and NG, and they refine crude oil into gasoline and diesel fuels. They and other retail gasoline marketers own and franchise retail stations that sell gasoline and diesel fuel. In international markets, integrated oil companies and other established fueling companies sell CNG at a number of their vehicle fueling stations that sell gasoline and diesel. NG utility companies own and operate the local pipeline infrastructure that supplies NG to retail, commercial and industrial customers.

Our vehicle conversion business will face, significant competition, including from incumbent technologies, and in particular increased competition with respect to spark-ignited NG engine original equipment manufacturers in China and aftermarket kit providers in Europe. As the market for NG engine products continues to grow this competition may increase. New developments in technology may negatively affect the development or sale of some or all of our products or make our products uncompetitive or obsolete. Other companies, many of which have substantially greater customer bases, businesses and financial and other resources than us, are currently engaged in the development of products and technologies that are similar to, or may be competitive with, certain of our products and technologies. 

Each of our target markets in vehicle conversion is currently serviced by existing manufacturers with existing customers and suppliers using proven and widely accepted technologies. Many existing manufacturers have or had NG engine programs and could develop new engines without our help or components, using more conventional technologies or technologies from competitive companies. Currently, Westport Innovations Inc. (Westport) is the leading manufacturer of low-emission engine and fuel system technologies utilizing gaseous fuels. Its technology and products enable light, medium, heavy-duty and high horsepower petroleum-based fuel engines to use primarily NG and alternative fuels. Westports technology and products enable light (less than 5.9 litre), medium (5.9 to 8.9 litre), heavy-duty (11 to 16 litre) and high-horsepower (greater than 16 litre) petroleum-based fuel engines to use primarily NG, giving users a cleaner and generally less expensive alternative fuel based on a more abundant natural resource. Through their partnerships and direct sales efforts, they sell a large number of NG and propane engines and fuel systems to customers in various nations. Westport also has strategic relationships with the worlds top four engine producers or has strategic relationships with the worlds top truck producers, as well as the worlds top automotive manufacturers. Westport may get into converting the used vehicles to run on NG using their superior technology and capital and may make the small start-up companies such as us competing to convert used vehicles to run on NG no longer profitable to operate.

It is possible that any of these current competitors, in any of our divisions of operation, and other competitors who may enter the market in the future, may create product and service offerings that will make it impossible for us to capture any market segment. Many of these companies have far greater financial and other resources and name recognition than us. Entry or expansion by these companies into the market segment we target for NG vehicle fuels and vehicle conversion may reduce our profit margins, limit our customer base and restrict our expansion opportunities. 

Competition-Healthcare Division


7

ECI-LATAM Inc. is the first subsidiary under our healthcare division. ECIL deals in maintaining large medical equipment that deals in sterilization and disinfection. ECIL also sells spare parts, consumables and service contracts for medical establishments. As of now 100% of ECIL sales and services are performed outside the USA. Also 100% of the maintenance and repairs for the period the financial statements reflect have been done only for the medical equipment belonging to Getinge Group, a public company based in Sweden who manufacture and distribute their own large medical equipment. Getinge Group faces major competition from other major manufacturers on similar medical equipment and if our limited clients chose to use any other machine than the Getinge equipment then we may lose the limited clients ECIL currently has.

We formed La Veles Inc., to manufacture, package and distribute naturally made products to treat dairy animal suffering from mastitis and udder edema in joint venture with a group in Serbia by setting up a factory in Serbia. As mentioned elsewhere in this report after further discussions we have decided not to get involved with production of the infection curing Cream but allow the group in Serbia to manufacture and package the Cream with our Company, most probably through ECI, focus only on distribution of such natural cream and also look to distribute similar natural creams being produced by other producers in the world. Due to this development La Veles Inc. will remain a non-operating company until we decided on any plans for La Veles Inc.

Consulting Division

Our consulting division so far has not made any revenue and the future of the division is not certain at this time. In the event we begun to progress with our plans, our competition will come from small CPA firms and consulting companies who may offer our potential clients similar services.
GOVERNMENTAL REGULATION

Energy and Retail Davison

Federal Clean Air Act  The Federal Clean Air Act provides a comprehensive framework for air quality regulation in the United States. Many of the federal, state and local air pollution control programs regulating vehicles and stationary sources have their basis in Title I or Title II of the Federal Clean Air Act.

Title I of the Federal Clean Air Act charges the EPA with establishing uniform National Ambient Air Quality Standards for criteria air pollutants anticipated to endanger public health and welfare. States in turn have the primary responsibility under the Federal Clean Air Act for meeting these standards. If any area within a particular state fails to meet these standards for a criteria air pollutant, the state must develop an implementation plan and local agencies must develop air quality management plans for achieving these standards. Many state programs regulating stationary source emissions, vehicle pollution or mobile sources of pollution are developed as part of a state implementation plan. For mobile sources, two criteria pollutants in particular are of concern: ozone and particulate matter. As components of state implementation plans, individual states have also adopted diesel fuel standards intended to reduce nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide (collectively, NOx) and particulate matter emissions. Texas and California, for example, have both adopted low-NOx diesel programs. Additionally, many state implementation plans and some quality management plans include vehicle fleet requirements specifying the use of low emission or alternative fuels in government vehicles.

Title II of the Federal Clean Air Act authorizes the EPA to establish emission standards for vehicles and engines. Diesel fueled heavy duty trucks and buses have recently accounted for substantial portions of NOx and particulate matter emissions from mobile sources, and diesel emissions have received significant attention from environmental groups and state agencies. Further, the 2007 Highway Rule seeks to limit emissions from diesel fueled trucks and buses on two fronts: new tailpipe standards requiring significantly reduced NOx and particulate matter emissions for new heavy duty diesel engines, and new standards requiring refiners to produce low sulfur diesel fuels that will enable more extensive use of advanced pollution control technologies on diesel engines.

The 2007 Highway Rules tailpipe standards apply to new diesel engines. Specifically, new particulate matter standards took effect in the model year 2007 and new NOx standards were phased in between 2007 and 2010. The rules fuel standards call for a shift by US refiners and importers from low sulfur diesel, with a sulfur content of 500 parts per million (ppm), to ultra-low sulfur diesel, with a sulfur content of 15 ppm. The rule, which effects a

transition to ultra-low sulfur diesel, required refiners to begin producing ultra-low sulfur diesel fuels on June 1, 2006.

Although the majority of state air pollution control regulations are components of state implementation plans developed pursuant to Title I of the Federal Clean Air Act, states are not precluded from developing their own air pollution control programs under state law. For example, the California Air Resources Board and the South Coast Air Quality Management District have promulgated a series of airborne toxic control measures under California law, several of which are directed toward reducing emissions from diesel fueled engines.

Although the federal government has not adopted any laws that comprehensively regulate greenhouse gas emissions, the EPA is developing regulations that would regulate these pollutants under the Clean Air Act.
