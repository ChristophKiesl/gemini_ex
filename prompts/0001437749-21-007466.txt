During periods prior to the quarter ended June 30, 2019, the Company also operated through a fifth reportable segment, Home Services Operations, comprised of former subsidiary Specialty Contracting Group, LLC’s operation of HVAC and plumbing companies in Arizona. However, for the year ended December 31, 2020, and for all prior periods presented, Home Services Operations are reported as discontinued operations.
 
The management of the Company also continually reviews various business opportunities for the Company, including those in other lines of business.
 
Asset Management Operations
 
The Company operates its asset management operations business through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Willow Oak Asset Management, LLC (“Willow Oak”) and Willow Oak Capital Management, LLC.
 
Willow Oak is an asset management platform focused on growing and enhancing the alternative investment landscape. Willow Oak seeks partnerships with alternative investment managers in the early stages of growth in order to build a network of unique investment opportunities for investors and scalable, professional operations for managers. Willow Oak offers affiliated managers strategic consulting, operational support and growth opportunities through minority partnerships and other bespoke relationships. Affiliations to date include fund seeding and reinvestments, fund launching, investor relations, and fund management administrative support. The Company intends to actively expand its Willow Oak platform with additional offerings that enhance the value of the Willow Oak platform to managers and funds across the investing community. 
 
On August 21, 2020, Willow Oak created two wholly-owned entities, Willow Oak Asset Management Affiliate Management Services, LLC (“Willow Oak AMS”) and Willow Oak Asset Management Fund Management Services, LLC (“Willow Oak FMS”), to support this partnership model in perpetuity. Willow Oak AMS earns gross revenue shares commensurate with ownership stakes in investment management firms in exchange for the provision of benefits of affiliation and ongoing fund management services (“FMS”). Willow Oak FMS earns a direct fee from affiliated limited partnerships for rendering administrative, compliance, and tax and audit liaison services. 
 
Real Estate Operations
 
As has been previously reported in December 2017, ENDI created a wholly-owned subsidiary named Mt Melrose, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (“New Mt Melrose”), to acquire a portfolio of residential and other income-producing real estate in Lexington, Kentucky, pursuant to a certain Master Real Estate Asset Purchase Agreement entered into in December 2017 with a like-named seller, Mt. Melrose, LLC (“Old Mt. Melrose”), a Kentucky limited liability company owned by Jeff Moore, then an ENDI director. During January and June 2018, New Mt Melrose, consistent with the terms of the purchase agreement, completed two bundled acquisitions from Old Mt. Melrose of residential and other income-producing real properties located in Lexington, Kentucky. As has been previously reported, on June 27, 2019, the Company sold 65% of its membership interest in New Mt Melrose to an unaffiliated third-party purchaser, Woodmont Lexington, LLC (“Woodmont”). As consideration for the transaction, Woodmont paid the Company $100,000 and agreed to assume full responsibility for the management and operation of New Mt Melrose and its real estate portfolio. As a result of no longer having a controlling financial interest, the Company deconsolidated the operations of New Mt Melrose as of June 27, 2019. See Note 4 for more information.
 
Our other real estate operations include activity from a legacy real estate investment portfolio held through EDI Real Estate, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary. The portfolio, primarily located in the Roanoke area of Virginia, includes residential properties and vacant land. The portfolio includes single-family homes that are currently rented and managed through a third-party property manager, as well as other properties being listed for sale.
 
Internet Operations
 
The Company operates its internet operations segment through Sitestar.net, a wholly-owned subsidiary that offers consumer and business-grade internet access, wholesale managed modem services, web hosting, third-party software as a reseller, and various ancillary services. Sitestar.net provides services to customers in the United States and Canada.

Other Operations
 
Other operations include nonrecurring or one-time strategic funding or similar activity that is not considered to be one of the Company’s primary lines of business. This activity includes opportunities such as the Company’s former investment activity with Huckleberry Real Estate Fund II, LLC and its existing financing arrangement regarding Triad Guaranty, Inc.
 
Other operations also include any revenue or expenses derived from corporate office operations, as well as expenses related to public company reporting, the oversight of subsidiaries, and other items that affect the overall Company.
 
Discontinued Operations - Home Services Operations
 
Prior to May 24, 2019, the Company operated a home services operations segment through its former subsidiary, Specialty Contracting Group, LLC (formerly known as HVAC Value Fund, LLC). The Company had organized and launched this subsidiary in June 2016, initially with an unaffiliated third party. Specialty Contracting Group was focused on the management of HVAC and plumbing companies in Arizona.
 
As has been previously reported, on May 24, 2019, the Company, via Specialty Contracting Group, completed a divestiture of the home services operations to an unaffiliated third-parity purchaser, Rooter Hero Plumbing, Inc. (“Rooter Hero”). In the transaction, all of Specialty Contracting Group’s personal property and customer lists and records were conveyed to Rooter Hero, excluding stock inventory and other current assets. As part of the transaction, Rooter Hero assumed Specialty Contracting Group’s obligations under lease and/or loan agreements for all outstanding vehicles and equipment, as well as the obligations to service all of the subsidiary’s then-remaining customer accounts going forward. No cash consideration was exchanged in the transaction. Rather, as consideration for the transaction, Rooter Hero agreed to pay monthly royalties for the sixty (60) months following the closing calculated on the basis of any revenue actually received from the customer accounts transferred (7.5% of any monthly revenue generated from qualified sales during the first year, and 5% of any such monthly revenue during years two through five; in each case subject to reduction for pre-approved warranty-related costs concerning select customers). 
 
On October 22, 2019, the Company, as and being the sole and managing member of Specialty Contracting Group, LLC, resolved to dissolve and wind up Specialty Contracting Group and proceed with distributing its assets in accordance with §18-804 of the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act. Management had determined that Specialty Contracting Group’s continued existence was not reasonably practicable or financially feasible; the entity having no operational capabilities, no significant assets, and no prospects for the carrying on of any business or receipt of revenue. All of Specialty Contracting Group’s cash on hand was paid out ratably to its creditors and claimants; however, its assets were not sufficient to satisfy in full its known liabilities. After making such payments out of and to the extent of its assets, Specialty Contracting Group filed a Certificate of Cancellation with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware on November 15, 2019, thereby effecting the cancellation and termination of the legal existence of the entity.

Real Estate Operations
 
As has been previously reported, in December 2017, ENDI created New Mt Melrose, a wholly-owned subsidiary at that time, to acquire a portfolio of residential and other income-producing real estate in Lexington, Kentucky, pursuant to a certain Master Real Estate Asset Purchase Agreement entered into in December 2017 with the seller, Old Mt. Melrose. During January and June 2018, New Mt Melrose, consistent with the terms of the purchase agreement, completed two bundled acquisitions from Old Mt. Melrose of residential and other income-producing real properties located in Lexington, Kentucky. As has been previously reported, on June 27, 2019, the Company sold 65% of its membership interest in New Mt Melrose to Woodmont, which agreed to assume full responsibility for the management and operation of New Mt Melrose and its real estate portfolio. As a result of no longer having a controlling financial interest, the Company deconsolidated the operations of New Mt Melrose as of June 27, 2019. See Note 4 for more information.
 
As has been previously reported, in July 2017, ENDI created a wholly-owned real estate subsidiary named EDI Real Estate, LLC, to hold ENDI’s legacy portfolio of real estate. As of December 31, 2020, through EDI Real Estate, LLC, ENDI owns a legacy real estate investment portfolio that includes four residential properties and vacant land. Our real estate portfolio under EDI Real Estate, LLC is primarily located in Roanoke, Virginia. The portfolio includes occupied single-family homes that are managed by a third-party property management company. The leases in effect as of December 31, 2020, are based on annual time periods and include month-to-month provisions after the completion of the initial term.
 
State and municipal laws and regulations govern the real estate industry and do not vary significantly from one community to another. State laws, including the Virginia Residential Landlord and Tenant Act, in addition to local ordinances, govern rental properties and also do not vary significantly throughout our real estate holding areas.
 
Internet Operations
 
The Company operates its internet operations segment through Sitestar.net, a wholly-owned subsidiary. Sitestar.net is an Internet Service Provider (ISP) that offers consumer and business-grade internet access, wholesale managed modem services, web hosting, third-party software as a reseller, and various ancillary services. We provide services to customers in the United States and Canada. This segment markets and sells narrow-band (dial-up and ISDN) and broadband services (DSL and fiber-optic), as well as web hosting and related services to consumers and businesses.
 
Our primary competitors include regional and national cable and telecommunications companies that have substantially greater market presence, brand-name recognition, and financial resources compared to Sitestar.net. Secondary competitors include local and regional ISPs.
 
The residential broadband internet access market is dominated by cable and telecommunications companies. These companies offer internet connectivity through the use of cable modems, Digital Subscriber Line (DSL) programs, and fiber. These competitors have extensive scale and significantly more resources than Sitestar.net. Competitors often offer incentives for customers to purchase internet access by offering discounts for bundled service offerings (i.e., phone, television, Internet). While we are a reseller of broadband services including DSL and fiber services, our profit margin is heavily influenced by these competitive forces.
 
There are currently laws and regulations directly applicable to access or commerce on the internet, covering issues such as user privacy, freedom of expression, pricing, characteristics and quality of products and services, taxation, advertising, intellectual property rights, information security, and the convergence of traditional telecommunications services with Internet communications. We may be positively or negatively affected by the repeal, modification, or adoption of various laws and regulations. These changes may occur at the international, federal, state, and local levels, and may cover a wide range of issues.
 
As of December 31, 2020, the focus of our internet operations segment is to generate cash flow, work to make our costs variable, and reinvest in our operations when an acceptable return is available. We did not make significant reinvestments into the internet operations segment during the year ended December 31, 2020.
 
Management routinely endeavors to identify the market value for domain names owned by the Company in order to assess potential income opportunities. Management evaluates these domain names for third-party sales potential, as well as for other marketing opportunities that could generate new revenue from current customers who utilize the domains.

The Company initially contributed $100,000. Triad Guaranty, Inc. exited bankruptcy in April 2018, and the Company subsequently entered into an amended and restated promissory note. As part of the amended and restated promissory note, the Company provided an additional contribution in the amount of $55,000 in May 2018. The terms of the promissory note provided for interest in the amount of 10% annually and the issuance of warrants in Triad Guaranty, Inc. equal to 2.5% of the company.
