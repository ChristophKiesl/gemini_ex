Item 1. Business 
OVERVIEW 
 
CohBar (“CohBar,” “we,” “us,” “our,” “its” or the “Company”) is a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the research and development of mitochondria based therapeutics (MBTs), an emerging class of drugs for the treatment of chronic and age-related diseases. Mitochondria based therapeutics originate from the discovery by CohBar’s founders of a novel group of naturally occurring mitochondrial-derived peptides within the mitochondrial genome that regulate metabolism and cell death, and whose biological activity declines with age. To date, the Company has discovered more than 100 mitochondrial-derived peptides. CohBar’s efforts focus on the development of these peptides into therapeutics that offer the potential to address a broad range of diseases, including nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), obesity, fibrotic diseases including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) including COVID-19 associated ARDS, cancer, type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. The Company’s lead compound, CB4211, is in the Phase 1b stage of a Phase 1a/1b clinical trial for NASH and obesity. In addition, CohBar has four preclinical programs, including one in fibrotic diseases, one in ARDS and two in cancer.

We substantially expanded our preclinical pipeline in 2020. Our expanded pipeline greatly strengthens our belief that there are potentially multiple novel therapeutics that can be developed from peptides encoded in the mitochondrial genome.
 
 The application of MBTs originates from almost two decades of research by our founders, resulting in their discovery of a novel group of mitochondrial-derived peptides (MDPs) encoded within the mitochondrial genome. Some of these naturally occurring MDPs and their analogs have demonstrated a range of biological activity and therapeutic potential in research models across multiple diseases including NASH, obesity, cancer, fibrotic diseases including IPF, ARDS, T2D, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Many chronic and age-related diseases are associated with a decrease in number and function of mitochondria.
 
Mitochondrial dysfunction can result in decreased levels of mitochondrially encoded peptides, some of which are secreted and have been shown to regulate cellular, metabolic, immunologic and other key processes, ranging from energy homeostasis to cytoprotection. We believe MBTs, which are novel modified analogs of mitochondrially derived peptides, represent an entirely new frontier and an emerging new class of potential drugs for the treatment of chronic and age-related diseases.
 
We believe CohBar is the first mover in exploring the mitochondrial genome for therapeutically relevant peptides, and has developed a proprietary MBT technology platform, using cell-based assays and animal models of disease, to rapidly identify naturally occurring MDPs with promising biological activity. Once identified, we deploy powerful development techniques to improve the drug-like properties of our MBT candidates, enabling us to match the most biologically promising peptides to disease indications that have substantial unmet medical needs. Our ongoing research and development activities focus on discovery and development of novel improved MDP analogs that have the greatest therapeutic and commercial potential.
 
Our first clinical candidate, CB4211, is a potential treatment for NASH and obesity. It is a novel peptide initially developed from a MOTS-c MDP. In July 2018, we initiated a Phase 1a/1b clinical study of CB4211, which was designed to initially assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CB4211 following single and multiple-ascending doses in healthy subjects.
 
In November 2019, the double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1a stage was completed and the blinded safety and tolerability data supported advancement to the Phase 1b stage of the study.
 
In November 2019, we initiated recruitment for the Phase 1b stage, which is designed to assess the safety, tolerability and activity of CB4211 in obese subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Assessments will include changes in liver fat assessed by MRI-PDFF, body weight and biomarkers relevant to NASH and obesity. On March 30, 2020, we announced a delay in the completion of our Phase 1b study due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The delay was a result of a pause by some of our clinical research organization partners in all of their activities related to the study in response to COVID-19. On July 7, 2020, we announced the resumption of our Phase 1b study. In March 2021, we completed the enrollment for the Phase 1b clinical trial. Based on positive clinical results and additional funding from potential partnerships and general fundraising, we plan to initiate preparations for a Phase 2 study of CB4211 in 2021 and initiate a Phase 2 study in 2022.
 
Our internal discovery efforts have resulted in the identification of more than 100 previously unidentified peptides encoded within the mitochondrial genome. Many of these MDPs and their analogs have demonstrated various degrees of biological activity in cell based and/or animal models relevant to a wide range of diseases, such as NASH, obesity, fibrotic diseases, ARDS, cancer and T2D. Our research efforts have further identified and focused on certain of these MDPs and their analogs that have demonstrated the greatest therapeutic potential for treating indications related to those diseases. CohBar has four preclinical programs: CB5138 Analogs for IPF and other Fibrotic Diseases; CB5064 Analogs for ARDS, including COVID-19 Associated ARDS; CB5046 Analogs for Cancer and Other Disease Indications and MBT3 Analogs for Cancer Immunotherapy.

OUR PIPELINE 
 
Our research efforts are focused on identifying, assessing and optimizing new analogs of biologically active MDPs and advancing those candidates with the greatest therapeutic and commercial potential. Our pipeline includes a number of novel peptide analogs of MDPs in different stages of research evaluation as potential MBTs, and one MBT currently in clinical development.
 
CB4211
 
In July 2018, we announced the initiation of the Phase 1a stage of a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 1a/1b clinical study of our first lead MBT candidate, CB4211, for the potential treatment of NASH and obesity. The Phase 1a stage of the clinical study is designed to initially assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of CB4211 following single and multiple-ascending doses in healthy subjects. The Phase 1b stage of the clinical study is an assessment of safety, tolerability and activity in obese subjects with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Assessments will include changes in liver fat assessed by MRI-PDFF, body weight and biomarkers relevant to NASH and obesity.

In November 2018, we announced a temporary suspension of the Phase 1a stage of our Phase 1a/1b clinical study of CB4211 to address mild, but persistent injection site reactions. These injection site reactions were generally seen as painless bumps at the injection site that can be felt under the skin, but in most cases would be otherwise undetectable. Based on the data accumulated and expert review, we believe that some of the administered dose of CB4211 remained localized in the tissue at the injection site, thereby causing these bumps to occur. In May 2019, we received regulatory feedback on our plan to address this issue, and in June 2019, we resumed the trial. Since the study resumed, we have not observed any persistent injection site bumps.
 
In November 2019, we announced the completion of the Phase 1a portion of the clinical trial, with the drug being well-tolerated, and the commencement of the recruiting phase of the final Phase 1b stage of the study. On March 30, 2020, we announced a delay in the completion of our Phase 1b study due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The delay was a result of a pause by some of our clinical research organization partners in all of their activities related to the study in response to COVID-19. On July 7, 2020, we announced the resumption of our Phase 1b study. In March 2021, we completed the enrollment for the Phase 1b clinical trial. While topline data is expected at the end of the second quarter of 2021, it is dependent upon a number of factors such as the last patient visit, and therefore, we cannot predict with certainty when such data will be available.
 
CB4211, discovered by CohBar, is a novel, enhanced analog of MOTS-c, a naturally occurring mitochondrial peptide discovered by Dr. Pinchas Cohen and his academic collaborators in 2012. Their research in cell-based assays and animal models indicated that MOTS-c plays a significant role in the regulation of metabolism. Certain of the original MOTS-c studies were published in an article entitled “The Mitochondrial-Derived Peptide, MOTS-c, Promotes Metabolic Homeostasis and Reduces Obesity and Insulin Resistance,” which appeared in the March 3, 2015 edition of the journal Cell Metabolism.
 
In preclinical studies conducted by CohBar, CB4211 demonstrated significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of NASH, showing improvements in triglyceride levels, as well as favorable effects on liver enzyme markers associated with NAFLD and NASH. CB4211 also demonstrated significant therapeutic potential for the treatment of obesity, demonstrating significantly greater weight loss together with more selective reduction of fat mass versus lean mass in comparison to a market-leading obesity drug in DIO mice. The therapeutic effects of CB4211 have been further evaluated in the well-established Stelic Animal Model (STAM™) of NASH. In this model, treatment with CB4211 resulted in a significant reduction of the non-alcoholic fatty liver disease activity score, or NAS, a composite measure of steatosis (fat accumulation), inflammation and hepatocyte ballooning (cellular injury). Data from these studies were presented at the American Association for the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) 2017 Liver Meeting® in October, 2017.
 
In addition to the therapeutic potential indicated by the preclinical models described above, data were presented at the 2018 American Diabetes Association meeting providing in vitro evidence that CB4211 inhibits adipocyte lipolysis, a process that is foundational in the development of liver steatosis, through an insulin-dependent mechanism. These data provide a potential mechanistic explanation for previous observations in vivo, including efficacy of CB4211 in animal models of NASH, and anti-steatotic effects on livers of mice on a high fat diet, where a corresponding reduction in circulating fat and biomarkers of liver damage was also observed. The activity of CB4211 appears to involve sensitizing insulin action on the insulin receptor.
 
Research Programs
 
Our research activities are focused on discovering, developing and prioritizing MDP analogs for development as potential MBTs. Our criteria include examining MDP analogs with the greatest commercial and therapeutic potential, the most suitable development and clinical resources, and the broadest intellectual property protection and exploitation opportunities.

We have substantially expanded our preclinical pipeline in the last year. This expanded pipeline greatly strengthens our belief that there are potentially multiple novel therapeutics that can be developed from peptides encoded in the mitochondrial genome.
 
 CohBar Discovered MDPs and Analogs 
 
Our discovery efforts have resulted in the identification of more than 100 previously unidentified peptides encoded within the mitochondrial genome. Many of these MDPs and their analogs have demonstrated various degrees of biological activity in cell based and/or animal models relevant to a wide range of diseases, such as NASH, obesity, fibrotic diseases including IPF, ARDS, cancer, T2D, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases. Our research efforts have further identified and focused on certain of these MDPs and their analogs that have demonstrated greatest therapeutic potential for treating indications related to those diseases.
 
CB5138 Analogs for IPF and other Fibrotic Diseases: Our discovery efforts have identified CB5138 Analogs, a family of novel peptides with potential for use as treatments for fibrotic diseases. In co-cultures of human lung cells, CB5138-1 decreased the expression of key fibrosis biomarkers, including alpha smooth muscle actin (αSMA), and collagen types I and III. CB5138-1 also decreased the transformation of healthy lung cells into fibrotic cells after induction by TGF-beta1, resulting in reduced production of the fibrotic components αSMA and pro-collagen I alpha 1. In vivo, CB5138-1 decreased lung fibrosis and inflammation in both the prophylactic mouse model of IPF, initiating treatment with the peptide immediately after fibrosis induction by bleomycin, and in the therapeutic mouse model of IPF, starting peptide treatment one week after induction. In addition, using the more exacting therapeutic model of IPF, two new analogs of CB5138 (CB5138-2 and CB5138-3) significantly reduced lung fibrosis assessed by the Ashcroft Score, reduced inflammation, and decreased fibrosis-related changes in lung weight, collagen deposition in lung tissue, and collagen secretion into lung fluid. In addition, we have demonstrated that a CB5138 Analog has enhanced effects when combined with nintedanib, the leading treatment for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF), suggesting potential utility for combination therapy in IPF. In the first quarter of 2021, we identified CB5138-3 as the lead clinical candidate in this program and our goal is to initiate IND-enabling activities with the potential to file an IND in 2022.
 
CB5064 Analogs for COVID-19 Associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) and ARDS: Our internal discovery efforts have identified CB5064 Analogs, a family of peptides that are agonists of the apelin receptor with potential for use as therapeutics for COVID-19 associated ARDS and ARDS in general. In May 2020, we initiated testing of CB5064 Analogs in preclinical models of ARDS. In the preclinical studies, acute lung injury was induced in mice by administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a bacterial toxin that produces similar symptoms to other causes of ARDS, including fluid accumulation and cytokine secretion. A single dose of CB5064 Analog was administered one hour prior to the LPS exposure, and effects on lung weight and levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were measured at 4 hours after LPS exposure. Treatment with CB5064 Analogs reduced fluid accumulation in the lungs and a corresponding broad reduction in levels of key pro-inflammatory cytokines secreted into the lung fluid, when compared to treatment with a placebo control. We previously demonstrated the beneficial effects of this novel family of peptides on glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, and weight loss in an obese mouse model of T2D, as presented at the American Diabetes Association in 2019. In January 2021, we signed a Non-Clinical Evaluation Agreement (NCEA) with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) initiating a collaboration to evaluate the potential of CB5064 Analogs for the treatment of COVID-19 associated Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). In parallel with the work being conducted by NIAID, we are currently performing the required studies in this program to select a candidate. Based on successful outcomes of those studies and additional funding, we will nominate a clinical candidate followed by initiation of pre-IND work in 2021, with the longer-term goal of initiating a Phase 1 study.
 
CB5046 Analogs for Cancer and Other Disease Indications: Our internal discovery efforts have identified CB5046 Analogs, a family of novel potent and selective peptide inhibitors of CXCR4, a key chemokine receptor involved in tumor growth, metastasis and avoidance of immune surveillance that is overexpressed in 75% of human tumors. CXCR4 is also involved in localization of healthy stem cells and in certain genetic diseases. We have demonstrated positive effects of one of the CB5046 Analogs when administered in combination with chemotherapy in an animal model of aggressive melanoma. We are screening multiple peptide analogs for in vitro activity and plan to explore the potential for use initially in stem cell mobilization and hematologic cancers.

MBT3 Analogs for Cancer Immunotherapy: Our discovery efforts identified a novel peptide family, MBT3 Analogs. We have demonstrated the enhanced killing of cancer cells by human immune cells in the presence of an MBT3 Analog, and plan to further explore the therapeutic potential of this analog family for treatment of cancer, subject to resource availability and the requirements of our more-advanced programs.
 
CohBar Licensed MDPs and Analogs 
 
SHLP Analogs: Our founders and their academic collaborators discovered several MDPs encoded within the mitochondrial genome; we refer to these as small humanin-like peptides, or SHLPs. In cancer treatment models in cell culture and in mice, SHLP-6 demonstrated suppression of cancer progression via mechanisms involving both suppression of tumor angiogenesis (blood vessel development) and induction of apoptosis (cancer cell death). There is also in vivo research evidence to suggest that SHLP-2 has protective effects against neuronal toxicity.
 
Humanin Analogs: Our founders and others have demonstrated the protective effects of the humanin MDP in various animal models of age-related diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease, atherosclerosis, myocardial and cerebral ischemia and T2D. Humanin levels in humans have been shown to decline with age, and elevated levels of humanin together with lower incidence of age-related diseases have been observed in centenarians as well as their offspring. 
 
All of our pipeline peptides, except for CB4211, our first clinical candidate and CB5138-3, our second clinical candidate, are in various stages of research. There is no guarantee that any additional MDP analog will be advanced to clinical development, or that the activity demonstrated in preclinical research models will be shown in human testing.
 
OUR TECHNOLOGY PLATFORM 
 
Our proprietary technology platform is designed to rapidly identify therapeutically relevant peptides encoded within the mitochondrial genome, to evaluate their biological activity, and to develop these peptides into novel refined MBTs that have the potential to treat diseases with major unmet medical needs. We use a broad range of proprietary activity screens to assess the therapeutic potential of our novel peptides and to prioritize our development opportunities. Some of our novel peptides have demonstrated promising biological effects in a variety of in vitro and/or in vivo models of age-related diseases. We are prioritizing the research and development of our novel peptides by assessing their activity in a variety of areas such as metabolic regulation, oxidative stress, cellular energy levels, cell proliferation, cell death, cellular protection, carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, body weight regulation, regulation of body fat, insulin sensitivity, regulation of glucose, glucose tolerance, liver function, regulation of fibrotic processes, immunomodulatory effects, tumor growth, etc.
Disease Focus
 
Our research and development focus is on chronic diseases. Our research to date suggests multiple potential therapeutic disease indications for some of our pipeline MDPs. While we believe our current and future MBT drug candidates we identify would initially be advanced against one of the following diseases as a primary indication, it is possible that we may determine to advance a drug candidate for treatment of a different disease as a primary indication. We may determine to advance any future drug candidate against an alternative primary disease indication if, for example, additional data suggests greater therapeutic potential for the drug candidate against the alternative indication, or we determine that the development, approval or commercialization pathway may be more favorable for a drug candidate targeted against the alternative indication.

NAFLD and NASH – Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the build-up of extra fat in liver cells that is not due to alcohol consumption and tends to develop in people who are overweight or obese or have diabetes, high cholesterol or high levels of triglycerides. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a more severe form of NAFLD characterized by swelling of the liver that eventually may lead to scarring (cirrhosis) and over time to liver cancer or liver failure. NAFLD affects between 30-40% of the U.S. adult population while as many as 12% of U.S. adults may have NASH. Currently, there are no FDA approved treatments for NAFLD/NASH.
Obesity –– Obesity is now recognized as the most prevalent metabolic disease world-wide, reaching epidemic proportions in both developed and developing countries and affecting all age groups.  More than one-third of the U.S. adult population, and over 45% of U.S. age groups between 45 and 75, have obesity.  The prevalence of class III, or morbid, obesity (body mass index ≥40) has increased dramatically in several countries and currently affects approximately 8% of adults in the U.S., with an estimated increase of 130% over the next two decades. It is expected that by 2030 approximately 50% of the U.S. adult population will be obese and one in four will have severe obesity. Obesity is a major risk factor for age-related diseases such as heart disease, stroke, T2D and certain types of cancer.
Fibrotic Diseases – Fibrosis describes the formation of fibrous connective tissue in an organ or tissue as a reparative response to an injury or damage. “Scarring” occurs when fibrosis develops in response to injury. Fibrotic diseases include diseases that result in fibrosis, such as lung or pulmonary fibrosis, liver fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, skin fibrosis, systemic sclerosis and others.
Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome - ARDS can be triggered by viral or bacterial pneumonia, sepsis, trauma or other events and represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality. There is a high unmet need for a safe and effective treatment of ARDS due to its high mortality rate and lack of effective drug treatments, affecting three million patients annually. ARDS also prolongs hospital stays and requires convalescence in the hospital and rehabilitation. An effective therapy would reduce time on ventilators and in the ICU, reduce mortality, and improve quality of life.
Cancer – Cancer is a generic term for a large group of diseases that can affect any part of the body. One defining feature of cancer is the rapid creation of abnormal cells that grow beyond their usual boundaries, and which can then invade adjoining parts of the body and spread to other organs. This process is referred to as metastasis. Metastases are a major cause of death from cancer. Cancer is a leading cause of death worldwide. Cancer treatments such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy and other treatments are used to destroy cancer cells. The goal of cancer drugs is to cure the disease or, when a cure is not possible, to prolong life or improve quality of life for patients with incurable cancer.
Other Potential Disease Indications for MBTs
 
Previous preclinical studies have demonstrated potential utility of certain MDPs or their analogs in models of the following disease indications:
 
Neurodegenerative disease – In the brain, neurons connect and communicate at synapses, where tiny bursts of chemicals called neurotransmitters carry information from one cell to another. Alzheimer’s, a neurodegenerative disease, disrupts this process and eventually destroys synapses and kills neurons, damaging the brain’s communication network. There is no cure, and medications on the market today treat only the symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and do not have the ability to stop its onset or its progression. There is an urgent and unmet need for both a disease-modifying drug for Alzheimer’s disease as well as for better symptomatic treatments.

Cardiovascular – Heart disease is a leading cause of death for both men and women in the United States. Atherosclerosis is a cardiovascular disease commonly referred to as a “hardening” or furring of the arteries. It is caused by the formation of multiple atheromatous plaques within the arteries. This process is the major underlying risk for developing myocardial infarction (heart attack) as those plaques will either narrow the vessel or rupture the vessel, preventing blood flow in the coronary artery to parts of the heart muscle. Cholesterol lowering drugs are considered the main preventive approach to treat atherosclerosis, however these drugs are estimated to prevent only one-third of incidences of myocardial infarction, and there is significant unmet need for additional therapeutic options.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus – T2D is a chronic disease characterized by a relative deficiency in insulin production and secretion by the pancreas and an inability of the body to respond to insulin normally, i.e. insulin resistance. Hyperglycemia, or raised blood sugar, is a common effect of uncontrolled diabetes and over time leads to serious damage to many of the body’s systems, especially the nerves, kidneys, eyes and blood vessels.
 
COMPETITION 
 
The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products. While we believe that our scientific knowledge, technology, and research and development experience provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including major pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic institutions and governmental agencies, and public and private research institutions. Many of our competitors may have significantly greater financial resources and capabilities for research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. 
 
There are no approved therapies for the treatment of NAFLD and NASH, but numerous therapies are in development for NASH. These potential therapies are varied in modality and mechanism of action and may provide significant competition, if approved, for any of our product candidates for which we obtain market approval. Competitive products or therapies for NASH that are in development may become available and provide efficacy, safety, convenience and other benefits that could provide significant competition for any of our product candidates for which we obtain market approval.
 
If a CohBar MBT is developed and approved for the treatment of patients with obesity, it may compete with products currently approved for obesity, such as Saxenda, Contrave, phentermine (Adipex) and other sympathomimetic amines approved for short term use (a few weeks) such as benzphetamine (Didex), diethyoproprion (Tenuate) and phendimetrazine (Bontril), Xenical and Alli, and Qsymia, as well as several investigational therapies that are currently being studied for the treatment of obesity. The list of investigational therapies, while not exhaustive, includes such potential therapies as CB1-receptor-antagonists, 5-HT receptor agonists, SGLT-2 antagonists, GLP-1 agonists, Adenylate Cyclase 3 activators, GLP1 and GIP co-agonists, GLP1, Glucagon co-agonists and activin II receptor antibodies, plus other centrally acting drugs, triple agonists, other gut hormone derived drugs, amylin mimetics such as davalintide, dual amylin and calcitonin receptor agonists, peptide YY, leptin analogues such as combination pramlintide-metreleptin, and other products such as the methionine aminopeptidase 2 inhibitors, the lipase inhibitor, cetilistat, the triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor, tesofensine, fibroblast growth factor 21 and anti-obesity vaccines against ghrelin, somatostatin, and adenovirus36. 
 
If a CohBar MBT is developed and approved for treatment of patients with NASH, it may compete with several investigational therapies that are currently being studied for the treatment of NAFLD/NASH including, for example, FXR activators, PXR activators, ACC1/2 inhibitors, PPAR-α, -γ and -δ activators, SREBP2/MIR-33a inhibitors, DGAT1 or 2 inhibitors, CCR2/5 antagonists, TRbeta agonists, uncouplers, GLP1 agonists and dual and triple incretin agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, FGF19 and 21 analogs, galectin 3 antagonists, CXCR3 antagonists and numerous other potential therapeutics.

If a CohBar MBT is developed and approved for the treatment of patients with a fibrotic disease, it would compete with all approved therapies for the disease it is approved to treat. Since the specific fibrotic disease that these investigational therapies might be approved to treat is unknown, and approved therapies for fibrotic diseases are often studied in other types of fibrotic disease for which the sponsor may seek approval, they would theoretically compete with any pharmaceutical agent that is approved to treat fibrotic disease. Both new and existing drugs are being studied for the treatment of fibrotic diseases. If these investigational indications were approved, they could also compete with an MBT developed and approved for the treatment of the fibrotic disease.
 
If a CohBar MBT is developed and approved for treatment of patients with IPF, it would compete with drugs that are approved to treat IPF, including nintedanib (Ofev) and Pirfenidone (Esbriet). In addition, there are several classes of investigational drugs being studied to treat IPF, and if these investigational therapies were approved, they would also compete with an MBT developed and approved for IPF.
 
If a CohBar MBT is developed and approved for the treatment of patients with cancer, it would compete with all approved therapies for the cancer it is approved to treat. Since the specific cancer that these investigational therapies might be approved to treat is unknown, and approved therapies for cancer are often studied in multiple other cancers for which the sponsor may seek approval, they would theoretically compete with any pharmaceutical agent that is approved to treat cancer. Both new and existing drugs are being studied for the treatment of cancer, and if these investigational indications were approved, they could also compete with an MBT developed and approved for the treatment of cancer.
 
If a CohBar MBT is developed and approved for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer’s disease or other neurodegenerative diseases, it would compete with all approved therapies to treat Alzheimer’s disease including donepezil (Aricept), galantamine (Razadyne), memantine (Namenda), rivastigmine (Exelon) and tacrine (Cognex). In addition, there are several investigational drugs being studied to treat Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases that, if approved, would also compete with an MBT developed and approved for the treatment of Alzheimer’s and other neurodegenerative diseases.
 
If a CohBar MBT is developed and approved for treatment of patients with T2DM, it would compete with several classes of drugs for T2DM that are approved to improve glucose control, including sulfonylureas, glinides, PPAR gamma agonists, biguanides including metformin, alpha glucosidase inhibitors, DPP IV inhibitors, GLP1 agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, bromocriptine and insulin. Insulin sensitizing agents approved to treat T2D are the PPAR gamma agonists pioglitazone and rosiglitazone. Some of the agents approved to treat T2DM are not generic, are oral once-daily pills and are effective in lowering glucose and A1C. Drugs approved for obesity as well as surgical management of obesity and approved and investigational devices used in GI tract may also be used to treat T2D. In addition, there are several investigational drugs being studied to treat T2D, and if these investigational therapies were approved, they would also compete with an MBT developed and approved for T2D.
 
FINANCING
 
Our business strategy and plans for research and development of our MDPs and MBT candidates includes periodic infusion of new capital to our Company. We may seek to obtain funding for our business through partnership agreements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or through the issuance and sale of debt or equity securities in capital raising transactions.

PARTNERING
 
We believe our technology platform provides multiple opportunities for value creation. Our multiplexed peptide optimization process is designed to discover numerous potential drug candidate opportunities with near term value. These drug candidates can be internally developed by CohBar or advanced through strategic partnerships with larger biopharmaceutical companies. At the same time, our strategy of capturing the most valuable MBT space by aggressively filing for broad intellectual property coverage is designed to secure CohBar’s leadership role in the field and protect our ability to create additional value in the future.
EMPLOYEES AND HUMAN CAPITAL RESOURCES
 
As of March 25, 2021, we had 12 employees, eleven full-time and one part-time. In addition to our employees, our founders consult directly with our employees and scientific staff from time to time to advance our research programs. Our founders provide advisory services in the areas of peptide research, genetics, aging and age-related diseases, drug discovery, development and commercialization, and other areas relevant to our business. Additionally, from time to time we engage other subject-matter experts on a consulting basis in specific areas of our research and development efforts. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have not experienced any work stoppages and we consider our relations with our employees to be good.
 
Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
 
RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT 
 
Research and development activities are central to our business model. Our research programs include activities related to discovery of novel MDPs, investigational research to evaluate the potential therapeutic effects of certain discovered MDPs in research and preclinical studies and engineering novel, improved analogs of certain discovered MDPs with characteristics suitable for further development as potential MBT drug candidates and advancing our identified MBT candidate through clinical studies. Depending on factors of capability, cost, efficiency and intellectual property rights, we conduct our research programs independently at our laboratory facility. We also outsource some research and development activities pursuant to contractual arrangements with CROs or under collaborative arrangements with academic institutions.
INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY
 
Patents
 
Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our novel biological discoveries and therapeutic methods, to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing our proprietary rights. We seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, licensing and/or filing patent applications related to our proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business.
 
Our intellectual property and patent strategy is focused on our MDPs, their analogs and our MBT candidates. Our strategy is generally to seek patent protection in the United States and, where applicable, in those international jurisdictions we identify as holding significant potential market opportunity for any drug we may develop and in which patent protection is available. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. With respect to new biologically active MDPs that we identify within the mitochondrial genome, we typically file provisional patent applications and seek composition of matter and method of treatment patents for our MDPs, their analogs, and prospective MBTs as well as methods of use based on research and preclinical evaluation of therapeutic potential. We intend to file non-provisional patent applications for those MDPs and analogs within our pipeline based on further assessment of their therapeutic and commercial potential, as well as strategic and competitive considerations. We believe that the opportunity to engineer analogs or create combination therapies will afford us the opportunity to strengthen IP protection for our drug development candidates as they advance through our development pipeline and to broaden our IP protection internationally.
 
11

 

As of December 31, 2020, CohBar has filed more than 65 patent applications, including 8 international Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) applications, with claims directed to both composition of matter and methods of use of novel proprietary MDP analogs. Our patent applications include filings in the United States, Europe and a number of other foreign countries, with projected expiration dates ranging from 2037 to 2041. Additionally, we are the exclusive worldwide licensee from the Regents of the University of California (the Regents) of twelve issued patents that will expire between 2028 and 2034, along with six pending patent applications. Other licensed intellectual property is described below.
 
Terms for individual patents extend for varying periods of time generally depending on the date of filing of the patent application and the legal term of patents in the countries in which they are obtained. Generally, patents issued from applications filed in the United States are effective for twenty years from the earliest non-provisional filing date. In addition, in certain instances, a patent term can be extended to recapture a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of the FDA regulatory review period; however, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and the total patent term, including the restoration period, must not exceed fourteen years following FDA approval. The duration of foreign patents varies in accordance with provisions of applicable local law, but typically is also twenty years from the earliest international filing date. In certain instances, extension of patent term due to regulatory approval activities is available in foreign countries.
 
National and international patent laws concerning peptide therapeutics remain highly unsettled. Policies regarding the patent eligibility or breadth of claims allowed in such patents are currently in flux in the United States and other countries. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States and other countries can diminish our ability to protect our inventions and enforce our intellectual property rights. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth or enforceability of claims that may be granted in our patents or in third-party patents. The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. Our ability to maintain and solidify our proprietary position for our drugs and technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and enforcing those claims once granted. We do not know whether any of the patent applications that we may file or license from third parties will result in the issuance of any patents. The issued patents that we own, license, or may license or own in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar technology. Furthermore, our competitors may be able to independently develop and commercialize similar drugs or duplicate our technology, business model or strategy without infringing our patents. Because of the extensive time required for clinical development and regulatory review of a drug we may develop, it is possible that, before any of our drugs can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of any such patent.
 
Summaries of our owned and licensed patent positions are described below.

Trade Secrets 
 
In addition to patents, we rely upon unpatented trade secrets, know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants and invention assignment agreements with our employees. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions.
Trademarks
 
We consider COHBARTM to be our common law trademark and are pursuing registration in the United States Patent & Trademark Office.

In-licenses 
 
MOTS-c Exclusive License 
 
On August 6, 2013, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Regents of the University of California (the “Regents”) to obtain worldwide, exclusive rights under patent filings and other intellectual property rights in inventions developed by Dr. Cohen and academic collaborators at the University of California, Los Angeles. The intellectual property includes the U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications described above under “MOTS-c Patent Coverage”.
 
We agreed to pay the Regents specified development milestone payments aggregating up to $765,000 for the first product sold under the license. Milestone payments for additional products developed and sold under the license are reduced by 50%. We are also required to pay annual maintenance fees to the licensors. Aggregate maintenance fees for the first three years following execution of the agreement were $7,500. Thereafter, we are required to pay maintenance fees of $5,000 annually until the first sale of a licensed product. In addition, we are required to pay the Regents royalties equal to 2% of our worldwide net sales of drugs, therapies or other products developed from claims covered by the licensed patent, subject to a minimum royalty payment of $75,000 annually, beginning after the first commercial sale of a licensed product. We are required to pay the Regents royalties ranging from 8% of worldwide sublicense sales of covered products (if the sublicense is entered after commencement of Phase II clinical trials) to 12% of worldwide sublicense sales (if the sublicense is entered prior to commencement of Phase I clinical trials). The agreement also requires us to meet certain diligence and development milestones, including filing of an Investigational New Drug (IND) Application for a product covered by the agreement on or before the seventh anniversary of the agreement date.
 
Under the agreement, the license rights granted to us are subject to any rights the U.S. Government may have in such licensed rights due to its sponsorship of research that led to the creation of the licensed rights. The agreement also provides that if the Regents become aware of a third-party’s interest in exploiting the licensed technologies in a field that we are not actively pursuing, then we may be obligated either to issue a sublicense for use in the unexploited field to the third-party on substantially similar terms or to actively pursue the unexploited field subject to appropriate diligence milestones. The agreement terminates upon the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the agreement at any time by giving the Regents advance written notice. The agreement may also be terminated by the Regents in the event of our continuing material breach after notice of such breach and the opportunity to cure.
 
Humanin and SHLPs Exclusive License 
 
On November 30, 2011, we entered into an exclusive license agreement with the Regents and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University to obtain worldwide, exclusive rights under patent filings and other intellectual property rights in inventions developed by Drs. Cohen and Barzilai and their academic collaborators. The intellectual property includes the U.S. patents and patent applications described above under “Humanin and Humanin Analogs Patent Coverage” and “SHLP-2 and SHLP-6 Patent Coverage”.
 
We agreed to pay the licensors specified development milestone payments aggregating up to $765,000 for the first product sold under the license. Milestone payments for additional products developed and sold under the license are reduced by 50%. We are also required to pay annual maintenance fees to the licensors. Aggregate maintenance fees for the first five years following execution of the agreement were $80,000. Thereafter, we are required to pay maintenance fees of $50,000 annually until the first sale of a licensed product. In addition, we are required to pay the licensors royalties equal to 2% of our worldwide net sales of drugs, therapies or other products developed from claims covered by the licensed patents, subject to a minimum royalty payment of $75,000 annually, beginning after the first commercial sale of a licensed product. We are required to pay royalties ranging from 8% of worldwide sublicense sales of covered products (if the sublicense is entered after commencement of Phase II clinical trials) to 12% of worldwide sublicense sales (if the sublicense is entered prior to commencement of Phase I clinical trials). The agreement also requires us to meet certain diligence and development milestones, including filing of an IND for a product covered by the agreement on or before the seventh anniversary of the agreement date.

Under the agreement, the license rights granted to us are subject to any rights the U.S. Government may have in such licensed rights due to its sponsorship of research that led to the creation of the licensed rights. The agreement terminates upon the expiration of the last valid claim of the licensed patent rights. We may terminate the agreement at any time by giving the Regents advance written notice. The agreement may be modified or terminated on a product by product basis by the Regents if we materially fail to meet certain diligence requirements and development milestones. The agreement may also be terminated by the Regents in the event of our continuing material breach after notice of such breach and the opportunity to cure. In October 2020, the Regents accepted our payment for an additional year of license maintenance.
 
ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATORY MATTERS
 
Government Regulation 
 
The preclinical studies and clinical testing, manufacture, labeling, storage, record keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and sales, among other things, of our therapeutic candidates and future products, are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. In the United States, pharmaceutical products are regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the “FDCA”) and other laws. Biologics are subject to regulation by the FDA under the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, and related regulations, and other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Biological products include, among other things, viruses, therapeutic serums, vaccines and most protein products. Product development and approval within these regulatory frameworks takes a number of years, and involves the expenditure of substantial resources.
 
Regulatory approval will be required in all major markets in which we, or our licensees, seek to test our products in development. At a minimum, such approval requires evaluation of data relating to quality, safety and efficacy of a product for its proposed use. The specific types of data required and the regulations relating to these data differ depending on the territory, the drug involved, the proposed indication and the stage of development.
 
In general, new chemical entities are tested in animal models to determine whether the product is reasonably safe for initial human testing. Additional preclinical testing continues during the clinical development stage. Clinical trials for new products are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap. Phase 1 trials typically involve the initial introduction of the pharmaceutical into healthy human volunteers and focus on testing for safety, dosage tolerance, metabolism, distribution, excretion and clinical pharmacology. In the case of serious or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, initial Phase 1 trials are often conducted in patients directly, with preliminary exploration of potential efficacy. Phase 2 trials involve clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness of the drug for a particular disease indication or indications in patients with the disease or condition under study and to determine appropriate dosages and dose regimens and the common short-term side effects and risks associated with the drug. Phase 2 trials are typically closely monitored and conducted in a relatively small number of patients, usually involving no more than several hundred subjects. Phase 3 trials are generally expanded, well-controlled clinical trials. They are performed after preliminary evidence suggesting effectiveness, as well as the appropriate dose and dose ranges of the drug, have been obtained, and are intended to gather the additional information about effectiveness and safety that is needed to evaluate the overall benefit-risk relationship of the drug and to provide an adequate basis for physician labeling.
 
15

 

In the United States, specific research and preclinical data, chemical data and a proposed clinical study protocol, as described above, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which, unless the FDA objects, will become effective 30 days following receipt by the FDA. Phase 1 trials may commence only after the IND application becomes effective. Following completion of Phase 1 trials, further submissions to regulatory authorities are necessary in relation to Phase 2 and 3 trials to update the existing IND. Authorities may require additional data before allowing the trials to commence and could demand discontinuation of studies at any time if there are significant safety issues. In addition to regulatory review, a clinical trial involving human subjects has to be approved by an independent body. The exact composition and responsibilities of this body differ from country to country. In the United States, for example, each clinical trial is conducted under the auspices of an Institutional Review Board for any institution at which the clinical trial is conducted. This board considers among other factors, the design of the clinical trial, ethical factors, the safety of the human subjects and the possible liability risk for the institution.
 
Information generated in this process is susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approval at any stage of the approval process. Failure to demonstrate adequately the quality, safety and efficacy of a therapeutic drug under development would delay or prevent regulatory approval of the product.
 
In order to gain marketing approval, we must submit a new drug application, or NDA, for review by the FDA. The NDA must include a substantial amount of data and other information concerning safety and effectiveness of the drug compound from laboratory, animal and clinical testing, as well as data and information on manufacturing, product stability, and proposed product labeling.
 
There can be no assurance that if clinical trials are completed that we or any future collaborative partners will submit an NDA or similar applications outside of the United States for required authorizations to manufacture or market potential products, or that any such applications will be reviewed or approved in a timely manner. Approval of an NDA, if granted at all, can take several months to several years, and the approval process can be affected by a number of factors. Additional studies or clinical trials may be requested during the review and may delay marketing approval and involve unbudgeted costs. Regulatory authorities may conduct inspections of relevant facilities and review manufacturing procedures, operating systems and personnel qualifications. In addition to obtaining approval for each product, in many cases each drug manufacturing facility must be approved. Further, inspections may occur over the life of the product. An inspection of the clinical investigation sites by a competent authority may be required as part of the regulatory approval procedure. As a condition of marketing approval, the regulatory agency may require post-marketing surveillance to monitor adverse effects, or other additional studies as deemed appropriate. After approval for the initial disease indication, further clinical studies are usually necessary to gain approval for additional indications. The terms of any approval, including labeling content, may be more restrictive than expected and could affect product marketability.
 
Holders of an approved NDA are required to report certain adverse reactions and production problems, if any, to the FDA, and to comply with certain requirements concerning advertising and promotional labeling for their products. Moreover, quality control and manufacturing procedures must continue to conform to current good manufacturing practices (“cGMP”) after approval, and the FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess cGMP compliance. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance. We expect to continue to rely upon third-party manufacturers to produce commercial supplies of any products which are approved for marketing. We cannot be sure that those manufacturers will remain in compliance with applicable regulations, or that future FDA inspections will not identify compliance issues at the facilities of our contract manufacturers that may disrupt production or distribution, or require substantial resources to correct.

Any of our future products approved by the FDA will likely be purchased principally by patients through a pharmacy benefit plan or by pharmacies that typically bill various third-party payers, such as governmental programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), private insurance plans and managed care plans, for the pharmaceuticals provided to patients. The ability of customers to obtain appropriate reimbursement for the products they purchase is crucial to the success of new drug and biologic products. The availability of reimbursement affects which products customers purchase and the prices they are willing to pay. Reimbursement varies from country to country and can significantly impact the acceptance of new products. Even if we were to develop a promising new product, we may find limited demand for the product unless reimbursement approval is obtained from private and governmental third-party payers.
 
In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the health care system and efforts to control health care costs, including drug prices, that could significantly affect the development of our business, including preventing, limiting or delaying regulatory approval of our drug candidates and reducing the sales and profits derived from our products once they are approved. For example, in the United States, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (“ACA”) substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers and significantly affects the pharmaceutical industry. There is continued uncertainty about the implementation of ACA, including the potential for further amendments to the ACA and legal challenges to or efforts to repeal the ACA. We cannot be sure whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether government regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes would be on the marketing approvals, sales, pricing, or reimbursement of our drug candidates or products, if any, may be.
 
If the FDA approves any of our future products and reimbursement for those products is approved by any federal or state healthcare programs, then we will be subject to federal and state laws, such as the Federal False Claims Act, state false claims acts, the illegal remuneration provisions of the Social Security Act, and federal and state anti-kickback laws that govern financial and other arrangements among drug manufacturers and developers and the physicians and other practitioners or facilities that purchase or prescribe products. Among other things, these laws prohibit kickbacks, bribes and rebates, as well as other direct and indirect payments that are intended to induce the use or prescription of medical products or services payable by any federal or state healthcare program, and prohibit presenting a false or misleading claim for payment under a federal or state program. Possible sanctions for violation of any of these restrictions or prohibitions include loss of eligibility to participate in federal and state reimbursement programs and civil and criminal penalties. If we fail to comply, even inadvertently, with any of these requirements, we could be required to alter our operations, enter into corporate integrity, deferred prosecution or similar agreements with state or federal government agencies, and could become subject to significant civil and criminal penalties.
