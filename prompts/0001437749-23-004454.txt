Description of our business
 
Industry background
 
We operate in the high growth, point-of-care segment of the global in vitro diagnostics (IVD) industry, oenology (wine industry), veterinary blood glucose monitoring and other industries where point-of-use devices are or can be used. A large proportion of testing in the IVD industry, has historically been performed either by using expensive equipment or by trained personnel at dedicated or centralized testing sites including hospital laboratories and commercial laboratories. Similarly, a large proportion of testing in the wine industry, has historically been performed either by using expensive equipment or by trained personnel at dedicated or centralized testing sites including commercial laboratories. Significant interest has developed in techniques and technologies that allow testing to be performed “on-the-spot” in real time. While not all tests are suited to being performed at the point-of-use, we believe our electrochemical cell technology and other technologies could be a suitable platform for adapting a number of tests to a point-of-use format as it offers speed, ease of use, reliability, accuracy at a low cost in alternative industries.

Point-of-use tests in development and partnering strategy
 
We continue to demonstrate the broader application of our technology platform for markets with significant commercial potential and have developed products in blood glucose, a coagulation Prothrombin Time International Normalized Ratio (“PT-INR”) test and chemical tests for the wine industry.
 
We continue to develop an oncology biosensor used for the detection, staging and monitoring of cancer, and an Aptamer based platform to be used for SARS-CoV-2 N-Protein (which is the virus that causes COVID-19) (‘COVID-19 test’), female fertility and the environment.
 
We use various channels to sell our products and they include direct sales and the engagement of distributors and agents.
 
Principal products and services
 
We are the manufacturer and distributor of PT-INR coagulation test strips and devices (Xprecia Stride and Xprecia Prime), used to monitor the effect of the anticoagulant therapy warfarin. Xprecia Stride and Xprecia Prime are medical devices.
 
We are the manufacturer and distributor of all the Sentia wine testing products which includes Free SO₂, Malic Acid, Glucose, Fructose. Sentia is a non-medical device.
 
We will be the manufacturer and distributor of the Petrackr which is a blood glucose test to be used in cats and dogs.
 
HRL provides non-diagnostic laboratory services and performs coagulation testing services.
 
UBS continues to conduct research and development to demonstrate the broader application of its technology platform.
 
Facilities
 
UBS leases approximately 5,000 square meters of office, research and development and manufacturing facilities at 1 Corporate Avenue, Rowville in Melbourne, Australia. UBS has had ISO 13485 certification continuously at that site since May 2007. The lease for 1 Corporate Avenue was terminated and a new lease was entered into simultaneously in January 2021. The lease will expire on December 31, 2025 with an option to renew the lease for two further terms of five years each.
 
HRL leased approximately 482 square meters of office and laboratory facilities at 15(H) Wing, Second Floor, 711 Concession Street, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. The lease for 711 Concession Street expired on January 31, 2022.
 
On June 28, 2021, HRL entered a premises lease to occupy approximately 418 square meters of office and laboratory facilities at 44 Frid Street, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. The lease commenced in February 2022, with a ten-year contractual period. HRL relocated to the new premises in February 2022. The lease does not include an option to renew the lease for a further term. HRL holds an ISO 13485:2016 certification.
 
Raw materials
 
Raw materials essential to our business are purchased worldwide in the ordinary course of business from numerous suppliers. In general, these materials are available from multiple sources. Certain of our products in development may be more reliant on sole sources of supply. The use of sole sourced materials may be due to sourcing of proprietary and/or patented technology and processes that are intended to provide a unique market differentiation to our product. UBI continuously assesses its sole sourced raw materials and maintains business continuity plans with its suppliers. UBI’s continuity plans may include securing secondary supply with alternate suppliers, qualification of alternate manufacturing facilities, maintaining contingency stock and securing a long lead time for the supply of raw materials once notice of termination is given by the supplier. While UBI works closely with its suppliers, there may nonetheless be events that cause supply interruption, reduction or termination that adversely impacts UBI’s ability to manufacture and sell certain products.
 
Distribution
 
Order back log is not material to our business in as much as orders for our products generally are received and filled on a current basis. Our worldwide revenue for Xprecia Stride, Xprecia Prime, Petrackr and for the provision of non-diagnostic laboratory and coagulation testing services are not generally seasonal. Our worldwide revenue for certain of our Sentia products is seasonal based on the respective grape harvest seasons in each territory.

Regulatory clearances
 
UBI’s medical device products and operations are subject to regulation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) and various other federal and state agencies, as well as by foreign governmental agencies. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the development, testing, manufacturing, labelling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of UBI’s medical devices products. These products are also developed, manufactured and sold under an international quality system standard known as ISO 13485.
 
UBI’s Petrackr (animal device) and Sentia (non-medical) products are subject to regulation by product safety regulations by government agencies in multiple jurisdictions. These agencies enforce laws and regulations that govern the safety aspects for development, testing, manufacturing, labelling, advertising, marketing and distribution, and market surveillance of UBI’s products. These products are also developed, manufactured and sold under an international quality system standard known as ISO 9001.
 
UBI actively maintains FDA/ISO Quality Systems that establish standards for its product design, manufacturing, and distribution processes. Prior to marketing or selling most of its medical products, UBI must secure approval from the FDA and counterpart non-U.S. regulatory agencies. Following the introduction of a product, these agencies may engage in periodic reviews of UBI’s quality systems, as well as product performance and advertising and promotional materials. These regulatory controls, as well as any changes in FDA policies, can affect the time and cost associated with the development, introduction and continued availability of new products. Where possible, UBI anticipates these factors in its product development and planning processes. These agencies possess the authority to take various administrative and legal actions against UBI, such as product recalls, product seizures and other civil and criminal sanctions.
 
UBI also is subject to various federal and state laws, and laws outside the United States, concerning healthcare fraud and abuse (including false claims laws and anti-kickback laws), global anti-corruption, transportation, safety and health, and customs and exports. Many of the agencies enforcing these laws have increased their enforcement activities with respect to medical device manufacturers in recent years.
 
UBI believes it is in compliance in all material respects with applicable law and the regulations promulgated by the applicable agencies (including, without limitation, environmental laws and regulations), and that such compliance has not had, and will not have, a material adverse effect on our operations or results.
 
The importance and duration of all our patents, trademarks and licenses
 
We rely on a combination of patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality agreements, to establish and protect our proprietary rights which in the aggregate we believe to be of material importance to us in the operation of our business. Our continued success depends to a large extent on our ability to protect and maintain our owned and licensed patents and patent applications, copyright, trademark and trade secrets.
 
Our point-of-use tests in development draw upon an extensive portfolio of patents and patent applications as well as know-how either owned by UBS or licensed to UBS. We patent the technology, inventions and improvements that we consider important to the development of our business.
 
We rely on the owned patent applications and the patents and patent applications licensed to us in the manufacture of the point-of-use tests being developed by us and to enable us to grant rights to our customers and partners to commercialize products that we may develop.
 
Our owned and licensed patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. We maintain the owned and licensed patents and patent applications that we consider most significant by virtue of their importance to our platform.
 
We intend to continue to file and prosecute patent applications when and where appropriate to attempt to protect our rights in our proprietary technologies.
 
Our ability to build and maintain our proprietary position for our technology and products will depend on our success in obtaining effective claims and those claims being enforced once granted and, with respect to intellectual property licensed to us, the licensee’s success in obtaining effective claims and those claims being enforced once granted. The patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Some countries in which we or our customers or partners may seek approval to sell point of use tests that we have been involved in developing, may fail to protect our owned and licensed intellectual property rights to the same extent as the protection that may be afforded in the United States or Australia. Some legal principles remain unresolved and there has not been a consistent policy regarding the breadth or interpretation of claims allowed in patents in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia or elsewhere. In addition, the specific content of patents and patent applications that are necessary to support and interpret patent claims is highly uncertain due to the complex nature of the relevant legal, scientific and factual issues. Changes in either patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union, Australia or elsewhere may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection.
