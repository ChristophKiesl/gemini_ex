Company Overview
 
We are a growth-oriented renewable fuels technology and development company that is commercializing the next generation of renewable low-carbon liquid transportation fuels, such as SAF, and renewable isooctane (which we refer to as “renewable premium gasoline”), with the potential to achieve a “net zero” greenhouse gas (“GHG”) footprint and address global needs of reducing GHG emissions with sustainable alternatives to petroleum fuels. Our technology transforms carbon from the atmosphere using photosynthetic energy, wind energy and biogas energy into liquid hydrocarbons with a low or potentially “net-zero” GHG footprint.
 
As next generation renewable fuels, our hydrocarbon transportation fuels have the advantage of being “drop-in” substitutes for conventional fuels that are derived from crude oil, working seamlessly and without modification in existing fossil-fuel based engines, supply chains and storage infrastructure. In addition, with SAF, the carbon footprint of air travel can be reduced, or in the long run, eliminated on a net carbon basis, without change to planes or fuel systems. In addition to the potential of net-zero carbon emissions across the whole fuel life-cycle, our renewable fuels eliminate other pollutants associated with the burning of traditional fossil fuels such as particulates and sulfur, while delivering superior performance. We believe that the world is substantially under-supplied with low-carbon, drop-in renewable fuels that can be immediately used in existing transportation engines and infrastructure, and we are uniquely positioned to grow in serving that demand.
 
We use low-carbon, renewable resource-based raw materials as feedstocks. In the near-term, our feedstocks will primarily consist of non-food corn. As our technology is applied globally, feedstocks can consist of sugar cane, molasses or other cellulosic sugars derived from wood, agricultural residues and waste. Our patented fermentation yeast biocatalyst produces isobutanol, a four-carbon alcohol, via the fermentation of renewable plant biomass carbohydrates. The resulting renewable isobutanol has a variety of direct applications but, more importantly to our fundamental strategy, serves as a building block to make renewable premium gasoline and SAF using simple and common chemical conversion processes. We also plan to reduce or eliminate fossil-based process energy inputs by replacing them with renewable energy such as wind-powered electricity and renewable natural gas (“RNG”).
 
Our technology represents a new generation of renewable fuel technology that overcomes the limitations of first-generation renewable fuels, highlighted by the following:
 

● | Potential to replace the whole gallon of liquid transportation fuels, including for airplanes, automobiles, boats, trucks and ships of all types, while delivering massively reduced or negative GHG emissions and reducing or eliminating pollutants such as particulates and sulfur, which have been linked to cancer and other human health issues; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Drop-in compatibility and performance, without modification to existing vehicles, airplanes and other infrastructure; 
● | Scalability as a global and sustainable transportation fuel solution; 
● | Potential for a “net zero” or even negative carbon footprint for our fuel products across the lifecycles and value chains of our products through sustainable or regenerative agriculture practices to reduce the carbon footprint of the carbohydrates used to make our products and the use of renewable energy (such as wind power and biogas) to run our production facilities; 
● | The production of value-added feed and food products, including protein, bran, and vegetable oil, to help feed the world using sustainably grown corn to make our products; 
● | Through our platform fermentation technology, we possess the ability to use carbohydrates from various types of feedstock (including starch, dextrose, sugar, molasses, agricultural residues, and wood), thereby allowing our technology to be used in various economic conditions and taking advantage of raw materials abundant in different parts of the world; 
● | Through our platform alcohols-to-hydrocarbons technology, which converts fermentation alcohols into chemical products, we have developed the ability to produce renewable chemicals such as aroma chemicals, flavorings, para-xylene for use polyester textile fibers and polyethylene terephthalate plastic used in drinking bottles; renewable synthetic rubber; renewable propylene and hydrogen. We expect to license these technologies in the future; and
● | The opportunity to further optimize the performance of our biocatalyst to improve the economics associated with the production of our products. 

 
We use the Argonne National Laboratory’s GREET (Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Transportation) model (the “GREET Model”), the pre-eminent science-based lifecycle analysis model, to measure and predict GHG emissions across the life-cycle of our products. The GREET Model takes into account emissions and impacts "cradle to cradle" for renewable resource-based fuels including: inputs and generation of raw materials, agriculture practices, chemicals used in production processes of both feedstocks and products, energy sources used in production and transportation, and end fate of products, which for fuel products is usually burning to release energy.
 
Over the last decade we believe that we have proven the biotechnology and fermentation technology at our production facility in Luverne, Minnesota (the "Luverne Facility") where we have used a full-scale commercial fermenter system (~265,000 gallon fermenter scale). We believe that we have proven the hydrocarbon production technology at a 100,000 gallon/year demonstration plant in Silsbee, Texas which has been in operation since 2011. Our SAF complies with the commercial ASTM standards and has been used for commercial and business aviation. Our gasoline products are high octane fuels and have been sold for racing car applications. We believe our technology is proven to work, that our product performance is proven to work, that our potential to eliminate the fossil GHG footprint of our transportation fuels is real, and that there is significant marketplace demand for building world scale production plants.

Global GHG emissions, as a result of the widespread use of fossil fuels, are increasing and will continue to increase unless there is a global systemic change in energy consumption. Many industries, including the commercial airline industry, expect to experience strong growth but have also committed to hold GHG emission flat and, in some cases, even committed to take steps to reduce GHG emissions in the future. In addition, governments are taking steps to reduce GHG gas emissions, and consumers are increasingly focusing on GHGs and their effect on the global climate. To address these concerns, we believe that industries must eliminate burning fossil-based carbon in the production of electricity and transportation fuels, and that we must use forestry and agriculture to capture carbon in soil, plants, and trees. Because we have shown that our renewable-based products perform as well or better than traditional fossil-based fuels in existing fuels infrastructure, including internal combustion engines as well as transportation and storage infrastructure, we believe we are in a position to address the global GHG emission crisis head-on as a major player in the low-carbon fuel industry.
 
Our Strategy

Our products address global needs for drop-in low-carbon, clean-burning, high-performance fuels. Our strategy is to exploit our patented technology, process know-how, proven operations, proven product performance, business systems and product offtake agreements to develop the business and markets for low carbon renewable fuels that contain captured renewable energy and the monetary value from reductions in fossil carbon emissions normally associated with transportation fuels. We plan to build capacity and partner with others globally to meet the volumes from customer off-take agreements. We are, or intend to be, market developers, business developers, project developers, technology licensors, plant operators, and equity owners of production facilities for renewable fuels.
 
Key elements of our strategy include:
 

● | Continue to enter into supply agreements for low-carbon hydrocarbon fuels using our proprietary technology, and use these agreements to support financing to build production capacity of renewable fuels. We intend to build large scale production facilities of renewable fuels in order to support existing and future supply agreements. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Use a project finance approach to build out production capacity. In a project finance approach, financing for plant construction is secured by non-recourse or limited recourse debt and, potentially, partially by third-party equity investors through special purpose entities. We have engaged Citigroup to finance the construction of the Net-Zero 1 Project and additional production facilities to produce our products. We currently intend to own a majority equity position in the first two plant projects. 
● | Expand the global production capacity of renewable premium gasoline and jet fuel, and intermediates for chemical and plastics production via licensing core and adjacent technologies around the world. We believe that we have proven that our isobutanol production process works in full-scale fermenter systems at the Luverne Facility, and we believe that we have also proven that our renewable isobutanol can be readily converted to hydrocarbon products at our demonstration plant in Silsbee, Texas that was developed and is operated in partnership with South Hampton Resources Inc. (the “South Hampton Facility”). Our technology can be used to produce isobutanol from feedstocks other than corn, such as sugar, molasses, agricultural residues (e.g., straw, bagasse, stover), wood and wood residues and biogenic municipal solid waste. Feedstocks differ in their abundancy around the world. We intend to expand the global production of isobutanol and its derivative hydrocarbon products beyond the Luverne Facility through a low-cost, high-margin licensing model, in collaboration with partners such as Praj Industries Ltd., with whom we have previously announced an agreement. We have several technologies that we expect to eventually license. We believe that we have already proven that fully renewable polyester can be produced using intermediates from our renewable premium gasoline production. We have developed a technology to convert ethanol to hydrogen and propylene. We have developed a technology to convert short chain fermentation alcohols into fine chemicals such as flavors and fragrances.
● | Grow our business to achieve economies of scale to reduce selling prices of renewable fuels. We believe that the long-term price of oil is relevant to the demand for our products, and the value in the market for reducing carbon should make our selling prices more attractive in the future. In addition, as we scale up our business and achieve economies of scale, we can drive down our selling price of our renewable fuels to make our products more economical and attractive to our customers. We believe we can drive economies of scale by securing additional offtake supply agreements, with continued expansion of our production facilities and/or licensing our technology to others. Already, the net selling price to the customer approaches parity with fossil-based fuels. We also believe that with additional plants using our technology and with contracts for products that we expect to establish, we should be able to achieve attractive reinvestment economics making further plant buildouts attractive to project investors. 
● | Establish a business system that has potential to deliver “net zero” carbon emission fuel products. The concept of “net zero” carbon emissions is based on using sustainably produced, renewable resource-based raw materials as the product carbon source combined with reducing or eliminating fossil-based process energy inputs by using renewable electricity and RNG. The full life-cycle carbon footprint of our products, from generation of feedstocks to actual burning of the fuels, can be zero or even negative if regenerative or sustainable agricultural practices are used for the feedstock production. Our potential use of blockchain techniques could allow a complete and accurate accounting for positive and negative contributions to environmental metric which, in turn, would enable value transfers that incentivize systemic renewable and regenerative business practices across the value chain. 
● | Establish RNG production for use in our future production plants. RNG can be used to displace fossil based natural gas, thereby lowering the carbon footprint of our production processes. We are developing a biogas project in Northwest Iowa that we expect to begin production in 2022.

Competitive Strengths
 

● | Platform technologies and products to address large markets. Because isobutanol can be readily converted into hydrocarbon products, including isooctane (renewable premium gasoline), isooctene, SAF, lubricants, polyester, rubber, plastics, fibers and other polymers, we believe that the addressable markets are very large; potentially ultimately reaching 40% of the global petrochemicals markets and 50% of the renewable premium gasoline and SAF markets, in each case depending on the price of oil and the market value of carbon footprint reduction.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Growing, take-or-pay contracted demand for our renewable products. We currently have take-or-pay contracts in place for approximately 45 million gallons per year of our renewable premium gasoline and jet fuel, and we expect to enter into additional agreements in the future. We believe these take-or-pay contracts are suitable for sponsoring debt and equity project financing for expansion of our production capabilities. 
● | Proven commercial production processes. We believe that our renewable isobutanol production technology has been proven to work at a commercial scale in a 265,000 gallon fermenter at our Luverne Facility. We believe that our technology to convert renewable isobutanol into renewable jet fuel, isooctane, isooctene and para-xylene (building block for polyester) has been proven at our South Hampton Facility. 
● | Proven commercial products, renewable premium gasoline and SAF. 


■ | Renewable premium gasoline. We produce a product called isooctane that we refer to as renewable premium gasoline. We have demonstrated that isooctane can make up 50% to 60% of fossil-based premium gasoline, and we believe isooctane is a direct substitute for alkylate and reformate. Given that our isooctane is renewable, we have the ability to produce a renewable low-carbon premium gasoline. We believe that our renewable premium gasoline is substantially similar to fossil-based premium gasoline. Subject to receipt of certain regulatory approvals, our renewable premium gasoline could be a direct substitute for fossil-based premium gasoline for use in commerce in the U.S. Additionally, our renewable isooctane, like alkylate or reformate, when added to lower-octane fossil-based gasoline, produces a higher octane premium gasoline simultaneously lowering the GHG footprint and other pollution emissions. In the consumer gasoline markets, we expect that the demand will grow for premium gasoline with high octane ratings as more cars come onto the road with engines designed for high miles per gallon.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
■ | SAF. In 2016, ASTM International included our SAF in ASTM D7566 (Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons), which means that our SAF can be used in commercial aviation on a blended basis up to 50% with petroleum-based jet fuel. In fact, our SAF has been used to fuel commercial flights in the U.S. 


● | Existing commercial-scale production facility and expansion to additional facilities. Our Luverne Facility is located in the middle of the U.S. with access to attractively priced renewable wind power electricity (for our electricity demand), renewable natural gas (for thermal energy), certified sustainable corn as a feedstock, rail services, and a trained production leadership team who knows how to produce our products and train employees. We also have secured an option to purchase land to build a “greenfield” production facility of approximately 240 acres in Lake Preston, South Dakota, which is contemplated to produce approximately 45 million gallons per year of renewable hydrocarbon products.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Abundant, readily sourced feedstocks available globally. Through our platform fermentation technology, we have the ability to use carbohydrates from various types of feedstock (including starch, dextrose, sugar, molasses, agricultural residues and wood), allowing our technology to be used in various economic conditions. The feedstocks are abundantly available across the globe, typically at reasonable prices and easily aggregated. 
● | Experienced management team. Our management team brings over 100 years of combined experienced in the development and commercialization of low-carbon products, projects and businesses. 

Existing Supply Commitments and Expansion of Our Production Facilities
 
We have a growing portfolio of long-term, take-or-pay contracts for our products. As of the date of this report, we have entered into the following take or pay contracts, among others:

● | Trafigura. In August 2020, we entered into a long-term take-or-pay purchase agreement with Trafigura Trading LLC (“Trafigura”) pursuant to which we agreed to supply renewable hydrocarbons to Trafigura, subject to certain conditions. Performance under the agreement is subject to certain conditions, including acquiring a production facility to produce the renewable hydrocarbon products contemplated by the agreement and closing a financing transaction for sufficient funds to acquire or retrofit the production facility contemplated by the agreement. The Net-Zero 1 Project (as defined below) is expected to produce the products for the Trafigura agreement beginning in 2024.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | Delta Air Lines. In December 2019, and as subsequently amended in April 2020, we entered into a long-term, take-or-pay purchase agreement with Delta Air Lines, Inc. (“Delta”) pursuant to which we agreed to sell and deliver 10 million gallons per year of SAF to Delta, subject to certain conditions and exceptions, including Delta’s right to eliminate the take-or-pay requirements in certain circumstances. The Net-Zero 1 Project is expected to produce the products for the Delta agreement beginning in 2024. 
● | Air Total. In August 2019, we entered into a take-or-pay purchase agreement with Air Total International, S.A. (“Air Total”) pursuant to which we agreed to supply SAF to Air Total under a three-year offtake agreement. Air Total will initially purchase small quantities of SAF and we expect to sell Air Total increasing amounts of SAF upon the completion of the Net-Zero 1 Project beginning in 2024. 
● | HCS Group GmbH. In February 2019, we entered into a take-or-pay purchase agreement with HCS Holding GmbH (“HCS”), pursuant to which we agreed to supply renewable premium gasoline to HCS under a 10-year offtake agreement. HCS will initially purchase small quantities of renewable premium gasoline. The Net-Zero 1 Project is expected to produce the products for the HCS agreement beginning in 2024. 
● | Scandinavian Airlines System. On February 16, 2021, we and Scandinavian Airlines System (“SAS”) entered into Amendment No. 1 (the “Amendment”) to the Fuel Sales Agreement, dated October 28, 2019, by and between us and SAS (as amended by the Amendment, the “SAS Agreement”), pursuant to which we agreed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth in the Agreement, to supply SAF to SAS. We expect to supply the SAF for the SAS agreement from our second Net-Zero Project in 2024. 

 
In addition, as of the date of this Report, we have entered into the following licensing arrangements:

Praj Industries. In August 2020, we entered into a binding, definitive Master Framework Agreement (“MFA”) with Praj Industries Ltd. (“Praj”) to collaborate on providing renewable, low carbon, low particulate SAF and renewable premium gasoline in India and neighboring countries. This follows an earlier announcement in April 2019 between us and Praj regarding the commercialization of renewable isobutanol, SAF and renewable premium gasoline. We plan to license our technology and Praj will provide technology, plant equipment and engineering, procurement and construction (“EPC”) services to sugar mills and ethanol plants to produce renewable isobutanol from 1G feedstock (such as cane juice, cane molasses and sugar syrup) and 2G feedstock (such as cellulosic biomass like straws and bagasse). The renewable isobutanol will be aggregated and transferred to various refineries. We will also license our technology and Praj will provide technology, plant equipment and EPC services to refineries for converting renewable isobutanol into SAF and renewable premium gasoline through the ASTM-approved pathway of our SAF.
 
Net-Zero Projects
 
In early 2021, we announced the concept of “Net-Zero Projects” for the production of energy dense liquid hydrocarbons using renewable energy and our proprietary technology. The concept of a Net-Zero Project is to convert renewable energy (photosynthetic, wind, RNG, biogas) from a variety of sources into energy dense liquid hydrocarbons, that when burned in traditional engines, have the potential to achieve net-zero GHG emissions across the whole lifecycle of the liquid fuel: from the way carbon is captured from the atmosphere, processed to make liquid fuel products, and including the end use (burning as a fuel for cars, planes, trucks, and ships). We announced that our project that is currently planned to be constructed at Lake Preston, South Dakota will be the first Net-Zero Project (the “Net-Zero 1 Project”). We expect that the Net-Zero 1 Project will have the capability to produce liquid hydrocarbons that when burned have a “net-zero” greenhouse gas footprint. We currently expect the Net-Zero 1 Project to have a capacity of 45 MGPY of hydrocarbons (for renewable premium gasoline and SAF to produce more than 350,000,000 pounds per year of high protein feed products for use in the food chain, to produce enough RNG to be self-sufficient for the production process needs, and also to generate renewable electricity with a combined heat and power system. We also expect that the Net-Zero 1 Project will utilize wind energy, and we have entered into a development agreement with Juhl Energy Development, Inc. to design and develop a behind-the-meter wind project near the Net Zero 1 project site . Based on current engineering work completed to date, the unleveraged capital cost for the Net-Zero 1 Project is projected to be on the order of $650 million, including the hydrocarbon production and related renewable energy infrastructure which includes water treatment and anaerobic digestion to produce biogas that will be used for plant thermal energy and, with an on-site combined heat and power facility, generate electricity.
 

Wind Energy Project
 
In September 2019, Agri-Energy, LLC ("Agri-Energy"), our wholly-owned subsidiary, entered into an Environmental Attributes Purchase and Sale Agreement with an affiliate of Juhl Clean Energy Assets, Inc. (“Juhl”), which provides for Agri-Energy to purchase all environmental attributes, including renewable energy credits, related to the development of a wind electrical energy generating facility near the Luverne Facility. The wind project is comprised of two 2.5 megawatt wind turbines with a maximum output capacity of 5.0 megawatts and achieved commercial operation in the first half of 2020. Agri-Energy purchases the electricity generated by the wind project from the City of Luverne, Minnesota, and the electricity will be delivered directly to the Luverne Facility through a direct transmission line from the wind generation units. This is expected to enable the wind electricity to meet California’s requirement to be counted in determining the carbon intensity of the renewable transportation fuels produced at the Luverne Facility under California’s Low Carbon Fuel Standard Program (“LCFS”). The wind turbines began providing electricity to the Luverne Facility during the second quarter 2020.
Renewable Natural Gas Projects
 
In 2019, we began developing RNG projects . Manure from cows and pigs can be digested anaerobically to produce low-carbon methane. We expect that securing low-carbon methane for our production energy will assist us in achieving carbon negative GHG emissions on our end products. The end products resulting from such a decarbonization process are rewarded with a lower carbon intensity score, which increases the market value of certain products, in addition to having a more positive impact on the environment. We are currently working on financing the first RNG project in Northwest Iowa (the “NW Iowa RNG Project”). We expect financing of the NW Iowa RNG Project to close in the first half of 2021 and the project to begin producing RNG in 2022 to potentially supply RNG as a process energy input to Gevo’s Net-Zero Projects and to sell into natural gas pipelines to third party purchasers.

Our Business System and Sustainability
 
Our business system (from the raw materials to use of our advanced renewable fuels in all types of transportation) represents the entire circular economy in action. The graphic below is a summary representation of our business system at work in the Midwest region of the United States, and how each of the processes work together to produce advanced renewable fuels with a low-carbon footprint. We believe this system can work just as effectively in most other parts of the world.
 

In the above representation of our system, the most basic raw material for making our renewable fuel products is the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere (i.e., the GHG). Atmospheric carbon dioxide and water are captured by growing plants through photosynthesis (via sunlight) to produce carbohydrates. Carbohydrates sources already shown to work in our system include starch, dextrose, sucrose, molasses and from cellulosics such as wood waste, wood and agricultural residues such as straw. In our first plants, we plan on using sustainably grown field corn as the carbohydrate source. Kernels of corn are comprised of approximately 70% carbohydrate and 30% protein. The kernels are ground up, and then the protein is separated from the carbohydrates either before or after the fermentation process. The carbohydrates are used for fermentation producing isobutanol. The protein is a valuable component of animal feed product delivering nutrition to animals in meat and dairy production. The feed products are value added, having the starch removed. With the starch removed, cattle and other livestock emit less enteric emissions than if they ate whole corn, yet 100% of the nutritional value of corn is delivered to the food chain. In our process, approximately 10 pounds collectively of vegetable oil products and protein-rich feed product is produced for each gallon of renewable fuel produced.
 
Reducing the fossil carbon footprint of the energy sources in our business system is important to reducing the carbon footprint of our renewable fuel products. In September 2019, we secured 5 megawatts of wind power from our partnership with Juhl to offset the grid electricity needed at the Luverne Facility. With the NW Iowa RNG Project, we are also establishing a supply of RNG to be used at one or more of our production facilities. We have contracted with three dairies in the Midwest that are expected to produce about 350,000 MMBtus of RNG per year using anaerobic digestion. About half of the RNG production is expected to be used at one or more of our production facilities and the remaining production is expected to be sold in the RNG markets, which are highly developed in places like California. An additional benefit of RNG production is that nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium nutrients are captured from the manure and can be used as field fertilizer. We believe that practices around the full accounting for both negative and positive externalities are evolving and will increasingly benefit us.
 
The impact of using renewable energy at our plants has potential to significantly reduce the carbon footprint associated with our products. When sustainable farming techniques used to grow our corn feedstocks (such as regenerative agriculture techniques) are accounted for, our renewable premium gasoline and SAF products from our Net-Zero 1 Project could realize a GHG reduction of approximately 100% using the GREET Model and using the averages based upon the corn supplied to us. Furthermore, if we source feedstock from the farms that use conservation tillage such as strip tillage or drills, the corn GHG footprints are so low that we believe that we can run our total business system at a negative carbon footprint. We believe that we can achieve similar results by using waste wood, straw or municipal solid waste as feedstocks, depending upon the GHG footprint of the feedstock and the energy source used for production.

Our technology and business system embrace a new generation of systemic sustainability. We are focused on, and committed to, addressing the problem of supplying transportation fuels with a meaningful alternative that reduces GHGs and pollution, including the land utilization practices to generate our raw materials. We are working to establish accountability for the sustainability attributes of our entire business system, from the establishment of audited certification of our feedstocks (i.e. International Sustainability and Carbon Certification System and the Roundtable on Sustainable Biomaterials), to the development of distributed ledger technology in partnership with Blocksize Capital to enable the tracking of sustainability attributes proving assurance of sustainability to our customers.
 
As discussed below, beyond direct use as a chemical and gasoline blendstock, isobutanol can be dehydrated to produce butenes, which can then be converted into other products such as para-xylene (“PX”), SAF and many other renewable hydrocarbon fuels and blendstocks, and specialty chemicals offering substantial potential for additional demand. The conversion of isobutanol into butenes is a fundamentally important process that enables isobutanol to be used as a building block chemical in multiple markets.
 
Our Products
 
Sustainable Aviation Fuel
 
In April 2016, ASTM International completed its process of approving a revision of ASTM D7566 (Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons) to include alcohol to jet synthetic paraffinic kerosene derived from renewable isobutanol. This allows our SAF to be used as a blending component in standard Jet A-1 fuel for commercial airline use in the U.S. and around the globe.
Renewable Premium Gasoline (Isooctane) and Other Hydrocarbon Fuels
 
Isooctane (which we refer to as renewable premium gasoline), isooctene, diesel fuel and bunker fuel may also be produced from our isobutanol. Since 2011, we have been producing SAF and isooctane for renewable gasoline at a demonstration facility that we operate with South Hampton Resources, Inc. in Silsbee, Texas (the “South Hampton Facility”). The products produced at our South Hampton Facility are sold on a commercial basis to help develop the markets for these products. We continue to optimize the technologies and production systems, and we believe this technology is ready to scale up on a full commercial basis.
 
We currently believe that we have no competitors for renewable low-carbon isooctane, a substitute for alkylate, for premium gasoline in the marketplace. Additionally, we expect isooctane demand to increase because of the advent of engines with higher compression that get more mileage. We expect that isooctane will be in increasing demand as these more efficient engines come to market, and when blended with certain other renewable ingredients such a renewable naptha, and isobutanol or ethanol, it is possible to produce a complete gallon of gasoline.
 

   11

 

PX and Polyethylene Terephthalate (“PET”)
 
Isobutanol can be used to produce PX, polyester and their derivatives, which are used in the beverage, food packaging, textile and fibers markets. PX is a key raw material in PET production.
 
We have demonstrated the conversion of our isobutanol into renewable PX at our South Hampton Facility by producing renewable PX from October 2013 through March 2014.
 
Butenes
 
Traditionally butenes have been produced as co-products from the process of cracking naphtha in the production of ethylene. Historically, lower natural gas prices and reported reductions in the use of naphtha as the feedstock for the production of ethylene have resulted in a projected reduction in the volume of available butenes. This structural shift in feedstocks increases the potential market opportunity for our isobutanol in the production of butenes.
 
Isobutanol can be sold to isobutylene and n-butene (butenes) chemicals users for conversion into lubricants, methyl, methacrylate and rubber applications.
 
Feed Products Market
 
High protein animal feed is produced as a co-product of isobutanol and ethanol production. High protein animal feed is a valuable component of feed rations primarily to dairies and beef cattle markets, both nationally and internationally. The Luverne Facility has the capability to produce high protein animal feed from both isobutanol and ethanol. Producing high protein animal feed also allows us to lower the carbon footprint of our Luverne Facility, thereby increasing demand in California where premiums are paid for the low-carbon attributes. In addition, we recently installed a new system to manufacture value-added animal feed products. We expect that this system will be capable of producing several feed products with a value higher than that of typical high protein animal feed. We expect this system to be fully operational once we begin operating the Luverne Facility.
Isobutanol Direct Use Markets
 
Without modification, isobutanol has applications in the specialty chemical and gasoline blendstock markets. Since our potential customers in these markets would not be required to develop any additional infrastructure to use our isobutanol, we believe that selling into these markets should result in a relatively low risk profile and produce attractive margins.
Gasoline Blendstocks
 
Isobutanol has direct applications as a gasoline blendstock. Fuel-grade isobutanol may be used as a high energy content, low Reid Vapor Pressure (“RVP”), gasoline blendstock and oxygenate. Based on isobutanol’s low water solubility, in contrast with ethanol, we believe that isobutanol will be compatible with existing refinery infrastructure, allowing for blending at the refinery rather than blending at the terminal.
 
Further, based on isobutanol’s high energy content and low water solubility, as well as testing completed by the National Marine Manufacturers Association, the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute and Briggs & Stratton, we believe that isobutanol has direct applications as a blendstock in high value fuels markets serving marine, off-road vehicles, small engine and sports vehicle markets.
 
Specialty Chemicals
 
Isobutanol has direct applications as a specialty chemical. High-purity and chemical-grade isobutanol can be used as a solvent and chemical intermediate. We plan to produce high-purity and chemical-grade isobutanol that can be used in the existing butanol markets as a cost-effective, environmentally sensitive alternative to petroleum-based products.
 
We believe that our production route will be cost-efficient and will allow for significant expansion of the historical isobutanol markets within existing butanol markets through displacing n-butanol, a related compound to isobutanol that is currently sold into butanol markets.
 
Our Production Facilities
 
 We operate two existing production facilities. First, we operate the South Hampton Facility in Silsbee, Texas that was developed and is operated in partnership with South Hampton Resources, Inc. The South Hampton Facility has a capacity of approximately 100,000 gallons per year of renewable hydrocarbon products, including renewable premium gasoline and SAF, that is converted from our renewable isobutanol.
 

 12


Second, we operate the Luverne Facility, a wholly-owned, commercial-scale renewable isobutanol plant in Luverne, Minnesota, which has a current capacity of approximately 1.5 million gallons per year of isobutanol. Using the proven technologies and experience gained at both the Luverne Facility and the South Hampton Facility, we intend to expand production capabilities to produce substantially increased quantities of isobutanol and significant quantities of renewable premium gasoline and renewable jet fuel. We are planning to develop greenfield production sites in addition to the Luverne Facility. As previously disclosed, production for ethanol operations at the Luverne Facility is currently shut down until further notice. Currently, the South Hampton Facility is not producing renewable premium gasoline or jet fuel. We expect to produce isobutanol in intermittent campaigns during 2021 to supply the South Hampton Facility so that renewable premium gasoline or jet fuel can be produced in 2021.
 
In December 2020, we secured an option to purchase land to build a “greenfield” production facility of approximately 240 acres in Lake Preston, South Dakota (the “Lake Preston Site”). The Lake Preston Site is expected to be utilized for our Net-Zero 1 Project. In addition, we previously announced that we have engaged Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (“Citigroup”) to assist us in exploring, among other things, project funding needed for our production expansion projects. We intend to make a decision on whether to purchase the Lake Preston Site in the future as part of the Citigroup led project financing.
 
Conversion of Isobutanol into Hydrocarbons
 
We have demonstrated conversion of our isobutanol into a wide variety of renewable hydrocarbon products that are currently used to produce hydrocarbon fuels, plastics, fibers, polyester, rubber and other polymers and chemicals. Hydrocarbon products consist entirely of hydrogen and carbon and have historically been derived almost exclusively from petroleum, natural gas and coal. Importantly, isobutanol can be dehydrated to produce butenes, which are an intermediate product in the production of hydrocarbon products with many industrial uses. The straightforward conversion of our isobutanol into butenes is a fundamentally important process that enables isobutanol to be used as a building block chemical. Much of the technology necessary to convert isobutanol into butenes and subsequently into these hydrocarbon products is commonly known and practiced in the chemicals industry today. For example, the dehydration of ethanol to ethylene, which uses a similar process and technology to the dehydration of isobutanol, is practiced commercially today to serve the ethylene market. The dehydration of t-butanol into butenes is commercially practiced today.
 
Third Party Retrofit and Construction Activities
 
We have commenced a licensing strategy whereby a licensee would invest the capital for (i) the modification of an existing ethanol production facility whereby equipment is added to the facility and the existing fermenters are used to produce isobutanol rather than ethanol, or (ii) the modification of an existing ethanol facility to add fermenters and other equipment such that the facility is capable of producing both isobutanol and ethanol simultaneously "side-by-side" (collectively referred to as “Retrofit”)of its own ethanol plant or for a new greenfield build-out of an isobutanol-producing plant. In return, we, as the licensor, would expect to receive an up-front license fee and ongoing royalty payments from the projects, as well as other potential revenue streams such as yeast sales. This licensing strategy is expected to take some time to develop, and we cannot assure that it will be successful. The ability to license a technology is generally related to the commercial track record of the underlying technology itself. In addition, revenues from licensing our isobutanol and/or hydrocarbon technologies are expected to be directly linked to the build out of specific projects, which may take multiple years to construct.
Our Production Technology Platform
 
We have used tools from synthetic biology, biotechnology, chemical catalysis and process engineering to develop a proprietary set of technologies that enable the potential of cost-effective production of isobutanol and hydrocarbon fuels and chemicals. We believe the technologies have been proven to work as demonstrated by the fact that we have made and sold products using these technologies.
 
We have a proprietary fermentation yeast biocatalyst that effectively produces isobutanol. The advantage of this biocatalyst is that it (i) works in large scale fermentation systems, and (ii) can operate in complex biological mixtures such as corn mash or molasses and produce a suitable clean isobutanol product. The technology is designed to use similar carbohydrate feedstocks, similar to ethanol technology. For example, carbohydrates from non-food corn, sugar cane, molasses or cellulosic sugars each could be used depending upon cost and availability. We believe that our technology can be deployed in stand-alone production units and has the potential to add value to existing ethanol production sites by increasing the site profitability if our technologies are deployed.
 
We have demonstrated that our isobutanol to hydrocarbon technologies for the production of SAF, isooctane, isooctene, and paraxylene appear to be viable from a technical and process point of view. These catalytic technologies appear to be effective and scalable.
 
High protein animal feed, protein and oil are important products that can be produced at our Luverne Facility. We market our high-protein, high-energy animal feed to the beef, swine and poultry industries. The spent yeast from fermentation adds protein to the mix, resulting in a higher protein content than corn itself. By selling the feed, protein and oil products, we generate additional revenues and effectively reduce the net cost of fermentation feedstock.
 
Biocatalyst Overview
 
Our biocatalysts are microorganisms that have been designed to consume carbohydrates and produce isobutanol as a product. Our technology team developed these proprietary biocatalysts to efficiently convert fermentable sugars of all types into isobutanol by engineering isobutanol pathways into the biocatalysts. We designed our biocatalysts to be able to use the yeast improvement technologies currently in use and being developed for the ethanol industry. We have already achieved yield (percentage of the theoretical maximum percentage of isobutanol that can be made from a given amount of feedstock) and rate (how fast the sugar fed to the fermentation is converted to isobutanol) sufficient for commercialization. To achieve this, we believe that more than 100 genetic changes have been made to our yeast biocatalyst. We achieved our target fermentation performance goals at our Luverne Facility at a commercial scale in August 2015. We have embarked on a continuous improvement program for the performance parameters of our biocatalyst with a goal of reducing projected capital and operating costs, increasing operating reliability and increasing the volume of isobutanol production.
 
While we believe that the majority of the development work on a commercially viable isobutanol producing yeast is complete, we expect to continue to make incremental improvements targeted to its commercial performance.

Raw Material Feedstocks
 
In the U.S., non-food corn is a commercially attractive feedstock for both isobutanol and ethanol, because it is abundant and readily available, but more importantly because this corn generates low cost carbohydrates, protein and feed and corn oil for the food chain. In other parts of the world, sugar or molasses from cane, beets, or other sugar producing crops could be used. In the future, certain types of cellulosic sugars could be used once the cost to acquire those sugars becomes cost effective. We have designed our biocatalyst platform to be capable of producing isobutanol from any fuel ethanol feedstock currently in commercial use, which we believe, in conjunction with our proprietary isobutanol separation unit, will permit us to modify any existing fuel ethanol facility to produce our products.
 
Our Luverne Facility is currently, and our Net-Zero 1 Project will be, set up to use non-food corn as a feedstock. The starch is fermented to isobutanol, the fiber and protein are isolated from the process and sold as animal feed, and the corn oil is sold for industrial use.
 
We expect that our feedstock flexibility will allow our technology to be deployed worldwide and will enable us to offer our customers protection from the raw material cost volatility historically associated with petroleum-based products. For example, in some parts of the world, it may be that molasses is a lower cost feedstock; in others, sugar from beets or cane might be the lower cost feedstock. As cellulosic sugars become economical, we expect that these could be viable as a feedstock too.
 
In the future, we expect feedstocks to be chosen on the collective basis of (i) cost, (ii) carbon and/or sustainability footprint with associated value, (iii) positive contribution to food chain where possible, and (iv) availability of the feedstock at a practical scale.
 
In June 2015, Agri-Energy entered into a Price Risk Management, Origination and Merchandising Agreement, as amended as of December 21, 2017 (the “Origination Agreement”), with FCStone Merchant Services, LLC (“FCStone”) and a Grain Bin Lease Agreement with FCStone, as amended as of December 21, 2017. In 2020, we terminated the Grain Bin Lease Agreement with FCStone.
 
Pursuant to the Origination Agreement, FCStone originates and sells to Agri-Energy, the owner of the Luverne Facility, and Agri-Energy purchases from FCStone, the entire volume of corn grain used by the Luverne Facility.
 
Our ETO Technology
 
We have also developed new technologies using ethanol as a feedstock for the production of hydrocarbons, renewable hydrogen and other chemical intermediates, which we describe as our ethanol-to-olefins (“ETO”) technologies. The process produces tailored mixes of isobutylene, propylene, hydrogen and / or acetone, which are valuable as standalone molecules, or as feedstocks to produce other chemical products and longer chain alcohols. This technology has the potential to address additional markets in the chemicals, fuels, and plastics fields, such as renewable polypropylene for automobiles and packaging and renewable hydrogen for use in chemical and fuel cell markets. At this time, this technology has only been operated at a laboratory scale, but if successfully scaled up to commercial level, this technology may provide a broader set of end-product market and margin opportunities.
 
Underpinning the ETO technology is our development of proprietary catalysts that produce light olefins, such as propylene and butylene, or acetone in high yields in a single processing step. One of the benefits of the technology is that we can use conventional fuel grade specification ethanol that can be sourced from a variety of feedstocks with no apparent adverse impact on end product yields. Water, which is co-fed with the ethanol, is able to be recycled resulting in a process which generates minimal waste. The ethanol and water mixture is vaporized and fed across a fixed catalyst bed resulting in a gaseous product mix consisting of the light olefins, such as propylene and butylene or acetone, in addition to hydrogen and carbon dioxide, along with lesser amounts of methane and ethylene. Separation of gaseous products can be achieved via conventional process technologies and unit operations within the petroleum industry.
 
We have found that our ETO technology is effective at converting fusel oils into flavors, fragrances and certain specialty chemicals. We are evaluating the business opportunities and commercial potential.
 
Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC
 
Between 2011 and 2015, we were involved in an intellectual property dispute with Butamax Advanced Biofuels LLC (“Butamax”). We believe the dispute was satisfactorily resolved, enabling each of our companies to pursue their respective businesses.
Cross License Agreement
 
On August 22, 2015, we entered into a Settlement Agreement and Mutual Release (the “Settlement Agreement”) with Butamax, E.I. du Pont de Nemours & Company (“DuPont”) and BP renewable fuels North America LLC (“BP” and, together with Butamax and DuPont, the “Butamax Parties”), that resolved the various disputes, lawsuits and other proceedings between one or more of the Butamax Parties and us, as previously disclosed and as specifically identified in the Settlement Agreement (the “Subject Litigation”), and creates a new business relationship pursuant to which we and Butamax and we have granted rights to each other under certain patents and patent applications in accordance with the terms of a Patent Cross-License Agreement (the “License Agreement”), which was entered into by us and Butamax concurrently with the Settlement Agreement. For additional information concerning the settlement agreement, please see our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year-ended December 31, 2015 — Item 3 Legal Proceedings.
 
Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement, each party receives a non-exclusive license under certain patents and patent applications owned or licensed (and sublicensable) by the other party for the production and use of biocatalysts in the manufacture of isobutanol using certain production process technology for the separation of isobutanol, and to manufacture and sell such isobutanol in any fields relating to the production or use of isobutanol and isobutanol derivatives, subject to the customer-facing field restrictions described below. Each party also receives a non-exclusive license to perform research and development on biocatalysts for the production, recovery and use of isobutanol.
 

   14

 

Each party may produce and sell up to 30 MGPY of isobutanol in any field on a royalty-free basis. Butamax will be the primary customer-facing seller of isobutanol in the field of fuel blending (subject to certain exceptions, the “Direct Fuel Blending” field) and we will be the primary customer-facing seller of isobutanol in the field of jet fuel for use in aviation gas turbines (the “Jet” field, also subject to certain exceptions). As such, subject to each party’s right to sell up to 30 MGPY of isobutanol in any field on a royalty-free basis, other than with Butamax’s written consent, we will only sell isobutanol through Butamax in the Direct Fuel Blending field subject to a royalty based on the net sales price for each gallon of isobutanol sold or transferred by us, our affiliates or sublicensees within the Direct Fuel Blending field (whether through Butamax or not) and on commercially reasonable terms to be negotiated between the parties and Butamax will only sell isobutanol through us in the Jet field subject to a royalty based on the net sales price for each gallon of isobutanol sold or transferred by Butamax, its affiliates or sublicensees within the Jet field (whether through us or not) and on commercially reasonable terms to be negotiated between the parties; provided, that each party may sell up to 15 MGPY of isobutanol in a given year directly to customers in the other party’s customer-facing field on a royalty-free basis so long as the isobutanol volumes are within the permitted 30 MGPY of isobutanol sold or otherwise transferred per year in any field described above and, in certain instances, each party may then sell up to the total permitted 30 MGPY in the other party’s customer-facing field on a royalty-free basis. In addition, in order to maintain its status as the primary customer-facing seller in these specific fields, each party must meet certain milestones within the first five years of the License Agreement. If such milestones are not met as determined by an arbitration panel, then a party will have the right to sell directly to customers in the other party’s customer-facing field subject to the payment of certain royalties to the other party on such sales.
 
In addition to the royalties discussed above for sales of isobutanol in the Direct Fuel Blending field, and subject to our right to sell up to 30 MGPY of isobutanol in any field on a royalty-free basis, we will pay to Butamax a royalty per gallon of isobutanol sold or transferred by us, our affiliates or sublicensees within the field of isobutylene (a derivative of isobutanol) applications (other than isobutylene for paraxylene, isooctane, Jet, diesel and oligomerized isobutylene applications). Likewise, in addition to the royalties discussed above for sales of isobutanol in the Jet field, and subject to Butamax’s right to sell up to 30 MGPY of isobutanol in any field on a royalty-free basis, Butamax will pay to us a royalty per gallon of isobutanol sold or transferred by Butamax, its affiliates or sublicensees within the fields of marine gasoline, retail packaged fuels and paraxylene (except for gasoline blending that results in use in marine or other fuel applications). The royalties described above will be due only once for any volume of isobutanol sold or transferred under the License Agreement, and such royalties accrue when such volume of isobutanol is distributed for end use in the particular royalty-bearing field. All sales of isobutanol in other fields will be royalty-free, subject to the potential technology fee described below.
 
In the event that we, our affiliates or sublicensees choose to employ a certain solids separation technology for the production of isobutanol at one of their respective plants (“Solids Separation Technology”), we are granted an option to license such technology from Butamax on a non-exclusive basis subject to the payment of a one-time technology license fee based on the rated isobutanol capacity for each such plant (subject to additional fees upon expansion of such capacity). We also receive the option to obtain an engineering package from Butamax to implement the Solids Separation Technology on commercially reasonable terms to be negotiated between the parties and subject to the technology fee described above and an additional technology licensing fee for use of the Solids Separation Technology applicable to ethanol capacity as provided in such engineering package from Butamax (which capacity is not duplicative of the rated isobutanol capacity referenced above) in instances where Butamax provides an engineering package for use at a particular plant that will run isobutanol and ethanol production side-by-side using the licensed Solids Separation Technology at such plant.
 
The License Agreement encompasses both parties’ patents for producing isobutanol, including biocatalysts and separation technologies, as well as for producing hydrocarbon products derived from isobutanol, including certain improvements and new patent applications filed within seven years of the date of the License Agreement. While the parties have cross-licensed their patents for making and using isobutanol, the parties will not share their own proprietary biocatalysts with each other. The parties may use third parties to manufacture biocatalysts on their behalf and may license their respective technology packages for the production of isobutanol to third parties, subject to certain restrictions. A third-party licensee would be granted a sub-license and would be subject to terms and conditions that are consistent with those under the License Agreement.
 
Under the License Agreement, the parties also agreed to certain limitations on the making or participating in a challenge of the other party’s patents that are at issue in the Subject Litigation. The parties have also made certain representations, warranties and covenants to each other including, without limitation, with respect to obtaining certain consents, indebtedness, rights in the licensed patents, and relationships with certain other ethanol plant process technology providers.
 
The License Agreement will continue in effect until the expiration of the licensed patents, unless earlier terminated by a party as provided in the License Agreement. The parties also have certain termination rights with respect to the term of the license granted to the other party under the License Agreement upon the occurrence of, among other things, a material uncured breach by the other party. In the event that a party’s license is terminated under the License Agreement, such party’s sublicense agreements may be assigned to the other party, subject to certain restrictions.
 
The parties may not assign the License Agreement or any right or obligation thereunder without the prior written consent of the other party. However, the parties may assign the License Agreement to an affiliate or a person that acquires all of the business or assets of such party, subject to certain restrictions.
 
Competition
 
We face competitors in each market, some of which are limited to individual markets, and some of which will compete with us across all of our target markets. Many of our competitors have greater financial resources, more comprehensive product lines, broader market presence, longer standing relationships with customers, longer operating histories, greater production capabilities, stronger brand recognition and greater marketing resources than we do. In addition, if we fail to raise sufficient additional capital for our business and strategy, we may not be able to successfully compete.
 
Hydrocarbon fuels. Beyond direct use as a fuel additive, isobutanol can be converted into many hydrocarbon fuels and blendstocks, offering substantial potential for additional demand in the fuels markets. We compete with the incumbent petroleum-based fuels industry, as well as renewable fuels companies. The incumbent petroleum-based fuels industry makes the vast majority of the world’s gasoline, jet and diesel fuels and blendstocks. The petroleum-based fuels industry is mature and includes a substantial base of infrastructure for the production and distribution of petroleum-derived products. However, the industry faces challenges from its dependence on petroleum. High and volatile oil prices will provide an opportunity for renewable producers relying on biobased feedstocks like corn, which in recent years have had lower price volatility than oil, to compete.
 

 15


Renewable fuels companies will provide substantial competition in the gasoline market. These renewable fuel competitors are numerous and include both large established companies and numerous startups. Government tax incentives for renewable fuel producers and regulations such as the Renewable Fuel Standards (“RFS”) program (the “RFS Program”) help provide opportunities for renewable fuels producers to compete. In particular, in the gasoline and gasoline blendstock markets, Virent Energy Systems, Inc. (“Virent”) offers a process for making gasoline and gasoline blendstocks in a mixture than subsequently needs to be refined. However, we have the advantage of being able to target conversion of isobutanol into specific high-value molecules such as isooctane, which can be used to make gasoline blendstocks with a higher value than whole gasoline, which we do not believe Virent’s process can match. Renewable Energy Group, Inc., Neste Corporation, World Energy, LLC and others are also targeting production of SAF from vegetable oils and animal fats. Red Rock Biofuels LLC, Fulcrum BioEnergy, Inc. and others are planning to produce SAF from renewable biomass using Fisher Tropsch types of technology. We believe that the Gevo production process is economically competitive with any other potential routes and that we are the only company with technology to convert carbohydrates into SAF.
 
Renewable Premium Gasoline (Isooctane). We believe that we currently have no competitors for our renewable premium gasoline product (isooctane), a substitute for alkylate, for premium gasoline in the marketplace. We are aware that Global Bioenergies, S.A. is developing a technology to make renewable isooctane. Even with the increasing demand for electric vehicles ("EVs"), which are needed to help address the GHG emissions of the transportation sector, we believe that low-carbon liquid fuels will continue to be needed. The U.S. Energy Information Administration indicates that the vast majority of transportation will be still be powered by liquid transportation fuels in 2050 and beyond, with EV occupying only a small share of the market. Additionally, we expect renewable premium gasoline demand to increase because of the advent of engines with higher compression that get more mileage. We expect that renewable premium gasoline will be in increasing demand as these more efficient engines come to market, and when blended with certain other renewable ingredients such a renewable naptha, and isobutanol or ethanol, it is possible to produce a complete gallon of gasoline.
 
Renewable isobutanol. We are a leader in the development of renewable isobutanol via fermentation of renewable plant biomass. While the competitive landscape in renewable isobutanol production is limited at this time, we are aware of other companies that are seeking to develop isobutanol production capabilities, including Butamax with whom we have entered into the License Agreement. See —"Butamax Advanced renewable fuels LLC—Cross License Agreement".
 
Our isobutanol is targeted for use in producing SAF and renewable premium gasoline. In addition, isobutanol can be used in the following markets: direct use as a solvent and gasoline blendstock, use in the chemicals industry for producing rubber, plastics, fibers, polyester and other polymers and use in the production of hydrocarbon fuels.
 
Solvent markets. We also face competition from companies that are focused on the development of n-butanol, a related compound to isobutanol. These companies include Cathay Industrial Biotech Ltd., METabolic EXplorer S.A. and Eastman Chemicals Company. We understand that these companies produce n-butanol from an acetone-butanol-ethanol (“ABE”) fermentation process primarily for the small chemicals markets. ABE fermentation using a Clostridia biocatalyst has been used in industrial settings since 1919. As discussed in several academic papers analyzing the ABE process, such fermentation is handicapped in competitiveness by high energy costs due to low concentrations of butanol produced and significant volumes of water processed. It requires high capital and operating costs to support industrial scale production due to the low rates of the Clostridia fermentation, and results in a lower butanol yield because it produces ethanol and acetone as by-products. We believe our proprietary process has many significant advantages over the ABE process because of its relatively limited requirements for new capital expenditures, its production output of only isobutanol as a primary product and its limited water usage in production. We believe these advantages will produce a lower cost isobutanol compared to n-butanol produced by ABE fermentation. N-butanol’s lower octane rating compared to isobutanol gives it a lower value in the gasoline blendstock market, but n-butanol can compete directly in many solvent markets where n-butanol and isobutanol have similar performance characteristics.
 
Gasoline blendstocks. In the gasoline blendstock market, isobutanol competes with non-renewable alkylate and renewable ethanol. Alkylate is a premium value gasoline blendstock typically derived from petroleum. However, petroleum feeds for alkylate manufacture are pressured by continued increases in the use of natural gas to generate olefins for the production of alkylate, due to the low relative cost of natural gas compared to petroleum. Isobutanol and isooctane have fuel properties similar to alkylate and, as such, we expect that isobutanol and isooctane could be used as a substitute for some alkylate in fuel applications. Ethanol is renewable and has a high-octane rating, and although it has a high RVP, ethanol receives a one-pound RVP waiver in a large portion of the U.S. gasoline market. Renewability is important in the U.S. because the RFS Program mandates that a minimum volume of renewable blendstocks be used in gasoline each year. A high-octane rating is important for engine performance and is a valuable characteristic because many inexpensive gasoline blendstocks have lower octane ratings. Low RVP is important because the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) sets maximum permissible RVP levels for gasoline. In markets where low RVP is important, isobutanol can enable refiners to meet fuel specifications at lower cost. Ethanol’s vapor pressure waiver is valuable because it offsets much of the negative value of ethanol’s high RVP. We believe that our isobutanol will be valued for its combination of low RVP, low water solubility, relatively high octane and renewability.
 
Many production and technology supply companies are working to develop ethanol production from cellulosic feedstocks, including Raizen Energia S.A., Praj Industries Ltd., Clariant Corporation and POET, LLC and many smaller startup companies. Successful commercialization by some or all of these companies will increase the supply of renewable gasoline blendstocks worldwide, potentially reducing the market size or margins available to isobutanol.
 
Plastics, fibers, polyester, rubber and other polymers. Isobutanol can be dehydrated to produce butenes, hydrocarbon intermediates currently used in the production of plastics, fibers, polyester, rubber and other polymers. The straightforward conversion of our isobutanol into butenes is a fundamentally important process that enables isobutanol to be used as a building block chemical in multiple markets. These markets include butyl rubber, lubricants and additives derived from butenes such as isobutylene, poly methyl methacrylate from isobutanol, propylene for polypropylene from isobutylene, polyesters made via PX from isobutylene and polystyrene made via styrene.
 
In these markets, we compete with the renewable isobutanol companies and renewable n-butanol producers described previously and face similar competitive challenges. Our competitive position versus petroleum-derived plastics, fibers, rubber and other polymers varies, but we believe that the high volatility of petroleum prices, often tight supply markets for petroleum-based petrochemical feedstocks and the desire of many consumers for goods made from more renewable sources will enable us to compete effectively. However, petrochemical companies may develop alternative pathways to produce petrochemical-based hydrocarbon products that may be less expensive than our isobutanol or more readily available or developed in conjunction with major petrochemical, refiner or end user companies. These products may have economic or other advantages over the plastics, fibers, polyester, rubber and other polymers developed from our isobutanol. Further, some of these companies have access to significantly more resources than we do to develop products.
 

   16

 

Additionally, Global Bioenergies, S.A. is pursuing the direct production of isobutylene from renewable carbohydrates. Through analysis of the fermentation pathway, we believe that the direct production of butenes such as isobutylene via fermentation will have higher capital and operating costs than production of butenes derived from our isobutanol.
 
Ethanol. As mentioned above, we do not expect to produce ethanol in the future. We compete with numerous ethanol producers located throughout the U.S., many of which have much greater resources than we do, including Archer-Daniels-Midland Company, Green Plains, Inc., POET, LLC and Valero Energy Corporation. Competition for corn supply from other ethanol plants and other corn consumers will likely exist in all areas and regions in which our current and future plants will operate. We also face competition from foreign producers of ethanol and such competition may increase significantly in the future. Large international companies have developed, or are developing, increased foreign ethanol production capacities. Brazil is the world’s second largest ethanol producing country. Brazil’s ethanol production is sugarcane-based, as opposed to corn-based, and has historically been less expensive to produce.
Intellectual Property
 
Our success depends in large part on our proprietary products and technology for which we seek protection under patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws. Such protection is also maintained in part using confidential non-disclosure agreements. Protection of our technologies is important so that we may offer our customers and partners proprietary services and products unavailable from our competitors, and so that we may exclude our competitors from using technology that we have developed or exclusively licensed. If competitors in our industry have access to the same technology, our competitive position may be adversely affected.
 
We have submitted hundreds of patent applications in the U.S. and in various foreign jurisdictions. These patent applications are directed to our technologies and specific methods and products that support our business in the renewable fuels and bioindustrial markets. We continue to file new patent applications, for which terms extend up to 20 years from the filing date in the U.S.
 
We have also been issued multiple patents in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions.
 
In addition to the patents and applications described above, we have a global cross-license to certain patents and applications relating to the production, recovery, and use of isobutanol that are owned or licensed by Butamax. The global cross-license allows us to freely practice the licensed inventions, subject to the terms of the cross-license. For information regarding this license, see —"Butamax Advanced renewable fuels LLC—Cross License Agreement".
 
We have filed and prosecuted, and intend to continue to file and prosecute, patent applications and maintain trade secrets, as is consistent with our business plan, in an ongoing effort to protect our intellectual property. It is possible that our licensors’ current patents, or patents which we may later acquire or license, may be successfully challenged or invalidated in whole or in part. It is also possible that we may not obtain issued patents from our filed applications and may not be able to obtain patents regarding other inventions we seek to protect. We also may not file patents in each country in which we plan to do business or actually conduct business. Under appropriate circumstances, we may sometimes permit certain intellectual property to lapse or go abandoned. Due to uncertainties inherent in prosecuting patent applications, sometimes patent applications are rejected and we may subsequently abandon them. It is also possible that we will develop products or technologies that will not be patentable or that the patents of others will limit or preclude our ability to do business. In addition, any patent issued to us may provide us with little or no competitive advantage, in which case we may abandon such patent or license it to another entity.
 
We have obtained registered trademarks for GIFT™ and Gevo® in the U.S. These registered and pending U.S. trademarks are also registered or pending in certain foreign countries.
 
Our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate and our competitors may independently develop technology or products that are similar to or compete with ours. Patent, trademark and trade secret laws afford only limited protection for our technology platform and products. The laws of many countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the U.S. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties have in the past attempted, and may in the future attempt, to operate using aspects of our intellectual property or products or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary. Third parties may also design around our proprietary rights, which may render our protected technology and products less valuable. In addition, if any of our products or technologies is covered by third-party patents or other intellectual property rights, we could be subject to various legal actions. We cannot assure you that our technology platform and products do not infringe patents held by others or that they will not in the future.
 
Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets, to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement, invalidity, misappropriation or other allegations. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. We may be unable to finance litigation costs, which may harm our ability to enforce our intellectual property rights. Any settlement of or adverse judgment resulting from such litigation could require us to obtain a license to continue to make, use or sell the products or technology that is the subject of the claim, or otherwise restrict or prohibit our use of the technology.
 
Customers
 
In 2020, Eco-Energy, LLC ("Eco-Energy") accounted for approximately 52% of our consolidated revenue, HCS accounted for approximately 21% and Purina Animal Nutrition, LLC, formerly Land O'Lakes Purina Feed LLC ("Purina") accounted for approximately 15% of our consolidated revenue. HCS is a customer of Gevo segment. Eco-Energy and Purina are customers of our Gevo Development/Agri-Energy segment (see Note 16). Given the production capacity compared to the overall size of the North American market and the fungible demand for our products, we do not believe that a decline in a specific customer's purchases would have a material adverse long-term effect upon our financial results.

Government Regulation - Environmental Compliance Costs
 
Regulation by governmental authorities in the U.S. and other countries is a significant factor in the development, manufacture and marketing of second-generation renewable fuels. Our isobutanol and the next generation products isobutanol will be used to produce may require regulatory approval by governmental agencies prior to commercialization. In particular, renewable fuels are subject to rigorous testing and premarket approval requirements by the EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality and regulatory authorities in other countries. In the U.S., various federal, and, in some cases, state statutes and regulations also govern or impact the manufacturing, safety, storage and use of renewable fuels. The process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial resources. Regulatory approval, if and when obtained for any of the next generation products isobutanol is used to produce, may be limited in scope, which may significantly limit the uses for which our isobutanol and these next generation products may be marketed.
 
When built at a dry-mill facility, our GIFT™ fermentation process creates iDGs™, a potential animal feed component, as a co-product. We are currently approved to sell iDGs™ as animal feed through the self-assessed Generally Regarded as Safe (“GRAS”) process of the United States Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) via third party scientific review. While we believe we can rely on the GRAS process as we update our biocatalysts to increase isobutanol production, for further customer assurance, we also intend to pursue approval upon a completed biocatalyst from the Center for Veterinary Medicine of the FDA. Even if we receive such approval, the FDA’s policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, delay or require regulatory approval of our co-products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulations that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 
Our process contains a genetically engineered organism which, when used in an industrial process, is considered a new chemical under the EPA’s Toxic Substances Control Act program (“TSCA”). The EPA’s Biotechnology Program under TSCA requires the submission of certain information of the Office of Pollution Prevention and Toxic Substances. Due to the nature of our microorganism, we can utilize the TSCA Biotechnology Program Tier I and Tier II exemption criteria at our Luverne Facility. As we expand our business activities, we will pursue the EPA’s Microbial Commercial Activity Notice process for future plants. We do not anticipate a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition as a result of our efforts to comply with these requirements. However, the TSCA new chemical submission policies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulations that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 
There are various third-party certification organizations, such as ASTM International and Underwriters’ Laboratories, Inc. (“UL”), involved in certifying the transportation, dispensing and use of liquid fuel in the U.S. and internationally. In 2013, a specification for fuel grade isobutanol titled ASTM D7862 “Standard Specification for Butanol for Blending with Gasoline for Use as Automotive Spark-Ignition Engine Fuel” was published. In April 2016, ASTM International completed its process of approving the revision of ASTM D7566 (Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons) to include alcohol to jet synthetic paraffinic kerosene ("ATJ-SPK") derived from renewable isobutanol. Gevo’s SAF is ATJ-SPK for purposes of ASTM D7566. In addition, UL has published guidance on the use of isobutanol-gasoline blends in its UL87A fuel dispensers. When ATJ-SPK, which meets the specifications of ASTM D7566, is blended at a level of 30% or lower with petroleum-based jet fuel, which meets the specifications of ASTM D1655, the entire blended product meets the specifications of ASTM D1655, conventional jet fuel. In other words, the blend containing the ATJ-SPK is completely fungible with any conventional D1655 jet fuel. Voluntary standards development organizations may change and additional requirements may be enacted that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our products. The process of seeking required approvals and the continuing need for compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources. We do not anticipate a material adverse effect on our business or financial conditions as a result of our efforts to comply with these requirements, but we cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse third-party requirements that might arise from future action, either in the U.S. or abroad.
 
We are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including those relating to the discharge of materials into the air, water and ground, the generation, storage, handling, use, transportation and disposal of hazardous materials and the health and safety of our employees. These laws and regulations require us to obtain environmental permits and comply with numerous environmental restrictions as we construct and operate isobutanol assets. They may require expensive pollution control equipment or operation changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment. A violation of these laws, regulations or permit conditions can result in substantial fines, natural resource damage, criminal sanctions, permit revocations and facility shutdowns.
 
There is a risk of liability for the investigation and cleanup of environmental contamination at each of the properties that we own or operate and at off-site locations where we arrange for the disposal of hazardous substances. If these substances are or have been disposed of or released at sites that undergo investigation or remediation by regulatory agencies, we may be responsible under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act or other environmental laws for all or part of the costs of investigation and remediation. We may also be subject to related claims by private parties alleging property damage and personal injury due to exposure to hazardous or other materials at or from the properties. Some of these matters may require us to expend significant amounts for investigation and cleanup or other costs. We are not aware of any material environmental liabilities relating to contamination at or from our facilities or at off-site locations where we have transported or arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances.
 
In addition, new laws, new interpretations of existing laws, increased governmental enforcement of environmental laws or other developments could require us to make significant additional expenditures. Continued government and public emphasis on environmental issues can be expected to result in increased future investments in environmental controls at our facilities which cannot be estimated at this time. Present and future environmental laws and regulations applicable to our operations, more vigorous enforcement policies and discovery of currently unknown conditions could all require us to make substantial expenditures. For example, our air emissions are subject to the Clean Air Act, the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 and similar state and local laws and associated regulations. Under the Clean Air Act, the EPA has promulgated National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (“NESHAP”), which could apply to facilities that we own or operate if the emissions of hazardous air pollutants exceed certain thresholds. If a facility we operate is authorized to emit hazardous air pollutants above the threshold level, then we might still be required to come into compliance with another NESHAP at some future time. New or expanded facilities might be required to comply with both standards upon startup if they exceed the hazardous air pollutant threshold. In addition to costs for achieving and maintaining compliance with these laws, more stringent standards may also limit our operating flexibility.

As a condition to granting the permits necessary for operating our facilities, regulators could make demands that increase our construction and operations costs, which might force us to obtain additional financing. For example, unanticipated water discharge limits could sharply increase construction costs for our projects. Permit conditions could also restrict or limit the extent of our operations. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain or comply with the terms of all necessary permits to complete the retrofit of an ethanol plant. Failure to obtain and comply with all applicable permits and licenses could halt our construction and could subject us to future claims.
 
Our products benefit from the RFS Program in that our isobutanol and ethanol are currently eligible for Renewable Identification Numbers ("RINS") that have value based on the current RFS Program. The RFS Program could change, impacting our products, positively or negatively.
 
Various systems are being put in place around the world to measure carbon intensity and reduction of GHGs, with the intent of creating a system to monetize the value of the reduction of carbon. In order to benefit from such systems, companies need to have their products qualified through a regulatory process. There is no guarantee that any benefit could be gained. In 2019, we submitted a design pathway application to the California Air Resources Board to gain approval for low-carbon intensity ethanol utilizing beef manure biogas as a process input under the LCFS, and we may also seek approval under similar programs in the future.
