Market Overview, Products, Systems and Solutions
 With more than a century of water technology innovation, Badger Meter is a global provider of industry leading water solutions encompassing flow measurement, quality and other system parameters.  These offerings provide customers with the data and analytics essential to optimize their operations and contribute to the sustainable use and protection of the world’s most precious resource.  The Company’s flow measurement products measure water and other fluids and are known for accuracy, long-lasting durability and for providing valuable and timely measurement data through various methods.  The Company’s water quality monitoring solutions include optical sensing and electrochemical instruments that provide real-time, on-demand data parameters. The Company’s product lines fall into two categories: sales of water meters, radios and related technologies, and water quality monitoring solutions to water utilities (utility water) and sales of meters and other sensing instruments, valves and other products for industrial applications in water, wastewater, and other industries (flow instrumentation).  The Company estimates that approximately 90% of its products are used in water related applications.
 Utility water, the largest sales category, is comprised of either mechanical or static (ultrasonic) water meters along with the related radio and software technologies and services used by water utilities as the basis for generating their water and wastewater revenues.  It further comprises other sensor technology used in the water distribution system to ensure the safe and efficient delivery of clean water.  These sensors are used to detect leaks in the distribution piping system and to monitor various water quality parameters throughout the distribution system.  The largest geographic market for the Company’s utility water products is North America, primarily the United States, because most of the Company's meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the American Water Works Association.  The majority of water meters sold by the Company continue to be mechanical in nature; however, ultrasonic meters are an increasing percentage of the water meters sold by the Company and in the industry, due to a variety of factors, including their ability to maintain measurement accuracy over their useful life.  Providing ultrasonic water meter technology, combined with advanced radio technology, provides the Company with the opportunity to sell into other geographical markets, for example the Middle East, Europe and Southeast Asia.  
 The flow instrumentation product line primarily serves water applications throughout the broader industrial markets. This product line includes meters, valves and other sensing instruments sold worldwide to measure and control the quantity of fluids going through a pipe or pipeline including water, air, steam, oil, and other liquids and gases.  These products are used in a variety of industries and applications, with the Company’s primary market focus being water/wastewater; heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC) and corporate sustainability.  Flow instrumentation products are generally sold to original equipment manufacturers as the primary flow measurement device within a product or system, as well as through manufacturers’ representatives.
 Utility water meters (both residential and commercial) are generally classified as either manually read meters or remotely read meters via radio technology.  A manually read meter consists of a water meter and a register that provides a visual totalized meter reading.  Meters equipped with radio technology (endpoints) receive flow measurement data from battery-powered encoder registers attached to the water meter, which is encrypted and transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data

appropriately for water utility usage and billing systems.  These remotely read systems are classified as either automatic meter reading (AMR) systems, where a vehicle equipped for meter reading purposes, including a radio receiver, computer and reading software, collects the data from the utilities’ meters; or advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems, where data is gathered utilizing a network (either fixed or cellular) of data collectors or gateway receivers that are able to receive radio data transmission from the utilities’ meters. AMI systems eliminate the need for utility personnel to drive through service territories to collect data from the meters.  These systems provide utilities with more frequent and diverse data from their meters at specified intervals.
 The ORION® branded family of radio endpoints provides water utilities with a range of industry-leading options for meter reading.  These include ORION (ME) for migratable AMR meter reading, ORION (SE) for traditional fixed network applications, and ORION Cellular for an infrastructure-free meter reading solution.  ORION Migratable makes the migration to fixed network easier for utilities that prefer to start with mobile reading and later adopt fixed network communications, allowing utilities to choose a solution for their current needs and be positioned for their future operational changes.  ORION Cellular eliminates the need for utility-owned fixed network infrastructure, allows for gradual or full deployment, and decreases ongoing maintenance.
 Information and analytics are critical to the water metering ecosystem.  The Company’s BEACON® Advanced Metering Analytics (AMA) software suite improves utility visibility to their water and water usage.  BEACON AMA is a secure, cloud-hosted software suite that includes a customizable dashboard, and has the ability to establish alerts for specific conditions.  It also allows for consumer engagement tools that permit end water users (such as homeowners) to view and manage their water usage activity.  Benefits to the utility include improved customer service, increased visibility through faster leak detection, the ability to promote and quantify the effects of its water conservation efforts, and easier compliance reporting.
 Water meter replacement and the adoption and deployment of new technology comprise the majority of water meter product sales, including radio products.  To a much lesser extent, housing starts also contribute to the new product sales base.  Over the last decade, there has been a growing trend in the conversion from manually read water meters to meters with radio technology.  This conversion rate is accelerating, with the Company estimating that approximately 65% of water meters installed in the United States have been converted to a radio solution technology.
 In addition to our water utility flow measurement solutions, the Company provides various water quality monitoring solutions utilizing optical sensors and electrochemical instruments that measure a variety of parameters including turbidity, pH, chlorine, nitrates and approximately 40 others.   Utilizing these solutions, water quality can be monitored continually or periodically throughout the network from its original source to the point in which it is recycled and returned.  The addition of real-time water quality parameters to core flow measurement, pressure and temperature sensing capabilities enhances the scope of actionable data for water utilities to improve operational security, awareness and efficiency.
 The Company’s net sales and corresponding net earnings depend on unit volume and product mix, with the Company generally earning higher average selling prices and margins on meters equipped with radio technology, and higher margins on ultrasonic compared to mechanical meters.  The Company’s proprietary radio products generally result in higher margins than remarketed, non-proprietary technology products.  The Company also sells registers and endpoints separately to customers who wish to upgrade their existing meters in the field.  
 Flow instrumentation products are used in flow measurement and control applications across a broad industrial spectrum, occasionally leveraging the same technologies used in the municipal water category.  Specialized communication protocols that control the entire flow measurement process and mandatory certifications drive these markets.  The Company provides both standard and customized flow instrumentation solutions.
 The industries served by the Company’s flow instrumentation products face accelerating demands to contain costs, reduce product variability, and meet ever-changing safety, regulatory and sustainability requirements.  To address these challenges, customers must reap more value from every component in their systems.  This system-wide scrutiny has heightened the focus on flow instrumentation in industrial process, manufacturing, commercial fluid, building automation and precision engineering applications where flow measurement and control are critical.
 A leader in both mechanical and static (ultrasonic) flow metering technologies for industrial markets, the Company offers one of the broadest flow measurement, control and communication portfolios in the market.  This portfolio carries respected brand names including Recordall®, Hedland®, Dynasonics®, Blancett®, and Research Control®, and includes eight of the ten major flow meter technologies.  Customers rely on the Company for application-specific solutions that deliver accurate, timely and dependable flow data and control essential for product quality, cost control, safer operations, regulatory compliance and more sustainable operations.
 In addition, the Company provides various water quality monitoring solutions utilizing optical sensors and electrochemical instruments that measure a variety of parameters providing industrial customers with both process and discharge water quality monitoring capabilities.

The Company's products are sold throughout the world through employees, resellers and representatives.  Depending on the customer mix, there can be a moderate seasonal impact on sales, primarily relating to higher sales of certain utility water products during the spring and summer months.  No single customer accounts for more than 10% of the Company's sales.
 Competition
 The Company faces competition for both its utility water and flow instrumentation product lines.  The competition varies from moderate to strong depending upon the products involved and the markets served.  Major competitors for utility water meters include Xylem, Inc. (“Sensus”), Roper Technologies, Inc. (“Neptune”), Master Meter, Inc. and Mueller Water Products, Inc.  Together with Badger Meter, it is estimated that these companies sell in excess of 90% of the water meters in the North American market, which has historically been somewhat insulated from penetration by other competitors due to the historic nature of the mechanical metering technology used.  As static metering technology continues to gain traction in the North American market, additional competitors include firms such as Kamstrup A/S, Diehl Metering GmbH and Itron, Inc., although these competitors lack brand recognition and product breadth and do not have extensive water utility channel distribution to effectively reach the more than 50,000 water utilities in the United States, which impedes their ability to compete.  In addition, as previously noted, the broader technology acceptance of static metering worldwide also provides competitive opportunities for Badger Meter outside North America.
 The Company's primary competitors for utility water radio products in North America are Itron, Inc., Hubbel, Inc. (Aclara Technologies), Neptune and Sensus.  The vast majority of the Company’s radio sales are of its own proprietary radio systems; however, the Company may also resell other third party radio products as part of an overall smart meter solution (e.g. Aclara, Itron®).  
 The Company’s primary competitors for water quality monitoring solutions vary depending on the products and offerings.   Traditional water quality monitoring relies on reagents or test kits, along with lab samples with waiting time for results and the number and scale of competition can be extensive.  The Company’s online, real-time water quality monitoring capabilities generally compete with smaller, specialized firms.
 A number of the Company's competitors in certain markets have greater financial resources than the Company.  The Company, however, believes it currently provides the leading technologies in water meters and water-dedicated radio solutions and analytics.  As a result of significant research and development activities, the Company enjoys favorable patent positions and trade secret protections for several of its technologies, products and processes.
 There are many competitors in the flow instrumentation markets due to the various end markets and applications served.  They include, among others, Emerson Electric Company, Krohne Messtechnik GmbH, Endress+Hauser AG, Yokogawa Electric Corporation and Cameron International.  With a broad portfolio consisting of products utilizing eight of the ten major flow meter technologies, the Company is well positioned to compete in niche, specialized applications within these markets, primarily focused on the water/wastewater and HVAC. 
 Raw Materials and Components
 Raw materials used in the manufacture of the Company's products include purchased castings made of metal or alloys (such as brass, which uses copper as its main component, aluminum, stainless steel and cast iron), plastic resins, glass, microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies, and components.  There are multiple sources for these raw materials and components, but the Company relies on single suppliers for certain brass castings, resins and electronic subassemblies.  The Company believes these items would be available from other sources, but that the loss of certain suppliers may result in a higher cost of materials, delivery delays, short-term increases in inventory and higher quality control costs in the short term.  The Company carries business interruption insurance on key suppliers.  The Company's purchases of raw materials are based on production schedules, and as a result, inventory on hand is generally not exposed to price fluctuations.  World commodity markets and currency exchange rates may also affect the prices of material purchased in the future.  The Company does not hold significant amounts of precious metals.

Environmental Protection
 The Company is subject to contingencies related to environmental laws and regulations.  A future change in circumstances with respect to these specific matters or with respect to sites formerly or currently owned or operated by the Company, off-site disposal locations used by the Company, and property owned by third parties that is near such sites, could result in future costs to the Company and such amounts could be material.  Expenditures for compliance control provisions and regulations during 2020, 2019 and 2018 were not material.
Government Regulations
 The Company’s operations worldwide are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Whether at the federal, state, or local level, the intent of these laws and regulations is to protect product safety, public health and the environment. Similar laws and regulations have been adopted by government authorities in other countries in which we manufacture, distribute, and sell our products.  
 The Company believes that its operations, including its manufacturing locations, are in substantial compliance with all applicable government laws and regulations, including those related to environmental, consumer protection, international trade, labor and employment, human rights, tax, anti-bribery and competition matters. Any additional measures to maintain compliance are not expected to materially affect the Company's capital expenditures, competitive position, financial position or results of operations.
 There are currently no legislative or administrative regulations pending which we anticipate will have a substantial adverse impact on the Company's revenues, earnings or cash flows. However, if new or amended laws or regulations impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company or its products, the Company's business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position could be negatively impacted.
