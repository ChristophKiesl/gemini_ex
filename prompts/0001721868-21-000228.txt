Item 1. Business.
General Information
 Advanced Container Technologies, Inc. (the “Company”) was incorporated under the laws of the state of Florida on September 5, 1997. It changed its corporate name to Acology, Inc. on January 9, 2014; on August 28, 2018, to Medtainer, Inc.; and on October 3, 2020, to its present name.
 On October 9, 2020, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of Advanced Container Technologies, Inc., a California corporation (“Advanced”), that has the same corporate name as the Company, from its shareholders pursuant to an Exchange Agreement, dated August 14, 2020, which was amended on September 9, 2020 (as so amended, the “Exchange Agreement”) in exchange for 50,000,000 shares of the Company’s Common Stock. This exchange resulted in Advanced’s becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. For information as to the business that the Company conducts through Advanced, see Item 1 – Business – Products and Services – GrowPods and for information as to the interest of certain person in the Exchange Agreement, see Item 13 – Exchange Agreement.
 The acquisition of Advanced represents a material change in the business strategy of the Company and an expansion of its product base. Since the inception of the Company in 2014, its intended growth strategy was to concentrate on increasing sales of Medtainers®, while introducing related products and services, such as humidity control inserts and printing. This approach resulted in relatively flat revenues, increasing expenses and a history of losses. Management believes that this acquisition offers the prospect of substantially increased revenues, without a comparable increase in expenses, and offers the Company an opportunity to expand its profits significantly. For further information respecting these expectations, see Item 1 – Business – GrowPods – The Market for GrowPods.
 The Company has authorized capital of 100,000,000 shares of common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (“Common Stock”), and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, without par value. On March 22, 2019, the Company combined the outstanding shares of its Common Stock on the basis of one share for each 100 shares then outstanding and on that date, reduced the number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 6,000,000,000 to 100,000,000, while the number of authorized shares of preferred stock remained 10,000,000. On October 3, 2020, the Company combined the outstanding shares of its Common Stock on the basis of one share for each 59 shares then outstanding; the number of authorized shares of Common Stock and preferred stock was unaffected. The effects of these combinations have been retroactively applied to all periods covered by this report. The Company has also designated 1,000,000 shares of its preferred stock as Series A Convertible Preferred Stock (“Series A Preferred”) and, on July 31, 2020, issued them to its chief executive officer in exchange for 305,085 shares of his Common Stock; these shares, together with the shares of Common Stock owned by him, confer voting control of the Company on him. See Item 10 – Employment Agreement.
 The Company’s principal place of business is located at 1620 Commerce St., Corona, CA 92880. The Company’s telephone number is (951) 381-2555. The Company has two corporate websites: www.advancedcontainertechnologies.com for GrowPods and related items and www.medtainer.com for Medtainers® and related products and services. Common Stock is quoted on the OTC Pink tier of OTC Link, a quotation system operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (“OTC Link”) under the trading symbol ACTX.
Products and Services
 The Company markets and sells two principal products: (i) GrowPods, which are specially modified insulated shipping containers manufactured by GP Solutions, Inc. (“GP”), in which plants, herbs and spices may be grown hydroponically in a controlled environment (“GrowPods”) and (ii) Medtainers®, which may be used to store pharmaceuticals, herbs, teas and other solids or liquids and can grind solids and shred herbs. The Company also markets and sells various products related to GrowPods and the Medtainer®. GrowPods and their related products are described in Item 1. Business – Products and Services – GrowPods, and the Medtainer® and its related products are described in Item 1. Business – Products and Services – The Medtainer®. The Company also provides private labeling and branding services for purchasers of Medtainers® and certain related products. For further details, see Item 1 – Business – Printing.

 The Company received no revenue from GrowPods in the years ended December 31, 2020, or December 31, 2019.
 The Company markets all of its products and services directly to businesses through its phone room, to the retail public through internet sales, and directly to wholesalers and other businesses who resell its products to other businesses and end users. See Item 1 – Business – Sales and Distribution.
 Because Advanced sold no GrowPods during 2020 and the Company’s printing business is a service that relates principally to its Medtainer® products and lighters, the Company regards itself as having had a single segment during 2020. 
 GrowPods and Related Products
 Through its wholly owned subsidiary, Advanced, the Company has, since October 9, 2020, engaged in the business of marketing and distributing GrowPods under a Distributorship Agreement, dated August 6, 2020, by and between Advanced and GP (the “Distributorship Agreement”), which Advanced entered into in connection with the Exchange Agreement. GrowPods may be used to grow, farm and cultivate flowers, fruits, plants, vegetables, cannabis, grains and herbs hydroponically, in controlled environment settings that allow end users to control key farming variables, including temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, light intensity spectrum, nutrient concentration and pH. We also sell branded growing media and nutrients. For further information respecting the Distributorship Agreement, see Item 11 –Business – Products and Services – GrowPods and Related Products, and for information respecting the interests of certain persons who were affiliates of the Company when the Exchange Agreement was signed, or who became such affiliates upon its consummation, see Item 13 – Distributorship Agreement.

Hydroponics is a is a method of growing plants without soil, by using nutrients that are dissolved in water. Plants may be grown with only their roots exposed to the nutrients or roots may be physically supported by an inert growing medium such as perlite and gravel. The spaces in which plants may be grown range from mason jars at one extreme to large warehouses and covered terrain at the other. There are several growing techniques, including (i) static solution culture, in which plants are grown in smaller containers of nutrient solution, (ii) continuous-flow solution culture, in which the nutrient solution constantly flows past the root, which facilitates automation because sampling and adjustments to the temperature, pH, and nutrient concentrations, (iii) agroponics and fogoponics, in which roots are kept in an environment saturated with fine drops or a mist of nutrient solution, (iv) ”run to waste,” in which a nutrient solution is applied one or more times per day to a container of inert growing media and which may be automated with a delivery pump, a timer and irrigation tubing to deliver nutrient as appropriate in light of plant size, plant growing stage, climate, substrate, and substrate conductivity, pH, and water content and (v) deep water culture, in which suspended plant roots are fed a solution of nutrient-rich, oxygenated water.
 We believe that we are positioned to become a leading competitor by market share of in the market for container-based hydroponic growing spaces, which we believe is a unique category of such spaces. Our mission is to provide small- to medium-sized growers, farmers and cultivators with a product that enables greater quality, efficiency, consistency and speed in growing their crops than traditional farming.
 GrowPods
 GrowPods are 20- or 40-foot insulated food-grade containers that GP modifies to add climate control, aqueous or soil-based platforms, LED lighting, a nutrient tank, an irrigation system, a reverse-osmosis water purification system, air and water filters and remote monitoring. Optionally, GP adds prep stations, additional sensors and controls, solar and natural gas energy solutions, security systems and custom colors and graphics multiple pod connections, means of stacking GrowPods, modular additions, clean rooms and specialized shelf systems.
 GrowPods use both indoor organic hydroponic and soil-based systems to provide plants with nutrients, water, and oxygen. LED lights installed in GrowPods are adjustable and can create the specific the spectrum, intensity, and frequency that is optimal for the growth of a particular crop. Automated monitoring equipment enables a grower to maintain the proper level and mixture of nutrients and a precise growing environment. A GrowPod can grow some plants up to five times faster than traditional farming.
 Using GrowPods, growers can use physical space, water and other resources more efficiently, while enjoying year-round and more rapid grow cycles, as well as more predictable and abundant yields, compared with traditional farming.
 Some of GrowPods’ advantages over traditional farming are:
 
· | Productivity. GrowPod provide substantially more productivity. For example, a GrowPod can produce approximately 2,000 heads of lettuce every 55 days, as compared with 4,000 heads per year for the same ground area for traditional farming. Because GrowPods can be stacked (up to five containers high), productivity for each square foot of ground space can be multiplied by a factor of five. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Potentially lower operating costs. The operating costs of GrowPods are potentially lower than for traditional farming because water is reused, nutrients are concentrated and their amounts precisely determined, no pesticides are needed. No labor for tilling, weeding or crop protection is required and operation is automated. While annual operation costs for a GrowPod vary, we believe that the average is approximately $18,000 per year (including electricity, water and growing supplies). 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Climate insensitivity. GrowPods are unaffected by the outside elements. Crops can be grown in a GrowPod year-round in cold areas, reducing the costs of transporting food. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | No Pesticides. Because the controlled environment of GrowPods prevent pests, no insecticide is required. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Location versatility. GrowPods can be installed in building, warehouses, garages and parking lots, close to the market for their crops, saving transportation costs and enhancing freshness. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Ease of moving. GrowPods can easily be moved as the needs of its owner may require. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Better food. Food grown hydroponically has better product safety, quality and consistency. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduced transportation costs and carbon emissions. Hydroponics, especially vertical farming, allows farming operations to be located significantly closer to end-users, thereby reducing transportation distance. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Reduced food waste. Since hydroponics allows for food production significantly closer to end-users, there is less time between production and consumption and therefore reduced product spoilage, damage and waste. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


· | Chemical runoff prevention. Due to closed-loop nature of hydroponics systems, hydroponics significantly decreases the risk of chemical runoff, which is generally more difficult to control in traditional farming. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

While GrowPods offer savings in labor, material and space, they require a substantial amount electrical energy, the cost of which is sometimes higher than that of petroleum-based power that is commonly utilized in traditional farming. We believe that this is offset by the fact that plants may be grown in urban areas and in inhospitable climates, thereby reducing transportation times and costs and enhancing freshness. High energy costs tend to increase the cost of commonly grown crops, such as lettuce, herbs and spices; however, as the value of a crop increases, the cost of energy tends to become a less important consideration.
 Growing Media and Nutrients
 Starting in 2021, we are distributing distribute certain products that are used in order to improve the efficiency of the agricultural growing and the cultivation process. Growing media consists of premium soils and soil alternatives, such as perlite, gravel, rock wool, coconut coir or clay pebbles, used in hydroponic cultivation. We sell some of these products under the names Prolific Soilless Growth Medium and Prolific Fertilizer.
Other Supplies
 Starting in 2021, we are also selling high-efficiency LED lighting, electronically controlled irrigation systems, humidifiers and growing panels as replacement part and upgrades.
 The Market for GrowPods
 The Expanding Hydroponics Market
 Hydroponics is an increasingly significant and fast-growing component of the expanding global commercial agriculture sector. The Company believes that hydroponics will be used increasing as a farming technique, especially for cannabis. According to the USDA, farm output was $136.1 billion in the U.S. alone in 2019, and according to New Frontier Data, the market for legal cannabis in the U.S. in that year was $13.2 billion, with an additional $13.5 billion of illegal cannabis. As indicated below, we expect the market for legal cannabis to grow dramatically.
 According to industry publications, revenue for the global hydroponics industry totaled approximately $65 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 16% from 2019 to 2023. According to these publications, the global wholesale hydroponic equipment and supplies industry totaled approximately $8 billion in 2019 and is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 12.8% from 2019 to 2025.We believe that rapid growth in demand for hydroponically grown crops will increase demand for GrowPods.
 We believe that the growth in the demand for GrowPods and related products will be driven by a broad array of factors including:
 Significant Growth in the Cannabis Industry
 We believe that a majority of our hydroponic equipment and supplies is purchased by participants in the cannabis industry. The North American cannabis industry is massive and growing rapidly, driven largely by state-level legalization efforts in the U.S. We believe that the current and expected growth in the size of the cannabis market has had and will continue to have a very significant positive impact on sales of our hydroponic equipment and supplies.
 The following map illustrates the state-level progression through 2020 of cannabis legalization in the U.S., differentiating states that have fully legalized cannabis for medical and adult-use purposes and states that have partially legalized cannabis for medical purposes only. Importantly, though several U.S. states have taken significant steps towards cannabis legalization, we believe the North American legal cannabis market is still in the nascent stages of realizing its growth potential. As of the date of this report, only 15 U.S. states and the District of Columbia had legalized cannabis for adult-use. The aggregate population of those states is around only one-third of the total U.S. population. Furthermore, in U.S. states that have passed cannabis laws, many such laws remain restrictive to consumer access. As an example, we believe significant suppressed demand would be unlocked in Texas, should the state adopt a medical cannabis law that more closely resembles that of their neighboring state, Oklahoma, where there has been significant growth since cannabis was legalized for medical use in 2018.

Since the preparation of the above map, the State of New York has legalized cannabis and the State of Virginia has legalized it for medical use. In the legislatures of the states that have not legalized cannabis for adult use, there are 23 bills that would legalize its use by adults or for medicinal purposes.
 According to industry publications, the U.S. cannabis market will reach approximately $31.1 billion by 2024, up from approximately $12.2 billion in 2019, representing a 21% CAGR. The following chart illustrates the forecasted growth of the cannabis industry in the United States:

Significant growth in the U.S. cannabis market is expected due to (i) continued state initiatives for new adult use and/or medical-use programs in additional U.S. states, (ii) expanded access for patients or consumers in existing state medical or adult-use cannabis programs, and (iii) increased consumption driven by greater product diversity and choice, reduced stigma, and real and perceived health benefits in states with existing adult-use or medical use programs.

State initiatives for new adult-use or medical-use programs.
 We believe support for cannabis legalization in the U.S. is gaining momentum. According to a November 2019 poll by Pew Research Center, public support for the legalization of cannabis in the U.S. increased from approximately 41% in 2010 to approximately 67% in 2019. According to a 2019 poll by Quinnipiac University, 93% of Americans support patient access to medical-use cannabis if recommended by a doctor. Furthermore, due to the recent socio-economic changes across the U.S. since early 2020, many state government budgets are increasingly under pressure to identify additional revenue sources, such as the potential revenue streams from the taxation and job creation that state legalized adult-use cannabis may offer. Accordingly, a number of states are at various stages of considering implementing laws permitting cannabis use or further liberalizing their existing laws permitting such use. We believe this fact points to the significant sales opportunities for us if or when additional U.S. states legalize adult-use programs.
 Expanded access for patients and consumers in existing state medical and adult-use programs.
 The cannabis business in states with existing cannabis laws will continue to grow, creating jobs and opportunities for workers and entrepreneurs. Cultivators, manufacturers, dispensaries, delivery providers, labs and other cannabis-related businesses will continue to grow in these regions. As these businesses proliferate, we believe that demand for GrowPods will increase.
 Greater product diversity and choice, reduced stigma and real and perceived health benefits in states with existing adult-use or medical use programs.
 Several key developments have contributed to an increase in cannabis product availability and breadth, including the proliferation of CBD and other cannabis-infused products, including edibles, oils, tinctures, and topical treatments. We believe that the historical stigmatization of cannabis use has diminished significantly, driven by a more supportive legislative environment, changes in sociopolitical views and greater awareness of the potential health benefits of cannabis. According to industry publications, real and perceived health benefits extend into areas including cancer treatment, pain management, the treatment of neurological and mental conditions, and sleep management. According to industry publications, the use of cannabis in the U.S. by adults aged 65+ has increased sharply in recent years from 0.4% in 2006 and 2.9% in 2015 to 4.2% in 2018 (JAMA Internal Medicine).
 Acceleration of Hydroponics Adoption
 Both the commercial agriculture and cannabis industries are increasingly adopting more advanced agricultural technologies in order to enhance the productivity and efficiency of operations. This trend continues to increase globally, driven by the factors listed above as well as growth in fruit and vegetable farming, consumer gardening and the continued adoption of vertical farming. Vertical farming, which involves the stacking of GrowPods, has gained popularity mainly due to its advantage of maximizing yield by growing crops in layers. Industry publications project that the global vertical farming market will reach approximately $6 billion in 2023, up from $3 billion in 2019, representing a 24% CAGR from 2019 to 2023.
 We believe that hydroponics is and will continue to be the primary method of growing cannabis, driving demand for our products. The movement towards the legalization of cannabis in the U.S. comes with a corresponding increase in regulatory oversight and statutory requirements for growers and their products. These regulations not only enhance product safety and transparency to consumers but usually necessitate the use of hydroponics in cannabis cultivation in order to meet mandated THC content or impurity tolerances.
 Strong Demand for Hemp for CBD Production
 Hemp cultivation in North America has grown significantly since the passage of the U.S. Farm Bill in December 2018. Consumers are increasingly using hemp-derived products such as CBD for their therapeutic benefits. According to industry publications, the U.S. hemp-derived CBD market is expected to grow from $1.2 billion in 2019 to $6.9 billion in 2025, representing a 6-year CAGR of 33.8%. We believe that there is a market for GrowPods from growers of hemp.
 Competitive Strengths
 We believe that we will be successful in distributing GrowPods due to the following competitive strengths:
 Leading Market Positions in an Expanding Market
 We are a leading seller of container-based hydroponic systems in the U.S. We believe that there are approximately 20 companies that sell or resell products similar to GrowPods in the United States, including manufacturers of such systems who sell their products directly, but because we began selling GrowPods late in 2020, we are unable to ascertain our relative position among them. We serve several attractive end-markets, including hemp and indirectly, the cannabis industry. GP is an independent producer of container-based hydroponic systems.
 Favorable trends in hydroponics, including increased adoption of vertical farming methods to increase yields, are projected to drive a 24% CAGR for the vertical farming market through 2023, according to industry publications. Similarly, growers’ increasing preference to reduce water and energy usage, limit pesticide use and risk of environmental runoff and reduce labor costs coupled with growing consumer demand for fruits and vegetables are expected to drive significant growth in hydroponic. Furthermore, hydroponic growing allows farms to be located closer to their consumers, greatly reducing the costs and waste related to transportation and resulting in an overall smaller carbon footprint. We expect to see the most significant growth in cannabis. We believe that increased support for cannabis legalization at the federal level in the U.S., an increase in U.S. states’ legalization adult-use and medical cannabis and consumer and commercial awareness of the benefits associated with hemp-derived products will drive continued growth.

Capitalizing on Rapidly Growing Markets
 Grower can benefit from macroeconomic factors that we believe will drive demand for GrowPods – as single units or stacked – as well as the growth in cannabis, hemp and other end-markets. As the population grows and urbanizes, we expect vertical farming to be increasingly used to meet the demand for these crops. Industry publications estimate that the global vertical farming market will expand at a 24% CAGR from 2019 to 2023. In addition, the U.S. and Canadian markets for legal cannabis had an estimated value of approximately $14 billion in 2019 and are projected to grow to approximately $37 billion by 2024. The hemp market has benefited from consumer adoption of hemp-derived CBD products. According to industry publications, the U.S. hemp-derived CBD market is expected to grow from $1.2 billion in 2019 to $6.9 billion in 2025, representing a six-year CAGR of 33.8%. We expect that these favorable growth trends by continuing to increase demand for GrowPods.
No Seasonality
 We experience no seasonality due to the fact that GrowPods are climate insensitive.
 The Distributorship Agreement
 Under the Distributorship Agreement, Advanced has the exclusive right to acquire GrowPods and related products at prices to be agreed to from time to time and to sell and distribute them within the United States and its territories at prices that Advanced and GP agree to from time to time, and Advanced is obligated to use its best efforts to sell them. The Distributorship Agreement has an initial term that will expire on December 31, 2025. ACT may renew the Distributorship Agreement indefinitely as long as it purchases the lesser of (i) 100 GrowPods or (ii) GP’s total output of GrowPods in the last calendar year of any term. GrowPods and related items are shipped directly to our purchasers by GP. In the event that Advanced fails to pay GP’s invoices within 30 days of Advanced’s receipt of GP’s products and such default continues unremedied for 15 days after Advanced’s receipt of written notice thereof, GP may terminate the Distributorship Agreement on written notice. In the event that the event that GP is in default of its obligations to deliver its products and such default continues unremedied for 15 days after its receipt of written notice thereof, Advanced may terminate the Agreement on written notice. GP provides a limited warranty that its products will be free of defects in materials and workmanship upon their delivery and for 1 year thereafter.
 The Company believes that the Covid-19 Pandemic has not affected GP’s ability to perform its obligations under the Distributorship Agreement.
 The Medtainer® and Related Products
 Medtainers® are manufactured from medical-grade polypropylene resin. They can store pharmaceuticals, herbs, teas and other solids or liquids and can grind solids and shred herbs and are air- and water-tight. The Company sells the original 20-dram version, a 20-dram version that has received child safety certification, and a 40-dram version. The Company is focusing its marketing of Medtainers® on the drug stores and drug store chains, cannabis/CBD markets, veterinarians and veterinary distributors and other distributors and end users.
 Medtainers® have three components. The top component is a cap, the middle component is a storage cup with grinding/shredding teeth projecting downward from its bottom and the bottom component is a grinding/shredding cup with teeth projecting upward from its bottom. Material is transferred from the storage cup into the grinding/shredding cup, the storage cup is inserted into the grinding/shredding cup, forming a space in which the two sets of teeth intermesh, and the two cups are then rotated manually such that the material passes between the two sets of teeth and is ground or shredded. The ground or shredded material may then be returned to the storage cup for storage or used or dispensed in another manner. The cap attaches to the grinding/shredding cup such that the storage cup is held between them, forming a compact unit which is air- and water-tight between the cap and the storage cup, as well as between the storage cup and the bottom cup. The pictures below show exploded views of the non-childproof and childproof configurations of the Medtainer®.

On June 8, 2018, the Company acquired the patents and patent applications relating to the Medtainer® patents, the trademark “Medtainer” and a related domain name from Polymation, LLC (“Polymation”), agreed with Polymation to terminate the agreement under which the Company purchased Medtainers® from Polymation, licensed Polymation to manufacture Medtainers® solely for purchase by the Company under these patents and entered into a production contract, dated June 8, 2018, which was amended on March 27, 2019, under which Polymation manufactures and the Company purchases Medtainers® (as so amended, the “Production Contract”). The Production Contract requires the Company to purchase at least 30,000 units per month, increasing by 1% on each anniversary of its effective date, and sets prices for the products purchased thereunder, subject to periodic increase for changes in the local consumer-price index. Its term expires on April 30, 2031, unless the Company exercises a termination option, under which it may terminate the Production Contract upon payment to Polymation of $400,000, less any amount that its owner agrees that he owes to the Company or that he owes to it under a final and unappealable judgment, provided that the shares of Common Stock issued to him in the transaction in which the Company acquired the patent and trademark may be publicly sold under the exemption from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the “Securities Act”) afforded by Rule 144 promulgated thereunder or another exemption from such registration.

Because the Company owns the patent for the Medtainer®, to the extent that it can sell more Medtainers® than it is required to purchase under the Production Contract, it will be able to manufacture them in-house or acquire them from a third party, possibly at prices lower than under the Production Contract, but unless the number of Medtainers® that the Company is not required to purchase under the Production Contract is substantial, doing so may not be cost-effective. The Company intends to continue its efforts to sell Medtainers® globally, which, if successful, would increase demand for Medtainers® and could increase sales volume, with the result that the Company might produce them at its facilities or seek out a third party to manufacture them, instead of purchasing them from Polymation, if doing either were cost-effective. The Company presently has no suppliers other than Polymation for Medtainers®.
 The Company believes that the raw materials used by Polymation in manufacturing Medtainers® are readily available. 
 The Company believes that the Covid-19 Pandemic has not affected Polymation’s ability to perform its obligations under the Production Agreement.
 Other Products
 In addition to Medtainers®, the Company sells and is actively developing markets for the following products, all of which it purchases from their manufacturers and resells:

● | Humidity Control Inserts. These inserts are placed into air- and water-tight containers, such as humidors and Medtainers®, to maintain humidity by adding or removing moisture. These inserts are of varying sizes and capable of maintaining various ranges of relative humidity, depending on the specifications of each particular insert. The Company purchases inserts from Boveda Inc. and Desiccare, Inc. and markets them under the Boveda or Desiccare label. The Company also has an agreement with Desiccare for it to private label inserts under the name “MED X 2 Way Humidity Control Pack” and markets some of the inserts it purchases from Desiccare under its own private label. The Company believes that marketing inserts under its own brand label is significant in that many of its Medtainer® products are now being sold with humidity packs inserted into the containers and that this “value added” factor has increased demand for its product.

● | Smell-Proof Bags. These airtight bags are made of flexible polyester, Mylar®, plastic and other substances, with such means of closure as Velcro®, Ziploc® and zippers. Some use activated carbon to enhance odor removal. They are of varying size and can be used to store and prevent dissipation of odors from fish, herbs and dirty clothes, among others. 
● | Lighters. The Company sells butane lighters that are sold with and without logos and other markings. The Company adds logos and markings based on customers’ specifications. 

 There are numerous manufacturers of these products.
 Printing
 The Company began providing printing services in 2015. In 2020, it had revenue of $44,409 from printing, compared with $83,442 in 2019. The Company entered this business because some of its customers desired to have custom labels imprinted on the products that they purchased from the Company and the Company found that the cost of doing so through third parties raised the price that it charged to customers for imprinted products to levels that it believed would impede sales. Labelling is performed using two specialized printers, one of which is capable of printing on nonporous plastic. Currently, about 2,000 square feet is devoted to printing. The Company is seeking additional printing business from companies that require labelling on their own products.
Sales and Distribution
 The Company sells all of GrowPods and related products to end users, approximately 98% of its Medtainer® and related products are sold to wholesalers and distributors, who resell them to businesses and consumers, with and without custom labeling; the remainder are sold directly to retail consumers through internet sales and at trade shows. The Company does not have a showroom for GrowPods, but is able to demonstrate them to customers at GP’s manufacturing facility in Colton, California, and at the facility at which they are completed finished in Skiatook, Oklahoma.

 Patents, Trademarks and Other Intellectual Property
 GrowPods and Related Products
 GP has not registered “GrowPod” or the names of related products as trademarks under federal or state law. The Company does not believe that these names are material to its success in selling these products.
 The Medtainer®
 The Company owns patents and patent applications relating to the Medtainer®, a trademark of the name Medtainer® and a related internet domain. While the Medtainer® is patented, similar products are being manufactured and sold, the Company has not determined whether these products conflict with the Medtainer® patents; however, if it determines that a conflict exists, it takes measures to enforce its patents. The Company does not know to what extent these products have affected its business.
 The Company may license the Medtainer® patents and trademark to, and future, patents, trademarks, trade secrets and similar proprietary rights to and from, third parties.
 The Company employs various methods, including confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements with third parties, employees and consultants, to protect its trade secrets and know-how. As it develops new products, the Company will rely on a combination of patents, trade secrets, unpatented know-how, trademarks, copyrights and other intellectual property rights, nondisclosure agreements and other protective measures to protect its proprietary rights. The Company cannot presently ascertain the extent to which other intellectual property that it may develop or license will be important to it.
 Our ability to compete effectively depends in part on our rights to trademarks, patents and other intellectual property rights we own or license. We have not sought to register every one of our trademarks, patents and other intellectual property in every country in which we sell Medtainers®. Furthermore, because of the differences in foreign trademark, patent and other intellectual property or proprietary rights, we may not receive the same protection in other countries as we would in the United States with respect to our patents and trademarks. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property and proprietary rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products or services infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their intellectual property or proprietary rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources.
 We may need to obtain licenses to patents and other intellectual property and proprietary rights held by third parties to develop, manufacture and market our products, if, for example, we sought to develop our products, in conjunction with any patented technology. If we are unable to timely obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms (or at all) and maintain these licenses, our ability to commercially market our products, may be inhibited or prevented.
 Employees
 Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Company had, in addition to its 2 executive officers, 9 sales personnel, 3 administrative personnel and 4 print technicians and warehouse personnel. Due to the pandemic, the Company has reduced its employees, in addition to its 2 executive officers, to 1 print technician and 3 sales personnel. Depending on the demand for GrowPods, the Company may increase its staffing.
Competition
 We operate in highly competitive industries. There are numerous manufacturers, distributors and resellers of small containers, which include metal, glass, resin, plastic, paper and other packaging materials, while the Company believes that there are about 20 manufacturers, distributors and resellers of container-based hydroponic systems. These competitors are of varying sizes and include Freight Farms, Inc., Micro Lab Farms, Vertical Harvest LLC Freight Farms, Inc. and Greentech Agro LLC with respect to GrowPods; and national and local distributors and manufacturers of hydroponic equipment, nutrients and growing media, such as Maxigrow Ltd., Hydrotek Hydroponics Ltd., Hydrofarm Holdings Group, Inc., The Scotts Miracle-Gro Company and Wholesale Hydroponic Supplies. We also face competition from smaller regional competitors who operate in many of the areas where we compete. Most of the Company’s existing and potential competitors have greater brand name recognition and their products may enjoy greater market acceptance among its potential customers. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater financial, technical, sales, marketing, distribution, service and other resources than does the Company and may be more able to adapt quickly to customers’ changing demands and changes in technology, to enhance existing products, to develop and introduce new products and new production technologies and to respond timely changing market conditions and customer demands. If the Company is not able to compete successfully in the face of its competitors’ advantages, its ability to gain market share or market acceptance for its products could be limited, its revenues and profit margins could suffer and it might never become profitable. Additionally, if demand for our products continues to increase due to the growth of the cannabis and industrial hemp industries, new competitors may enter the market. We believe that the barriers to entry to distributing products similar to those that we resell and to their manufacture are relatively low.

Competitive factors for the products that we market product quality, brand awareness, product performance, value, reputation, price and advertising. We believe that we currently compete effectively with respect to each of these factors.
 Government Regulation
 The Company’s GrowPod business is affected by laws and regulations relating to cannabis, as set forth in Item 1A. Risk Factors. The Company sells products that may be used for cannabis-related purposes. While there is no national governmental regulation relating to the sale of hydroponics equipment, certain products included in our growing media and nutrients product line are subject to certain registration requirements with some U.S. state regulators and federal regulations. We intend to obtain the requisite licenses to sell these where required. Our products include growth media and nutrients that contain ingredients that in some jurisdictions are subject to regulation by various agencies. A decision by a regulatory agency to significantly restrict the use of such products could have an adverse impact on companies providing us with these products and on the end users of these products, and as a result, limit our ability to sell them.
 The Food and Drug Administration (the “FDA”) regulates the material content of Medtainers®, including the medical-grade polypropylene resin used in their manufacture, pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission (the “CPSC”) regulates certain aspects of these products pursuant to various federal laws, including the Consumer Product Safety Act and the Poison Prevention Packaging Act. The FDA and the CPSC can require the manufacturer of defective products to repurchase or recall these products and may also impose fines or penalties on the manufacturer. Similar laws exist in some states, cities and other countries in which the Company sells or intends to sell its products. In addition, certain state laws restrict the sale of packaging with certain levels of heavy metals and impose fines and penalties for noncompliance. Although FDA-approved resins and pigments are used in its products that directly contact food and drugs and the Company believes that Medtainer® products are in material compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements (although the Company is not required to submit these or any other products to the FDA or the CPSC for review), the Company is subject to the risk that these products could be found not to be compliant with these and/or other requirements. A recall of any of these products or any fines and penalties imposed in connection with noncompliance could have a materially adverse effect on the Company.
 The Company believes that it is not otherwise subject to laws and regulations that affect it to a greater extent than other businesses generally.
