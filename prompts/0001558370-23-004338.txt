ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Introduction
We are a blank check company incorporated on March 24, 2021 as a Delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities, which we refer to throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K as our initial business combination. We have also neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. 
Prior to our Initial Public Offering, on March 30, 2021, our sponsor purchased an aggregate of 8,625,000 founder shares, for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000. In November 2021, our sponsor surrendered an aggregate of 1,900,000 founder shares to the Company at no cost. An aggregate of 175,000 founder shares were issued to our independent directors for an aggregate of $700. As of December 31, 2022, there were 6,900,000 founder shares outstanding.
​
On November 19, 2021, we consummated our Initial Public Offering of 27,600,000 units at $10.00 per Unit, generating gross proceeds of approximately $276.0 million, and incurring offering costs of approximately $16.6 million, of which approximately $9.7 million was deferred underwriting commissions. Each unit consisted of one share of Class A common stock and one half of one redeemable public warrant. Each public warrant entitles the holder to purchase one share of Class A common stock at a price of $11.50 per share. 
​
Simultaneously with the closing of the Initial Public Offering, we consummated the private placement (“Private Placement”) of 13,730,000 private placement warrants, at a price of $1.00 per private placement warrant, generating gross proceeds of $13.7 million.
Commencing January 7, 2022, holders of the units sold in our Initial Public Offering may elect to separately trade the shares of Class A common stock and public warrants included in the units. The shares of Class A common stock and public warrants that are separated trade on the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) under the symbols “NETC” and “NETC.WS,” respectively. Those units not separated continue to trade on the NYSE under the symbol “NETC.U.”
Proposed Business Combination
Business Combination Agreement
On February 14, 2023, we entered into a Business Combination Agreement with Vast Solar Pty Ltd, an Australian proprietary company limited by shares (“Vast”), Neptune Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Vast (“Merger Sub”), our sponsor and Nabors (the “Business Combination Agreement,” and the transactions contemplated thereby, the “Business Combination”), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions contained therein, Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company (the “Merger”), with the Company continuing as the surviving corporation and a wholly owned direct subsidiary of Vast (the “Surviving Corporation”).
Immediately prior to the Merger, the MEP Share Conversion (as defined below), the Existing Convertible Note Conversion (as defined below) and a conversion of ordinary shares in Vast (the “Vast Ordinary Shares”) (whether by way of subdivision or consolidation) (the “Vast Split Adjustment”) will be undertaken whereby the amount of all Vast Ordinary Shares outstanding immediately after such corporate actions will be 20,500,000 (subject to certain adjustments) to be effective at the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”).
Exchange and Conversion of Securities
At or around the time of undertaking the Vast Split Adjustment and the Existing Convertible Note Conversion, Vast will cause each share or other awards granted under Vast’s existing Management Equity Plan Deed (such shares and awards, the “MEP Shares”) that is outstanding immediately prior to such time to be settled by the conversion of those MEP Shares into Vast Ordinary Shares (the “MEP Share Conversion”).
​

 At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of us, Vast, Merger Sub or any of the holders of any of their securities, the following events will take place simultaneously:



● | all shares of our Class A common stock, Class B common stock and founder shares will be canceled without any conversion thereof and no payment of distribution will be made with respect thereof;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | (i) each share of our Class A common stock (other than the Redemption Shares as described below) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be exchanged for one validly issued and fully paid Vast Ordinary Share, (ii) each founder share and share of our Class B common stock held by (A) the sponsor and (B) any person to whom the sponsor has transferred founder shares or shares of Class B common stock immediately prior to the Effective Time will be collectively exchanged for 2,825,000 validly issued and fully paid Vast Ordinary Shares, (iii) each share of our Class B common stock not held by (A) the sponsor or (B) any person who received shares of Class B common stock from the sponsor immediately prior to the Effective Time will be exchanged for one validly issued and fully paid Vast Ordinary Share, and (iv) each founder share not held by (A) the sponsor or (B) any person who received founder shares from the sponsor immediately prior to the Effective Time will be exchanged for one validly issued and fully paid Vast Ordinary Share, in each case, after giving effect to the Vast Split Adjustment (collectively, the “Per Share Merger Consideration”);
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | each share of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation and will constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation as of immediately after the Effective Time; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Vast will assume (i) the Private Warrant Agreement and (ii) the Public Warrant Agreement (together, the “NETC Warrant Agreements”), and each warrant granted thereunder then outstanding and unexercised will automatically, without any action on the part of its holder, be converted into a warrant to acquire a number of Vast Ordinary Shares (each resulting warrant, a “Vast Warrant”). Each Vast Warrant will be subject to the same terms and conditions (including exercisability terms) as were applicable to the corresponding private placement warrant or public warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time, except to the extent such terms or conditions are rendered inoperative by the Business Combination. Accordingly, effective as of the Effective Time: (I) each Vast Warrant will be exercisable solely for Vast Ordinary Shares; (II) the number of Vast Ordinary Shares subject to each Vast Warrant will be equal to (x) the number of shares of our Class A common stock subject to the applicable public warrant or private placement warrant; and (III) the per share exercise price for the Vast Ordinary Shares issuable upon exercise of such Vast Warrant will be equal to (x) the per share exercise price for the shares of our Class A common stock subject to the applicable public warrant or private placement warrant, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time. Vast will take all corporate action necessary to reserve for future issuance, and will maintain such reservation for so long as any of the Vast Warrants remain outstanding, a sufficient number of Vast Ordinary Shares for delivery upon the exercise of such Vast Warrants.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each share of our Class A common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time with respect to which a stockholder has validly exercised its redemption rights (“Redemption Rights”) provided for in our amended and restated charter (i) will be redeemed immediately prior to the Effective Time (such shares, the “Redemption Shares”) and will be converted into the right to receive from us, in cash, an amount per share calculated in accordance with such stockholder’s Redemption Rights and (ii) will not be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.
In the event that a unit has not been detached so as to permit separate transferability or trading prior to the Effective Time, then effective immediately prior to the Effective Time, any and all units will be automatically detached and broken out into their constituent parts, such that a holder of one unit will hold one share of our Class A common stock and one-half of one warrant, and the underlying Class A common stock and warrants will be converted in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement. However, if the detachment would result in a holder of a warrant holding a fractional warrant, then prior to the conversion the number of warrants deemed to be held by such holder will be rounded down to the nearest whole number.

Earn-Out
During the period between the date that is seventy (70) days after the closing of the Business Combination (the “Closing,” and such date, the “Closing Date”) and the five-year anniversary of the Closing Date (the “Earnout Period”), Vast will issue to eligible Vast shareholders up to 2,799,999 additional Vast Ordinary Shares in the aggregate (the “Earnout Shares”), consisting of (i) up to 1,299,999 additional Vast Ordinary Shares in the aggregate issued (a) upon satisfaction of certain share price targets set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, which price targets will be based upon the daily volume-weighted average closing sale price of one Vast Ordinary Share quoted on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) (or the exchange on which the Vast Ordinary Shares are then listed), for any twenty (20) trading days within any thirty (30) consecutive trading day period within the Earnout Period or (b) upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) pursuant to which Vast or its shareholders has the right to receive consideration implying a value per Vast Ordinary Share equal to or above the share price targets set forth in the Business Combination Agreement, and (ii) 1,500,000 additional Vast Ordinary Shares issued upon the achievement of certain project milestones or upon a Change of Control.
While Vast must use its reasonable best efforts to do all things necessary (including obtaining any shareholder or other approvals required under applicable Laws, including the Australian Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) (the “Corporations Act”)) to issue Earnout Shares, if certain Earnout Shares cannot be issued within three (3) months of an entitlement to them arising or if an issue of Earnout Shares is subsequently unwound by order of a court or other governmental authority, Vast must instead pay an amount of cash to the affected eligible Vast shareholder in an amount up to the value of the unissued Earnout Shares as defined in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement.
Representations, Warranties and Covenants
The Business Combination Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants of (a) us and (b) Vast and Merger Sub relating to, among other things, our and their ability to enter into the Business Combination Agreement and our and their outstanding capitalization.
Conditions to Closing and Termination
The Business Combination Agreement contains customary conditions to each party’s obligation to close the transaction and circumstances under which the parties can terminate the agreement. If the Business Combination Agreement is terminated, the Business Combination Agreement will become void and there will be no liability under the Business Combination Agreement on the part of any party, except in the case of a willful material breach of the Business Combination Agreement prior to such termination.
Certain Related Agreements
In connection with the Business Combination Agreement, we entered into the following agreements:
Support Agreement. We entered into the Support Agreement with Sponsor, Vast, Nabors Lux and the independent directors (together with our sponsor and Nabors Lux, the “Insiders”), pursuant to which, among other things, the Insiders agreed (i) to certain restrictions on the transfer of the founder shares and private placement warrants, (ii) to vote all founder shares held by them in favor of the adoption and approval of the Business Combination Agreement, (iii) to waive the anti-dilution rights with respect to their founder shares and (iv) to enter into the Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement. The sponsor will have the right to be issued up to 3,900,000 additional Vast Ordinary Shares during the Earnout Period upon satisfaction of certain price targets set forth therein, which price targets will be based on the daily volume-weighted average closing sale price of one Vast Ordinary Share quoted on the NYSE (or the exchange on which the Vast Ordinary Shares are then listed), for any twenty (20) trading days within any thirty (30) consecutive trading day period within the Earnout Period.
Letter Agreement Amendment. We, our sponsor, Nabors Lux and our officers and directors entered into an amendment to the Letter Agreement, pursuant to which the parties have agreed to remove the lock-up provisions with respect to the founder shares conditioned on the Closing. 
Subscription Agreements. Concurrently with the signing of the Business Combination Agreement, Nabors Lux and AgCentral Energy Pty Limited (“AgCentral”) entered into subscription agreements (the “Notes Subscription Agreements,” 

10




and the financing received therefrom, the “Interim Company Financing”), pursuant to which, among other things, Nabors Lux and AgCentral have each agreed to subscribe for and purchase up to $5.0 million (or $10.0 million in aggregate principal amount) of Senior Convertible Notes from Vast in a private placement to be funded in accordance with the Notes Subscription Agreements. Any amount of Interim Company Financing provided by Nabors Lux or AgCentral will be exchanged for an equivalent number of Vast Ordinary Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time and be deemed to reduce their subscription amounts under the PIPE Financing (as defined below). Vast may enter into additional Notes Subscription Agreements with additional investors between the signing of the Business Combination Agreement and the Closing (the financing received under such additional agreements and together with the financing received under the Notes Subscription Agreements, the “Convertible Financing”).
Also concurrently with the signing of the Business Combination Agreement, Nabors Lux and AgCentral entered into subscription agreements with Vast (the “Equity Subscription Agreements”), pursuant to which, among other things, Nabors Lux and AgCentral agreed, subject to the Closing occurring and certain other conditions, to subscribe for and purchase, and Vast agreed to issue and sell to each of Nabors Lux and AgCentral, up to $15.0 million (or an aggregate of $30.0 million) of Vast Ordinary Shares for $10.20 per share in a private placement. Vast may enter into additional Equity Subscription Agreements, with additional investors between the signing of the Business Combination Agreement and the Closing (the financing received under such additional agreements and together with the financing received under the Equity Subscription Agreements, the “PIPE Financing”).
Services Agreement. Concurrently with signing of the Business Combination Agreement, Vast and Nabors Corporate Services, Inc., an affiliate of our sponsor (“Nabors Corporate”), entered into a services and cost reimbursement agreement pursuant to which, among other things, Nabors Corporate will provide certain services related to operations, engineering, design planning and other operational or technical matters to Vast.
Joint Development and License Agreement. Concurrently with the signing of the Business Combination Agreement, Vast and Nabors Energy Transition Ventures LLC, an affiliate of our sponsor (“NETV”), pursuant to which NETV and Vast will agree to work together on a project-by-project basis to develop products and/or equipment related to solar power generation.
Noteholder Support Agreement. At the time of the signing of the Business Combination Agreement, AgCentral is the sole holder of convertible promissory notes previously issued by Vast (the “Existing Convertible Notes”) and a party to certain existing loan agreements with Vast (the “AgCentral Loan Agreements”).Concurrently with the signing of the Business Combination Agreement, Vast and AgCentral entered into the Noteholder Support and Termination Agreement (the “Noteholder Support Agreement”) pursuant to which, among other things, AgCentral agreed to (i) immediately prior to the Closing, as applicable, (a) exercise (or be deemed to have exercised) the conversion rights under each of the Existing Convertible Notes to convert all such Existing Convertible Notes into Vast Ordinary Shares, (b) accept Vast Ordinary Shares as settlement of its Existing Convertible Notes whereupon such notes shall be cancelled, (c) accept Vast Ordinary Shares as repayment of all of the principal outstanding and accrued interest under each AgCentral Loan Agreement whereupon each AgCentral Loan Agreement will be discharged and terminated and (d) discharge and release all financier security granted by Vast to AgCentral in respect of the Existing Convertible Notes and the Ag Central Loan Agreements, and (ii) not to transfer, prior to the Closing or termination of the Business Combination Agreement, AgCentral’s rights under any AgCentral Loan Agreement, its Vast Ordinary Shares or the Existing Convertible Notes, subject to certain exceptions.
In connection with the Closing, we will enter into, among others, the following agreement:
Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement. Concurrently with the Closing, we, Vast, our sponsor and the holder parties thereto will enter into the Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement, pursuant to which Vast will agree that, within sixty days of the Closing, Vast will file with the SEC (at Vast’s sole cost and expense) a resale registration statement, and Vast will use its commercially reasonable efforts to have the such registration statement declared effective as soon as reasonably practicable after the filing thereof. In certain circumstances, the holders of certain securities held by or issuable to certain of our existing shareholders and Vast can demand Vast’s assistance with underwritten offerings and exercise demand or piggyback rights with respect to such offerings. Additionally the Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement contains a customary lock-up agreement for six months after the Closing. The Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement grants to the sponsor the right to nominate for election one director to Vast’s board of directors (the “Vast Board”) for so long as the sponsor and its affiliates collectively beneficially own 50% of the number of Vast Ordinary Shares that the sponsor and its affiliates collectively beneficially owned immediately following the Closing. The 

11




Shareholder and Registration Rights Agreement also grants to AgCentral the rights to nominate for election one director to the Vast Board for so long as AgCentral and its affiliates collectively beneficially own at least the number of Vast Ordinary Shares that entitle the sponsor to nominate for election one director.
Extension 

We have extended of our initial 15-month period to consummate our initial business combination by 3 months as allowed by our charter. On February 16, 2023, Nabors Lux and Greens Road Energy LLC deposited an aggregate $2,760,000 into our trust account in connection with the three month extension of our time to consummate our initial business combination. In connection with such extension, we issued an unsecured promissory note to (i) Nabors Lux in the principal amount of $1,518,000 and (ii) Greens Road Energy LLC in the principal amount of $1,242,000 (together, the “Notes”). Each of Nabors Lux and Greens Road Energy LLC is an affiliate of the Sponsor. The Notes bear no interest and are due and payable upon the earlier to occur of (i) the date on which our initial business combination is consummated as provided herein and (ii) the liquidation of the Company on or before May 19, 2023 (unless such date is extended pursuant to our charter or such later liquidation date as may be approved by our stockholders). 
If we consummate an initial business combination, we will repay the loans out of the proceeds of the trust account for our public stockholders or, at the option of our Sponsor, convert all or a portion of the loans into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant, which warrants will be identical to the warrants we issued in a private placement in connection with our initial public offering. If we do not consummate an initial business combination, we will repay the loans only from funds held outside of the Trust Account.
Business Strategy
Our strategy is to identify solutions, opportunities, companies or technologies that facilitate, improve or complement the ongoing global energy sector’s shift from fossil-based systems of energy production and consumption -- including oil, natural gas and coal -- to renewable energy sources such as geothermal energy or hydrogen, which support the transition towards a low- or no-carbon emitting future and reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions as energy consumption continues to rapidly grow, which is known as the “energy transition.” We intend to prioritize environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors advancing the energy transition.
Specific sectors on which we intend to focus include alternative energy, energy storage, emissions reduction and carbon capture, utilization and sequestration (“CCUS”). We intend to leverage Nabors’ particular energy transition experience and its expertise developing and globally deploying discrete, mobile assets, advanced technologies and applications, such as digital controls and analytics, as well as the commercial, operational and financial expertise and industry relationships of our directors and executive officers to effectively identify and execute on investment opportunities.
The energy transition has gained traction across multiple markets. Nabors has developed a deep understanding of the transformation of the energy landscape, having successfully operated for more than a century through multiple significant transitions. These include the progressive evolution of drilling rigs from mechanical to the modern AC electric rig, the expansion of hydrocarbon exploration and development to offshore and remote domains, the digitization of field operations and, most recently, the adoption of automation across multiple phases of the drilling process. We believe Nabors is the recognized leader in driving robotics for land and offshore rigs. Historically, Nabors has also been active in geothermal energy development in several countries and retains technical leadership in developing and managing geothermal assets. Nabors’ and our management team’s combined experience includes a thorough understanding of market drivers and a track record of proactively anticipating significant market shifts.
We intend to focus on acquisition opportunities with meaningful and attractive growth prospects with a principal focus on advancing the energy transition. More specifically, we intend to focus on:

• | alternative energy sources, including but not limited to geothermal energy;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | power management, energy storage and distributed energy systems;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | CCUS;
--+------


• | advanced combustion technologies targeting emissions reduction;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


• | autonomous and industrial mobility; and
--+----------------------------------------


• | other industrial applications.
--+-------------------------------

12




Our initial business combination strategy will target opportunities that would offer market leadership, and which would benefit from both the financial flexibility of access to public capital markets and the access to Nabors’ own market presence and operational and functional expertise. We believe our relationship with Nabors and its long record of successfully navigating technology evolutions, as well as its global operational and manufacturing platform and its history of identifying and integrating accretive acquisitions, will enable deal flow and be attractive to potential acquisition targets.
Specific elements of our strategy include:

• | capitalizing on emerging energy transition to decarbonization;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | ​participating in the development of renewable energy sources;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | ​identifying acquisition opportunities with sustainable competitive advantages;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | leveraging Nabors’ global operational, commercial and manufacturing platform and capabilities to develop and deploy technology; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | providing strong sponsor support.
--+----------------------------------

​
Our Sponsor
Our sponsor is Nabors Energy Transition Sponsor LLC, which is (i) managed and co-owned by, and is an affiliate of, Nabors, a public corporation with operations providing services and equipment for upstream oil and gas exploration and production (“E&P”), and (ii) co-owned by Greens Road Energy LLC.
Nabors and its predecessor entities have been continuously operating in the energy sector for over 100 years. Since the late 1980s, Nabors has become one of the global drilling industry’s largest contractors through a combination of organic growth and many successful acquisitions.
As a strategic partner, Nabors brings several significant sources of value to the company. These include:

• | opportunity to readily scale technology across global markets;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------


• | established operational, safety, risk management, financial, accounting and reporting systems and best practices in place;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | worldwide footprint in markets accounting for more than 70% of hydrocarbon production;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | opportunity to design, commercialize, deploy and operate cutting-edge technology and assets on a global basis;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | low-cost manufacturing capacity in Nabors’ Canrig operation; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------


• | modular, automation, remote controlled and monitored system expertise.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Nabors’ capabilities have been proven across a multitude of demanding environments. It has operated successfully in surface conditions as varied as the Middle East desert, sub-zero temperatures in the Arctic, and difficult, dense and logistically challenged locations, as well as offshore in both shallow and deep water. Subsurface conditions, which are seen as particularly challenging in the industry yet ordinary course for Nabors, include high temperatures and pressures typically encountered by oil and gas wells at depth, as well as volatile or corrosive compounds in hydrocarbon bearing zones. Through its technology innovation, Nabors has proven to be a valued provider to many global leaders including Saudi Aramco, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Royal Dutch Shell, Ecopetrol, YPF and PEMEX, among others.
In particular, Nabors offers:

• | market access that spans geographies, including strong relationships with the largest energy companies in the world;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | manufacturing proficiency and multijurisdictional functional expertise, with established management systems in place; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | development and commercialization of technologies with an organization comprised of hundreds of mechanical, industrial, electrical and software engineers.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Greens Road Energy LLC has been funded exclusively by cash provided by its owners independently of Nabors, and its economic ownership of our sponsor is pari passu with the investment in our sponsor by an affiliate of Nabors. As a 

13




result, the interests of Greens Road Energy LLC are substantially aligned with those of Nabors. The separate ownership of Greens Road Energy LLC also offers the following advantages:

• | assurance to our public stockholders that management is committed and focused on prioritizing our success;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | alignment of our interests with those of our management; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | demonstration that owners of Greens Road Energy LLC believe that it is a compelling investment opportunity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acquisition Target Focus/Criteria
In line with our strategy, we have established general criteria which we plan to utilize to evaluate acquisition candidates, although we may ultimately acquire a target that does not meet these criteria, or that meets criteria which we may develop. Our current intent is to focus on targets which meet one or more of the following criteria:

• | actively driving the energy transition through one or more initiative areas;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | platform for high growth, organically, through acquisitions, or from a combination of both;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | established or potential sustainable competitive advantages;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------


• | identifiable target market for products and services, and potential for additional markets;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | maximizes value to a broad base of stakeholders, including investors, employees, and the wider community; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential to generate returns on investment which are greater than the target’s cost of capital.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial Business Combination
The NYSE rules require that we must complete one or more business combinations having an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in trust (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust) at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. Our board will make the determination as to the fair market value of a target business or businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of a target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”), or an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria.
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation requires the affirmative vote of a majority of our board of directors, and which must include (i) a majority of our independent directors and (ii) each of the non-independent directors nominated by our sponsor, to approve our initial business combination.
We anticipate structuring our initial business combination either (i) in such a way so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses, or (ii) in such a way so that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders, or for other reasons. However, we will only complete a business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise is not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”). Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock, shares or other equity interests of a target or issue a substantial number of new shares to third parties in connection with financing our initial business combination. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the 80% of net assets test. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the transactions and we will treat the target businesses together as the initial business combination for seeking stockholder approval or for purposes of a tender offer, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of fair market value test.

14




Our Acquisition Process
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review that will encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, inspection of facilities, as well as a review of financial and other information that will be made available to us. We will also utilize our operational and capital allocation experience.
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will take appropriate measures to ensure that the transaction is considered and approved by directors who do not have an interest in the transaction and will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.
Nabors, members of our management team and our directors directly or indirectly own founder shares and private placement warrants. Each member of our management team may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination. Further, each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a condition to any agreement with respect to our initial business combination.
Certain of the members of our board of directors are employed by, and/or directors of, Nabors or affiliates of Nabors. Nabors and its affiliates are continuously made aware of potential business opportunities, one or more of which we may desire to pursue for a business combination; we have not, however, selected any specific business combination target and we have not, nor has anyone on our behalf, initiated any substantive discussions, directly or indirectly, with any business combination target.
Certain of our officers and directors presently have, and any of our officers and directors in the future may have, additional fiduciary or contractual obligations to other entities pursuant to which such officer or director is or will be required to present a business combination opportunity. For example, certain of our officers and directors currently serve in similar roles for Nabors, a Bermuda exempted company the ordinary shares of which trade on the NYSE under the symbol “NBR.” Each such officer and director owes certain duties to Nabors under applicable Bermuda laws.
Accordingly, if any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that is suitable for an entity to which he or she has then-current fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she will honor his or her fiduciary or contractual obligations to present such opportunity to such other entity, subject to their fiduciary duties under Delaware law. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue. We do not believe, however, that the fiduciary duties or contractual obligations of our officers or directors will materially affect our ability to complete our business combination. We believe that potential conflicts with Nabors are naturally mitigated by the differing nature of the investments Nabors would typically consider most suitable to its existing businesses and the types of transactions we expect to find most attractive based on target sector, transaction size, capital structure and other factors. For this and other reasons, you should not rely on the historical record of our management team, Nabors or any related investment’s performance as indicative of our future performance or of an investment in us or the returns we will, or are likely to, generate going forward.
In addition, Nabors or its affiliates may sponsor other blank check companies similar to our company during the period in which we are seeking an initial business combination, and members of our management team and directors may participate in such blank check companies. Any such companies may present additional conflicts of interest in pursuing an acquisition target, particularly in the event there is overlap among the management teams.
Management Resources
Members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business 

15




combination. The amount of time that any members of our management team will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process.
Status as a Public Company
We believe our structure makes us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses. As an existing public company, we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination with us. In a business combination transaction with us, the owners of the target business may, for example, exchange their shares of stock, shares or other equity interests in the target business for shares of our Class A common stock (or shares of a new holding company) or for a combination of shares of our Class A common stock and cash, allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers. Although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company, we believe target businesses will find this method a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering. The typical initial public offering process takes a significantly longer period of time than the typical business combination transaction process, and there are significant expenses in the initial public offering process, including underwriting discounts and commissions, that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us.
Furthermore, once a proposed business combination is completed, the target business will have effectively become public, whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters’ ability to complete the offering, as well as general market conditions, which could delay or prevent the offering from occurring or could have negative valuation consequences. Once public, we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital, an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders’ interests and the ability to use its equity as currency for acquisitions. Being a public company can offer further benefits by augmenting a company’s profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees.
While we believe that our structure and our management team’s backgrounds make us an attractive business partner, some potential target businesses may view our status as a blank check company, such as our lack of an operating history and our ability to seek stockholder approval of any proposed initial business combination, negatively.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (1) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to time) or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (2) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities during the prior three-year period.
Financial Position
With funds available in trust for a business combination in the amount of $284.8 million as of December 31, 2022, assuming no redemptions and excluding any amounts available to us for working capital, we offer a target business a variety of options, such as creating a liquidity event for its owners, providing capital for the potential growth and expansion 

16




of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt-to-equity ratio. Because we are able to complete our initial business combination using our cash, debt or equity securities, or a combination of the foregoing, we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires. However, we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us.
Effecting our Initial Business Combination
We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, our capital stock, debt or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.
If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or if not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other businesses or assets, or for working capital.
Although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine, we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter. Furthermore, some of those risks may be outside of our control, meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely affect a target business.
We may need to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination, either because the transaction requires more cash than is available from the proceeds held in our trust account or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of the business combination, in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination. In the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets, our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and, only if required by applicable law, we would seek stockholder approval of such financing. There are no prohibitions on our ability to issue securities or incur debt in connection with our initial business combination. We are not currently a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities, the incurrence of debt or otherwise.
Sources of Target Businesses
We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, or from making the acquisition through a joint venture or other form of shared ownership with our sponsor, officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a business combination target that is affiliated with our sponsor, officers or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, would obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that such an initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view. We are not required to obtain such an opinion in any other context.
If any of our officers or directors becomes aware of a business combination opportunity that falls within the line of business of any entity to which he or she has pre-existing fiduciary or contractual obligations, he or she may be required to present such business combination opportunity to such entity prior to presenting such business combination opportunity to us. Our officers and directors currently have certain relevant fiduciary duties or contractual obligations that may take priority over their duties to us.
Selection of a Target Business and Structuring of our Initial Business Combination
The NYSE rules require that our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least 80% of the net assets held in trust (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting discount held in trust) 

17




at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination. The fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community, such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses. If our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or from an independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. We do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in conjunction with our initial business combination. Subject to this requirement, our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses, although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations.
In any case, we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or if the post-transaction company is otherwise not required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act. If we own or acquire less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses, the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the NYSE’s 80% of net assets test. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if we are not then listed on the NYSE for whatever reason, we would no longer be required to meet the foregoing 80% of fair market value test. There is no basis for investors in the Initial Public Offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our business combination.
To the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business. Although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business, we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors.
While the high vote feature of our Class B common stock differs from the typical capital structure of many other special purpose acquisition companies, we expect to maintain this capital structure following our initial business combination. However, maintenance of this capital structure is not a condition for us to evaluate acquisition opportunities. Although we are not aware of and are unable to determine at this time the criteria on which we would base our decision regarding whether to engage in a business combination that would eliminate our Class B common stock or its high vote feature, we may, in our sole discretion, seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to change this feature.
In evaluating a prospective target business, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review, which may encompass, among other things, meetings with incumbent management and employees, document reviews, interviews of customers and suppliers, inspection of facilities, as applicable, as well as a review of financial, operational, legal and other information which will be made available to us. If we determine to move forward with a particular target, we will proceed to structure and negotiate the terms of the business combination transaction.
The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of, and negotiation with, a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination. The company will not pay any consulting fees to members of our management team, or any of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to or in connection with our initial business combination.
Lack of Business Diversification
For an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination, the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business. Unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries, it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business. In addition, we intend to 

18




focus our search for an initial business combination in a single industry. By completing our business combination with only a single entity, our lack of diversification may:

• | subject us to negative economic, competitive and regulatory developments, any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination, and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Limited Ability to Evaluate the Target’s Management Team
Although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business, our assessment of the target business’s management may not prove to be correct. In addition, the future management may not have the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities to manage a public company. Furthermore, the future role of members of our management team, if any, in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty. The determination as to whether any of the members of our management team will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination. While it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination, it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination. Moreover, we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business.
We cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company. The determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination.
Following a business combination, we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business. We cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers, or that additional managers will have the requisite skills, knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management.
Stockholders May Not Have the Ability to Approve our Initial Business Combination
We may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, subject to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. However, we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule, or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons. Presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder approval is currently required under Delaware law for each such transaction.

​ | ​ | ​ 
--------------------------------------------------------------------+---+------------
​ | | Whether 
​ | | Stockholder
​ | | Approval is
Type of Transaction | | Required 
Purchase of assets | | No 
Purchase of stock of target not involving a merger with the company | | No 
Merger of target into a subsidiary of the company | | No 
Merger of the company with a target | | Yes 

​
Under the NYSE’s listing rules, stockholder approval would be required for our initial business combination if, for example:

• | we issue shares of Class A common stock that will be equal to or in excess of 20% of the number of shares of our Class A common stock then outstanding (other than in a public offering);
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | any of our directors, officers or substantial security holders (as defined by the NYSE rules) has a 5% or greater interest, directly or indirectly, in the target business or assets to be acquired and if the number of shares of common stock to be issued, or if the number of shares of common stock into which the securities may be convertible or exercisable, exceeds either (a) 1% of the number of shares of common stock or 1% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any of our directors or officers or (b) 5% of the number of shares
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

of common stock or 5% of the voting power outstanding before the issuance in the case of any substantial security holders; or
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the issuance or potential issuance of common stock will result in our undergoing a change of control.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Permitted Purchases of our Securities
In the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no limit on the number of shares our sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and the rules of the NYSE. Any such price per share may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material nonpublic information), our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or any of their respective affiliates are under no obligation or duty to do so and they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. Such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder, although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights.
In the event that our initial stockholders, sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.
The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or (ii) to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible.
In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our common stock or public warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
Our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our initial stockholders, sponsor, officers, directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders (in the class of shares of Class A common stock) following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination. To the extent that our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase, they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against our initial business combination, whether or not such stockholder has already submitted a proxy with respect to our initial business combination but only if such shares have not already been voted at the stockholder meeting related to our initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers, directors, advisors or any of their affiliates will select which stockholders to purchase shares from based on the 

20




negotiated price and number of shares and any other factors that they may deem relevant, and will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with Regulation M under the Exchange Act and the other federal securities laws.
Any purchases by our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under Rule 10b-18 under the Exchange Act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with Rule 10b-18, which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under Section 9(a)(2) and Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Rule 10b-18 has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser. Our sponsor, officers, directors and/or their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10b-5 of the Exchange Act. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.
Redemption Rights for Public Stockholders upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.20 per public share and such amount may be increased by $0.10 per share for each three-month extension of our time to consummate our initial business combination, as described herein. The per-share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our sponsor, officers and directors will not be entitled to redemption rights with respect to any founder shares held by them or any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of our business combination.
Limitations on Redemptions
Under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, we will not redeem our public shares if such redemption would cause our Class A common stock to be considered “penny stock” as such term is defined in Rule 3a51-1 of the Exchange Act. This may require us to not redeem the public shares, or not close the initial business combination, if it would result in us having less than $5,000,001 in net tangible assets unless another exemption from the definition of “penny stock” is available. Additionally, we may be subject to a minimum cash requirement or a maximum redemption requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination. For example, the proposed business combination may require (i) cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners, (ii) cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or (iii) the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination. In the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of Class A common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us, we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares, and all shares of Class A common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof.
Manner of Conducting Redemptions
We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either (i) in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or (ii) by means of a tender offer. The decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us, solely in our discretion, and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under applicable law or stock exchange listing requirement. Asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than 20% of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval. If we structure a business combination transaction with a target business in a manner that requires stockholder approval, we will not have discretion as to whether to seek a stockholder vote to approve the proposed business combination. We currently intend to conduct redemptions in connection with a stockholder vote unless stockholder approval is not required by applicable law 

21




or stock exchange listing requirement and we choose to conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC for business or other legal reasons.
If we hold a stockholder vote to approve our initial business combination, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:

• | conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies, and not pursuant to the tender offer rules, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file proxy materials with the SEC.
--+-----------------------------------

In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination. A quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting. Our initial stockholders will count toward this quorum and have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after the Initial Public Offering in favor of our initial business combination. For purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock voted, abstentions and non-votes will have no effect on the approval of our initial business combination once a quorum is obtained. As a result, in addition to our initial stockholders’ founder shares, we would need 10,350,001, or 37.5% (assuming all outstanding shares are voted) or 1,725,001, or 6.25% (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted) of the 27,600,000 public shares sold in the Initial Public Offering to be voted in favor of an initial business combination in order to have our initial business combination approved (assuming only the minimum number of shares representing a quorum are voted). We intend to give approximately 30 days (but not less than 10 days nor more than 60 days) prior written notice of any such meeting, if required, at which a vote shall be taken to approve our initial business combination. These quorum and voting thresholds, and the voting agreements of our initial stockholders, may make it more likely that we will consummate our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether it votes for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our sponsor, officers and directors will not be entitled to redemption rights with respect to any founder shares or any public shares held by them in connection with the completion of a business combination.
If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation:

• | conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers, and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. Although we are not required to do so, we currently intend to comply with the substantive and procedural requirements of Regulation 14A in connection with any stockholder vote even if we are not able to maintain our NYSE listing or Exchange Act registration.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Upon the public announcement of our business combination, we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with Rule 10b5-1 to purchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer, to comply with Rule 14e-5 under the Exchange Act.
In the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules, our offer to redeem will remain open for at least 20 business days, in accordance with Rule 14e-1(a) under the Exchange Act, and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period. In addition, the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than the number of public shares we are permitted to redeem. If public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase, we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination.

22




Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval
If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to the Excess Shares. We believe this restriction will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Initial Public Offering without our prior consent, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including Excess Shares) for or against our business combination.
Tendering Stock Certificates in Connection with a Tender Offer or Redemption Rights
Public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights, whether they are record holders or hold their shares in “street name,” will be required to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent prior to the date set forth in the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials (as applicable) mailed to such holders, or up to two business days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials, or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using the Depository Trust Company’s DWAC (Deposit/Withdrawal At Custodian) System, at the holder’s option. The proxy solicitation or tender offer materials (as applicable) that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate the applicable delivery requirements. Accordingly, a public stockholder would have from the time we send out our tender offer materials until the close of the tender offer period, or up to two days prior to the initially scheduled vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials, as applicable, to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights. Given the relatively short period in which to exercise redemption rights, it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares.
There is a nominal cost associated with the above-referenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the DWAC System. The transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker a fee of approximately $80.00 and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder. However, this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares. The need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated.
The foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies. In order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations, many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders’ vote on an initial business combination, and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights. After the business combination was approved, the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership. As a result, the stockholder then had an “option window” after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the company’s stock in the market. If the price rose above the redemption price, he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation. As a result, the redemption rights, to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting, would become “option” rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate. The requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holder’s election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved.

23




Any request to redeem such shares, once made, may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials, as applicable. Furthermore, if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights, such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate (physically or electronically). It is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination.
If our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason, then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account. In such case, we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares.
If our initial proposed business combination is not completed, we may continue to try to complete a business combination until 18 months (or up to 21 months if further we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination
Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that we will have only 15 months from the closing of the Initial Public Offering to complete our initial business combination. However, if we anticipate that we may not be able to consummate our initial business combination within 15 months, we may, but are not obligated to, extend the period of time to consummate a business combination by an additional three months, up to two times (for a total of up to 21 months to complete a business combination); provided that our sponsor (or its affiliates or designees) must deposit into the trust account additional funds of $2,760,000 ($0.10 per unit), for each of the available three-month extensions, for a total payment of up to $5,520,000 ($0.20 per unit), in exchange for a non-interest bearing, unsecured promissory note. Our public stockholders will not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our extension of time to consummate an initial business combination from 15 months to up to 21 months described above or redeem their shares in connection with such extension. If we are unable to complete our business combination within such 15-month (or up to 21-month if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination) period, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per- share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (net of any taxes payable by us and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire without value to the holder if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the 15-month (or up to 21-month if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination) time period. As described above, we utilized our first extension to extend our initial 15-month period to consummate our initial business combination by 3 months.
Our sponsor, officers and directors will not be entitled to rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 21 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering. However, public shares acquired by our sponsor, officers or directors in or after the Initial Public Offering are entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted 15-month (or up to 21-month if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination) time period.
Our sponsor, officers, directors and director nominees have agreed, pursuant to a written agreement with us, that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) in a manner that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 21 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other material provision relating to the right of holders of our Class A common stock or pre-initial business combination activity, unless we provide 

24




our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares. However, we may be required to not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our Class A common stock to be considered “penny stock” under the SEC’s rules. If this optional redemption right is exercised with respect to an excessive number of public shares such that we cannot satisfy this requirement, we would not proceed with the amendment or the related redemption of our public shares at such time. Pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, such an amendment would need to be approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 65% of all then outstanding shares of our common stock.
We expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, as well as payments to any creditors, will be funded from amounts remaining out of the proceeds held outside the trust account, although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose. However, if those funds are not sufficient to cover the costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution, to the extent that there is any interest accrued in the trust account not required to pay our taxes on interest income earned on the trust account balance, we may request the trustee to release to us an additional amount of up to $100,000 of such accrued interest to pay those costs and expenses.
If we were to expend all of the net proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account, and without taking into account interest, if any, earned on the trust account, the per-share redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately $10.20. The proceeds deposited in the trust account could, however, become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders. We cannot assure you that the actual per-share redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than $10.20. Under Section 281(b) of the DGCL, our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full, as applicable, if there are sufficient assets. These claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders. While we intend to pay such amounts, if any, we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors’ claims.
Although we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses and other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders, there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement, breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims, as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver, in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets, including the funds held in the trust account. If any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account, our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third party’s engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative. Examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver. In addition, there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of, or arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason. Our sponsor has agreed that it will be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a third party (other than our independent public accountants) for services rendered or products sold to us, or a prospective target business with which we have entered into a written letter of intent, confidentiality or other similar agreement or business combination agreement, reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below (i) $10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case, net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, except as to any claims by a third party or prospective target business who executed a waiver of any and all rights to the monies held in the trust account (whether or not such waiver is enforceable) and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. However, we have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations, nor have we independently verified whether our sponsor has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations, and we believe that our sponsor’s only assets are securities of our company. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. As a result, if any such claims were successfully made against the trust account, the funds available for our initial business combination and redemptions could 

25




be reduced to less than $10.20 per public share. In such event, we may not be able to complete our initial business combination, and you would receive such lesser amount per share in connection with any redemption of your public shares. None of our officers or directors will indemnify us for claims by third parties including, without limitation, claims by vendors and prospective target businesses.
In the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below (i) $10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case, net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay our taxes, and our sponsor asserts that it is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that it has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim, our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations. While we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against our sponsor to enforce its indemnification obligations to us, it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so if, for example, the cost of such legal action is deemed by the independent directors to be too high relative to the amount recoverable or if the independent directors determine that a favorable outcome is not likely. We have not asked our sponsor to reserve for such indemnification obligations and we cannot assure you that our sponsor would be able to satisfy those obligations. Accordingly, we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the per-share redemption price will not be less than $10.20 per public share.
We will seek to reduce the possibility that our sponsor will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account. Our sponsor will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. We will have access to proceeds of the Initial Public Offering held outside the trust account with which to pay any such potential claims (including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation, currently estimated to be no more than approximately $100,000). In the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient, stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors. 
Under the DGCL, stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution. The pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 21 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering may be considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law. If the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it, including a 60-day notice period during which any third-party claims can be brought against the corporation, a 90-day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought, and an additional 150-day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders, any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholder’s pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder, and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution.
Furthermore, if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 21 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering is not considered a liquidating distribution under Delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful, then pursuant to Section 174 of the DGCL, the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution, instead of three years, as in the case of a liquidating distribution. If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 21 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes (net of any taxes payable by us and less up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), subject to applicable law, and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our 

26




remaining stockholders and our board of directors, dissolve and liquidate, subject in each case to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. Accordingly, it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our 15th month, (or 21st month, as applicable) and, therefore, we do not intend to comply with the procedures set forth in Section 280 of the DGCL. As such, our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them (but no more) and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date.
Because we will not be complying with Section 280, Section 281(b) of the DGCL requires us to adopt a plan, based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent 10 years. However, because we are a blank check company, rather than an operating company, and our operations are limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire, the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors (such as lawyers, investment bankers, etc.) or prospective target businesses. As described above, pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement, we will seek to have all vendors, service providers (other than our independent registered public accounting firm), prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account. As a result of this obligation, the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote. Further, our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below (i) $10.20 per public share or (ii) such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account, due to reductions in value of the trust assets, in each case, net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay our taxes and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of the Initial Public Offering against certain liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act. In the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party, our sponsor will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third-party claims.
If we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders. To the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account, we cannot assure you we will be able to return $10.20 per share to our public stockholders. Additionally, if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed, any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtor/creditor and/or bankruptcy laws as either a “preferential transfer” or a “fraudulent conveyance.” As a result, a bankruptcy court could seek to recover some or all amounts received by our stockholders. Furthermore, our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors and/or may have acted in bad faith, and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages, by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors. We cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons.
Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only (i) in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 21 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering subject to applicable law, (ii) in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (A) in a manner that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business combination within 15 months (or up to 21 months if we extend the period of time to consummate our initial business combination) from the closing of the Initial Public Offering or (B) with respect to any other material provision relating to the rights of holders of our Class A common stock or pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. In the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination, a stockholder’s voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholder’s redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account. Such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, like all provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, may be amended with a stockholder vote.
Limited payments to insiders
There will be no finder’s fees, reimbursements or cash payments made by the company to our sponsor, officers or directors, or our or their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the completion of our initial 

27




business combination, other than the following payments, none of which will be made from the proceeds of the Initial Public Offering and the sale of the private placement warrants held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial business combination:

• | repayment of up to an aggregate of $300,000 in loans made to us by an affiliate of our sponsor to cover offering-related and organizational expenses;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reimbursement for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative support made available to us by our sponsor or an affiliate thereof, in an amount equal to $15,000 per month;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses related to identifying, investigating, negotiating and completing an initial business combination; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | repayment of loans which may be made by our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and directors to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. Except for the foregoing, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.

Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, a number of these competitors may possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than we do. In addition, our high vote capital structure differs from the typical capital structure of many other special purpose acquisition company competitors and may make us less attractive to an acquisition target or may make an acquisition more costly to complete. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Employees
We currently have four officers. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time that they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in.
Periodic Reporting and Financial Information
We have registered our units, Class A common stock and warrants under the Exchange Act and have reporting obligations, including the requirement that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with the SEC. In accordance with the requirements of the Exchange Act, our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public accountants.
We will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the proxy solicitation or tender offer materials (as applicable) sent to stockholders. These financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with GAAP, or reconciled to, GAAP, or IFRS, depending on the circumstances, and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. These financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame. We cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with the requirements outlined above, or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in 

28




accordance with the requirements outlined above. To the extent that any applicable requirements cannot be met, we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business. While this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates, we do not believe that this limitation will be material.
We were required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022 as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited. A target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act regarding adequacy of their internal controls. The development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition.
We filed a Registration Statement on Form 8-A with the SEC to voluntarily register our securities under Section 12 of the Exchange Act. As a result, we are subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act. We have no current intention of filing a Form 15 to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the Exchange Act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our initial business combination.
We are an “emerging growth company,” as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not “emerging growth companies” including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile.
In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act also provides that an “emerging growth company” can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an “emerging growth company” can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period.
We will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of (i) the last day of the fiscal year (a) following the fifth anniversary of the completion of the Initial Public Offering, (b) in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least $1.07 billion (as adjusted for inflation pursuant to SEC rules from time to time) or (c) in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer, which means the market value of our Class A common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the end of that year’s second fiscal quarter, and (ii) the date on which we have issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt during the prior three-year period.
