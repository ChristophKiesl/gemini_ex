ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview
As a leading synthetic biotechnology company active in the Clean Health and Beauty markets through our consumer brands and a top supplier of sustainable and natural ingredients, we apply our proprietary Lab-to-Market biotechnology platform to engineer, manufacture and market high performance, natural and sustainably sourced products. We do so with the use of computational tools, strain construction tools, screening and analytics tools, and advanced lab automation and data integration. Our biotechnology platform enables us to rapidly engineer microbes and use them as catalysts to metabolize renewable, plant-sourced sugars into high-value ingredients that we manufacture at industrial scale. Through the combination of our biotechnology platform and our industrial fermentation process, we have successfully developed, produced and commercialized thirteen distinct molecules used in formulations by thousands of leading global brands.
We believe that synthetic biology represents a third industrial revolution, bringing together biology and engineering to generate new, more sustainable materials to meet the growing global demand for bio-based replacements of petroleum-based and traditional animal- or plant-derived ingredients. We continue to generate demand for our current portfolio of products through an extensive go-to-market network provided by our partners that are the leading companies in our target markets. Via our partnership model, our partners invest in the development of molecules to take it from the lab to commercial scale and use their extensive marketing and sales capabilities to sell our ingredients and formulations to their customers. We capture long-term revenue both through the production and sale of our molecules to our partners and through royalty revenues from our partners' product sales to their customers. We have also successfully formulated our unique, natural and sustainably-sourced ingredients into wholly-owned consumer brands, including Biossance® our clean beauty skincare brand, Pipette®, our baby and mother care brand, and PurecaneTM, our alternative sweetener brand. We are marketing our brands directly to consumers via our ecommerce platforms, in brick-and-mortar stores, and online via various retail partners.
We were founded in 2003 in the San Francisco Bay area by a group of scientists from the University of California, Berkeley. Through a grant in 2005 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we developed technology capable of creating microbial strains that produce artemisinic acid, a precursor of artemisinin, an anti-malarial drug.
 We produced a renewable farnesene brand, Biofene®, a long-chain, branched hydrocarbon molecule that we manufacture through fermentation using engineered microbes. Our farnesene derivatives are sold in hundreds of products as nutraceuticals, skincare products, fragrances, solvents, polymers, and lubricant ingredients. In 2014, we began manufacturing additional molecules for the Flavor & Fragrance industry; in 2015, we began investing to expand our capabilities to other small molecule chemical classes via our collaboration with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA); and in 2016, we expanded into proteins. We then made the strategic decision to transition our business model from low margin commodity markets to higher margin specialty ingredients markets. We began the transition by first commercializing and supplying farnesene-derived squalane as a cosmetic ingredient to formulators and distributors. We also entered into collaboration and supply agreements for the development and commercialization of molecules within the Flavor & Fragrance and Clean Beauty markets. We partner with our customers to create sustainable, high performing, low-cost molecules that replace an ingredient in their supply chains. We commercially scale and manufacture those molecules. Our revenue is generated from research and development collaboration programs, grants, renewable product sales, and license and royalty revenues from our renewable product portfolios.
All of our non-government partnerships include commercial terms for the supply of molecules we produce at commercial scale. The first molecule to generate revenue for us outside of farnesene was a fragrance molecule launched in 2015. Since the launch, this and additional fragrance molecules have continued to generate sales year over year. Our partners for these molecules are indicating continued strong growth due to their cost advantaged position, high purity of our molecules and our sustainable production method. In 2019, we commercially produced and shipped our Reb M product that is an alternative sweetener and sugar replacement for food and beverages. In 2020, we added a total of six new ingredients to our portfolio. We have a pipeline that can deliver an estimated two to three new molecules each year over the coming years.
Our time to market for molecules has decreased from seven years to less than a year for our most recent molecule, mainly due to our ability to leverage our biotechnology platform with proprietary computational tools, strain construction tools, screening and analytics tools, and advanced lab automation and data integration. Our state-of-the-art infrastructure includes industry-leading strain engineering and lab automation located in Emeryville, California, pilot-scale production facilities in Emeryville, California and Campinas, Brazil, a demonstration-scale facility in Campinas, Brazil and a commercial scale production facility in Leland, North Carolina (owned and operated by our Aprinnova joint venture). We are able to use a wide 
variety of feedstocks for production but have focused on sourcing Brazilian sugarcane for our large-scale production because of its renewability, low cost and relative price stability. We are constructing a new purpose-built, large-scale specialty ingredients facility in Brazil, which we anticipate will allow for the manufacture of up to five products concurrently, including both our specialty ingredients portfolio and our alternative sweetener product. In September 2019, we obtained the necessary permits and broke ground for this facility, and we expect construction to be completed by the end of 2021. During construction, we continue to manufacture our products at manufacturing sites in Brazil, the U.S. and Europe.
In 2017, we decided to monetize the use of one of our lower margin molecules, farnesene, in certain fields of use while retaining any associated royalties. We began discussions with our partners and ultimately made the decision to license farnesene to Koninklijke DSM N.V. (DSM) for use in these fields. We also sold to DSM our subsidiary Amyris Brasil Ltda. (Amyris Brasil), which owned and operated the purpose-built, large-scale manufacturing facility in Brotas, Brazil that manufactures farnesene, a key, bio-based intermediate ingredient in certain of our products.
The Brotas facility was built to batch manufacture one commodity product at a time (originally for high-volume production of biofuels, a business we have exited), which is not suited for the high margin specialty markets in which we operate today. We are in the process of constructing a new purpose-built, large-scale production facility in Brazil (see the Manufacturing section below). As part of the December 2017 sale of the Brotas facility, we contracted with DSM for the use of the Brotas facility to manufacture products to fulfill our product supply commitments to our customers until our new production facility becomes operational. In September 2019, we obtained the necessary permits and broke ground on our new Brazil plant. We expect facility construction to be completed by the end of 2021. During construction, we continue to manufacture our products at contract manufacturing sites in Brazil, the U.S. and Europe.
In the second quarter of 2018, we successfully demonstrated our industrial process at full-scale to produce a high-purity, zero calorie sweetener derived from sugarcane, and in December 2018, we received notification from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (the FDA) that we received its "Generally Recognized As Safe" (GRAS) designation concurrence, and began producing commercial quantities of Steviol Glycoside Rebaudioside M (or Reb M) during the fourth quarter of 2018. When derived from the Stevia plant, Reb M is found in very limited quantities. The Reb M we produce from sugarcane is more sustainable and lower cost than other natural sweeteners and has a technical profile that we believe is advantaged in taste and total process economics for blends and formulations.
In the second quarter of 2018, we executed an agreement for a significant project consortium in Europe with the Universidade Católica Portuguesa (UCP) Porto Campus and AICEP Portugal Global (AICEP). UCP is a university system, including the leading biotech school in Portugal, and operates 15 research centers. AICEP is an independent public entity of the Government of Portugal, focused in encouraging foreign companies to invest in Portugal. In conjunction with this agreement, we opened a subsidiary in Porto, Portugal with the primary purpose to conduct a research and development project together with Escola Superior de Biotecnologia o Universidade Católica Portuguese. This subsidiary is the second R&D center of Amyris and responsible for certain areas of research, namely valorization of fermentation residues and wastes and the advancement of the Company's Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Informatics platform. The overall multi-year project is valued up to approximately $50 million including investment funding and incentives allotted across the parties involved. We have sole responsibility for commercialization and majority ownership of all intellectual property (IP) generated. We believe this is the largest biotechnology grant ever awarded in Portugal and one of the largest ever approved by the AICEP for commercial applications.
In the third quarter of 2018, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with a subsidiary of Yifan Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (Yifan), which is one of the leading Chinese pharmaceutical companies. Such license and collaboration agreement was expanded in November 2018 and again in December 2019.
In May 2019, we consummated a research, collaboration and license agreement (the Cannabinoid Agreement) with LAVVAN, Inc., a newly formed investment-backed company (Lavvan), for the development, manufacture and commercialization of cannabinoids. Under the agreement, the Company will perform research and development activities and Lavvan will be responsible for the commercialization of the cannabinoids developed under the agreement. The Cannabinoid Agreement funding is on a milestone basis, with the Company also entitled to receive certain supplementary research and development funding from Lavvan. The agreement provided aggregate funding of up to $300 million over the term of the Cannabinoid Agreement if all of the milestones are achieved. Additionally, the agreement provides for royalties to the Company on Lavvan's gross profit margin once products are commercialized. Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Cannabinoid Agreement included the formation of a special purpose entity to hold certain intellectual property created during the collaboration (the Cannabinoid Collaboration IP), the licensing of certain Company intellectual property to Lavvan, the licensing of the Cannabinoid Collaboration IP to the Company and Lavvan, and the granting by the Company to Lavvan of a lien on our background intellectual property being licensed to Lavvan under the Cannabinoid Agreement, which would be 
subordinated to the lien on such intellectual property under the Foris LSA debt facility; see Note 4, “Debt” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. On September 10, 2020, Lavvan filed a suit against the Company in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York alleging breach of contract, patent infringement, and trade secret misappropriation in connection with that certain Research, Collaboration and License Agreement between Lavvan and Amyris, dated March 18, 2019, as amended (Cannabinoid Agreement). Amyris filed motions to compel arbitration or to dismiss on October 2, 2020. On October 30, Lavvan filed its opposition to the motions and the Company filed its reply to such opposition on November 13, 2020. The Company believes the suit lacks merit and intends to continue to defend itself vigorously. Given the early stage of these proceedings, it is not yet possible to reliably determine any potential liability that could result therefrom. See Note 9, “Commitments and Contingencies” in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information.
Going Concern
The Company has incurred operating losses since its inception and expects to continue to incur losses and negative cash flows from operations over the course of at least the next 12 months following the issuance of our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, the Company had negative working capital of $16.5 million (compared to negative working capital of $87.5 million as of December 31, 2019), and an accumulated deficit of $2.1 billion.
As of December 31, 2020, the Company's outstanding debt principal (including related party debt) totaled $170.5 million, of which $56.5 million is classified as current. The Company's debt agreements contain various covenants, including certain restrictions on the Company's business that could cause the Company to be at risk of defaults, such as restrictions on additional indebtedness, material adverse effect and cross default provisions. A failure to comply with the covenants and other provisions of the Company’s debt instruments, including any failure to make a payment when required, would generally result in events of default under such instruments, which could permit acceleration of a substantial portion of such indebtedness. If such indebtedness is accelerated, it would generally also constitute an event of default under the Company’s other outstanding indebtedness, permitting acceleration of a substantial portion of such other outstanding indebtedness. Throughout the first half of 2020, the Company failed to meet certain covenants under several credit arrangements, including those associated with cross-default provisions, minimum liquidity and minimum asset coverage requirements and certain scheduled payments. Most of these lenders provided waivers to the Company for breaches of all past covenant violations and cross-default payment failures, under the respective credit agreements or extended payment deadlines through May 31, 2020. 
Beginning in May 2020 and continuing through June 2020, the Company executed a series of financial transactions for general corporate purposes, including debt servicing payments. On May 1, 2020, the Company amended the Senior Convertible Notes to eliminate the monthly amortization payments and change the interest payment frequency from monthly to quarterly. On June 1, 2020, the Company amended the Foris LSA to eliminate the quarterly principal payments and defer all interest payments until maturity on July 1, 2022, and to provide for the conversion of all outstanding indebtedness under the LSA at a $3.00 per share conversion price, which conversion was approved by the Company’s stockholders on August 14, 2020. Further, on June 1, 2020 and June 4, 2020, the Company entered into securities purchase agreements with investors for the private placement of an aggregate of $200 million of common and preferred stock, resulting in the Company receiving approximately $190 million of net proceeds. A portion of the proceeds from the offering was used to pay down approximately $37.1 million of debt principal and $6.1 million of accrued interest. Also, on June 2, 2020, Total Raffinage Chimie (Total) converted approximately $9.3 million of debt principal and accrued interest into common stock under the terms of the 2014 Rule 144A Convertible Note, further reducing the Company’s outstanding indebtedness. On August 10, 2020, the Company and Ginkgo Bioworks, Inc. (Ginkgo) entered into a Second Amendment to Promissory Note and Partnership Agreement to reduce the frequency of partnership payments from monthly to quarterly, in an aggregate amount of $2.1 million, and to defer an aggregate of $9.8 million in partnership payments to the end of the agreement in October 2022. See Note 4, “Debt” for more information. As a result of closing the equity offering, making past due payments, converting the $9.1 million 2014 Rule 144A Convertible Note principal into equity, and executing amendments to the Foris LSA, the Senior Convertible Notes, and the Ginkgo Note, the Company cured all payment defaults and other events of default, including cross-defaults under the Company’s various debt instruments as of December 31, 2020.
Further, the Company's cash and cash equivalents of $30.2 million as of December 31, 2020 is not expected to be sufficient to fund expected cash flow requirements from operations and cash debt service obligations through March 2022. The Company has previously announced strategic transactions which are expected to generate substantial cash during 2021 and beyond. Solely based on cash from operations, there is doubt about the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date our consolidated financial statements are issued. The consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. The Company's ability to continue as a going concern will depend, in large part, on its ability to eliminate or minimize the anticipated negative cash flows from operations during the 12 months from the date of this filing and to either raise additional cash proceeds through strategic transactions, financings or 
refinance the debt maturities occurring in June 2021 ($10 million as of the date of this filing), all of which are uncertain and outside the control of the Company. Further, the Company's operating plan for the next 12 months contemplates (i) revenue growth from sales of existing and new products with positive gross margins, (ii) reduced production costs as a result of manufacturing and technical developments, (iii) the monetization of certain assets, (iv) continued cash inflows from collaboration and grants and licenses and royalties and (v) lower debt servicing expense. If the Company is unable to complete these actions, it may be unable to meet its operating cash flow needs and its obligations under its existing debt facilities over the next 12 months. This could result in an acceleration of its obligation to repay all amounts outstanding under those facilities, and the Company may be forced to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not occur timely or on reasonable terms, if at all, and/or liquidate its assets.
Technology
We have developed innovative microbial engineering and screening technologies that allow us to transform the way microbes metabolize sugars. Specifically, we engineer microbes, such as yeast, and use them as catalysts to convert sugar, through fermentation, into high-value molecules. In 2015, we were awarded a technology investment agreement with DARPA to expand the capabilities of our technology platform. The investment has resulted in accelerating the integration of our platform with artificial intelligence that will speed up the development and commercialization of small molecules across 15 different chemical classes. We have also developed our technology to be able to produce large molecules, such as proteins.
We devote substantial resources to our research and development efforts. We have invested more than $750 million to date in our research and development capabilities that has resulted in an almost 6x improvement in speed to market and in the scale-up of nine successful molecules. These achievements are due to the leading strain engineering and upscaling and commercialization capabilities we have developed from our investment.
Strain Engineering
Companies and researchers around the world are continuously learning how the complex biological processes in organisms work. Because there is so much that is still unknown, the best method for development of commercially viable strains is to test as many hypotheses as accurately and quickly as possible to accelerate the learning curve.
We have developed a high-throughput strain engineering system that is currently capable of producing and screening more than 600,000 yeast strain candidates per month, which enables us to achieve an approximately 90% lower cost per strain than we achieved in 2009. We generated more than 520,000 unique strains in 2020, and over 8.3 million unique strains since our inception, with each strain testing for improved production of the target molecules. In addition, through our lab-scale and pilot-plant fermentation operations, and our proprietary analytical tools, we are now able to predict, with high reliability, the performance of candidate strains at industrial scale.
Upscaling and Commercialization
The most challenging parts of commercializing biotechnology are often the scale up and manufacturing phases due to the unpredictability of biotechnology at different scales. We have built scale-up and manufacturing capabilities to our advantage by heavily investing in prediction models and analytics to quickly ascertain how a strain’s behavior at one scale will translate to another scale. We have successfully scaled-up and commercially manufactured thirteen distinct molecules used by thousands of leading global brands. Our capabilities advantage results in accelerated speed to market, lower overall development costs, and a significantly lower risk profile for any project we undertake.
A strain must be improved to increase the level of efficiency of production and tested for performance in pilot-scale facilities before it is implemented at commercial scale manufacturing facilities. Our unique infrastructure to support this scale-up process includes lab-scale fermentors (0.25 to 2 liter), operating pilot plants in our facilities in Emeryville, California, which operates a 1000-liter and multiple 300-liter fermentors, and Campinas, Brazil, which operates 300- and 2,000-liter fermentors, and five years’ experience owning and operating the 1,200,000-liter production facility in Brotas, Brazil that we sold in late 2017. Each of these stages mimic the conditions found in larger-scale fermentation so that our findings may translate predictably from lab-scale to pilot and ultimately to commercial scale.
We have developed a world-class manufacturing team which has successfully brought online a production facility and scaled up and manufactured molecules at commercial scale that are currently used in thousands of consumer goods products around the world. Our effort also expands into continued strain and process improvements to ensure our manufacturing is robust and cost advantaged.
Product Markets and Partnerships
There are three market areas that are our primary focus and key to our growth: Health & Wellness, Clean Beauty and Flavor & Fragrance. Each of these markets embodies our core competencies of sustainably providing clean ingredients in markets where we can be the most impactful, not just from a growth and revenue standpoint, but also for healthier living.
We believe that our leadership in biotechnology is demonstrated by collaboration partners, who come to us to access our platform and industrial fermentation expertise. Together we seek to reduce environmental impact, enhance performance, reduce supply and price volatility, and improve product cost. Our partners include Flavor & Fragrance companies such as Firmenich S.A. (Firmenich) and Givaudan International, SA (Givaudan), and nutrition companies such as DSM and Yifan. A portion of our work has also been funded by the U.S. government, including the Department of Energy (DOE) and DARPA, to develop technologies and processes capable of improving the ability to utilize biotechnology for the production of a broader range of molecules.
Health & Wellness
Our Health & Wellness focus includes alternative sweeteners, nutraceuticals, such as vitamins, and food ingredients. As consumers continue to demand higher nutritional performance, healthier ingredients and convenience from their food, the demand will continue to grow for specific ingredients that are often difficult and expensive to procure. Animal farming is also being impacted by the growing demand for protein and the need to change farming practices, such as reducing antibiotic use. Our technology can be employed to provide affordable access to these desired ingredients for both human and animal health. To date, product revenue in this area has been from a derivative made from our Biofene® product by our partner. During 2015, we announced the signings of our first ingredient supply agreement and collaboration agreement for the global nutraceuticals market. Under the supply agreement, we sourced Biofene to our partner, which was then further processed into a nutraceutical product. In 2016, we made the first large-scale shipments of Biofene to our partner, who successfully produced and sold a nutraceutical product to its customers. In 2017 and 2018, we expanded our collaborations in nutraceuticals to four vitamins and a human nutrition ingredient.
In late 2018, we began to produce at commercial scale an alternative, healthier sweetener. We introduced this ingredient, our Reb M product, to the public in December 2018. In 2019, we ran two production campaigns that resulted in feedback that our Reb M product is distinguished by one of the best-tasting profiles in the industry to date. We sold out the production from our campaigns. By the end of 2019 we also introduced our direct-to-consumer sweetener brand: Purecane. We currently offer Purecane for table-top and culinary applications through our own website: www.purecane.com and on Amazon.
Flavor & Fragrance Markets
Our technology enables us to cost-effectively produce natural oils and aroma chemicals that are commonly used in the Flavor & Fragrance market. Many of the natural ingredients used in the Flavor & Fragrance market are expensive due to limited supply and the synthetic alternatives requiring complex chemical conversions. We offer Flavor & Fragrance companies a natural route to procure these high-value ingredients without sacrificing cost or quality. To date, we have successfully brought multiple Flavor & Fragrance ingredients to market with our collaboration partners. We also have several other ingredients under development.
In 2014, we completed the first production campaign for our first Flavor & Fragrance ingredient for a range of applications, from perfumes to laundry detergent, which is marketed by a collaboration partner and global Flavor & Fragrance leader. In late 2015, we commenced production of our second Flavor & Fragrance ingredient to the same collaboration partner. During 2019, we added two new Flavor & Fragrance molecules to our list of successfully scaled products, and we shipped seven compounds destined for the Flavor & Fragrance market (including compounds converted by our partners to Flavor & Fragrance ingredients) to our partners. Finally, in 2020 we introduced our tenth ingredient, a leading natural flavor, and completed successful production campaigns in the third quarter.
We continue to work to develop and commercialize a variety of Flavor & Fragrance ingredients that are either direct fermentation products or derivatives of fermentation products.
Clean Beauty
Our Clean Beauty focus includes clean skincare and cosmetic ingredients we develop and commercialize with our partners and our branded Biossance skincare and Pipette baby and mother care product lines. We have several cosmetic ingredients currently under development and plan to launch four additional brands in 2021. Our Biossance and Pipette products are discussed further in the Amyris-branded Product Markets section below.
Amyris-branded Product Markets
Through basic chemical finishing steps, we are able to convert our farnesene into squalane, which is used today as a premium emollient in clean skincare products. We believe that our squalane offers performance attributes equal or superior to those of squalane derived from conventional sources. The ingredient traditionally has been manufactured from olive oil or extracted from deep-sea shark liver oil, which requires that the shark be killed in order to harvest its liver oil. The relatively high price and unstable supply of squalane in the past meant that its use was generally limited to luxury products or small quantities in mass-market product formulations. With our ability to produce a reliable supply of low-cost squalane that eliminates the need to harvest shark liver oil, we offer this ingredient at a price that we believe will drive adoption by formulators. In addition to squalane, we offer a second, lower-cost cosmetic ingredient, hemisqualane, for the cosmetics market. Our joint venture with Nikko Chemicals Co., Ltd. (Nikko) currently has supply agreements with several regional distributors, including those with locations in Japan, South Korea, Europe, Brazil and North America, and, in some cases, directly with cosmetics formulators, which we transferred to the joint venture during the formation process. See below under “Joint Venture” for more information regarding our Aprinnova joint venture.
Our consumer clean skincare products, sold under our Biossance brand, feature our Biofene-derived squalane. Under our Biossance brand, we market and sell our products directly to retailers and consumers. Biossance was initially sold solely through our ecommerce branded website. In February 2017, we launched a full squalane-based consumer cosmetic line at participating Sephora stores and Sephora online. All of the products are based on our commitment to No Compromise®. Since the launch of Biossance, sales have grown, and with Sephora’s partnership, we continued to expand to more stores through 2020.
We launched a clean beauty brand, Pipette, in September 2019 with an initial offering of seven products developed for babies and moms to support and nurture the skin. Currently, the brand offers nine unique products.
Pipette is available for purchase at Pipettebaby.com, buybuyBABY.com, Amazon.com, Target.com, Walmart.com, and Dermstore.com, in-store exclusively at buybuy BABY® stores nationwide, and at our own direct website. The brand is seeking further expansion through online and brick-and-mortar retailers.
Manufacturing
Until December 2017, we owned and operated a purpose-built, large-scale production facility located in Brotas, Brazil. In December 2017, we sold the facility to a unit of DSM and entered into a supply agreement with DSM for us to purchase output from the facility.
In September 2019, we obtained the necessary permits and broke ground on a new Brazil plant. We expect facility construction to be completed by the end of 2021 with production commencing during the first quarter of 2022. This facility will allow us to manufacture up to five products concurrently, including both our specialty ingredients portfolio and our alternative sweetener product. During construction, we are manufacturing our products at contract manufacturing sites in Brazil, the U.S. and Europe.
For many of our products, we perform additional distillation or chemical finishing steps to convert initial target molecules into other finished products, such as renewable squalane. We have agreements with several facilities in the U.S. and Brazil to perform these downstream steps for such products. We also have a manufacturing facility in Leland, North Carolina through Aprinnova, our joint venture with Nikko, to convert our Biofene into squalane and other final products. See below under "Joint Venture" for more information regarding our Aprinnova joint venture.
Joint Venture
Aprinnova, LLC
In December 2016, Amyris, Nikko Chemicals Co., Ltd., an existing commercial partner of the Company, and Nippon Surfactant Industries Co., Ltd., an affiliate of Nikko (collectively, Nikko) entered into a joint venture agreement to focus on the worldwide commercialization of the Neossance cosmetic ingredients business. Amyris formed the joint venture under the name Neossance, LLC, and later changed the name to Aprinnova, LLC (the “Aprinnova JV”), which is jointly owned by Amyris and Nikko. Pursuant to the joint venture agreement, Amyris contributed certain assets to the Aprinnova JV, including certain intellectual property and other commercial assets relating to the Neossance cosmetic ingredients business, as well as the production facility in Leland, North Carolina and related assets purchased by Amyris from Glycotech in December 2016. Amyris also agreed to provide the Aprinnova JV with licenses to certain intellectual property necessary to make and sell products associated with the Neossance business. At the closing of the formation of the joint venture, Nikko purchased a 50% interest in the Aprinnova JV in exchange for an initial payment to Amyris of $10.0 million and payment to Amyris of any profits distributed in cash to Nikko from the Aprinnova JV for the three year period beginning January 1, 2017, up to a maximum of $10.0 million. In addition, as part of the formation of the Aprinnova JV, Amyris and Nikko agreed to make certain working capital loans to the Aprinnova JV and executed a supply agreement to supply farnesene to the Aprinnova JV. Amyris also agreed to purchase product from the Aprinnova JV, to transfer all of Amyris customers buying the Aprinnova JV products to the Aprinnova JV, to guarantee a maximum production cost for certain Aprinnova JV products and take on the cost of production above certain guaranteed costs.
Product Distribution and Sales
We distribute and sell our ingredients products directly to distributors, formulators, collaboration partners, or through joint ventures, depending on the end-market. We also distribute and sell our Amyris-branded consumer products directly to retailers and consumers through on-line ecommerce web-sites. Generally, our collaboration agreements include commercial terms, and sales are contingent upon achievement of technical and commercial milestones.
For the year ended December 31, 2020, revenue from key customers and from all other customers was as follows:

(In thousands) | Renewable Products | Licenses and Royalties | Grants and Collaborations | Total Revenue | % of Total Revenue
DSM (related party) | $ | 946 | | $ | 43,750 | $ | 7,018 | | $ | 51,714 | 29.9 | %
Firmenich | 9,967 | | 7,241 | | 594 | 17,802 | | 10.3 | %
All other customers | 93,425 | | — | | 10,196 | 103,621 | | 59.8 | %
Total revenue | $ | 104,338 | | $ | 50,991 | $ | 17,808 | | $ | 173,137 | 100.0 | %

Intellectual Property
Our success depends in large part upon our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for our products and technologies, and to operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of others. We seek to avoid the latter by monitoring patents and publications in our product areas and technologies to be aware of developments that may affect our business, and to the extent we identify such developments, evaluate and take appropriate courses of action. With respect to the former, our policy is to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing for patent applications on inventions that are important to the development and conduct of our business with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the USPTO), and its foreign counterparts.
As of December 31, 2020, we had 695 issued U.S. and foreign patents and 220 pending U.S. and foreign patent applications that are owned or co-owned by or licensed to us. We also use other forms of protection (such as trademark, copyright, and trade secret) to protect our intellectual property, particularly where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. We aim to take advantage of all of the intellectual property rights that are available to us and believe that this comprehensive approach provides us with a strong proprietary position.
Patents extend for varying periods according to the date of patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in various countries where patent protection is obtained. The actual protection afforded by patents, which can vary from country to country, depends on the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Our proprietary rights may not adequately protect our technologies and product candidates.”
We also protect our proprietary information by requiring our employees, consultants, contractors and other advisers to execute nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements upon commencement of their respective employment or engagement. Agreements with our employees also prevent them from bringing the proprietary rights of third parties to us. In 
addition, we also require confidentiality or material transfer agreements from third parties that receive our confidential data or materials.
Trademarks
Amyris, the Amyris logo, Biofene, Biossance, Pipette, Purecane and No Compromise are trademarks or registered trademarks of Amyris, Inc or its subsidiaries. This report also contains trademarks and trade names of other businesses that are the property of their respective holders. 
Competition
We expect that our renewable products will compete with products produced from traditional sources as well as from alternative production methods (including the intellectual property underlying such methods) that established enterprises and new companies are seeking to develop and commercialize.
Health & Wellness
Many active ingredients in the nutraceutical market are made via chemical synthesis by suppliers that have a deep chemistry know-how and production facilities, including ingredient suppliers. We may compete directly with these companies with respect to specific ingredients or attempt to provide customers with a natural alternative that is more cost effective or higher performing than those derived from chemistry. For food ingredients, we also compete with companies that produce products from plant- and animal-derived sources as well as with companies that are also developing biotechnology production solutions to produce specific molecules.
Flavor & Fragrance
The main competition in the Flavor & Fragrance and cosmetic actives markets is from products derived from plant and animal sources as well as chemical synthesis. The products derived from plant and animal sources are typically produced at a higher cost, lower purity and create a greater impact on the environment compared to our products. Products derived from chemical synthesis are often produced at a low cost but may have ramifications on sustainability and on non-natural sourcing. There are also companies that are working to develop products using similar technology to us.
Clean Beauty
We develop and sell active cosmetic ingredients and consumer products in the Clean Beauty market, creating a competitive landscape that includes ingredient suppliers as well as consumer goods companies, such as Procter & Gamble and Estee Lauder. Most skincare ingredients are derived from plant and animal sources or created using chemical synthesis. Plant- and animal-sourced ingredients are typically higher in cost, lower in purity and have a greater impact on the environment versus our products. Products derived from chemical synthesis are often produced at a low cost but have ramifications on sustainability as well as non-natural sourcing. There are also companies that are working to develop products using similar technology to us.
Competitive Factors
We believe the primary competitive factors in our target markets are:
•product performance and other measures of quality;
•product price;
•product cost;
•sustainability and social responsibility;
•dependability of naturally supplied ingredients; and
•infrastructure compatibility of products.
We believe that, for our products to succeed in the market, we must demonstrate that our products are comparable or better alternatives to existing products and to any alternative products that are being developed for the same markets based on some combination of product cost, pricing, availability, performance, and consumer preference characteristics.
Regulatory Matters
Environmental Regulations
Our development and production processes involve the use, generation, handling, storage, transportation and disposal of hazardous chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. We are subject to a variety of federal, state, local and international laws, regulations and permit requirements governing the use, generation, manufacture, transportation, storage, handling and disposal of these materials in the United States, Brazil, Europe, China and other countries where we operate or may operate or sell our products in the future. These laws, regulations and permits can require expensive fees, pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impact of our technology on the environment and violation of these laws could result in significant fines, civil sanctions, permit revocation or costs from environmental remediation. We believe we are currently in substantial compliance with applicable environmental regulations and permitting. However, future developments including the commencement of or changes in the processes relating to commercial manufacturing of one or more of our products, more stringent environmental regulation, policies and enforcement, the implementation of new laws and regulations or the discovery of unknown environmental conditions may require expenditures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. See “Risk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business - We may incur significant costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant liabilities.”
GMM Regulations
The use of genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs), such as our yeast strains, is subject to laws and regulations in many countries. In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates the commercial use of GMMs as well as potential industrial products produced from the GMMs. Various states within the United States could choose to regulate products made with GMMs as well. While the strain of genetically modified yeast that we use, S. cerevisiae, is eligible for exemption from EPA review because it is generally recognized as safe, we must satisfy certain criteria to achieve this exemption, including but not limited to, use of compliant containment structures and safety procedures. In Brazil, GMMs are regulated by the National Biosafety Technical Commission (CTNBio) under its Biosafety Law No. 11.105-2005. We have obtained commercial approvals from CTNBio to use our GMMs in a contained environment in our Brazil facilities for research and development purposes, in manufacturing and at contract manufacturing facilities in Brazil. In Europe, we are subject to similar regulations and have obtained approvals from the Ministry of Environment, Spain for production activities.
We expect to encounter GMM regulations in most if not all of the countries in which we may seek to make our products; however, the scope and nature of these regulations will likely vary from country to country. In addition, such regulations may change over time. If we cannot meet the applicable requirements in countries in which we intend to produce our products using our yeast strains, then our business will be adversely affected. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - Our use of genetically modified feedstocks and yeast strains to produce our products subjects us to risks of regulatory limitations and rejection of our products.”
Chemical Regulations
Our renewable products may be subject to government regulations in our target markets. In the United States, the EPA administers the requirements of the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), which regulates the commercial registration, distribution and use of many chemicals. Before an entity can manufacture or distribute significant volumes of a chemical, it needs to determine whether that chemical is listed in the TSCA inventory. If the substance is listed, then manufacture or distribution can commence immediately. If not, then in most cases a “Chemical Abstracts Service” number registration and pre-manufacture notice must be filed with the EPA, which has 90 days to review the filing. A similar requirement exists in Europe under the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical Substances (REACH) regulation. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our renewable products.” In 2013, the EPA registered farnesane as a new chemical substance under the TSCA, which enables us to manufacture and sell Hemisqualane™ (Farnesane) without restriction in the United States.
Other Regulations
Certain of our current or emerging products in the Health & Wellness, Clean Beauty, and Flavor & Fragrance markets, including alternative sweeteners, nutraceuticals, Flavor & Fragrance ingredients, skincare ingredients, cosmetic actives, and our proposed cannabinoid products, are subject to regulation by either the FDA or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) or both, as well as similar agencies of states and foreign jurisdictions where these products are manufactured, sold or proposed to be sold. Pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (the FDCA), the FDA regulates the processing, formulation, safety, manufacture, packaging, labeling and distribution of food ingredients, vitamins, and cosmetics. Generally, in order to be marketed and sold in the United States, a relevant product must be generally recognized as safe, approved and not adulterated or misbranded under the FDCA and relevant regulations issued thereunder. The FDA has broad authority to enforce the provisions 
of the FDCA applicable to food ingredients, vitamins, drugs and cosmetics, including powers to issue a public warning letter to a company, to publicize information about illegal products, to request a recall of illegal products from the market, and to request the United States Department of Justice to initiate a seizure action, an injunction action, or a criminal prosecution in the U. S. courts. Failure to obtain requisite approval from, or comply with the laws and regulations of, the FDA or similar agencies of states and applicable foreign jurisdictions could prevent us from fully commercializing certain of our products. See “Risk Factors - Risks Related to Our Business - We may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for the sale of our renewable products.” Our proposed cannabinoid products may also be subject to regulation under various federal, state and foreign-controlled substance laws and regulations. See “Risk Factors - Our cannabinoid initiative is uncertain and may not yield commercial results and is subject to significant regulatory risks.”
In addition, our end-user products such as our Biossance and Pipette brands clean skincare products will be subject to the Natural Cosmetics/Personal Care Products Safety Act, if enacted. Cosmetic products are regulated by or under the FDA’s oversight. Also, our end-user products are subject to the regulations of the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and similar agencies of states and foreign jurisdictions where these products are sold or proposed to be sold regarding the advertising of such products. In recent years, the FTC has instituted numerous enforcement actions against companies for failure to have adequate substantiation for claims made in advertising or for the use of false or misleading advertising claims. The FTC has broad authority to enforce its laws and regulations applicable to cosmetics, including the ability to institute enforcement actions which often result in consent decrees, injunctions, and the payment of civil penalties by the companies involved. Failure to comply with the laws and regulations of the FTC or similar agencies of states and applicable foreign jurisdictions could impair our ability to market our end-user products.
Human Capital
As of December 31, 2020, we had 595 full-time employees, of whom 471 were in the United States, 122 were in Brazil and 2 were in Portugal. Except for labor union representation for Brazil-based employees based on labor code requirements in Brazil, none of our employees is represented by a labor union or is covered by a collective bargaining agreement. We have never experienced any employment-related work stoppages, and we consider relations with our employees to be good. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and additional employees. The principal purposes of our equity incentive plans are to attract, retain and motivate selected employees, consultants and directors through the granting of stock-based compensation awards and cash-based performance bonus awards.
