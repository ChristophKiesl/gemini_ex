Item 1. Business
Company Overview
 
Immune Therapeutics, Inc. (the “Company”) was initially incorporated in Florida on December 2, 1993 as Resort Clubs International, Inc. (“Resort Clubs”). It was formed to manage and market golf course properties in resort markets throughout the United States. Galliano International Ltd. (“Galliano”) was incorporated in Delaware on May 27, 1998 and began trading in November 1999 through the filing of a 15C-211. On November 10, 2004, Galliano merged with Resort Clubs. Resort Clubs was the surviving corporation. On August 23, 2010, Resort Clubs changed its name to pH Environmental Inc. (“pH Environmental”).
 
On April 23, 2012, pH Environmental completed a name change to TNI BioTech, Inc., and on April 24, 2012, we executed a share exchange agreement for the acquisition of all of the outstanding shares of TNI BioTech IP, Inc. On September 4, 2014, a majority of our shareholders approved an amendment to our Amended and Restated Articles of Incorporation, as amended, to change our name to Immune Therapeutics, Inc. We filed our name change amendment with the Secretary of State of Florida on October 27, 2014 changing our name to Immune Therapeutics, Inc.
 
The Company currently operates out of Orlando, Florida. In July 2012, the Company’s focus turned to acquiring patents that would protect and advance the development of new uses of opioid-related immune- therapies, such as low dose naltrexone (“LDN”) and Methionine [Met5]-enkephalin (“MENK”). The Company’s therapies are believed to stimulate and/or regulate the immune system in such a way that they provide the potential to treat a variety of diseases. We believe our therapies may be able to correct abnormalities or deficiencies in the immune system in diseases such as HIV infection, autoimmune disease, immune disorders, or cancer; all of which can lead to disease progression and life-threatening situations when the immune system is not functioning optimally.
 
In October 2012, the Company formed TNI BioTech International, Ltd., a BVI company in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, which was set up to allow the Company to market and sell LDN in those countries outside the U.S. in which we have been able to obtain approval to sell the Company’s products.
 
In August 2013, the Company formed its United Kingdom subsidiary, TNI BioTech, LTD (the “UK Subsidiary”). The UK Subsidiary received approval to be considered a micro, small or medium-sized enterprise (“SME”) with the European Medicines Agency (“EMA”) on August 21, 2013. The designation provides the UK Subsidiary with significant discounts when holding meetings or submitting filings to the EMA. On September 19, 2013, the UK Subsidiary submitted a pre-submission package to the EMA regarding Crohn’s Disease. The EMA granted the UK Subsidiary a meeting that took place on September 27, 2013. The UK Subsidiary is eligible to benefit from the provisions for administrative and financial assistance for SMEs set out in Regulation (EC) No 2049/2005. The Company will apply to obtain EMA benefits once funding becomes available.
 
In December 2013, the Company formed a new subsidiary, Cytocom Inc., to focus on conducting LDN and MENK clinical trials in the United States. In December 2014, the Company finalized the distribution of common stock of Cytocom Inc. to its shareholders. As part of the transaction, the Company retained exclusive rights to all international patents, in-country approvals, formulations, trademarks, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and distributions rights in emerging nations, including Africa, Central America, South America, Russia, India, China, Far East, and The Commonwealth of Independent States (former Soviet Union). The Company will continue to have access to existing clinical data as well as any new data generated by Cytocom Inc. during drug development. On December 8, 2014, the number of Cytocom Inc. shares of common stock that were issued to our shareholders totaled 113,242,522 shares. In connection with the transaction, Cytocom Inc. issued 140,100,000 shares of its common stock to the Company, which gave the Company a 55.3% stake in Cytocom Inc. on that date. In April 2016, the Board of Directors and a majority of shareholders of Cytocom approved a reverse stock split of Cytocom’s outstanding common stock with one new share of stock for each twenty old shares of common stock. Cytocom effectuated and finalized the reverse split in June 2016. At December 31, 2016, the Company’s equity interest had been further reduced to 13%, by subsequent issuances of Cytocom common stock to shareholders in settlement of notes payable.

In March 2014, the Company incorporated Airmed Biopharma Limited, an Irish corporation with an address in Dublin, Ireland, and Airmed Holdings Limited, an Irish company domiciled in Bermuda. The Irish companies were set up to benefit from incentives granted by the Irish government for the establishment of pharmaceutical companies (many of the world’s leading pharmaceutical companies have located in Ireland), and so that the Company could take advantage of Ireland’s status as a member of the European Union and the European Economic Area. An Irish limited liability company enjoys a low corporate income tax rate of 12.5%, one of the lowest in the world. The Irish-domiciled company hopes to qualify for tax incentives for Irish holding/headquartered companies and to benefit from the network of double tax treaties that reduce withholding taxes. TNI BioTech International, Ltd. will manage our international distribution, using product that is manufactured in Ireland and elsewhere.
 
Today, Immune Therapeutics is focused on the commercialization of affordable non-toxic immunotherapies focused on the activation and rebalancing of the body’s immune system. Stimulating the body’s immune system remains one of the most promising approaches in the treatment of Cancers, HIV, Autoimmune Diseases, inflammatory conditions and other opportunistic infections for chronic often life-threatening diseases through the mobilization of the body’s immune system in Emerging Nations using existing clinical data.
 
Cytocom Inc, is a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company focused on the development of the first affordable non-toxic immunodulator for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, immune-related disorders, and cancer and is responsible for the development of our patented therapies with the FDA and EMA.
 
As of this date, neither we nor our collaboration partners are permitted to market our drug candidates in the United States until we receive approval of a New Drug Application from the FDA. Neither we nor our collaboration partners have submitted an application for or received marketing approval for any of our drug candidates. Obtaining approval of an NDA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process.
 
Some of the Company’s more substantial risks include, but are not limited to, its lack of operating history, its high needs for capital, strict government regulation, risk of law suits from trial participants and otherwise, requirement for drug approvals which may never occur, changes in the industry, failure of the Company’s products to make it through trials, reliance on third parties to conduct trials and manufacture and distribute the Company’s drugs, and fierce competition. All of these factors and more could affect investors’ investments in the Company.
 
The Company’s technology platform is built surrounding two different immune therapies, IRT-103, low dose naltrexone herein sometimes referred to as “LDN” or “Lodonal™” or IRT-101, herein sometimes referred to as Methionine-Enkephalin or “MENK.” Both therapies have been decades in the making, over forty clinical trials run by institutions such as the Pennsylvania State University Medical School at Hershey, University of Chicago, State University of New York, and Multiple Sclerosis Center at UCSF. When the Company acquired the assets from the either the patent holder or licensee we also acquired the rights to the clinical data, orphan drug designations and IRB. The Company has completed one trial in Nigeria for Lodonal™ and has a second trial underway for cervical cancer in Malawi. The Company has also submitted briefing packaged to the FDA for a phase IIB/III trial for IRT-103 for Crohn’s Disease and is preparing a new briefing package for IRT-103 for pancreatic cancer. In addition to the work in the United States we have been completing pre-clinical and clinical work for IRT-013 with Professor Shan at the School of Immunology in China.
 
LDN
 
The Company has branded our Immediate Release Low Dose Naltrexone as IRT-103TM when working with the FDA and EMA and trademarked our product in Africa as LodonalTM. Lodonal™ with an immediate release 4.5mg formulation of Naltrexone is the brand name for our HIV treatment. LDN can be any formulation between .05 and to 10mg and may or may not be immediate release and may be an oral or liquid formulation.
 
The FDA approved naltrexone HCl in 1984 for the treatment of opioid addiction. The typical daily dosage for opioid addiction is 50mg to 100mg, and 50mg tablets are available commercial. There is no FDA-approved use for naltrexone at any lower dosage then 50mg for the treatment of any other medical conditions or treatments.

Where high dose Naltrexone at 50mg to 100mg and Slow release Naltrexone between .01mg and 10mg and Immediate Release Naltrexone between .01mg and 10mg share commonality” in categories of genes and are considered the same drug the difference in dosing and delivery method (immediate release) difference in the overall response to the immune system. There is a difference in the cell patterns of genes that are altered by the treatment of immediate release naltrexone verses high does naltrexone and slow release low naltrexone between .01mg and 10mg. The differences are important because immediate release naltrexone between .01 and 10mg acts as an immunomodulator.
 
Since immediate release naltrexone blocks the opiate receptors only for a few hours before it is naturally excreted, what results is a rebound effect; in which both the production and utilization of methionine-enkephalin or opiate growth factor are increased. Once the immediate release naltrexone has been metabolized, the elevated endorphins produced as a result of the rebound effect can now interact with the more sensitive and more-plentiful receptors and assist in regulating cell growth and immunity. There is no rebound effect with either high dose naltrexone or slow release naltrexone and it is the rebound immunomodulatory effect that effects the treatment of treating patients suffering from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS, autoimmune disease, opportunistic infections, cancer, inflammation, and neurodegenerative diseases
 
It has been demonstrated in trials that in the presence of LDN, the numbers of T-cells, both CD4+ helper T cells and CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, may increase by more than 300%.
 
The Mechanism of Action of immediate release LDN is not fully understood at this time, but based on clinical work there are three current theoretical models for how immediate release LDN works in autoimmune disease, inflammatory disease, cancer and HIV/AIDS.
 
Immediate Release LDN, which is different from either slow or extended release LDN, works by triggering a number of receptors including (1) the opioid and T Cell receptors on immune cells which activate or balance various cells of the immune system, and (2) tolling receptors to shift Th1 (pro-inflammatory) to Th2 (anti-inflammatory) which is critical when dealing with autoimmune and inflammatory disease. (1) Increases the production of cytokines specifically an endorphin referred to as Methionine-enkephaline or OGF.
 
These compounds then produce pain relief similar to opiates. The body responds to these compounds by inhibition of cell growth, promoting healing, and reducing inflammation, all in an effort to restore homeostasis. IRLDN also causes increase in OGF receptor.
 
Regulatory applications submitted, if any, to commence clinical trials and the current status of such applications.
 
Clinical trials under the INDs are anticipated to be conducted in the United States and the EU.

Immune Therapeutics, Inc. Drug Development Plan 
 
Nigeria
 
Immune Therapeutics Inc., through its wholly owned subsidiary TNI BioTech Intl., completed a 90-day bridging trial for the treatment of patients with HIV/AIDS in Nigeria. The National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) approval is based on previous clinical data and the Nigeria Bridging Trial was a single center, open labeled, randomized, bridging study. The trial consisted of a total of one hundred and fifty [150] patients of both genders between the ages of 18-60, each of whom was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

7
-


The 90-Day Bridging Trial was undertaken at the State Specialist Hospital in Asubiaro, Osogbo, Osun State, Nigeria and the primary objective of this Bridging Trial was to confirm that LodonalTM has a beneficial effect on the immune system of immune deficient patients and that it is safe. The trial separated the patients into a Control (placebo) Group and a Treatment Group (which was administered LodonalTM). The efficacy of increasing CD4 count [cell/mm3] between Day-1 and Day-90 by at least 25% was set as the criteria for demonstrating beneficial effect on the immune system. Safety was demonstrated through quality of life assessment and vitals both of which were not adversely affected. Treatment Group patients were given a daily dose of 4.5-mg/kg of Lodonal™.
 
The results yielded an average increase of 44% increase in CD4 count in the Lodonal Treatment Group compared to an 11% increase in the Control Group. Additionally, there were no reported opportunistic infections and no toxicity levels uncovered. Liver function remained normal and there was no negative impact on other systems based on blood results. No sleep disturbance or vivid dreams were present enough to justify trial discontinuation. No appreciable adverse CNS, renal, cardiac, hepatic, musculoskeletal, hematopoietic side effects were present.
 
NAFDAC has issued approval of Lodonal™as an immune system regulator in the management of HIV patients and the company is now in the process of completing the registration to import the drug into Nigeria.
 
Malawi
 
The Company, through its wholly owned subsidiary TNI BioTech International, received permission from the Pharmacy, Medicines and Poisons Board (PMPB) and The College of Medicine; University of Malawi to initiate a clinical trial for a Single Visit Approach to Cervical Cancer Prevention in the Republic of Malawi. The PMPB issued drug approval to import the drug in 2015.
 
The Malawi Clinical Trial’s primary endpoint includes Safety, Acceptability, and Feasibility of a Single Visit Approach to Cervical Cancer Prevention in patients. (Trial number: VIA-LDN-401 -0 I). The secondary objectives’ is to determine life extension; to improve the immune system of HIV and Cancer positive patients by starting treatment with LDN (“LodonalTM”) and to ensure marked improvement in Clinical benefit based upon parameters that reflect the overall well- being of the patient, including Pain control, performance status, and body weight under the supervision of Dr. Frank Taulo, Dr. Gladys Gadama, Dr. Effie Chipeta as Principal Investigators. The recruitment of study participants, testing and follow up is still on-going. The first evaluation report from the doctors involved is expected by the end of April 2017 as per the study protocol.
 
The Company intends to initiate a number of additional trials in Africa in the next 6 months, which will include trials as an adjunct to chemotherapy in Kenya and Ghana and HIV/AIDS in Malawi.
 
FDA and EMA Development Plan for Cytocom, Inc.
 
After the completion of the spin-off of our subsidiary, Cytocom, Inc., to shareholders, all work with the FDA, EMA or any of the G7 countries will be under the supervision of Cytocom Inc. However, the Company plans to submit all trials and fees on Cytocom Inc.’s behalf until such time as Cytocom, Inc. is sufficiently funded, as all funding is currently being provided through the Company. Nonetheless, the trials will be supervised by Cytocom, Inc. following submission by the Company. At this time the INDs have not been transferred to Cytocom; however they will be transferred before the trials begin. Studies and trials in countries that are not part of the G7 are being conducted directly by the Company.
 
Our lead product candidate is IRT-103 ™, a first-in-class, proprietary fixed-dose therapy entering Phase 2b clinical trials for the treatment of adult and pediatric Crohn’s disease where we have orphan drug designation. The Company acquired all of the clinical data from Dr. Jill Smith in conjunction with the acquisition of the license. The Company had no direct involvement in the trials.
 
Crohn’s disease affects over 1.6 million adults in the United States and an estimated 80,000 children. Data from the Phase 2a clinical trial indicate that Lodonal™ was generally well-tolerated therapy that can provide promise for the treatment of Crohn’s disease. The Department of Medicine at The Pennsylvania State University, (PSU) College of Medicine, GI Medicine were responsible for three of the Crohn’s trials that were part of our briefing package to the FDA.

PSU researchers have demonstrated in a mouse model of Crohn’s disease from with dextran sodium sulfate (a chemically induced colitis) that opioid receptor blockade by a low dose of naltrexone resulted in less weight loss, lower disease activity index scores and less histological evidence of inflammation when compared to controls (Matters, GL et al., 2008). Furthermore, the researchers demonstrated that tissue inflammatory cytokine mRNA was reversed to baseline levels in the colons of mice treated with naltrexone.
 
A Phase 2 trial with low-dose naltrexone was completed on patients with Crohn’s Disease and the objective of the trial was to determine the role of endogenous opioids and opioid antagonists in healing and repair of tissues. Eligible subjects with histologically and endoscopically confirmed active Crohn’s disease activity index (CDAI) score of 220–450 were enrolled in a study using 4.5 mg naltrexone per day. Infliximab was not allowed for a minimum of 8 weeks prior to study initiation. Other therapy for Crohn’s disease that was at a stable dose for 4 weeks prior to enrollment was continued at the same doses. Patients completed the inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (IBDQ) and the short-form (SF-36) quality of life surveys and CDAI scores were assessed pre-treatment, every 4 weeks while on therapy and 4 weeks after completion of the study. The drug was administered by mouth each evening for a 12-week period. Seventeen patients with a mean CDAI score of 356 °æ 27 were enrolled. CDAI scores decreased significantly (P = 0.01) with LDN, and remained lower than baseline 4 weeks after completing therapy. Eighty-nine percent of patients exhibited a response to therapy and 67% achieved a remission (P < 0.001). Improvement was recorded in both quality of life surveys with LDN compared with baseline. No laboratory abnormalities were noted. The most common side effect was sleep disturbances, occurring in seven patients. The trial concluded that LDN therapy appears effective and safe in subjects with active Crohn’s disease.
 
Another Phase 2 trial therapy was conducted, entitled, Therapy with the Opioid Antagonist Naltrexone Promotes Mucosal Healing in Active Crohn’s Disease: A Randomized Placebo-Controlled Phase 11 trial at the Department of Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, GI Medicine [Smith, JP. et al, 2011]. Aims – A randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study was designed to test the efficacy and safety of an opioid antagonist for 12 weeks in adults with active Crohn’s disease. The phase 2A trial had 3 major endpoints for the study including: 1) Clinical improvement based upon the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) Score, 2) Mucosal healing by colonoscopy, and 3) Safety. The human studies were done with FDA approval under IND 67442. Forty subjects with active Crohn’s disease were enrolled in the study. Randomized patients received daily oral administration of 4.5-mg naltrexone or placebo. Providers and patients were masked to treatment assignment. The primary outcome was the proportion of subjects in each arm with a 70-point decline in Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) score. The secondary outcome included mucosal healing based upon colonoscopy appearance and histology. Eighty-eight percent of those treated with naltrexone had at least a 70-point decline in CDAI scores compared to 40% of placebo-treated patients (p = 0.009). After 12 weeks, 78% of subjects treated with naltrexone exhibited an endoscopic response as indicated by a 5-point decline in the Crohn’s disease endoscopy index severity score (CDEIS) from baseline compared to 28% response in placebo-treated controls (p = 0.008). 33% achieved remission with a CDEIS score <6, whereas only 8% of those on placebo, showed the same change. Fatigue was the only side effect reported that was significantly greater in subjects receiving placebo. The study concluded that Naltrexone improves clinical and inflammatory activity of subjects with moderate to severe Crohn’s Disease compared to placebo-treated controls. Strategies to alter the endogenous opioid system provide promise for the treatment of Crohn’s Disease.
 
A pilot study was completed entitled Safety and Tolerability of Low-dose Naltrexone Therapy in Children With Moderate to Severe Crohn’s Disease trial at the Department of Medicine, The Pennsylvania State University, College of Medicine, GI Medicine Smith, (JP. et al, 2013). The aims of this study were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of an opioid antagonist, naltrexone, in children with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease. The pilot clinical trial was conducted in children with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease. Fourteen subjects with a mean age of 12.3 years (range, 8 to 17 y) were enrolled. Children were randomized to placebo or naltrexone (0.1 mg/kg) orally for 8 weeks followed by open-labeled treatment with 8 additional weeks of naltrexone. Safety and toxicity were monitored by physical examinations and blood chemistries. Clinical activity was assessed by the Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) and Quality of life was monitored by the Impact III survey. The results indicated that oral naltrexone was well tolerated without any serious adverse events in children with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease. PCDAI scores decreased from pre-treatment values (34.2Å 3.3) with an 8-week course of naltrexone therapy (21.7Å 3.9) (P=0.005). Twenty-five percent of those treated with naltrexone were considered in remission (score r10) and 67% had improved with mild disease activity (decrease in PCDAI score by at least 10 points) at the end of the study. Systemic and social quality of life improved with naltrexone treatment (P=0.035). The study concluded that naltrexone therapy seems safe with limited toxicity when given to children with Crohn’s disease and may reduce disease activity.

Food And Drug Administration 
 
There are three types of meetings with the FDA: Type A Meeting – is a meeting that is “immediately necessary for an otherwise stalled drug development program to proceed.” This type of meeting refers to meetings to resolve disputes, talk about clinical holds, special protocols. Type B Meetings are identified as (1) pre-IND meetings, (2) certain end of Phase I meetings, (3) end of Phase 2/pre-Phase 3 meetings and (4) pre-NDA/BLA meetings. A type C Meeting is any other kind of meeting.
 
The Company attended a Type C meeting with the FDA June 26, 2013 with the Division of Gastroenterology and Inborn Errors Products regarding the clinical and regulatory aspects of the proposed Phase IIB/III development program and future 505(b)(2) application for Low Dose Naltrexone (LDN) in the treatment of adults and pediatric patients with Crohn’s Disease. In principal the FDA agreed that a 505(b)(2) application would be an acceptable approach at FDA recommends that sponsors considering the submission of an application through the 505(b)(2) pathway consult FDA’s regulations at 21 CFR 314.54, and the draft guidance for industry Applications Covered by Section 505(b)(2) (October 1999). The Company is planning to submit a request for “breakthrough technology” designation. If this request is granted, what impact could it have on minimizing the Phase 3 study design(s) and the package needed for filing the 505(b)(2) application.
 
The Company retained the services of Cote Orphan to provide a new briefing package and work with the Division for Breakthrough Therapy Designation is granted to determine the most efficient development program for your product and proposed indication. The Company notes that a 505(b)(2) NDA will need to be submitted with all the same components that a regular NDA requires. The Company hopes to submit our briefing package to the FDA because CDAI was previously been accepted by the FDA for phase 3 trials in CD, FDA has reconsidered the use of the CDAI as a measure of clinical response to therapeutic intervention and we our new trial design endpoint will include endoscopies to show true mescal healing. The Company delayed submitting our new briefing package to the FDA as a number of changes were under consideration at the FDA in connection with 505(2)(b) pathway drug development. The Company has recently begun to make final changes to the briefing package, and expects to present its new briefing package to the FDA before the end of the third quarter 2017, with a meeting shortly thereafter.
 
Anticipated developmental timelines for Cytocom, Inc. 
 
Guidance meeting held with FDA regarding pediatric and adult studies provided feedback and based on the new submission of a briefing package we anticipate presenting final protocols for both adult and pediatric trial.

Competitive Advantage 
 
The Company believes many of the same advantages of our therapies apply to both the US market as well as the African market. LodonalTM could provide the first affordable, non-toxic approach for treatment of immune dysfunction, cancer and d chronic inflammatory state.

10
--


Some of the Competitive Advantages and Benefits of LodonalTM include the following: 
 
Lower production costs and sales price of treatments
 
Today the majority of the drugs under development are both more expensive and more toxic. We do not believe this is the right way to move forward. Biologic agents cost between $12,000 and $150,000 a year.
 
LodonalTM/ IRT-103 can be manufactured and delivered in Emerging Nations for under $.90 cents a day and we estimate a price of $3,600 dollars a year in developed country underwritten to $10 to $15 dollars per month and when not underwritten the company will provide to patients for $30 dollars a month.
 
Lodonal™ should be able to substantially reduce health care costs for a number of reasons:
 

● | IRT-103 and Lodonal™ can provides a new, non-toxic inexpensive method of medical treatment by mobilizing the natural defenses of one’s own immune system. It can be used as a stand-alone therapy or an adjunct to existing immunosuppressive therapies by reducing the toxic side effects of immunosuppressive drugs. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Patients who are taking immunosuppressant drugs should see their doctor on a regular basis to monitor the patient for unwanted side effects. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lodonal™ does not require the medical supervision of antiretroviral or immunosuppressive therapies. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Immunosuppressive drugs are very powerful and can cause such serious side effects as high blood pressure, kidney problems, malignancies and liver disorder. Immunosuppressant drugs lower a person’s resistance to infection and can make infections harder to treat. The drugs can also increase the chance of uncontrolled bleeding. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lodonal™ has no toxic side effects as it is an immunomodulator and activates and re-balances the immune system. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | HIV as a Chronic Disease: For reasons that remain to be elucidated, antiretroviral-treated HIV disease is associated with a new constellation of problems, generally referred to as “non-AIDS morbidity”, and, in the popular press, “premature aging” 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Health care systems in those regions where most people with HIV reside (e.g., sub-Saharan Africa) were designed to provide acute care only and are ill equipped to provide the chronic care, which is now required to manage HIV. 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Lodonal as an immunomodulator has a way of helping what is now referred to as “non-AIDS morbidity”, and, in the popular press, “premature aging”. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Blocks release of proinflammatory cytokines including Interleukins IL6 and IL12, TNFα, NF-ĸB (nuclear factor kappa light chain enhancer of activated B cells) 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Modulates T and B lymphocyte production and cause Shift from Th1 (pro-inflammatory) to Th2 (anti-inflammatory) 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Affects microglia – macrophages/ 1st line of immune defense in CNS; normally quiescent; 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Cell death, inflammation, infection à Activated microglia à increase in proinflammatory cytokines, excitatory amino acids, and nitric oxide 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | (NO); Increased NFkB à additional proinflammatory cytokines that act on neurons to create pain, fatigue, etc.; Naltrexone suppresses microglial activation; 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Low dose naltrexone (LDN) enhances maturation of bone marrow dendritic cells (BMDCs) 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reduces inducible nitric oxide synthase activity à decreased peroxynitrite formation à glutamate transporters inhibited 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Excitatory neurotoxicity of glutamate on neuronal cells and oligodendrocytes is prevented 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Apoptosis of oligodendrocytes reduced 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Downregulates NFk2, inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1, IL-6) 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


11
--


● | These are all immune system changes associated with aging, which potentially can be improved by Lodonal, which will improve the quality of life for HIV/AIDS patients and reduce the health care burden on the medical system. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Avoiding contact with people who have infections is also important. In addition, people who are taking or have been taking immunosuppressant drugs should not have such immunizations as smallpox vaccinations without consulting their physician. Because their resistance to infection has been lowered, people taking these drugs might get the disease that the vaccine is designed to prevent. People taking immunosuppressant drugs should avoid contact with anyone who has had a recent dose of oral polio vaccine, as there is a chance that the virus used to make the vaccine could be passed on to them.

● | Lodonal™ has been shown to reduce the number of opportunistic infections with HIV/AIDS 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Lodonal™ can improve compliance. When used correctly, antiretroviral therapy (ART) is effective. However, according to recent studies, ART regimens require 70–90% adherence in order to be effective. Sustaining adherence to ART over the long term requires accurate and consistent monitoring, and this is a particular challenge for countries in sub-Saharan Africa.
 

o | Lodonal is a simple, once-daily regimen, which can be taken with or without a food, 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Occasional non-compliance will not affect the overall success therapy. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Does not require the medical supervision of antiretroviral or immunosuppressive therapies (people will not lose time from work). 
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Compliance is further challenged by various social and clinical obstacles, where inadequate suppression of viral replication by ART are resulting due to poor adherence to therapy, low potency of the antiretroviral regimens and viral resistance to antiretroviral medications. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Estimates suggest that the average rates of non-adherence to antiretroviral therapy range from 50% to 70%. 
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Due to lack of compliance, the transmissibility of the antiretroviral resistant viruses from person to person further compounds the problem as a clinical and public health challenge. Which continues to be one of the major problems with treatment around the world.

Our lead product candidate with the FDA is IRT-103 and is posed to initiate a pivotal phase IIB/III clinical trial for moderate-to-severe adult Crohn’s disease as well for pediatric Crohn’s disease, an orphan indication. We will need to complete both a Phase 2B and Phase 3 clinical trial for both Pediatric and Adult Crohn’s Disease for IRT-103 before we can obtain final approval to market the drug in the U.S. from the FDA.
 
The Company seeks to benefit patients with chronic and often life-threatening diseases through the stimulation and/or regulation of the body’s immune system. Using our patented immunotherapy, management believes that the Company’s products, technologies and patents will harness the power of the immune system to improve the treatment of cancer, HIV/AIDS, autoimmune diseases, opportunistic infections and inflammatory disorders.
 
Recent Accomplishments
 
The Company obtained drug approval from NAFDAC (National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control) in April of 2016. In May the Company began the regulatory process with NAFDAC for marketing authorization. There were a number of steps the Company is required to complete before marketing approval will be granted despite the current approval of Lodonal™ as a treatment of immune deficiency by NAFDAC.

The Company is currently completing the regulatory process to begin marketing the drug in Nigeria. Beginning in July of 2016 NAFDAC began requiring a manufacturing site inspection before authorizing the marketing of any new products, including Lodonal™.
 
On October 3, 2016 the Company received a letter from NAFDAC requesting a site visit of our manufacturing facility as the final step in regulatory marketing approval. Upon completion of the site visit the Company expects to receive marketing approval shortly thereafter.
 
The Company has been informed that the Nigerian approval allows the company to use the approval to be “fast tracked” for approval in the Economic Community of West African States, a regional group of sixteen countries, of which Nigeria is a member. The countries include Benin, Burkina, Faso, Cote d’Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Togo. These countries play a major role in our Africa development strategy, as they are part of the “Test and Treat Program” for West and Central Africa. While the trend in international health funding for HIV/AIDS and ART (Antiretroviral Therapy) and the policies that drive the funding, has been to focus on high-burden countries and HIV ‘hotspots’ in Sub-Saharan Africa, most countries in the region classified by the UN as the West and Central Africa (WCA) region have been neglected. In the WCA region, 76% of those who need antiretroviral therapy – a total of five million people – are still awaiting treatment. The unmet needs in most of these countries are slipping further out of focus and we believe that Lodonal™ could help the people of West and Central Arica.
 
In September of 2016, the company retained the services of GLOBALMEDLINE SARL in Senegal to assist the drug registration of Lodonal™ in Senegal for HIV/AIDS and Cancer. The filing in Senegal is part of the company’s program to register Lodonal™ throughout the francophone (French-speaking) countries in Africa using our approval in Senegal to fast track the process.
 
The Company is currently in the process of filing in Kenya, Ghana, Liberia, Mali and Uganda. We will be adding additional countries in 2017.
 
In September of 2016 the Company signed a consulting agreement with the Honorable Joyce Banda as a member of the Champions for an AIDS Free Generation. His Excellency Festus Mogae, the Former President of the Republic of Botswana, first launched The Champions in 2008. The Champions program works to ensure that all children are born free from HIV in Africa and that all people have access to quality HIV prevention and treatment services.
 
The Company has been assigned three provisional patent applications: No. 62/296,759, a Method for Inducing a Sustained Immune Response; No. 62/379,272, a Method for Treating and Preventing Protozoan Infection; and No. 62/450,635, Methods and Compositions Useful for Treating Cancer Application. The Company expects to file additional patent applications in the coming months. Our intellectual property portfolio includes biotech assets acquired either through acquisition or exclusive licensing. The Company converted the provisional patent for method for inducing immune response into a US patent, and a PCT application was filed on February 17, 2017 under number PCT/IB2017/000124.
 
The Company has retained the services Coté Orphan to assist in obtaining FDA and EMEA approvals. Cote Orphan is a boutique, full-service, lab-to-market regulatory group focused on Orphan Drugs. Team Coté is led by Dr. Tim Coté, the former Director of the FDA’s Office of Orphan Products Development (OOPD). Dr. Cote is currently working with the Company to file a briefing package and final protocols for adult and pediatric Crohn’s Disease. The Company expects to finish this process by the end of the second quarter of 2017. The Company has delayed its request for a Type B meeting with the FDA on Crohn’s Disease, as the FDA is in the process of making changes in a number of areas as it applies to both 505(2)(b) pathway development and paediatric trials. The Company is preparing its final submission and expects to have the briefing package ready in the next 90 days.
 
The Company recently submitted its application for drug approval in Senegal and Kenya, and expects to have responses from the regulatory authorities by the end of the fourth quarter of 2017.
 
The Company’s Board has authorized continued discussions with a number of potential partners in Far East as well as discussion with drug development partners in both the US and EU.

MENK
 
MENK, also herein referred to as IRT-101, opiate growth factor or OGF, and Methionine-enkephalin is a synthetic peptide that activates natural killer (“NK”) cells of the immune system to seek and destroy cancer cells of the immune system to seek and destroy cancer cells. IRT-101 is a small peptide normally made by nerve cells and immune cells.
 
Further work in the laboratories of Plotnikoff, et al. has shown that daily injection of enkephalins into mice for 1 week resulted in increases in the size and weight of the thymus gland and a concomitant decrease in size and weight of the spleen. These observations led the same workers to study the antitumor action of the enkephalins. Mice carrying L 1210 tl.~mor cells were treated with methionine and leucine enkephalins, and their survival was compared to placebo treated controls.
 
The survival of the enkephalin-treated mice was longer than that of controls. Such observations in the animal model prompted these and other researchers to evaluate the immune potentiating effects of enkephalins and endorphins in humans. Plotnikoff and his group found that enkephalins and endorphins stimulated active rosettes in humans. Similar results were obtained by Gilman, et al., and Wybran, et al. This work was expanded further to study the effect of enkephalins on an immunosuppressed population of individuals. Lymphocytes from a group of lymphoma patients were treated with the enkephalins in vitro and then evaluated for rosetting with sheep red blood cells (SRBC’s.) It was found that both methionine and leucine enkephalins enhanced the ability of these cells to form T cell rosettes when compared to controls. Methionine enkephalin exhibited this immunopotentiation at a concentration as low as 10-14 mg/ml.
 
Studies have been undertaken in laboratories to investigate the effects of enkephalins on natural killer (NK) cell activity. The NK cells are a population of cells that can selectively lyse certain tumor cells in vitro without prior sensitization. This is a heterogeneous population of cells present in a variety of animals and humans. It is presently believed that these cells play a major role in protective surveillance against cancer. Anticancer potential of many of the immune activators has been measured by their ability to boost the (NK) defenses of the host. Results to date indicate enkephalins are capable of enhancing NK activity in vitro from normal volunteers and more importantly from cancer patients, some of whom have been heavily pretreated with chemotherapy.
 
Three separate groups have now reported in vivo clinical findings with the use of methionine enkephalin in patients with AIDS and symptomatic HIV infection. A Low Dose Study (10 micrograms/kg l.V.3 times/wk. for 12 weeks) Zunich and Kirkpatrick administered 10 μg/kg MEK intravenously three times weekly for up to 12 weeks to seven patients with various stages of HIV infection. This trial was conducted prior to the advent of potent antiretroviral therapy. In evaluating cellular immunity, the authors stated that MEK appears to temporarily enhance selected immune responses in patients infected with HIV. However, in this study, the results were neither clinically, nor statistically significant. There were no adverse reactions or evidence of toxicity.
 
Moderate-High Dose Studies (20, 25, 40, 50, 60, 80, and 100 micrograms/kg 1.V. 1 to 3 times/week for one to 24 months) have also been conducted. The preliminary clinical studies of MEK in symptomatic HIV infection, AIDS and cancer patients (30, 32, 45, 46, 47, 48 and 49) involved individualized treatment schedules with doses ranging up to 100 μg/kg 3x/week and durations extending beyond one year. There were no serious adverse reactions attributed to treatment for any of the patients studied. All reactions were transitory and appear to have been directly related to the infusion.
 
Eight Kaposi’s Sarcoma Patients were administered MEK (10-100 μg/kg 1-3 x week for 1-24 months). There were no serious adverse reactions attributed to treatment for any of the patients studied.
 
Symptomatic HIV Infection (Treatment one month up to 24 months, MEK administered at doses of 20-100 μg/kg 1-3x week). In a pilot study in these patients, Dr. J. Wybran in Brussels, Belgium indicated that there may be immunological improvements with MEK treatment. No adverse reactions attributable to MEK treatment were observed.

Asymptomatic HIV+ patients. Four asymptomatic HIV+ patients were treated with methionine enkephalin (60 μg/kg i.v.) once a week for 1-4 months. The monoclonal marker Leu 19 (CD56) for natural killer and killer cells was found to be increased in all four patients (18/24 discrete measures). No adverse reactions to methionine enkephalin were reported. It appears, based on the above data, that a new group of clinically useful immune modulators called enkephalins are emerging. Their in vitro magnitude of potency is at least 106 - 107 greater than that of interferon, interleukins and thymus hormones. Stimulatory effects were observed at concentrations as low as 1012- 10-14 mg/ml (33-37). Such characteristics make endogenous peptides ideal for therapeutic trials. The following additional facts are of interest in this regard: a) Methionine enkephalin stimulates humoral immunity (at low doses) and chemotaxis; b) Methionine enkephalin selectively stimulates production of cytotoxic T cells. Cytotoxic T cells (CD3, CD8) have been reported to inhibit reverse transcriptase of HIV; c) Subacute safety studies in rats and dogs at doses up to 25 mg/kg resulted in no toxicity; d) Human safety studies using doses up to 250 micrograms/kg resulted in no toxicity; e) Enkephalins may in fact be the natural mediators for the endogenous release of both interleukin 2 (32, 44), gamma interferon (32, 44) and IL-12.
 
Prior clinical studies
 
Eight (8) Phase I and four (4) Phase II clinical trials completed in cancer and HIV/AIDS between the years 1997-2015.
 
Notably promising data in HIV/AIDS and Cancer with strong efficacy signals:
 123 adults in Phase I/II trials in cancer Between the years 1997-2014
 250 adults in Phase I/II for HIV/AIDS Between the years 2000 -2014
 
Our first acquisition was the patents and intellectual property of Dr. Nicholas P. Plotnikoff and Professor Fengping Shan in 2012. While Dr. Plotnikoff was with Oral Roberts University, he was a member of the team that developed and patented the specific application of MENK as a treatment for cancer, HIV/AIDS, and infectious diseases. All of the clinical data generated by Dr. Plotnikoff has been included in our briefing package to the FDA.
 
Dr. Nicholas Plotnikoff initiated and completed Phase I and Phase II clinical studies of MENK under Investigational New Drug (“IND”) protocols filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”). In these clinical trials, MENK has been shown to reduce the symptoms of early AIDS and AIDS Related Complex (“ARC”), a condition also known as pre-AIDS which includes symptoms such as fever, diarrhea, weight loss, swollen lymph nodes and herpes. In addition to the therapeutic effects of the treatments, trial reports indicated an elevation in mood of the patients treated (Bihari, B., Plotnikoff, N., Freeman, K., Dowling, J., Duguid, C., and Altmann, E., ’‘Methionine Enkephalin in the Treatment of ARC,’’ Seventh Int. Conf. on AIDS, Florence, Italy, 1991).
 
A double-blind, randomized controlled Phase II study of 46 patients was performed with ARC (Bihari B, Plotnikoff NP. Methionine Enkephalin in the Treatment of AIDS-Related Complex. CRC Press, LLC; Cytokines: Stress and Immunity. 1999; 77-91) that was designed to measure the effect of a regular weekly dosing schedule of MENK at two different dose levels. The study involved randomized assignment to three arms: (i) patients on the first arm received weekly doses of 60µg/kg of MENK (low dose) for 12 weeks; (ii) patients on the second arm received a weekly infusion of 60µg/kg of MENK (low dose) for 2 weeks, followed by 10 weekly doses of MENK at 125µg/kg (high dose); and (iii) the patients on the third arm received a placebo intravenously for 12 weeks.

One of the most important features of OGF therapy in cancer patients with advanced metastatic disease is the marked improvement in Clinical Benefit. Clinical benefit is based upon parameters that reflect the overall well-being of the patient, including Pain control, performance status, and body weight. 53% of those receiving OGF experienced a clinical benefit compared to patients treated with standard chemotherapy.
 
The Company is planning to rely on the following available information and historical data to support the initiation of the Phase 3 study and filing of the NDA:

Exact study design will be determined by the Sponsor, and submitted to the FDA for review.
 
After completion of the Phase 2b study, the Agency would grant the Sponsor an End-of-Phase 2 meeting.
 
Hubei Qianjiang and Immune Therapeutics have a signed agreement for the development of MENK and have moved forward on that project since 2014-present.
 
PK and Toxicology Studies were delayed in 2015 because the China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA) required Chemistry, Manufacturing and Controls to be completed before starting the toxicology study. They have been started and will be completed by the end of 2017.
 
Hubei Qianjiang signed Pharmaceutical Development Agreement for Formulation Development and CTM Manufacturing of Methionine–Enkephalin for Quinjiang and Immune Therapeutics with China Peptide Company (“CPC”) in Q3 2015
 
CPC perform analytical, pre-formulation, formulation development, clinical trial manufacturing, release testing and ICH1 stability for Methione- Enkephalin
 
CPC is among only a handful of companies in the world that can claim both ISO Certification and cGMP licensing. In February 2012, CPC became the first peptide company to successfully pass US FDA inspection outside of US and Europe regions.
 
CMC and formulations are required for mass production of MENK, which is also required for pivotal trials with the FDA for this work has been ongoing since our meeting with the FDA.

In addition Hubei has completed pre-clinical studies using MENK on various cancers in the lab using mouse models and has shown to be successful in a number of cancers including colon, pancreatic and hepatic. The data will be translated and provided as part of the briefing package for both pancreatic and liver cancer.
 
The MENK treatment was generally well tolerated with no appreciable toxicity observed. The high dose of MENK increased adaptive cell immunity resulting in increased activity of the body’s immune system (e.g. increased IL-2 receptors, CD56 NK and LAK cells, CD3, CD4 and CD8 cells) and a reduction in the size of lymph nodes. One patient in the high dose group administered by rapid intravenous infusion experienced dizziness, diaphoresis, elevated blood pressure and decreased pulse rate. These signs and symptoms were responded to with supportive measures.
 
Recently, Professor Fengping Shan and Dr. Plotnikoff have published, in a number of peer-reviewed international journals, that MENK inhibited regulatory T-cells, increasing the functional activities of T cells and NK cells and, thus, is a key to improved cancer therapy. They additionally published results showing that MENK alone or in combination with Interleukin-2 (“IL -2”) or Interferon-γ (“IFN-γ”) can enhance the production of interferon- γ or IL-2 from CD4+T cells, respectively (Shan F, Yanjie Xia, Ning Wang, Jingjuan Meng, Changlong Lu, Yiming Meng, Nicolas P. Plotnikoff. Functional modulation of the pathway between dendritic cells (DCs) and CD4+T cells by the neuropeptide: Methionine enkephalin (MENK). Peptides 32. 2011; 929–937). MENK also appeared to be more potent than IL -2 or IFN-γ, alone (Hua H, Changlong Lu, Weiwei Li, Jingjuan Meng, Danan Wang, Nicolas Plotnikoff, Enhua Wang and Fengping Shan. Comparison of stimulating effect on subpopulations of lymphocytes in human peripheral blood by methionine enkephalin with IL-2 and IFN-γ. Human Vaccines & Immunotherapeutics 8:8, 2012; 1082-1089), two widely known cytokines that have been approved by the FDA for marketing.

● | In 1984 Nicholas P Plotnikoff and Gerald C miller and Joseph Wybran (etc) initiated a trial in 14 healthy volunteers and 8 cancer patients the Clinical pharmacology of methionine-enkephalin was studied in normal volunteers at doses of 1, 10, 50, 100, 150, 200, and 250 pg/kg. Immunologically, increases in total lymphocytes, B lymphocytes, active rosette-forming cells, T lymphocytes (OKTl 1), T-helper lymphocytes (OKT4), and T-suppressor lymphocytes (OKT8) were seen after infusion with methionine-enkephalin. In addition, increased mitogen-stimulated blastogenesis with PHA, Con A, and pokeweed were also seen with methionine-enkephalin treatment. No material changes were seen in EKG, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, temperature, or neurologic reflexes of normal volunteers receiving methionine enkephalin in doses of 1 to 200 pg/kg. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Our human (in vivo) studies have demonstrated that methionine-enkephalin is an activator of T-cell subsets, NK cells, and potentiator of blastogenesis in the presence of PHA, Con A, pokeweed, or Staph A. All of the clinical pharmacologic variables were normal, including EKG, heart rate, blood pressure, respiration, temperature, and neurologic reflexes, as well as urinalysis and SMAC 26. Transient side effects such as vasodilation and/or gastrointestinal cramps were seen only at high doses (100, 150, 200, and 250 pg/kg). Thus, in this study, methionine-enkephalin, a natural hormone, was administered without significant adverse effect in a dose range of 1 to 250 pg/kg (by intravenous infusion).
 

18
--


In our studies in cancer patients with Kaposi’s sarcoma (due to AIDS), melanoma, lung cancer, and hypernephroma increases in T-cell subsets were also observed. Increased levels of blastogenesis with the mitogens PHA, Con A, and pokeweed were also observed. An increased expression of interleukin-2 receptors was also observed, while Wybran reported increased blood levels of interleukin-2 in patients receiving methionine-enkephalin. In addition, Wybran et al. 28 have reported that methionine enkephalin elevates T-cell subset numbers in pre-AIDS or ARC patients. Methionine enkephalin may well be useful as an immunomodulator in the treatment of patient in the early stages of their illness and/or following surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy treatment.
 
Cancer Patients
 
Methionine-enkephalin was administrated to seven patients with lung cancer. These patients were newly diagnosed and had not yet received prior treatment such as surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or immunotherapy. Immunologic tests were performed before Methionine-enkephalin injection, and 2 hours, 24 hours, 6 days after Methionine-enkephalin perfusion. The results can be summarized as follows: in four patients active T-cells were increased in the blood; in five patients the percentage of OKTlO increased in the blood; and in seven the cells with the Leu 11 phenotype increased (to more than twice the initial value in four of these patients). More interestingly, NK activity increased in five of seven patients (by more than 100 in three of them, in whom NK activity increased from 30 to 60, 7 to 15%, and 18 to 36%).
 
Once again, the absence of subjective or objective side effects should be stressed in this single-injection study.
 
ARC Patients
 
Seven patients with AIDS-related complex received Methionine-enkephalin three times a week intravenously for a minimum of 21 days; the concentrations varied from 20 to 100 pg/kg at each injection. Some patients have already been treated for 130 days. The immunologic results can be summarized as follows after 21 days of treatment: increase in the numbers of blood OKT3 and OKT4 lymphocytes, no increase in the absolute count of lymphocytes, borderline increase in NK activity (p < 0.10), and increase in IL-2 production as well as in PHA response. The most striking result is the enhancement of the PHA response. Some patients were treated for a longer period of time and one patient has shown a remarkable immunologic and clinical course. This 32-year-old Caucasian homosexual male had a prior history of an 11-kg weight loss, night sweats, recurrent scrota infections, and lymphadenopathy for a period of 2 years. Testing of his immunologic status showed a reduced OKT4 percentage (20%) and count 336/mm3), low NK activity (22%), low ILL-2 production (0.5 units), and low PHA response (147,000 cpm). He was started on Methionine-enkephalin and followed immunologically as well as clinically. At day 130, his OKT4 percentage is 38% and the OKT4 count 730/mm3. The NK activity has increased to 43% and the IL-2 production is also normalized to 2.1 units. Finally, his PHA response has presently reached 414,000 cpm. Clinically, this patient has no more scrota1 infections, he has gained 8 kg, the night sweats have disappeared, and the lymph nodes have completely regressed within 3 months. In summary, this patient shows an almost complete immunologic nonspecific functional reconstitution, except with respect to the OKT4 subset. Clinically, he is in complete remission. All the data indicate that Methionine-enkephalin can enhance some immunologic functions in ARC patients, and preliminary data suggest some therapeutic beneficial effect in some patients. These results have to be confirmed in larger series in double-blind randomized trials.
 
AIDS Patients
 
One AIDS patient received a single injection of 20 pg/kg of Methionine-enkephalin and his PHA response increased from 4300 cpm to 14,000 cpm! Another AIDS patient with Kaposi’s Sarcoma is now receiving chronic treatment with Methionine-enkephalin. His lesions have remained stable for 4 months. More interestingly, an AIDS patient (with Hodgkin’s lymphoma, Toxoplasma cerebral abscess, atypical mycobacteria) was diagnosed as having Kaposi’s Sarcoma lesions (biopsy-proven). He was started on Methionine-enkephalin treatment 1 month after the Kaposi’s Sarcoma lesions appeared, and after 4 weeks of treatment these lesions have flattened and are in the process of disappearing (as determined by biopsy). In the case, Methionine-enkephalin administration was associated with the regression of the Kaposi’s Sarcoma.
 
Clinical Studies finished with 178 patients in Tulsa, Brussels the Belgium Medical School, New York SUNY, Denver Colorado Medical School and Chicago to increase number of cytotoxic cells CD4, CD8 and NK Cells in AIDS and Cancer patients. The studies demonstrated that Methionine-enkephalin is an effective and potent immunomodulator in HIV/AIDS patients. Methionine-enkephalin exhibited a dose response between the dose of 10, 20, 50 and 100 micrograms/kg in terms of increasing number of CD3, CD4, CD8 and NK cells in these patients (average increase of 50%). Higher doses of Methionine-enkephalin (150, 200, 250 and 300 micrograms/kg) exhibited a plateau effect. No toxicity was seen in these patients. Methionine-enkephalin increases the number of cytotoxic cells (subsets CD4, CD8 and NK) that are known to specifically destroy HIV. This “antiviral” effect was recorded by marked reduction of p24 both in vitro and in vivo.

A phase II clinical study under IND was completed. The study, was a double-blind and placebo controlled, involved randomized assignment to three arms receiving a weekly intravenous infusion of 60mpg/km (low Dose) or receiving a weekly infusion of 125 micrograms/kg and the third receiving a placebo infusion of normal saline. Twenty subjects completed 12 weeks of the trial, twenty-six patients completed 8 weeks, and 33 patients completed 4 weeks. Eligibility for this clinical study included a positive HIV serology, CD4 level between 200 and 500.
 
Substantial differences from baseline were observed (at eight weeks in patients receiving 125 micrograms/km) for the following parameters: CD4, DC8, DC35, CD38, CD56, NK, PHA, PWM and CMV. The most important findings of the study were the increase in CD4 (T helper cells) and CD56 (cytotoxic cells NK-K-LAK). There were no serious adverse reactions.
 
Phase I and Phase II studies have been conducted under the Company’s IND (previously held by Penn State University) that have demonstrated that MENK can be delivered to patients suffering from advanced pancreatic cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma (PI: Eric Kimchi, M.D. at Penn State University) and advanced head and neck cancer (PI: David Goldenberg, M.D., FACS at Penn State University). The maximum tolerated dose has been found to be 250 µg/kg using the intravenous route of administration over a 30-min infusion time in a Phase I trial in fourteen normal volunteers and eight cancer patients. This maximum tolerated dose was later confirmed in Phase I and Phase II trials in patients with advanced unresectable pancreatic cancer.
 
Patients with Kaposi’s Sarcoma (9 patients), lung cancer (12 patients), melanoma (3 patients), hypernephroma (1 patient), or pancreatic cancer (1 patient) were treated with MENK for one week to 12 months at doses of 10 µg/kg three times per week up to 80 µg/kg 3 times per week. After 1-2 weeks increases in T cell subsets (CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD2 positive cells) were observed. An increase also occurred in IL-2 receptor expression. NK cell activity was measured in 14 patients and an increased NK activity was present in 12/14 patients. No toxicity attributable to treatment with MENK was observed in any patient.
 
Two case studies have been reported in an infant and a 20-month old child who were treated with MENK. The infant was diagnosed with hepatoblastoma and was treated with one course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy at approximately one week of age. Due to complications from the chemotherapy (neutropenic fever, pneumonia and sepsis), the patient’s parents declined further chemotherapy, and the infant was treated with surgical resection and MENK/LDN. She is currently close to ten years disease–free survival. The 20-month-old child was diagnosed with hepatoblastoma. Due to existing comorbidities (including autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease and hypertension), and biopsy results that indicated the tumor might be insensitive to chemotherapy, the parents elected not to proceed with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The patient was treated with surgical resection and MENK/LDN, and is currently at more than five years disease-free survival.
 
2013- 2014 Open Label China Medical School 
 
2012-Present: We have been running trials both in-vitro and in-vino and have published on some of the work that was completed.
 
MENK, a penta-peptide is considered as being involved in the regulatory feedback loop between the immune and neuroendocrine systems, with marked modulation of various functions of human immune cells. The aim of the present work was to investigate change of lymphocyte subpopulations in peripheral blood of 50 cancer patients before and after treatment with MENK. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of peripheral blood from 50 cancer patients were isolated by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque solution and cultured with MENK. We measured proliferation of total nucleated cells, subpopulations of individual CD4+T cells, CD8+T cells, CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Treg), natural killer cells (NK) before and after treatment with 10-12M MENK in cell culture by flow cytometry (FCM).

Our results indicated that MENK showed a strong inhibiting effect on Treg cells while it stimulated marked proliferation of other lymphocyte subpopulations. All data obtained were of significance statistically. It was therefore concluded that MENK could work as a strong immune booster with great potential in restoring damaged human immune system and we could consider MENK as a drug to treat cancer patients, whose immune systems are damaged by chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Furthermore we could consider MENK as a chemotherapy additive, which would sustain immune system of cancer patients during the process of chemotherapy to get maximized efficacy with minimized side effect.
 
Methionine enkephalin (MENK) improves lymphocyte subpopulations in human peripheral blood of 50 cancer patients by inhibiting regulatory T cells (Tregs). The patients recruited for this study were all with terminal cancers with broad metastasis, underwent chemotherapy and their immune system were damaged severely. They failed to respond to any therapy available and were desperate. After they signed informed consent we began to give treatment. The concrete cases distribution was as following: Rectal cancer: 4, Colon cancer: 6, Stomach cancer: 3, Hepanocellular cancer: 2, Lung cancer: 7, Oval cancer: 3, Pancreatic cancer: 2, Breast cancer: 3, Urinary bladder cancer: 1
 
This approach helps us learn more knowledge about MENK’s action in rehabilitating human immune system and the conclusion of MENK as an immune enhancer, drawn from present study is fully supported by the data obtained. We believe that this is the first time that published data based on large samples show that MENK could stimulate proliferation of lymphocyte subpopulations by inhibiting Tregs in peripheral blood of cancer patients.
 
Research results indicate that MENK, at suitable doses, boosts the immune system through the following possible mechanisms:
 

● | increasing proliferation and functional activities of CD4+T-cells and CD8+T-cells which will play a role in anti-virus and anti-tumor activities; 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | increasing maturation of dendritic cells which will initiate and intensify T-cell responses; 
● | increasing secretion of cytokines such as IL-2, TNF, IL-12 and IFN-γ which will amplify the T-cell response and mediate interaction among immune cells, forming a modulated and balanced immunity; 
● | increasing functions of macrophages, resulting in enhanced cellular immunity through secreting a set of cytokines; and 
● | increasing activity of NK cells which have the ability to kill cancer cells and virus-infected cells. 

 
Based upon published literature, the Company believes that, in oncology in particular, MENK has two possible mechanisms of actions:
 
1. Immune stimulation and regulation effects; and
 
2. Direct anti-cancer inhibitory effects.
 
Based upon data from multiple in vivo and in vitro studies conducted by Zagon et al. over the past 15 years, the onset and/or progression of some cancers may be related to defects in MENK and/or OGFr, which would promote or exacerbate tumorigenesis. These findings show there may be an advantage in up-regulating the peptide (e.g., MENK administration) to enhance anti-cancer activity (Zagon IS, Donahue RN, McLaughlin PJ. Opioid growth factor-opioid growth factor receptor axis is a physiological determinant of cell proliferation in diverse human cancers. Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol. 2009; 297: R1154–R1161). Further exploration and clinical trials are needed to confirm MENK’s mechanism of action and its ability to stop the growth of cancerous cells in human subjects with advanced cancer; however, supportive literature around the possible mechanism of actions for MENK are provided below.
 
MENK as an immune stimulator/regulator
 
While Dr. Nicholas Plotnikoff was a faculty member at Oral Roberts University, he discovered that all three of the classical opioid receptors are expressed on most subsets of immune cells, and that either in vitro incubation with MENK or parenteral administration of and humans, especially those with immunodeficiencies associated with cancer or HIV/AIDS, MENK in vivo increased the number and functional activities of T cells, including cytotoxic CD8+ T cells, and also natural killer (NK) cells (Plotnikoff NP, Faith RE, Murgo AJ, Herberman RB, Good RA. Methionine Enkephalin: A New Cytokine – Human Studies. Clinical Immunology and Immunopathology. February 1997; 82(2): 93-101). Following those pioneering studies, several other investigators observed that administration of MENK to mice increased CD4+ and CD+ T cells, and increased various immune functions, including cytotoxic activities of both T cells and NK cells (Wybran J, Schandené L, Van Vooren JP, Vandermoten G, Latinne D, Sonnet J, De Bruyère M, Taelman H, Plotnikoff NP. Immunologic properties of methionine-enkephalin, and therapeutic implications in AIDS, ARC, and cancer. Ann N Y Acad Sci. 1987; 496:108-14). Recently, Drs. Fengping Shan and Nicholas Plotnikoff have reported that MENK treatment of mice stimulates the cytotoxic activities of T cells and NK cells and reduces levels of T regulatory cells, and augments therapeutic effects in tumor-bearing immunocompetent mice.

MENK as an inhibitor of cancer cell growth
 
MENK has been found to exert a profound inhibition on the initiation and progression of human pancreatic cancer in vitro and in vivo (Zagon IS, Smith JP, McLaughlin PJ. Opioid Growth Factor (OFG) Inhibits Human Pancreatic Cancer Transplanted into Nude Mice. Cancer Letters. 1997 Jan 30; 112(2):167-175. Zagon IS, Smith JP, Conter R, McLaughlin PJ. Identification and Characterization of Opioid Growth Factor Receptor in Human Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma. International J of Molecular Med. 2000 Jan; 5(1):77-84.). This led to the discovery that MENK interacted with a novel opioid receptor (OGFr) on human cancer cells (ovarian, SCCHN, pancreatic, colorectal and others) creating a competitive inhibition profile and subcellular location that is different from other well-known “classic” opioid receptors [mu (µ), delta (δ) and kappa (κ)]. The other “classic” opioid receptors have not been found to have any impact on cell growth; thus there is specificity in the MENK-OGFr interaction which regulates cell proliferation. In an extensive number of experiments that have been conducted on human pancreatic cancer cells in tissue culture exposed to a variety of opioid-related compounds, MENK was the only compound that inhibited cell proliferation. Based upon data from multiple in vivo and in vitro studies conducted by Zagon et al., the onset and/or progression of some cancers may be related to defects in MENK and/or OGFr, which would promote or exacerbate tumorigenesis. These findings show there may be an advantage in up-regulating the peptide (e.g., MENK administration) to enhance anti-cancer activity.
 
Therefore, as opioid receptors are not only found on cancer cells, but also on most subsets of immune cells, MENK has the ability to not only inhibit cancer cell growth, but also have a direct impact on the patient’s immune system by increasing the number and functional activities of T cells and NK cells.
 
Zagon and McLaughlin have not recorded in any of their animal studies any side effects of MENK for non-oncological indications such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE, the mouse model of multiple sclerosis) or relapse-remitting EAE (RR-EAE) with MENK being administered daily. Treatment with MENK or LDN did not exacerbate EAE and was able to halt progression of disease, reverse neurological deficits, and prevent the onset of neurological dysfunction over time (Rahn KA, McLaughlin PJ, Zagon IS. Prevention and diminished expression of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis by low dose naltrexone (LDN) or opioid growth factor (OGF) for an extended period: Therapeutic implications for multiple sclerosis).
 
Management believes clinical trials involving LDN hold great promise for the millions of people worldwide for the treatment of autoimmune diseases or disorders, central nervous system disorders or those who face cancer. Management also believes it could be the first low-cost, easy to administer therapy with minimal to no side-effects for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, autoimmune diseases and immune disorders, in particular Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and/or fibromyalgia.
 
Naltrexone is an orally effective opioid receptor antagonist, used as a treatment for opiate addiction. Naltrexone was originally synthesized in 1963 and patented in 1967. In 1984, the FDA approved naltrexone in a 50 mg dose as a treatment for heroin addiction. Naltrexone 50 mg film-coated tablets have been approved in Europe since at least 1989 for the treatment of opiate addiction and more recently alcohol dependency. At lower doses (approximately 4.5 mg/day), it has been gaining popularity as a treatment for signs and symptoms of autoimmune diseases and immune disorders, HIV/AIDS and cancer. Research studies by others have indicated that the short-term blockage of opioid receptors on circulating and tissue cells by LDN was followed by a substantial rebound in opioid receptor expression and increased levels of β-endorphin and methionine-enkephalin (Zagon IS, McLaughlin PJ. Opioid antagonist modulation of murine neuroblastoma: A profile of cell proliferation and opioid peptides and receptors. Brain Res. 1989; 480:16–28.)

Oral administration of LDN has been shown to transiently (approximately 4 hours) inhibit opioid receptors which in turn provides a remaining window of approximately 20 hours for the unregulated opioids and receptors to interact (Donahue RN, McLaughlin PJ, Zagon IS. The opioid growth factor (OGF) and low dose naltrexone (LDN) suppress human ovarian cancer progression in mice. Gynecol Oncol. 2011 Aug; 122(2):382-8).
 
LDN has been shown to increase the levels of endogenous opioid activity, thereby having the ability to play a direct role in enhancing the human body’s stress resilience, improving psychiatric problems such as autism, in addition to being able to have a direct impact on the immune system and regulation of how the immune system works when faced with disease. LDN is believed to facilitate the body’s own resources to slow down or combat cancers, autoimmune diseases and HIV/AIDS; thus reducing the overall impact and load on the body (Brown N, and Panksepp J. Low dose naltrexone for disease prevention and quality of life. Med Hypotheses. 2008 Mar: 72(3):293-6.).
 
Naltrexone was originally patented in 1967 by the specialty pharmaceutical company Endo Health Solutions Inc. At the time, it seemed unlikely that naltrexone would be developed because the experimental drug had relatively low market potential, and naltrexone’s patent protection would likely expire before the completion of clinical trials. With the assistance of DuPont, a division of Merck & Co. that acquired Endo in 1969, the US government’s National Institute on Drug Abuse (“NIDA”) advanced naltrexone through the FDA approval process, leading to approval for marketing as a treatment for heroin addiction in a 50 mg dose in 1984. Although its patent expired that same year, naltrexone gained seven additional years of marketing exclusivity for DuPont when the FDA designated it (trademarked as Trexan) an Orphan Drug. Marketing exclusivity provides a pharmaceutical company the right to sell its drug for a certain length of time free of competition from generic versions of the drug and is often granted to encourage companies to develop a use for a drug whose patent has expired or to encourage a company to develop an already approved drug for a new use. With market exclusivity, the anticipated returns on investment are higher, improving the profitability of a drug. With funding provided by the US National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (“NIAAA”) and the potential to gain three additional years of post-approval market exclusivity for naltrexone, DuPont advanced naltrexone through additional clinical trials, and gained FDA approval for a 50 mg dose (trademarked as ReVia) as a treatment for alcohol abuse in 1995. As naltrexone had already been on the market for 10 years as a treatment for heroin addiction, the FDA’s confidence in its safety resulted in approval only six months after naltrexone’s regulatory application was submitted.
 
Naltrexone has a black box warning for liver toxicity, which was included based on liver enzyme elevations reported with daily dosing at 100 mg-300 mg. These doses were evaluated in clinical trials for obesity; however, they have not been approved for this use. Our review of the literature and adverse effect reports in naltrexone clinical trials did not demonstrate a risk for liver damage with daily dosing at 50 mg. Although the black box warning does remain, the FDA has stated that naltrexone does not appear to be a hepatotoxin at the recommended doses for the currently approved indications. Recently, naltrexone at 4 mg and 8 mg, in combination with the anti-depressant drug, bupropion at 90 mg, was evaluated as an anti-obesity drug by Orexigen Therapeutics Inc. and submitted for FDA approval in 2010. Data from studies with the drug combination (trademarked Contrave) showed potential hepatotoxicity in 1.2% of subjects treated with Contrave (n = 3,239). [Note: After the FDA requested a long-term study to demonstrate the daily recommended dose of the drug combination (two tablets each with 8 mg naltrexone plus 90 mg bupropion taken twice daily) does not raise the risk of heart attacks, Orexigen initiated a Phase III trial to evaluate Contrave in a study expected to enroll more than 9,000 subjects and is anticipated to be completed in 2017.] Other than its small potential association with liver toxicity at high doses, the most common adverse effects reported with naltrexone are non-specific gastrointestinal complaints such as diarrhea and abdominal cramping.
 
Notable published clinical trial evidence indicates that LDN, particularly daily dosing at 3mg - 4.5 mg, stimulates the immune system and is effective in the treatment of some immunodeficiency diseases, such as HIV/AIDS diseases, and advanced cancer as shown in the studies referenced herein. The first clinical trial results with LDN for immune disorders, however, were published only recently in a peer-reviewed medical journal in 2007 which evaluated LDN treatment in a pilot phase II study of 17 patients with Crohn’s disease, a form of inflammatory bowel disease that most commonly affects the ileum and the beginning of the colon. Two-Thirds of patients in this study went into remission after 4.5 mg daily LDN treatment (p < 0.001), with 89% of patients overall showing some degree of response.

An open-label pilot study was conducted by Pennsylvania State University with LDN to evaluate response, safety and toxicity in adult subjects with moderate to severe, active Crohn’s disease. Patients were treated with LDN orally each evening at a dose of 4.5 mg for 3 months. A total of 17 patients were enrolled, 16 of whom completed the study. No laboratory abnormalities were noted. The most common side effect was sleep disturbances (occurred when dosing at night, at about bed-time), occurring in seven patients (41%).
 
A second clinical study was conducted by Pennsylvania State University as a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study to test the efficacy and safety of LDN for 12 weeks in adults with moderate to severe active Crohn’s disease. Forty subjects with moderate to severe active Crohn’s disease were enrolled in the study. Randomized patients received daily oral administration LDN (4.5 mg/day) or placebo. Fatigue was the only side effect reported of statistical significance, and it was greater in subjects receiving placebo.
 
A pilot Phase II clinical trial was conducted by Pennsylvania State University in children with moderate to severe active Crohn’s disease. Fourteen subjects were enrolled, 12 subjects were randomized and treated with a mean age of 12.3 years (range 8-17 years). Children were randomized to placebo or LDN (0.1 mg/kg or a maximum dose of 4.5 mg) orally for 8 weeks followed by open-label treatment for an additional 8 weeks of LDN at the same dose of 0.1 mg/kg or 4.5 mg. Oral LDN was well tolerated without any serious adverse events.
 
Fourteen (14) subjects were enrolled, 12 subjects were randomized and treated (Smith J. et al., 2007; Smith J. et al., 2011; Smith J. et al., 2013).
 
Pennsylvania State University researchers have also demonstrated in a mouse model of Crohn’s disease (chemically induced colitis with dextran sodium sulfate) that opioid receptor blockade by LDN resulted in less weight loss, lower disease activity index scores and less histological evidence of inflammation when compared to controls. Furthermore, the researchers demonstrated that tissue inflammatory cytokine mRNA was reversed to baseline levels in the colons of mice treated with LDN.
 
Management believes in LDN’s potential treatment effects for Crohn’s disease, as the treatments currently available for Crohn’s disease are expensive and carry black box warning due to the toxic side effects associated with virtually all of the currently used drugs. Management believes that LDN provides an attractive alternative. Three published clinical trials in patients with moderate to severe disease, two in adults and one in children, have shown notable disease and quality of life improvement by 12-weeks. LDN was able to reverse the inflammatory activity, promote mucosal healing, and decrease histologic inflammation when compared to placebo-treated controls (Smith J. et al, 2011; Smith J. et al, 2013). Based on these results, the Company has placed a very high priority on implementing a pivotal Phase IIB/III study. By using the 505(b)(2) pathway, confirmation of efficacy in our Phase III study is expected to result in approval by the FDA.
 
With its increasing recognition in children and adolescents, Crohn’s disease has become one of the chronic diseases that affect young people. Pediatric Crohn’s disease affects approximately 80,000 patients in the United States, and thus has led to orphan drug designation with the FDA. In addition to the common GI symptoms due to inflammation in the small and/or large intestine, children often experience growth failure, malnutrition, pubertal delay, bone demineralization, and psychological issues. Crohn’s tends to be both severe and extensive in the pediatric population with a relatively high proportion of pediatric Crohn’s patients having involvement of their small intestine, proximal to the ileum.

The 505(b)(2) Regulatory Pathway
 
Traditionally, pharmaceutical drugs had to be approved by the FDA under the standard 505(b)(1) regulatory pathway, which could take as long as 15 years. Now, drugs approved under 505(b)(2) may rely in part on data from existing reference drugs meaning they can be developed and achieve FDA approval in as little as 30 months with only a fraction of the number of required clinical trials and at a much lower cost.
 
Developing LDN using the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway decreases the amount of development time and cost in order to obtain FDA approval. As naltrexone is an FDA-approved product for alcohol or opiate dependence, prescriptions are currently being filled for naltrexone in 50 mg doses by hundreds of local pharmacies and mail-order pharmacies around the United States.
 
The FDA’s 505(b)(2) pathway for approving drugs opens the door for the Company to gain FDA approval of LDN (which is used at doses of approximately 1/10th the approved dose) for new diseases. A 505(b)(2) drug application for LDN will contain full reports of clinical investigations to support the safety and effectiveness in the new indication(s); however, at least some of the information required for approval will come from studies not conducted by or for the applicant, and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use, as many of these drugs are now off-patent. With the opportunity to use previous findings of safety, the Company intends to use the 505(b)(2) pathway to study and gain approval for LDN in other diseases, with Crohn’s disease slated as its first therapeutic indication.
 
As there is a sufficient database of information around the safety of this product, and the reference listed drug (NDA 018932 REVIA) is being used, the FDA agreed that a 505(b)(2) application would be an acceptable approach at this time.
 
The Company, through its subsidiary, will need to complete both a Phase 2B and Phase 3 clinical trial for both Pediatric and Adult Crohn’s Disease for IRT-103 before final approval to market the drug in the U.S. from the FDA. Similarly Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials will need to be completed in the U.S. for IRT-101 before we can obtain final approval to market the drug in the U.S. from the FDA. All clinical trials in the U.S. are being completed under the supervision of our subsidiary Cytocom, Inc.

Intellectual Property
 
The Company has been developing active forms of immunotherapies through the acquisition of patents, IND Applications, clinical data and all proprietary technical information, know-how, procedures, protocols, methods, prototypes, designs, data and reports which are not readily available to others through public means, and which were owned, generated or developed through experiments or testing by Dr. Plotnikoff, Professor Shan, Dr. Bernard Bihari, Dr. Ian S. Zagon, Dr. Jill Smith, Dr. Patricia J. McLaughlin and Moshe Rogosnitzky.
 
The Company has been able to acquire many of the patents and intellectual property it was seeking, and has also been able to team up with some of the leaders in the field of immunology, experts such as the late Dr. Ronald Herberman (1940-2013), Dr. Fenping Shan, Dr. Jill Smith and Dr. Terry Grossman.
 
Dr. Plotnikoff is the inventor behind a number of patents granted for cancer treatments and an adjunct to patents for autoimmune diseases including: European Patent United Kingdom, Germany, France, Ireland EP 1401471 BI Methods for inducing sustained immune response; Russian Patent Russian Federation patent number 2313364; The Patent Office of the People’s Republic of China, Application No.: 200810165784.8 China Patent CN1015113407 A The Patent Office of the People’s Republic of China ISSN: 1006-2858 CN 21-1349/R; Patent Agencies Government of India Patent, Application number 1627/KOLNP/2003 number 220265 an Enkephalin Peptide Composition; and the US Patent Pending, US Patent Application 10/146.999 which was approved in January 2014 US patent number 20140024588 (the “Plotnikoff Patents”). The Patent Cooperation Treaty (“PCT”) enables a U.S. applicant to file a single application, known as “an international application,” in a standardized format in English in the U.S. Receiving Office (the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office) that is acknowledged as a regular national or regional filing in any state or region that is party to the PCT.
 
The Company entered into a Sale of Technology Agreement with Dr. Nicholas P. Plotnikoff on March 4, 2012, wherein Dr. Plotnikoff agreed to transfer and assign all of his rights, title and interest in the Plotnikoff Patents to the Company. The Company received all the production formulations and technology designs from Dr. Plotnikoff necessary for the manufacturing, formulation, production and protocols of the MENK treatment of cancer and HIV/AIDS. As consideration for entering into the Sale of Technology Agreement, Dr. Plotnikoff received 6,000,000 shares of common stock, a royalty of a one percent on all sales of MENK in perpetuity and was granted the position of Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. The Sale of Technology Agreement was filed with Amendment No. 6 to the Form 10 Registration and incorporated herein by reference.
 
In addition to the above patents, we also signed an exclusive licensing agreement for all of the intellectual property developed at Pennsylvania State University by Dr. Ian S. Zagon, Dr. Patricia J. McLaughlin and Dr. Jill P. Smith for the treatment of cancer. The patents cover methods and formulations related to the treatment and prevention of cancers. More specifically, the present inventions describe the use of drugs that interact with opioid receptors (naltrexone, naloxone and the pentapeptide MENK) to inhibit and arrest the growth of cancer. Such efficacy has been discovered to be partially due to the functional manipulation of the zeta opioid receptor through exogenous and endogenous MENK. This receptor has been determined to be present in a variety of cancers, including pancreatic, ovarian, liver, head and neck, and colon cancer. US Patent Numbers 6,737,397, CA 2,557,504, US 20010046968 , US 6737397 , US 6136780 , US 20080015211 , US 20070053838 , US 8003630 , US 20110123437 , US 7807368 , US 7576180 , US 7517649 , US 20080146512 , US 7122651 , US 20060073565, US 20050191241 , Patent No 8,003,630.

Once the Company acquired the above patents, it was then able to sign a licensing agreement to acquire the exclusive patent rights for the intellectual property of the licensors, Dr. Jill Smith and LDN Research Group, LLC, whose members include Dr. Ian S. Zagon, Dr. Patricia J. McLaughlin and Moshe Rogosnitzky. The patents cover methods and formulations for the treatment of the inflammatory and ulcerative diseases of the bowel, using naltrexone in low doses as an opioid antagonist. Endogenous opioids and opioid antagonists at low doses have been shown to play a role in stimulating and rebalancing the immune system and the healing and repair of tissues. US Patent No. 6,136,780, Patent No. US 7879870. The Company then negotiated with Dr. Jill Smith to arrange the transfer of the Orphan Drug Designation for the use of naltrexone for the treatment of pediatric Crohn’s disease with the FDA. Dr. Smith has since transferred the IND to the Company, and the FDA acknowledged that the Company is now the sponsor for this IND. In September 2014, the Company and the licensors jointly agreed to terminate the license agreement, and in place thereof, have the licensors grant a similar license in their patent rights to Cytocom Inc. pursuant to a Patent License Agreement between the licensors, Cytocom Inc. and the Company with substantially similar terms as set forth in the original license agreement. Pursuant to this agreement, the Company issued 1,000,000 shares of its common stock to the licensors and the Company guaranteed the obligations of Cytocom Inc. to the licensors under the agreement.
 
The Company originally acquired the patents and intellectual property from Dr. Smith and LDN Research Group, LLC because management believed clinical trials involving LDN held great promise for the millions of people worldwide with autoimmune diseases or disorders, central nervous system disorders or those who face cancer. Management also believed it could be the first low-cost, easy to administer therapy with minimal to no side-effects for the treatment of HIV/AIDS, autoimmune diseases and immune disorders, in particular Crohn’s disease, multiple sclerosis, and/or fibromyalgia.
 
Dr. Nicholas Plotnikoff, Professor Fenping Shan and Noreen Griffin recently filed a Provisional Application for a Utility Patent US Application No. 62/296,759 Method for Inducing a Sustained Immune Response, which was assigned to the Company in March 2016. U.S. Patent and Trademark Office has issued the Official Filing Receipt in connection with this application, and accorded a filing date of February 18, 2016 during its pendency in the USPTO.
 
Summaries of the Company’s agreements are as follows:
 
Dr. Nicholas Plotnikoff
 
In connection with the share exchange, the following is the scope of the intellectual property transfer: we entered into a Sale of Technology Agreement with Dr. Nicholas P. Plotnikoff on March 4, 2012, wherein Dr. Plotnikoff agreed to a 100% transfer and assign all of his rights, title and interest in: European Patent United Kingdom, Germany, France, Ireland EP 1401471 BI Methods for inducing sustained immune response; Russian Patent Russian Federation patent number 2313364; The Patent Office of the People’s Republic of China, Application No.: 200810165784.8 China Patent CN1015113407 A The Patent Office of the People’s Republic of China ISSN: 1006-2858 CN 21-1349/R; Patent Agencies Government of India Patent, Application number 1627/KOLNP/2003 number 220265 an Enkephalin Peptide Composition; and the US Patent Pending, US Patent Application 10/146.999 e. The Company received all the production formulations and technology designs from Dr. Plotnikoff necessary for the manufacturing, formulation, production and protocols of the MENK treatment of cancer and HIV/AIDS. As consideration for entering into the Sale of Technology Agreement, Dr. Plotnikoff received 8,000,000 shares of common stock, a royalty of a single-digit percentage on all sales of MENK and was granted the position of Non-Executive Chairman of the Board of Directors. There were no other payment provisions included in the termination provisions.
 
At the time of the acquisition, the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets were determined using the fair market price for the Company’s common stock, which were exchanged for shares of TNI IP. In the fourth quarter of 2012, the Company performed an annual valuation to determine whether any goodwill or intangible assets that had been acquired by the Company were impaired. The result of this valuation was that material impairments were identified. The Company recognized an impairment of the goodwill arising on the acquisition of TNI IP of $98,000,000.

Jacqueline Young
 
On August 13, 2012, the Company signed an exclusive License Agreement with Ms. Jacqueline Young (the “Young Agreement”) for the intellectual property developed by Dr. Bernard Bihari relating to treatments with opioid antagonists such as naltrexone and Met-enkephalin for a variety of diseases and conditions including malignant lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic herpes virus infections, chronic herpes viral infections such as chronic genital herpes caused by the herpes simplex virus Type 2 and chronic infections due to the Epstein-Barr virus and a treatment method for humans infected with HTLV-III (AIDS) virus, including patients clinically diagnosed as suffering from AIDS and those suffering from AIDS-related complex (ARC).
 
The Young Agreement is valid for the life of the patents and expires on a country by country basis in each country where patent rights exist, upon the expiration of the last to expire patent in each country or in the event the patent in such country is held to be invalid and/or unenforceable (by a court or government body of competent jurisdiction) or admitted to be invalid or unenforceable.
 
The termination provision states that, additionally, we can cancel the Young Agreement upon 120 days’ written notice and shall pay all royalties and fees that have accrued. We have the exclusive rights to the intellectual property; however, Ms. Young retains a right to practice the patents licensed under the Young Agreement solely for non-commercial, academic research purposes.
 
The Bihari patents were acquired in exchange for 540,000 shares of the Company’s common stock with a fair value of $972,000 and assumed liabilities of $400,000, which is payable to Ms. Young over a twenty-four month period in equal installments to reimburse her for the costs of a New York City office in accordance with the Young Agreement. The patent liability at December 31, 2013 totaled $118,333. The cost of the patent totaled $1,372,000. Additionally, the Company will pay the licensor a royalty payment of 1% of gross MENK sales and provide the licensor a position as non-executive chairman of the Company.

Research and Development
 
Our research and development (“R&D”) organization focuses primarily on new uses for the opioid-related immuno-therapies, such as LDN and MENK. These therapies stimulate the immune system in such a way that provides the potential to treat a variety of diseases that have abnormalities in the immune system.

35
--


Our R&D priorities include development of MENK IRT-101, a small synthetic pentapeptide that is naturally occurring in the body, and LDN IRT-103, an opioid receptor antagonist. Our pipeline provides two therapies with an extremely wide range of indications that can be pursued. Both molecules have the ability to stimulate and/or regulate the immune system in order to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis, immune disorders such as Crohn’s disease, cancer, and viral infections such as HIV/AIDS.
 
Our R&D is overseen and managed internally, working with individuals, universities, and Contract Research Organizations (“CROs”) in order to utilize patents that we have licensed or acquired since our inception. We continue to seek to expand our pipeline by reviewing other compounds, technologies or capabilities. We also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects.
 
Drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. According to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), out of 5,000-10,000 screened compounds, only 250 enter preclinical testing, five enter human clinical trials and one is approved by the FDA. The process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than 10 years. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research.
 
As of December 31, 2015, we had two compounds (IRT-101 and IRT-103) in research and development. In 2015 our development programs focused on both compounds, one in oncology and one in Crohn’s disease; which we are expecting to move into Phase II clinical trials.
 
The following table provides information about notable regulatory actions by, and filings pending with the FDA and regulatory authorities in the EU, as well as additional indications and new drug candidates in late-stage development.
 

NEW DRUG CANDIDATES IN LATE-STAGE DEVELOPMENT 
-------------------------------------------------
CANDIDATE | INDICATION | REGULATORY ACTIONS 
IRT-101 | Pancreatic Cancer | End-of-Phase 1 Meeting with FDA Complete 3Q 2013 
IRT-103 | Crohn’s Disease | Type C Meeting with FDA Complete 2Q 2013 Scientific Advice with EMA Complete 1Q 2014 

 
The Company expects it will incur future research and development expenditures in the next 12 months through Cytocom. Cytocom plans to conduct Phase II and Phase IIB trials for the treatment of IRT-103 Crohn’s disease, at an estimated cost of $3,900,000 and $7,500,000 respectively for each phase. If the trials do not commence before the end of 2017, the Company will be required to make a payment of $100,000 in December 2017 under its license agreements. In prior years, the Company has been able to raise funds through sales of notes payable, and it expects to do the same for the payment due in 2017. With funding Cytocom will be responsible for the development of IRT-101 MENK for pancreatic cancer.
 
Government Regulations
 
United States
 
The research, testing, manufacturing, labeling, approval, selling, import, export, marketing and distribution of drug products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the United States and other countries with regulations differing from country to country. Neither we nor our collaboration partners are permitted to market our drug candidates in the United States until we receive approval of a New Drug Application (“NDA”) from the FDA. Neither we nor our collaboration partners have submitted an application for or received marketing approval for any of our drug candidates. Obtaining approval of an NDA can be a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process.
 
Prior to receiving approval to commercialize any of our drug candidates in the United States or abroad, we and our collaboration partners must demonstrate with substantial evidence from well controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA and other regulatory authorities abroad, that such drug candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses. Results from preclinical studies and clinical trials can be interpreted in different ways. Regulatory approval of an NDA or NDA supplement is not guaranteed, and the approval process is expensive and may take several years.
 

36
--


Before a drug can be tested in people, the sponsor (in this case the Company) performs laboratory and animal tests to discover how the drug works and whether it’s likely to be safe and effective in humans. As LDN and MENK have previously been used in clinical trials, this phase of development was not required by the Company to initiate clinical trials under its applications.
 
Next, a series of tests in people (i.e. clinical trials) is begun to determine whether the drug is safe when used to treat a disease and whether it provides a real health benefit. The clinical phase typically starts at Phase 1 and progresses to Phase 3. The Company will have an abbreviated list of clinical trials that need to be conducted due to published literature on previously conducted studies, as well as utilizing the approval of naltrexone previously at 50 mg by the FDA.
 
Upon completion of the clinical trials, the Company will send the FDA and/or the EMA the evidence from these tests to prove the drug is safe and effective for its intended use (New Drug Application (NDA) in the US or Marketing Authorization Application in the EU). The regulatory bodies will review these data and determine if the sponsor has approval to market the product at the specified dose(s) and formulation(s) for the specified indication(s) (http://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/default.htm).
 
Once regulatory approval has been granted, the approved product and its manufacturer are subject to continual review by the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities. Any regulatory approval that we or our collaboration partners receive for our drug candidates may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing follow-up studies to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. In addition, if the FDA and/or non-U.S. regulatory authorities approve any of our drug candidates, we will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements by the FDA and other regulatory authorities with regard to the labeling, packaging, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for our products. In addition, manufacturers of our drug products are required to comply with current cGMP regulations which include requirements related to quality control and quality assurance, as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation. Further, regulatory authorities must approve these manufacturing facilities before they can be used to manufacture our drug products, and these facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations.
 
European Union
 
We intend to seek distribution and marketing partners for IRT-101 (MENK) and IRT-103 (LDN) in the European Union (“EU”). To market our future products in the European Economic Area (“EEA”) (which is comprised of the 27 member states of the EU plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and many other foreign jurisdictions, we must obtain separate regulatory approvals. More concretely, in the EEA, medicinal products can only be commercialized after obtaining a Marketing Authorization (“MA”).

● | The Community MA is issued by the European Commission through the Centralized Procedure, based on the opinion of the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the EMA, and is valid throughout the entire territory of the EEA. The Centralized Procedure is mandatory for certain types of products, such as biotechnology medicinal products, orphan medicinal products, and medicinal products indicated for the treatment of AIDS, cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, diabetes, auto-immune and viral diseases. The Centralized Procedure is optional for products containing a new active substance not yet authorized in the EEA, or for products that constitute a therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation or which are in the interest of public health in the EU. 
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
● | National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the Centralized Procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in a member state of the EEA, this National MA can be recognized in another member state through the Mutual Recognition Procedure. If the product has not received a National MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the Decentralized Procedure. 


37
--


Under the procedures described above, before granting the MA, the EMA or the competent authorities of the member states of the EEA make an assessment of the risk-benefit balance of the product on the basis of scientific criteria concerning its quality, safety and efficacy.
 
Our IND is being conducted per 21 Code of Federal Regulations Title 21, Part 312. In addition, we follow ICH guidelines, including good clinical practices (ICH E6) and current good manufacturing practice (ICH Q7) throughout the development process. After completion of Phase III clinical trials, the Company will file our NDA for LDN (IRT-103) as a 505(b)(2) application. IRT-103 products will follow the 505(b)(2) pathway relying on the Reference Listed Drug (RLD) REVIA to support the safety of the product. Efficacy will be submitted by the Company directly to the LDN NDA. IRT-101 products will follow the traditional approval pathway as a RLD is not available for MENK. However, published literature will support this program.
 
Nigeria 
 
NAFDAC is the equivalent in Nigeria of the FDA. It undertakes registration of food, drugs, medical devices, cosmetics, agrochemicals and other similar products in Nigeria. At the end of the process, a registration number is given to the product and a registration certificate is issued to the applicant.
 
Many of the African countries do not have a local FDA equivalent organization or agency. We plan to use the NAFDAC Registration as the guideline for submission in Africa for countries that do not have their own application and approval procedures.
 
The Company has partnered with AHAR Pharma, a company duly incorporated and existing under the laws of the Republic of Nigeria to distribute LDN in the Republic of Nigeria. The distribution agreement was originally signed in 2013 and extended in 2016 for 5 years with an optional 5 year extension. AHAR Pharma is responsible for securing all required governmental or regulatory approvals, registrations, permits and licenses necessary to market, promote, offer for sale, sell, supply and distribute LDN in the Republic of Nigeria. Pursuant to the distribution agreement, the Company shall pay AHAR Pharma twenty-five U.S. cents for each tablet sold. Of the twenty-five cents paid, twelve and a half cents may be credited against the Company’s invoices and twelve and a half U.S. cents shall be paid to AHAR Pharma’s affiliate GB Pharma.
 
In addition, the Company has worked with GB Pharma Holdings since its formation in 2012. Over the last two years GB Pharma has worked directly with the NAFDAC and Minister of Health’s in Africa and the African Union on the approval of Lodonal™ for HIV/AIDS in Africa. GB Pharma has also worked to introduce LDN to the UNAIDS and World Health Organization. Dr. Gloria Herndon, the President of GB Pharma Holdings has traveled extensively to Nigeria, Kenya, Angola and South Africa in the past two years meeting with and holding discussion about the Company’s immunotherapies. Dr. Herndon has spoken on behalf of the Company at a number of conferences and was responsible for the introduction of the therapy to the Africa Union and the Champions, a group of former presidents of Africa to help promote the approval through the various in-country agencies.
 
The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary, Airmed Biopharma Limited, entered into an Exclusive Agency Agreement with GB Parma Holdings, Inc. on June 12, 2014 to distribute Lodonal™ in various emerging markets including Equatorial Guinea. Pursuant to the distribution agreement, GB Pharma shall be entitled to a commission of 5% of the net product sales. The Company’s relationships with the GB Pharma and its subsidiaries and affiliates are contractual, with the rights and obligations of the parties dictated by their respective agreements. GB Pharma and certain of its affiliates may also now own, or in the past owned, minority share positions in the Company via their investments or shares granted for services.
 
Malawi
 
No formal governmental agency is in place in Malawi to govern the application of a new drug. Malawi is a member of the Southern Africa Development Community (“SADC”). The SADC has been making efforts to synchronize the regulation of medication in the SADC countries.

38
--


The guidelines require filing an application prior to approval of registration. However, these guidelines are preliminary. The Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan (“RISDP”) is a comprehensive development and implementation framework guiding the Regional Integration agenda of the SADC over a period of fifteen years (2005-2020). It is designed to provide clear strategic direction with respect to SADC programs, projects and activities in line with the SADC Common Agenda and strategic priorities, as enshrined in the SADC Treaty of 1992.
 
In July 2014, the Republic of Malawi approved Lodonal™ as an adjunct for the treatment of cancer. Protocols for a Lodonal™ trial were approved in November 2015. The Brewer Group, Inc. has paid for production of the first shipment to Malawi of Lodonal™, which was delivered to Malawi from Nicaragua in 2015.
 
The Company and the Brewer Foundation arranged for the donation of the Wallach LL100 Cryosurgical system that were necessary to run the trial and treat patients with cervical cancer. In July 2014, the Republic of Malawi approved Lodonal™ as an adjunct for the treatment of cancer. Protocols for a Lodonal™ trial were approved in November 2015.
 
In 2012, the Company started its collaboration with the Brewer Foundation and the Brewer Group. Over the last two years The Brewer Group and Foundation has worked directly with the Government of Malawi on the approval of the clinical trials and protocols. Once the protocols were approved the Brewer Group help to arrange funding for the trials.
 
The Brewer Group has entered into a distribution agreement with Airmed Bioparhma Limited, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, to distribute Lodonal™ in emerging markets. The distribution agreement was entered into in 2014 and has a term of 5 years. Pursuant to the distribution agreement the Company shall sell Lodonal™ to The Brewer Group at a 25% discount to the list price. The Brewer Group has also arranged a number of meetings with various hedge funds in New York to assist with the funding of the company.
 
The Company’s relationships with the Brewer Group and Brewer Foundation are contractual, with the rights and obligations of the parties dictated by their respective agreements. The Brewer Group, Brewer Foundation and certain of their affiliates may also now own, or in the past owned, minority share positions in the Company via their investments or shares granted for services.
 
Equatorial Guinea
 
Equatorial Guinea does not have procedures for the official approval of traditional medical practices or remedies. Accordingly, the Company was requested to make a presentation to the Health Sector and Minister on the use of naltrexone in the treatment of certain indications. After due discussion, the Government approved the following:

1. | Drug use naltrexone (4.5 mg) in the treatment of diseases requiring immune system stimulating cancer, HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, etc., as demonstrated by the Company, at a cost of $1/day or 450 x F.CFA/day. 
---+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. | Management – laboratory for quality control and to analyze drugs imported in to Equatorial Guinea. 
3. | The implementation of local production of quality essential medicines. 

 
The Company’s wholly owned subsidiary Airmed Biopharma Limited, entered into an Exclusive Agency Agreement with GB Parma Holdings, Inc. on June 12, 2014 to distribute Lodonal™ in various emerging markets including Equatorial Guinea. Pursuant to the distribution agreement, GB Pharma shall be entitled to a commission of 5% of the net product sales.
 
China
 
On October 18, 2012, the Company and Hubei Qianjiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Qianjiang Pharmaceutical”), signed a Venture Cooperation Agreement on New Drug Methionine Enkephalin (the “Venture Agreement”) pursuant to which Qianjiang Pharmaceutical acquired an exclusive license for the production of MENK in China. The Venture Agreement requires that Qianjiang Pharmaceutical conduct drug research and pilot testing for MENK, organize pre-clinical studies, and apply for clinical trials for MENK with the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration. Under the Venture Agreement, Qianjiang Pharmaceutical must open a co-administration account for the development of MENK in China. Qianjiang Pharmaceutical must pay the Company, upon the marketing of MENK products, a half-year amount equaling 6% of its gross sales from MENK of the preceding half year.

39
--


Qianjiang Pharmaceutical is required to obtain all approvals and permits required for the importation and sale of the Company’s products in China.
 
The Company may cancel the Venture Agreement if Qianjiang Pharmaceutical does not pay expenses for a period exceeding nine months or does not commence clinical trials within 12-months after receiving certain approvals. Qianjiang Pharmaceutical may cancel the Venture Agreement if the Company fails to perform its obligations for a period of nine months or the failure to receive approval of clinical trials is due to the Company’s MENK technologies.
 
On August 6, 2014, the Company entered into a Supplementary Agreement on New Drug Methionine – Enkephalin Cooperation (the “Amendment”) with Qianjiang Pharmaceutical, amending the Venture Agreement, as amended. The Company and Qianjiang Pharmaceutical executed the Amendment to accelerate clinical trials in both the United States and China, and agreed to immediately initiate three month Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) Toxicology Studies (rat and dog) within 30 days of signing the Amendment. The Amendment requires that the GLP Toxicology Studies Trials are conducted in China in accordance with international standards and standards acceptable to the FDA.
 
The Company modified the agreement one more time due to the fact toxicology studies were not completed by the end of 2015 as others steps were required before the studies could start.
 
Qianjiang has completed the formulation and required Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC”) for Methionine–Enkephalin. All work was completed in China in accordance with international cGMP standards acceptable to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration with Chinese Peptide Company (“CPC”). CPC is among only a handful of companies in the world that can claim both ISO Certification and cGMP licensing. In February 2012, we became the first peptide company to successfully pass US FDA inspection outside of US and Europe regions.
 
Nicaragua and Dominican Republic
 
Laboratorios Ramos in Managua, Nicaragua has been issued approval from the Minster of Health to manufacture Naltrexone for the Company under the trademark name Lodonal™. The certificate of free sale allows Naltrexone to be exported from the Managua facility to other jurisdictions where the Company is approved to market and sell Naltrexone in satisfaction of the import requirements of such jurisdictions. The free sale certificate is not a license for export, which is issued separately for a specific product in both the country of export as well as the country of import.
 
Due to political developments in Nicaragua in the second half of 2016, the Company decided it would be prudent to obtain a second source of LDN product supply for sales outside of North America. In October 2016, the Company and Acromax Dominicana, SA (“Acromax”) entered into a contract for the manufacture of LDN tablets, capsules and/or creams (“Agreement”). Acromax is located in Santo Domingo; in the Dominican Republic. It is both cGMP certified and ISO 9001: 2008 certified. Acromax exports over 160 products and has sold throughout the Caribbean and Central and South America. More information about Acromax is available at http://acromaxdominicana.com/.
 
The Agreement has an initial term of five years unless terminated by either party in accordance with the terms. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Acromax will obtain all necessary licenses and permits to carry out the manufacturing and packaging of LDN in exchange for a fixed fee per tablet plus an additional fee for packaging, shipping and customs clearance. In 2017, Acromax received approval from the Ministry of Public Health and Social Assistance to manufacture and sell Naltrexone both in the Dominican Republic as well as for export on behalf of TNI BioTech International under the trademark name Lodonal™. The company was granted and issued a Certificate of Pharmaceutical Product (“COPP”) for the following countries: Nigeria, Senegal, Kenya and Malawi. We expect to add additional countries to the COPP in 2017.

Business Strategy
 
The Company’s short-term business strategy focuses on several key areas described below, all of which are being undertaken simultaneously.
 
International Regulatory Approval in 2017: The Company has been in discussions with drug regulators regarding the regulatory and approvals process for sale of its products in 2017 in a number of countries: South Africa, Nigeria, Malawi, Kenya, Angola, Niger, Gabon, Egypt, Sri Lanka, and China. The process can take between four to 12 months depending on the local authorities. In December 2016, the Company presented the final results of a bridging trial in Nigeria. As of March 31, 2017, we are still awaiting receipt of final approvals for sale of Lodonal™ in Nigeria. The Company has begun discussions for a 90-day Lodonal™ bridging trial as an adjunct to chemotherapy in Kenya. If we complete the Kenya trial and if we meet the primary and secondary end points, the Company expects to receive approval for Lodonal™ as an adjunct treatment for cancer in Kenya. An approval in Nigeria would allow the Company to fast track approvals in other countries.
 
While working on regulatory approval throughout Africa, The Company has begun discussions with a number of international organizations including the World Health Organization, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), and PATH, an international nonprofit organization dedicated to saving lives and improving health, especially among women and children. The Company expects to reach agreements with them in the coming year.
 
Establish Partnerships in Africa: Receipt of the recent approvals in Nigeria will allow the Company to establish partnerships in Africa with large employers that maintain onsite clinics; there is increasing recognition that health creates wealth and advances GDP. HIV and AIDS have had a significant negative impact on labor and productivity. The vast majority of people living with HIV in Africa are of working age 15-49 years old. The Company believes that Lodonal™ can be used as a prophylactic to avoid many of the standard opportunistic infections accompanied with HIV and cancer. The Company will now move forward on this program if it receives approval for Lodonal™ sales in Nigeria.
 
Funding Cytocom Inc. Clinical Trials: If we generate significant revenue from sales to Africa and under the licensing of our LDN formulation to., which is described in detail below under “Agreements to Promote Development and Sale of Company Products,” we believe that in 2017 we will be able to commit financial resources to help fund Cytocom Inc.’s clinical trials in the United States to validate the use of Lodonal LDN in a number of indications. Unless other funding becomes available, the Company expects to use revenue from the sale of Lodonal™ in Nigeria to help underwrite clinical trials in the U.S. and Europe.
 
Clinical Studies:
 
In 2016, the Company focused on receipt of approvals in Nigeria and Malawi to conduct clinical development programs for Lodonal™. We completed a trial in Nigeria in December 2016, and we have final NAFDAC approval to commence sales in Nigeria. The Company also expects to commence a bridging trial for cancer in 2017 in the Republic of Malawi for Lodonal as a stand-along therapy. The recruitment of study participants, VIA testing and follow up of patients is still on-going. The first evaluation report from the doctors involved is expected by the end of April 2017 as per the study protocol. Since we have a cancer trial with Lodonal as an adjunct, we decided to hold off requesting final approval for the second trial until we complete our first trial, which is expected to occur in the third quarter of 2017.
 
On the regulatory front, Cytocom Inc. has held constructive dialogue with the FDA with respect to appropriate trial designs and study protocols for Lodonal™ and IRT-101. The Company has received approval for a phase IIB/III to be run in conjunction with this trial, but as of the date of this Report the FDA remains in the process of determining the primary endpoint for the trial for Crohn’s Disease. The Company has retained Cote Orphan to submit a final package to the FDA during the third quarter of 2017.
 
Cytocom Inc.’s immediate focus will be on pediatric and adult Crohn’s Disease. The Company expects recruitment in both pharmacokinetic (PK) and Dosing Trials for Lodonal™ to begin in 2017 as long as funds are available.
 

41
--


In addition to the trial design as described immediately above, the Company intends to undertake a Toxicologist and PK study in China with its partner, Hubei Qianjiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, for IRT-101 for the purpose of furthering its understanding of the effect of the pharmacokinetics of IRT-101. The trial has been delayed until 2017 because the State Food and Drug Administration of the People’s Republic of China on the Safety of Drugs and Medical Devices (SFDA) has required chemistry, manufacturing and controls to be completed before the start of the toxicology study. Quinjiang expects to have the PK and Toxicology studies completed before the end of the year. This will allow the Company to better understand the potential for drug interactions to further optimize treatment for Phase 3 development of IRT-101 for cancer in both the United States and China. These trials are required before Hubei can file for a phase III trial for liver cancer with the SFDA.
 
The Company recently received the pharmacology and toxicology reports for MENK completed at GLP Lab by Hubei Qianjiang on. In addition to the pharmacology and toxicology, China Peptide Company has completed the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) required to file with both the SFDA and the FDA, as no pivotal trial can be started without CMC.
 
Strategy for Growth:
 
Since 2015, the Company has worked aggressively to build the business both upward and outward. It has worked to create a multi-faceted leader in immunotherapies by exploring opportunities beyond HIV/AIDS and cancer in emerging nations.
 
The goal and strategic vision is to build a diverse pipeline and to develop and commercialize novel drug treatments to improve the lives of patients suffering from chronic often life-threating disease.
 
To fulfill these goals, the Company received funding from the sale of stock, the exercise of stock warrants and issuance of notes payable totaling approximately $3.0 million in 2016. The Company anticipates generating revenues in 2017 from a number of sources, including revenues from the use of its formulation and patents and the sale of Lodonal™ in Nigeria, Malawi, Kenya, and Equatorial Guinea.
 
Company Growth:
 
To build visibility and positive awareness of the Company, management has made presentations at key investor and industry conferences internationally.
 
If the Company receives approvals for the sale of LDN in Nigeria following the 2016 bridging trial there, the Company believes it will be able to “fast track” the approval process in a number of African nations that will accept NAFDAC Nigeria’s approval of Lodonal™ for the treatment of HIV/AIDS.
 
Focus on HIV/AIDS
 
HIV/AIDS remains one of the three global public health threats. This disease results in substantial morbidity, mortality, negative socioeconomic consequences, and human suffering. Despite the significant increase in financial support and recent progress in addressing HIV/AIDS, many obstacles and unmet priorities remain.
 
Disease-specific interventions must be developed to ensure successful treatments of this disease. Apart from human suffering, the associated high adult mortality caused by HIV/AIDS, negatively impacts the socioeconomic development in some countries, especially in Nigeria and South Africa.
 
Adopting a treatment regimen for life that involves taking daily medication with potential side effects, presents many challenges that must be overcome if patients are to successfully remain on treatment. If drug resistance occurs through failure to adhere to antiretroviral treatments (ARVs), far more expensive second line therapy may be necessary. In some cases drug-resistant strains of HIV are transmitted, which can impact national treatment programs. Drug resistance has been found to be more prevalent the longer a country has provided antiretroviral therapies.
 

42
--


The Company believes Lodonal™ can provide an alternative in areas where patients have stopped taking their therapies due to side effects, or cost; Lodonal™ has been shown in trials to lessen the toxic side effects of ARVs. In those countries where people must travel monthly for a medical check-up (and lose a day’s pay), Lodonal™ can cost-effectively provide the ability to slow the progression of the disease without any toxic side effects.
 
Nigeria: In Nigeria, it is estimated that more than 3.6 million people are living with HIV/AIDS, with the annual number of new infections for adults at 323,000 and 57,000 for children. Currently, only 600,000 people receive HIV treatment (see http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries/).
 
South Africa: Based on a wide range of data including the household and antenatal studies, UNAIDS (see http://www.unaids.org/en/regionscountries) estimated that HIV prevalence was 17.3% among 15-49 year olds at the end of 2011. The high and low estimates were 16.6% and 18.1%, respectively. This implies that approximately 5.6 million South Africans were living with HIV at the end of 2011, including 460,000 children under 15 years old. By October 2012, only two million people were receiving ARVs. The biggest problem is compliance with prescribed treatment, as people are required to take pills 2 to 3 times a day at specific times and many times with food with considerable toxic side effects. In contrast, Lodonal™ is taken only once per day, does not have to be taken with food, and has no toxic side effects.
 
Agreements to Promote Development and Sale of Company Products
 
The Company is focused on its lead therapies designed for the treatment of cancer, HIV/AIDS, Crohn’s disease, fibromyalgia and MS. Management believes the pharmaceutical industry is eager to acquire advanced clinical-phase and approved products. However, despite the strong demand for advanced clinical-phase products, nearly 4,000 known compounds have had their development suspended in Phase II or earlier. Many of these are promising therapeutic drug candidates, but their development was discontinued because of strategic or financial constraints rather than for clinical reasons. Therefore, management believes there are clear market opportunities with a significant amount of unmet needs and a robust potential for partnering activities.
 
To further the business strategy, the Company has entered into relationships with a number of groups to promote the sale of its products outside the U.S., focusing initially on countries in Africa. They include: The Brewer Group, Inc.; GB Oncology & Imaging Group, LLC; American Hospitals and Resorts Limited (“AHAR”), an advanced surgical and medical facility, as well as a number of U.S. doctors that own and operate clinics in the U.S. and Nigeria.
 
The Brewer Group, Inc. is an international business advisory firm engaged in the business of identifying and capitalizing on opportunities with international governments, non-government organizations and professional athletes. The CEO of The Brewer Group is also the founder and Executive Director of The Jack Brewer Foundation. The Jack Brewer Foundation seeks to provide the Company with medical equipment where it is needed. Under the Engagement Agreement for Corporate Advisory Services dated February 5, 2013, the Brewer Group agreed to evaluate the Company’s options for expansion and growth into certain international markets, including Africa and, upon request, markets in Haiti, the Dominican Republic and/or Panama. Pursuant to the Engagement Agreement, the Brewer Group agreed to endorse the Company publicly and assist the Company in securing strategic partnership deals to enhance brand and market awareness. The initial term of the Engagement Agreement was 12 months, with an option for either party to terminate upon 30 calendar days with written notice to the other party. The agreement has been extended through 2017. The Company has issued the Brewer Group a total of 6,650,000 shares of its common stock since the signing of the Engagement Agreement.
 
GB Pharma lead by Dr. Gloria B. Herndon, a former director and current consultant of the Company has been committed to sourcing sustainable solutions in the field of health care in Africa, and has been involved since the 1990s on health-care related issues in Africa. The Company and GB Pharma have continued working with the ministries of health in African countries to provide better access to and public awareness of the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer and chronic infectious diseases.

In 2015, the Company submitted protocols seeking permission from the Pharmacy, Medicines and Poisons Board of Malawi (“PMPB”) to conduct two trials involving Lodonal™ in Malawi:
 

a. | The first protocol, submitted jointly with The Jack Brewer Foundation (“JBF Worldwide”), received PMPB approval on November 11, 2016. The protocol covers a 12-month trial for a “Single Visit Approach to Cervical Cancer Prevention.” The approach is designed to deliver a preventive and simple procedure that can be performed in a clinical setting without the use of a laboratory and to allow for immediate treatment of any precancerous lesions utilizing Wallach LL100 Cryosurgical systems. The protocol provides for 50% of the patient group to be put on Lodonal™ to determine if the drug lowers the number of opportunistic infections during the year, and if it can be shown that LDN increases CD4, CE8, NK and T cell count, which would show that the incidence rates of opportunistic infection could decrease with Lodonal™ and that Lodonal™ could be used as a prophylaxis to prevent substantial HIV-related morbidity in Malawi. The Company expects the final trial agreement with PMPB to be signed by the end of the third quarter of 2017 as there was a delay in training and recruitment. 
---+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
b. | The second protocol, which has not yet been approved, covers a trial using Lodonal™ for the treatment of cancer. The protocol is still under discussion with the PMPB. The Company has held off on this trial as the approval of Lodonal™ in Nigeria and the pending approval in Kenya and Senegal for cancer treatment will allow it to file for drug approval without the need for a trial. 

 
In September 2013, TNI BioTech International, Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company, signed a Distribution Agreement with AHAR Pharma, a Nigerian company, to market Lodonal™, in Nigeria for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and cancer. AHAR intends to distribute Lodonal™ through a local distributor network, an Internet client base and directly to hospitals, pharmacists and doctors in Nigeria. The agreement gives AHAR exclusive rights to sell to customers in the private sector and non-exclusive rights to public-sector companies. The Company may terminate the exclusivity if AHAR fails to meet minimum purchase targets. Unless terminated earlier, the agreement is valid for five years, subject to the right of the parties to extend for one additional five-year term. The Company had hoped to implement the agreement in 2015 but did not finish the trial until December 2015. We now anticipate launch of the product in the third quarter of 2017. This delay was caused by the change in manufacturing from Nicaragua to the Dominican Republic. Under the agreement, the Company is obligated to provide delivery of an initial supply of between 1 million and 1.5 million doses of Lodonal™ product to cover AHAR Pharma’s first-year purchase commitment.
 
In August 2015, the Company announced the signing of a letter of interest with GB Pharma/AHAR and Fidson Healthcare of Nigeria to enable Fidson to market and sell LodonalTM in Nigeria. The agreement will become effective if we receive NAFDAC approval to distribute LodonalTM in Nigeria, based on the 2015 trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of Lodonal™. The agreement will require an amendment to the agreement signed in September 2013 with AHAR, so that both contracts conform. On January 21, 2016 the company submitted the initial results of the clinical trial to NAFDAC, and on February 22, 2016 AHAR Pharma submitted final document to NAFDAC requesting the issuance for marketing approval. As of March 31, 2017 the Company is still awaiting marketing approval for distribution of Lodonal™ in Nigeria under this agreement.
 
In September 2014, Airmed Biopharma Limited (“Airmed”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, signed an exclusive agency agreement with GB Pharma Holdings Inc., to market and promote Lodonal™, and to solicit purchase orders for Lodonal™, in various counties in Africa. Airmed is required to pay GB Pharma Holdings Inc. a commission based on payments actually received on purchase orders procured by the GB Pharma Holdings Inc. from customers in Africa during the term of the agreement, after deduction for certain costs incurred by Airmed for product supply. The agreement has an initial term of five years, with automatic renewals for additional one-year periods unless terminated by either party.
 
On October 18, 2012, the Company and Hubei Qianjiang Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Qianjiang Pharmaceutical”), signed a Venture Cooperation Agreement on New Drug Methionine Enkephalin (the “Venture Agreement”) pursuant to which Qianjiang Pharmaceutical acquired an exclusive license for the production of MENK in China. The Venture Agreement requires that Qianjiang Pharmaceutical conduct drug research and pilot testing for MENK, organize pre-clinical studies, and apply for clinical trials for MENK with the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration. Under the Venture Agreement, Qianjiang Pharmaceutical must open a co-administration account for the development of MENK in China. Qianjiang Pharmaceutical must pay the Company, upon the marketing of MENK products, a half-year amount equaling 6% of its gross sales from MENK of the preceding half year. The Company may cancel the Venture Agreement if Qianjiang Pharmaceutical does not pay expenses for a period exceeding nine months or does not commence clinical trials within 12-months after receiving certain approvals. Qianjiang Pharmaceutical may cancel the Venture Agreement if the Company fails to perform its obligations for a period of nine months or the failure to receive approval of clinical trials is due to the Company’s MENK technologies. The Venture Agreement was amended on February 24, 2013 to expand the clinical trials from pancreatic to both pancreatic and liver cancer and amended on March 6, 2014 to require Qianjiang Pharmaceutical to commence studies and clinical trials in China and place funds in the co-administration account.

On August 6, 2014, the Company entered into a Supplementary Agreement on New Drug Methionine – Enkephalin Cooperation (the “Amendment”) with Qianjiang Pharmaceutical, amending the Venture Agreement, as amended. The Company and Qianjiang Pharmaceutical executed the Amendment to accelerate clinical trials in both the United States and China, and agreed to immediately initiate three month Good Laboratory Practice (“GLP”) Toxicology Studies (rat and dog) within 30 days of signing the Amendment. The Amendment requires that the GLP Toxicology Studies Trials are conducted in China in accordance with international standards and standards acceptable to the FDA.
 
In February 2013, the Company signed a Strategic Framework Agreement for Cooperation with Qianjiang Pharmaceutical. Under the agreement, the parties will work together to further the development of new products and conduct research and development on the Company’s licensed patented technology. Specifically, the parties aim to co-invest to develop and market products focusing on HIV, cancer and related autoimmune system therapies, develop co-ventured manufacturing facilities in China, and develop co-ventured distribution of the developed products in China and Africa. The agreement does not have a definitive term, as each new agreement resulting from the cooperation will set forth the material terms, including, but not limited to, fees, duration and termination therein.
 
In accordance with these agreements, Qianjiang Pharmaceutical has acquired MENK material for the preclinical and clinical trial. MENK toxicology studies are in process under the trial, including a six-month toxicology study in animals. Other studies, including stability and general pharmacology (on normal animals to determine the effect to heart, blood pressure, etc.) have commenced. All FDA-required tests, including formulation and quality control tests, are in process in China.
 
The Company recently received the pharmacology and toxicology reports for MENK at GLP lab completed by Hubei Qianjiang. In addition to the pharmacology and toxicology, China Peptide has completed the Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (CMC) required to file with both the SFDA and the FDA, as no pivotal trial can be started without CMC.
 
Production
 
On April 23, 2013, the Company signed a Contract with ViPharma for the Supervision and Inspection of Manufacturing Processes as part of its negotiations for a contract for the manufacturing of LDN in a tablet, capsule and/or cream. The contract sets out the terms and conditions under which ViPharma will carry out the services of inspecting and supervising the manufacturing and packaging processes of LDN and ensure compliance with the FDA’s Current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations (“cGMP”) and the Company’s specifications. ViPharma will carry out its obligations in whatever Latin American country the Company ultimately decides to manufacture LDN. Under the contract, ViPharma has the exclusive rights to supervise and inspect all manufacturing processes of LDN in Latin America. The initial term of the agreement is ten years commencing in September 2013, with automatic five-year renewal terms provided neither party is in breach. The agreement may be terminated by (i) mutual agreement, (ii) in the event of a breach after a 45 day cure period or (iii) by either party upon provision of written notice at least 90 days before the end of the agreement, provided however that if the Company terminates the contract without cause it will be required to pay ViPharma a $10 million penalty.
 
The Company executed a manufacturing agreement with Laboratorios Ramos, a current good manufacturing practice (“cGMP”) facility for Lodonal™ effective August 16, 2013. Under the agreement, Laboratorios Ramos will produce LDN tablets, capsules and/or cream in accordance with the technical specifications we provided, cGMPs and the practices of Nicaragua and of any other regulatory body of the countries where the products will be exported. Laboratorios Ramos has obtained all permits and licenses necessary to carry out the manufacturing of LDN. The manufacturing agreement has a five-year term, renewable by a signed agreement by the parties at least 60 days before the expiration of the agreement. The agreement may be terminated earlier through mutual agreement or upon expiration of a 30-day cure period following notice from the non-breaching party to the breaching party of a material failure of the obligations under the agreement. Additionally, we may terminate the agreement upon at least 30 days written notice if Laboratorios Ramos does not act in strict accordance with the technical specifications we provided and with cGMPs or those of any regulatory body of the importing countries. We will pay Laboratorios Ramos a low single digit cent amount per tablet or capsule and a low double-digit cent amount per each cream produced.

Raw Materials and Principal Suppliers
 
The Company has decided to enter into third-party manufacturing agreements; accordingly, we rely on third parties for clinical production of our products and product candidates.
 
The active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) for initiating clinical trials in the United States has been and will continue to be sourced from a cGMP-established vendor that has filed or will file a Type II Drug Master File in the United States. Prior to sourcing, a quality due diligence/vendor qualification will be completed that will include, but is not limited to, a review of the vendor’s inspection and compliance history with the FDA and, as relevant, the vendor’s inspection and compliance history with other regulatory bodies (i.e. the European Medicines Agency, or EMA).
 
The Company expects that the Finished Pharmaceutical Product (“FPP”) for initiating the proposed clinical trials will be prepared by a U.S. vendor with extensive cGMP experience, a strong record of compliance with FDA regulations as evidenced by a site Quality Audit, and an extensive history of manufacturing products administered to humans in the U.S.
 
American Peptide Company is the Company’s supplier of the API in MENK. S.A.L.A.R.S SpA supplies the API in LDN.

The current lack of safe, effective, low cost oral treatments for autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis and Crohn’s disease provides an attractive opportunity for our product. Treatment of cancer is an unmet medical need in developing countries, and the need for a safe, effective, low-cost oral treatment provides an opportunity for our Company. Clinical results with LDN trials support further evaluation of our products in the treatment of Crohn’s disease.
 
Customers
 
In 2016, the Company recorded Lodonal™ sales totaling $3,463 to individuals in the USA under its agreement with KRS. The Company had $16,197 of sales to customers in 2015.
 
The Company has made final applications for the importation of Lodonal™ into the Republic of Nigeria and the Republic of Equatorial Guinea. In Equatorial Guinea, the Company has obtained approval for the sale of the drug, but the government has not allocated any funds to initiate purchases. In December 2015, NAFDAC granted permission to the Company and AHAR Pharma for a Lodonal™ trial for HIV/AIDS in Nigeria. The objective of this bridging trial was to assure safety and tolerability as well as efficacy with the local population. The Company completed this trial in December 2016, and as of March 31, 2017 had not yet received approval for the importation of Lodonal™ in Nigeria.
 
The Company, with approval from the Minister of Health in Nicaragua and countries that approve and register the product inclusive of the Certificate of Pharmaceutical Products issued for that jurisdiction, will look to open distribution channels in Central and South America in 2017.
 
Lodonal’s commercialization in Nigeria was delayed by about three quarters as we replaced our Lodonal manufacturer in Nicaragua in favor of Dominican Republic. Through our political contacts, we determined the political landscape in Nicaragua was shifting in the wrong direction and, rather than risk a major, costly supply chain disruption after beginning distribution, our Board decided to secure a relationship with a second manufacturer.
 
The Company signed an agreement with Acromax Dominicana SA October 25, 2016 one of the premier pharmaceutical companies in the Dominican Republic. Acromax is both cGMP certified but has received ISO 9001: 2008 certification as evidence that they fully meet the requirements dictated by the said rule and, as a result, is able to meet national and international regulations related to their activities ensuring quality, safety and reliability of their medicines. Acromax exports over 160 products and has shipped into Nigeria in the past. This required a new round of regulatory approvals in both Nigeria with NAFDAC and with the Dominican Republic with the Minister of Public Health and Social Assistance.
 
The Dominican Minister of Public Health and Social Assistance granted manufacturing and export approval for LodonalTM on January 23, 2017, registration number 2017-0068. As of March 16, 2017, the Company had submitted all of the required documents and samples to NAFDAC to apply for final marketing approval in Nigeria of Dominican-manufactured LodonalTM. The company is hopes to receive marketing approval by the third quarter of 2017.
 
Once the Company obtained drug approval for Lodonal in the Dominican Republic, we were able to begin the new regulatory process in Nigeria for marketing approval. The Company was required to provide the following documents as part of marketing approval: Acromax Dossier, Drug Approval issued by the relevant health/regulatory body Dominican Republic, Certificate of Pharmaceutical Products (COPP – WHO FORMAT); Current Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) Certificate of the manufacturing facility; Certificate of Registration of Brand Name with the trademark Registry in the Ministry of Commerce in Nigeria, Clinical Trial Data, Comprehensive Certificate of Analysis; Issued by the manufacturer. Current Annual License to Practice for the Superintendent Pharmacists issued by the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria; Current Certificate of Registration Retention of Premise issued by the Pharmacists Council of Nigeria, 100 Samples including packaging, Patient Data Sheet and A letter of Invitation to inspect the factory abroad.
 
The Company has received approval from the Republic of Malawi for the importation of Lodonal™, subject to completion of a clinical trial as an adjunct treatment for cancer.

Research and Development
 
Our research and development (“R&D”) organization focuses primarily on new uses for the opioid-related immuno-therapies, such as LDN and MENK. These therapies stimulate the immune system in such a way that provides the potential to treat a variety of diseases that have abnormalities in the immune system.
 
Our R&D priorities include development of MENK IRT-101, a small synthetic pentapeptide that is naturally occurring in the body, and Lodonal™, an opioid receptor antagonist. Our pipeline provides two therapies with an extremely wide range of indications that can be pursued. Both molecules have the ability to stimulate and/or regulate the immune system in order to treat a variety of autoimmune diseases including multiple sclerosis, immune disorders such as Crohn’s disease, cancer, and viral infections such as HIV/AIDS.
 
Our R&D is overseen and managed internally, working with individuals, universities, and Contract Research Organizations (“CROs”) in order to utilize patents that we have licensed or acquired since our inception. We continue to seek to expand our pipeline by reviewing other compounds, technologies or capabilities. We also seek out promising compounds and innovative technologies developed by third parties to incorporate into our discovery and development processes or projects.
 
Drug discovery and development is time-consuming, expensive and unpredictable. According to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA), out of 5,000-10,000 screened compounds, only 250 enter preclinical testing, five enter human clinical trials and one is approved by the FDA. The process from early discovery or design to development to regulatory approval can take more than 10 years. Drug candidates can fail at any stage of the process, and candidates may not receive regulatory approval even after many years of research.
 
As of December 31, 2016, we had two compounds (IRT-101 and Lodonal™) in research and development. In 2016 our development programs focused on both compounds, one in oncology and one in Crohn’s disease; which we are expecting to move into Phase II clinical trials.
 
The following table provides information about significant regulatory actions by, and filings pending with the FDA and regulatory authorities in the EU, as well as additional indications and new drug candidates in late-stage development.
 

NEW DRUG CANDIDATES IN LATE-STAGE DEVELOPMENT
