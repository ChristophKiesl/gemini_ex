Item 1. Business.

We are a global gene therapy company dedicated to transforming the lives of people affected by rare diseases through the development of innovative, potentially curative gene therapies. Our ex vivo autologous hematopoietic stem cell, or HSC, gene therapy approach harnesses the power of genetically modified blood stem cells and seeks to correct the underlying cause of disease in a single administration. We seek to achieve this outcome by utilizing a lentiviral vector to introduce a functional copy of a missing or faulty gene into the patient’s own, or autologous, HSCs through an ex vivo process, resulting in a gene-modified cellular drug product that can then be administered to the patient at the bedside.
To date, over 170 patients have been treated with our current and former product candidates across seven different diseases, with follow-up periods of more than 11 years following a single administration. We believe the data observed across these development programs, in combination with our expertise in the development, manufacturing and commercialization of gene and cell therapies, position us to provide potentially curative therapies to people suffering from a broad range of diseases.
We are currently focusing our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach on severe neurometabolic diseases and early research programs. Our lead program is OTL-200, which was approved in the European Union, the United Kingdom, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway under the brand name Libmeldy for eligible patients with early-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy, or MLD. Pending the outcome of the multidisciplinary pre-BLA meeting scheduled for the second quarter of 2023, we anticipate a potential BLA submission in mid-2023.
 Our portfolio includes a commercial-stage product and research and development-stage product candidates. We believe our approach of using lentiviral vectors to genetically modify HSCs has wide-ranging applicability to a large number of indications. The ability of HSCs to differentiate into multiple cell types allows us to deliver gene-modified cells to multiple physiological systems, including the central nervous system, immune system and red blood cell and platelet lineage, thereby potentially enabling the correction of a wide range of diseases. By leveraging the innate self-renewing capability of HSCs that are engrafted in the bone marrow as well as the ability of lentiviral vectors to achieve stable integration of a modified gene into the chromosomes of HSCs, our gene therapies have the potential to provide a durable effect following a single administration.
The diseases we target affect patients around the world, requiring an infrastructure to deliver gene therapies globally. In order to meet anticipated demand for our pipeline of approved products and product candidates still in development, we are utilizing our existing network of contract development and manufacturing organizations, or CDMOs, to manufacture lentiviral vectors and drug product. In addition, we have established process development capabilities in London, UK, and are leveraging technologies that will allow us to deliver our gene therapies globally.
Cryopreservation of our gene-modified HSCs is a key component of our commercialization strategy to deliver potentially curative gene therapies to patients worldwide, facilitating both local treatment and local or cross-border product reimbursement. We developed a cryopreserved formulation of Libmeldy (OTL-200) and are collecting supportive clinical data from patients treated with cryopreserved formulations to support the analytical comparability to the fresh cell formulations used in our registrational clinical trials. The registrational trials for all our earlier stage product candidates are expected to be conducted using a cryopreserved formulation.
With the exception of OTL-105, our product candidate for the potential treatment of hereditary angioedema, or HAE, which we are pursuing in partnership with Pharming Group N.V., we have global commercial rights to all our clinical product candidates and plan to commercialize our gene therapies in key markets worldwide, including in Europe and the U.S. initially, subject to obtaining the necessary marketing approvals for these jurisdictions. We are focused on deploying a commercial infrastructure to deliver Libmeldy and our product candidates, if approved, to patients and are focused on working closely with all relevant stakeholders, including patients, caregivers, specialist physicians and payors, to ensure the widest possible post-approval access for our product candidates. In addition, we may rely on third parties to assist with regulatory submissions, disease awareness, patient identification and reimbursement in countries where local expertise is required or where we do not have a direct presence.

As we continue to develop our portfolio, we believe that the experience of our management team and our extensive academic relationships are key strategic strengths. Our management team has extensive experience in rare diseases and in the manufacturing, pre-clinical and clinical development and commercialization of gene and cell therapies. In addition, we partner with leading academic institutions around the world, which are pioneers in ex vivo autologous HSC-based gene therapy. We plan to leverage our internal expertise combined with our relationships with leading academic institutions to transition our lead clinical-stage product candidates to commercialization and continue to expand our portfolio of ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy products.

Our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach

Our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach seeks to transform a patient’s autologous HSCs into a gene-modified cellular drug product to treat the patient’s disease. HSCs are self-renewing cells that are capable of differentiating into all types of blood cells, including white blood cells, red blood cells, platelets and tissue resident macrophages, which include the microglia of the central nervous system. HSCs can be obtained directly from the bone marrow, which requires administration of a general anesthetic, or from the patient’s peripheral blood with the use of mobilizing agents, which are agents that can move HSCs from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood for easier collection. The HSCs collected are then manufactured to insert a functional copy of the missing or faulty gene. By delivering gene-modified HSCs back to patients, we seek to take advantage of the self-renewing capability of HSCs to enable a durable effect following a single administration, as has been seen in our commercial and development programs. Since these cells are recognized by the body as the patient’s own cells, the risks associated with using donor cells may be reduced. In addition, the ability of HSCs to differentiate into multiple different cell types has the potential to enable the delivery of gene-modified cells to different physiological systems and allow the correction of a broad range of different diseases.
Clinical validation already exists for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, or HSCT, an approach of treating a patient with a genetic disease with HSCs contributed by a healthy donor individual, thereby using HSCs that contain a functioning copy of the gene of interest. However, this approach has significant limitations, including difficulties in finding appropriate genetically matched donors and the risk of graft-versus-host disease, transplant-related rejection and mortality from these and other complications, and is therefore typically only offered on a limited basis. Furthermore, genetically modified cells can be used to express enzyme activity at supra-physiological levels, which we believe has the potential to overcome the limitations of HSCT (where enzyme expression is generally limited to normal levels) to treat some neurometabolic disorders and improve the metabolic correction in neuronal cells before irreversible degeneration occurs. Our approach is intended to address these significant limitations of HSCT.
In a pre-clinical study conducted by one of our scientific advisors and published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America, or PNAS, a sub population of gene-modified HSCs has evidenced the potential to cross the blood-brain barrier, engraft in the brain as microglia and express genes and proteins within the central nervous system, one of the important physiological systems targeted by our HSC gene therapy approach. As published in PNAS, images taken during the study show a cross-section of the brain of a mouse that was infused intravenously with HSCs, which had been genetically modified using a lentiviral vector carrying green fluorescent protein, or GFP. The GFP expression observed throughout the brain illustrates the potential of gene-modified HSCs to cross the blood-brain barrier, engraft in the brain and express the functional protein throughout the brain, thereby potentially addressing a range of diseases that affect the central nervous system. Libmeldy (OTL-200), for instance, leverages this same mechanism of action to deliver gene-modified HSCs that can cross the blood-brain barrier and deliver a therapeutic gene that can prevent neuronal degeneration. The study demonstrated widespread distribution and expression of GFP in the brain of a mouse model following intravenous administration of HSCs transduced with GFP encoding vector.
 With respect to Libmeldy (OTL-200) and each of our product candidates, our ex vivo gene therapy approach utilizes a self-inactivating, or SIN, lentiviral vector to introduce a functional copy of the missing or faulty gene into the patient’s autologous HSCs through an ex vivo process called transduction, resulting in a cellular drug product that can then be re-introduced into the patient. Unlike some other viral vectors, such as adeno-associated viral, or AAV, vectors, lentiviral vectors integrate into the chromosomes of patients’ HSCs. We believe this allows us to achieve stable integration of the functional gene into the HSCs and can lead to durable expression of the target protein by the gene-modified HSCs and their progeny after a single administration of gene therapy. In contrast, because AAV vectors rarely integrate into the genome, the transgene is not passed on to all progeny when the cell divides, resulting in rapid dilution and loss of the transgene among frequently dividing cells such as HSCs. Regarding immunogenicity, because in vivo delivery of AAV places the vector into direct contact with the immune system and most individuals harbor some type of pre-existing immunity, including neutralizing antibodies, to one or more types of AAV vector, the incoming vector can be completely inactivated by the patient’s immune system. Furthermore, there have been reports that certain high dose applications of AAV have resulted in acute and severe innate immune responses that have proved lethal. With ex vivo delivery, however, the vector is not introduced directly into the body and

vector elements are washed away in the laboratory such that there is little to no vector element left to present to the immune system. Our HSC gene therapies and product candidates are all manufactured ex vivo.
Strimvelis for adenosine deaminase severe combined immunodeficiency, or ADA-SCID, is the only gammaretroviral vector-based gene therapy in our portfolio. In March 2022, we announced that we would discontinue our investment in and seek alternatives for Strimvelis.
 The image below illustrates the steps in our approach to transform a patient’s autologous HSCs ex vivo into therapeutic product.



Initial clinical trials conducted using our product candidates utilized a fresh product formulation, resulting in a limited drug product shelf life. We market Libmeldy (OTL-200) and plan to market our current and any future product candidates, if approved, in a cryopreserved product formulation, which is designed to extend the drug product shelf life and enable the shipment of the drug product to specialized treatment centers, allowing patients to receive treatment closer to their home while leveraging more centralized manufacturing. Cryopreservation also allows us to conduct a number of quality control tests on the genetically modified HSCs prior to introducing them into the patient.
In addition, certain of our clinical-stage product candidates have been evaluated in registrational trials using drug product derived from HSCs extracted from the patients’ bone marrow. To optimize our potential product label and the number of patients that we may be able to treat, as part of any BLA or MAA submission for such product candidates, we plan to demonstrate comparability between drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from the patients’ peripheral blood and drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from the patients’ bone marrow. In cases where clinical trials were conducted using vector and/or drug product manufactured at academic centers, we plan to demonstrate comparability between vector and/or drug product manufactured by our third party commercial CDMOs with vector and drug product manufactured at such academic centers.
We are currently focused on employing our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach in two therapeutic disease areas: neurodegenerative and immunological disorders. We also have a program focused on beta thalassemia, or TDT, a blood disorder, but new investments in this program are currently limited. Data from clinical trials suggest that ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy has the potential to provide generally well-tolerated, sustainable and improved outcomes over existing standards of care for diseases in these areas. We believe that we can apply our approach beyond our current target indications to treat an even broader range of diseases.

Our strategy

We are building a leading, global, fully-integrated gene therapy company focused on transforming the lives of people affected by severe diseases. To achieve this, we are pursuing the following strategies:
 •Continue our commercialization efforts for Libmeldy (OTL-200) for treatment of eligible patients with early-onset MLD in Europe and expand geographically into new markets as regulatory approvals are obtained
 •Advance our clinical-stage product candidates towards marketing approvals, including a potential BLA submission for OTL-200 in the U.S. in mid-2023


•Leverage the power of our therapeutic approach to investigate the potential of HSC gene therapy in larger indications 
 •Invest in new technologies and innovations to continue to improve our manufacturing processes for lentiviral vector and drug product and reduce costs of goods manufactured
 •Establish end-to-end process development, manufacturing and supply chain capabilities, initially through third parties and internally over time
 •Establish a patient-centric, global commercial infrastructure, including with third parties in certain regions where we do not have a direct presence 
 •Execute a business development strategy to leverage our HSC gene therapy approach, expand geographically, accelerate time-to-market or attract disease-area expertise to optimize the value of our portfolio of product candidates or expand into new indications
 
Our pipeline

Our pipeline spans multiple therapeutic areas where the disease burden on children, families and caregivers is immense and current treatment options are limited or do not exist.
•Our programs focused on neurodegenerative disorders consist of our commercial program approved in Europe, Libmeldy (OTL-200) for MLD, two clinical proof of concept-stage programs, OTL-203 for MPS-I and OTL-201 for mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA, or MPS-IIIA, and one pre-clinical program, OTL-204 for frontotemporal dementia with progranulin mutations, or GRN-FTD. 
 •Our programs in immunological disorders consist of two pre-clinical programs, OTL-104 for Crohn’s disease with mutations in the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2, or NOD2-CD, and OTL-105 for HAE. 
 oIn July 2021, we entered into a collaboration with Pharming Group N.V., or Pharming, pursuant to which we granted Pharming worldwide rights to OTL-105. Under our agreement with Pharming, we will lead the completion of IND-enabling activities of OTL-105 and oversee its manufacturing during pre-clinical and clinical development, which will be funded by Pharming. Pharming will be responsible for clinical development, regulatory filings and commercialization of OTL-105, if approved, including associated costs.
 oWe also have a commercial product approved in Europe, Strimvelis for ADA-SCID, an advanced registrational clinical program, OTL-103 for Wiskott Aldrich syndrome, or WAS, and one clinical proof of concept-stage program, OTL-102 for X-linked chronic granulomatous disease, or X-CGD. However, in March 2022, we announced that we would discontinue our investment in and seek alternatives for these programs.
 The nature of our autologous gene therapy product candidates precludes the conduct of Phase 1 safety studies in healthy volunteers. Moreover, considering the indications our product candidates are intended to treat, which are often fatal without treatment and which are rare indications with high unmet medical need, we believe our clinical programs will generally be eligible to proceed to registration based on a single pivotal study given the bioethical considerations regarding the conduct of randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trials with gene therapies for such indications. For purposes of this Annual Report, we refer to an exploratory study, which is sometimes referred to as a Phase 1 or Phase 1/2 clinical trial, as a proof of concept trial, and a confirmatory efficacy and safety study to support submission of a potential marketing application with the applicable regulatory authorities, which is sometimes referred to as a Phase 2/3 or Phase 3 clinical trial or a pivotal trial, as a registrational trial.

Neurodegenerative Disorders
 Gene therapy for treatment of MLD
Disease overview
MLD is a rare and life-threatening inherited disease of the body’s metabolic system occurring in approximately one in every 100,000 live births in most regions of the world. Higher incidence rates are reported in geographies of higher consanguinity, such as Turkey and the Middle East. MLD is caused by a mutation in the arylsulfatase-A gene, or ARSA, that results in the accumulation of sulfatides in the brain and other areas of the body, including the liver, gallbladder, kidneys, and/or spleen. Over time, the nervous system is damaged, leading to neurological problems such as motor, behavioral and cognitive

regression, severe spasticity and seizures. Patients with MLD gradually lose the ability to move, talk, swallow, eat and see. In its late infantile form, mortality at five years from onset is estimated at 50% and 44% at 10 years for juvenile patients.
 
Limitations of current therapies
Prior to the approval of Libmeldy (OTL-200) in Europe, there were no effective treatments or approved therapies for MLD. Palliative care options involve medications for seizures and pain, antibiotics and sedatives, on a case-by-case basis, as well as physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and tube feeding or gastrostomy when patients can no longer eat without assistance. Palliative care addresses the symptoms of MLD but does not slow or reverse the progression of the underlying disease. HSCT has limited and variable efficacy in arresting disease progression and, as a result, HSCT is not considered to be a standard of care for this disease. MLD patients, their caregivers and families, and the healthcare system have faced significant burdens given the severity of the disease and the lack of effective treatments.

Our solution, Libmeldy (OTL-200) for treatment of MLD
 OTL-200 is designed as a one-time therapy that aims to correct the underlying genetic cause of MLD, offering eligible patients the potential for long-term positive effects on cognitive development and maintenance of motor function at ages at which untreated patients show severe motor and cognitive impairments. With OTL-200, a patient’s own HSCs are selected, and functional copies of the ARSA gene are inserted into the genome of the HSCs using a lentiviral vector before these genetically modified cells are infused back into the patient. The ability of the gene-corrected HSCs to migrate across the blood-brain barrier into the brain, engraft, and express the functional enzyme has the potential to persistently correct the underlying disease with a single treatment.
We obtained worldwide rights to this program through our asset purchase and license agreement with Glaxo Group Limited and GlaxoSmithKline Intellectual Property Development LTD, or, together, GSK. The clinical trials for this program have been conducted under a GSK-sponsored clinical trial authorization, which was transferred to us during the third quarter of 2018.

Libmeldy approval in Europe as Orphan Drug
 In December 2020, the European Commission granted full, or standard, marketing authorization for Libmeldy (OTL-200) (autologous CD34+ cell enriched population that contains hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells transduced ex vivo using a lentiviral vector encoding the human arylsulfatase-A (ARSA) gene) for the treatment of early-onset MLD characterized by biallelic mutations in the ARSA gene leading to a reduction of the ARSA enzymatic activity in children with (i) late infantile or early juvenile forms, without clinical manifestations of the disease, or (ii) the early juvenile form, with early clinical manifestations of the disease, who still have the ability to walk independently and before the onset of cognitive decline.
 Libmeldy has received orphan drug designation from the EMA for the treatment of MLD and orphan drug status was maintained at the time of approval. We are continuing to follow patients in the clinical development program for up to 15 years as a post-marketing commitment, and data will be presented to regulators at agreed time points in order to further characterize the long-term efficacy and safety of Libmeldy, particularly in the early symptomatic early juvenile population.

Data Supporting the Clinical Profile of Libmeldy
The European Commission (EC) approval is supported by clinical studies of Libmeldy in both pre- and early- symptomatic, early-onset MLD patients. Early-onset MLD encompasses the disease variants traditionally referred to as late infantile, or LI, and early juvenile, or EJ.
 Clinical efficacy supporting EC approval was based on the integrated analysis of results from 29 patients with early-onset MLD who were all treated with Libmeldy:
 •20 patients were treated in a clinical study (median follow-up of 4 years); 9 patients were treated in expanded access programs (median follow-up of 1.5 years) 
 •16 patients had a diagnosis of LI MLD; 13 had a diagnosis of EJ MLD
 •At the time of treatment, 20 patients were deemed pre-symptomatic; 9 were deemed early-symptomatic
 Clinical safety was evaluated in 35 patients with early-onset MLD:
 •29 patients from the efficacy analysis supporting EC approval (described above)
 •6 additional patients treated in another clinical study of Libmeldy



Co-primary endpoints
 The co-primary endpoints of the integrated efficacy analysis were Gross Motor Function Measure, or GMFM, total score and ARSA activity, both evaluated at two years post-treatment. Results of this analysis indicate that a single-dose intravenous administration of Libmeldy is effective in modifying the disease course of early-onset MLD in most patients.
 Pre-symptomatic LI and EJ patients treated with Libmeldy experienced significantly less deterioration in motor function at two years and three years post-treatment, as measured by GMFM total score, compared to age and disease subtype-matched untreated patients (p≤0.008). The mean difference between treated pre-symptomatic LI patients and age-matched untreated LI patients was 71.0% at year 2 and 79.8% at year 3. Similarly, the mean difference between treated pre-symptomatic EJ patients and age-matched untreated EJ patients was 52.4% at year 2 and 74.9% at year 3. Although not statistically significant, a clear difference in GMFM total score was also noted between treated early-symptomatic EJ patients and age-matched untreated EJ patients (28.7% at year 2; p=0.350 and 43.9% at year 3; p=0.054).
 A statistically significant increase in ARSA activity in peripheral blood mononuclear cells was observed at 2 years post-treatment compared to pre-treatment in both pre-symptomatic patients (20.0-fold increase; p<0.001) and early-symptomatic patients (4.2-fold increase; p=0.004).
 At the time of the integrated data analysis, all treated LI patients were alive with a follow-up post-treatment of up to 7.5 years and 10 out of 13 treated EJ patients were alive with a follow-up post-treatment of up to 6.5 years. No treatment-related mortality has been reported in patients treated with Libmeldy.
 
Key secondary endpoints
 For EJ patients who were early-symptomatic when treated with Libmeldy, meaningful effects on motor development were demonstrated when these patients were treated before entering the rapidly progressive phase of the disease (IQ≥85 and Gross Motor Function Classification, or GMFC, ≤1). By 4 years post-disease onset, an estimated 62.5% of treated, early-symptomatic EJ MLD patients survived and maintained locomotion and ability to sit without support compared with 26.3% of untreated early-symptomatic EJ MLD patients, representing a delay in disease progression following treatment with Libmeldy.
 A secondary efficacy endpoint that measured cognitive and language abilities as quantified by Intelligence Quotient/Development Quotient, or IQ/DQ, found in the treated LI subgroup, 12 out of 15 assessed patients had a fairly constant IQ/DQ, within the normal range (IQ/DQ score of 100 +/- SD of 15) throughout follow-up. All but two of these patients (i.e., one pre-symptomatic and one early-symptomatic) remained above the threshold of severe mental disability (IQ/DQ>55) at chronological ages at which all 14 untreated comparator LI patients showed evidence of severe cognitive impairment, which is defined as IQ/DQ below 55 and close to zero. Of the 10 surviving EJ patients, all 4 pre-symptomatic patients and 4 out of 6 early-symptomatic patients showed normal IQ/DQ throughout follow-up. In contrast, 11 out of 12 untreated EJ patients showed evidence of severe cognitive impairment during follow-up.
 
Clinical trial with cryopreserved drug formulation
 The cryopreserved formulation of OTL-200 is being studied in a clinical trial of pediatric patients with pre-symptomatic LI, or pre- to early-symptomatic EJ in Milan, Italy.
 The primary goal of this clinical trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-200 in early-onset MLD patients, as measured by improvement in gross motor function and ARSA activity levels in the patients’ blood cells as well as overall survival. Secondary goals for this clinical trial include assessment of cognitive function through IQ.
Ten patients were treated in this trial between April 2017 and April 2020. Data, which included six of these ten patients, was presented at WORLD Symposium in 2021. The median duration of follow up was 0.87 years as of November 2019. Administration was generally well tolerated in all patients, and for those with enough follow-up post-treatment, preliminary evidence of engraftment and restoration of ARSA activity in peripheral blood to supraphysiological levels and in cerebral spinal fluid, or CSF, to normal levels has been shown. The short-term safety profile was comparable between patients treated with the fresh formulation.
 
Data Supporting Safety Profile of Libmeldy
 The safety of Libmeldy was evaluated in 35 patients with MLD.
The median duration of follow-up in the integrated safety data set, which included 29 patients treated with the fresh (investigational) formulation was 4.51 years. Three patients died and a total of 26 patients remained in the follow-up phase. The median duration of follow-up in the 6 patients treated with the cryopreserved (commercial) formulation was 0.87 years.


All treated LI patients were alive with a follow-up post-treatment of up to 7.5 years, and 10 out of 13 treated EJ patients were alive with a follow-up post-treatment of up to 6.5 years. No treatment-related mortality has been reported in patients treated with Libmeldy.
 The most common adverse reaction attributed to Libmeldy was presence of anti-ARSA antibodies, or AAA. Five events of AAA were observed in four out of 35 patients and were related to treatment. Antibody titers were generally low and resolved either spontaneously or after a short course of rituximab. In all patients with positive AAA test results, no negative effects were observed in the post-treatment ARSA activity of peripheral blood or bone marrow cellular sub populations nor in the ARSA activity within the cerebrospinal fluid. No impact on the clinical efficacy or safety outcomes were observed.in any of the subjects who reported AAA. In addition to the risk associated with the gene therapy, treatment with Libmeldy is preceded by other medical interventions, namely bone marrow harvest or peripheral blood mobilization and apheresis, followed by myeloablative conditioning, which carry their own risks. During the clinical studies, the safety profiles of these interventions were consistent with their known safety and tolerability.
 A total of 39 patients have been treated as part of the clinical development program between April 2010 and April 2020. An integrated data analysis comparing 39 treated patients to a natural history study cohort was presented at WORLD Symposium in 2023. Consistent with previously published results (Fumagalli et al Lancet 2022), these results combining the original 29 subjects with the 10 treated patients from the study evaluating the cryopreserved formulation, with longer follow-up (median 6.15 years, max 11.03 years), show a continued favorable benefit-risk profile for arsa-cel in pre-symptomatic LI and EJ and early-symptomatic EJ MLD. Arsa-cel was generally well tolerated with no treatment-related SAEs or treatment-related deaths.
 For more details, please see the Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, for Libmeldy.
 
OTL-200 development in the U.S.
 OTL-200 has received orphan drug designation for the treatment of MLD as well as Rare Pediatric Disease designation. In late 2020, the FDA cleared our IND application for OTL-200 in the U.S., and in January 2021, FDA granted regenerative medicine advanced therapy, or RMAT, designation for OTL-200. Based on feedback received from the FDA, we are preparing for a BLA filing for OTL-200 in pre-symptomatic, early-onset MLD patients, expected in mid-2023, using data from existing OTL-200 patients. This approach and timeline are subject to the successful completion of activities remaining in advance of a pre-BLA meeting with the FDA, scheduled for the second quarter of 2023.
 
Gene therapy for treatment of MPS-IH
 Disease overview
Mucopolysaccharidosis type I is a lysosomal storage disease caused by a deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-L-iduronidase, or IDUA. Inherited deficiency of IDUA is responsible for MPS-I. Without treatment, clinical manifestations of this severe disease include skeletal abnormalities with severe orthopedic manifestations, hepatosplenomegaly, neurodevelopmental decline, sight and hearing disturbances, cardiovascular and respiratory problems leading to death in early childhood. IDUA deficiency can result in a wide range of clinical severity, with three major recognized clinical entities: (1) Hurler, or MPS-IH, (2) Scheie, or MPS-IS (3) and Hurler-Scheie, or MPS-IH/S, syndromes. MPS-IH is the most severe form of MPS-I.
 The median age of diagnosis for MPS-IH is 12 months, and most affected children are diagnosed before 18 months of age. Infants affected by MPS-IH may appear normal at birth, but progress to develop symptoms such as kyphosis of the spine, and inguinal or umbilical hernias in the first six months, developing the characteristic somatic phenotype over the first few years of life.
The approximate incidence of MPS-I is of one in 100,000 live births. Approximately 60 percent of children born with MPS-I have MPS-IH.
 
Limitations of current therapies
Allogeneic-HSCT, or allo-HSCT, which is commonly accompanied by pre- and peri-transplant enzyme replacement therapy, or ERT, from diagnosis to engraftment, has been established as the standard of care for MPS-IH patients with preserved cognition. The recommendation of allo-HSCT as the standard of care for MPS-IH patients is endorsed by the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the American Society for Transplantation and Cellular Therapy.
 Despite its established position in treatment algorithms, allogeneic-HSCT can result in alloreactive complications, including and graft versus host disease or death, particularly when the degree of matching between graft donor and recipient is poor. Additionally, there remains a significant disease burden in those treated, even if treated early in life, including severely

debilitating cognitive, neurological, growth, orthopedic, cardiac, respiratory and ophthalmic manifestations, all of which are reported during long-term post-HSCT follow-up.

Our solution, OTL-203 for treatment of MPS-IH
 Ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy strategies aimed at correcting the genetic defect in patients could represent a significant improvement for the treatment of MPS-I, notably MPS-IH, the most severe and prevalent phenotype with the highest unmet medical need, when compared to current treatments.
OTL-203 is a single administration, gene therapy product candidate consisting of autologous CD34+ enriched HSPCs, derived from mobilized peripheral blood, genetically modified ex vivo with the lentiviral vector encoding for the IDUA complementary DNA, or cDNA. It is being developed as a cryopreserved formulation. Ex vivo autologous gene therapies, such as OTL-203, are designed to correct the genetic defect in patients’ own HSCs and their progeny by addition of functional cDNA. The OTL-203 mechanism of action, or MOA, addresses the disease pathophysiology by restoring enzymatic IDUA expression in peripheral and central body compartments as well as restoring microglia homeostasis in the central nervous system, or CNS, to confer neuroprotective effects against the neurotoxic effects of glycosaminoglycan, or GAG, accumulation in affected cells.
The achievement of long-term sustained correction of the manifestations of MPS-IH occurs via local secretion of functional IDUA enzyme, which facilitates the efficient clearance of GAGs. This MoA is based on the local release of IDUA enzyme from genetically corrected cells containing functional copies of the IDUAgene into the extracellular space, which is in turn taken up by neighboring cells in a process referred to as “cross-correction.” Animal models have shown that genetically modified cells are able to cross the blood brain barrier and can provide cross-correction within the CNS. Engraftment of these cells within the CNS gives rise to monocyte-derived microglia-like cells that secrete the functional IDUA enzyme, which is taken up by neuronal and glial cells via cross-correction.
One way in which OTL-203 differs from allo-HSCT is the ability of the transduced autologous cells to produce supraphysiological levels of IDUA enzyme in peripheral compartments and increased IDUA levels in central compartments in both non-clinical and clinical settings. This difference may be important because multivariate analyses have consistently identified higher post-HSCT IDUA levels as predictors of outcomes with lower residual disease burden in multiple organ systems, including skeletal, ophthalmic, cardiac, auditory and respiratory. It is therefore hypothesized that the presence of supraphysiological levels of IDUA enzyme in peripheral compartments may help overcome the limitations of allo-HSCT by enhancing the cross-correction process, by enabling presence of greater quantities of available enzyme in difficult-to-reach protected (i.e., brain) or avascular compartments (i.e., eye and joint tissue) and better enable clearance of GAGs in hard-to-reach tissues.
In addition, OTL-203 has the potential to overcome safety issues associated with the current standard of care. Compared to allogeneic transplantation, which is the current standard of care for MPS-IH treatment, the autologous nature of OTL-203 is associated with a significantly reduced transplant-related morbidity and mortality and avoidance of graft versus host (both acute and chronic) and immune mediated graft rejection.
 We have obtained worldwide development and commercialization rights to OTL-203 from Telethon Foundation and San Raffaele Hospital.
 OTL-203 has received orphan drug and PRIME designation from the EMA as well as orphan drug designation and rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA for the treatment of MPS-I.

Ongoing clinical trials
 OTL-203 is currently being investigated in an ongoing, academic-sponsored clinical trial at the San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Italy to establish proof of concept. The study is a prospective, single dose, single center, non-randomized, open label study involving a single administration of OTL-203 in eight patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS-IH. The study is fully enrolled using a cryopreserved formulation of OTL-203.
The patients evaluated in this trial include pediatric MPS-IH patients from 14 to 34 months of age at the time of treatment and will be followed for at least five years post-treatment in the context of the proof of concept study and then continue to be evaluated in a long-term follow-up study.
In September 2022, we announced the presentation of the interim clinical results from the ongoing academic-sponsored clinical trial at the San Raffaele Hospital. For this presentation’s last follow up of all patients (range: 24 and 36 months), interim data supporting clinical proof-of-concept illustrated that treatment with OTL-203 was generally well-tolerated with a safety profile consistent with the selected conditioning regimen. IDUA antibodies present prior to gene therapy as a result of

ERT were not seen in any patient within three months following treatment. In addition, ERT was discontinued at least three weeks prior to any patient receiving gene therapy treatment, and no patients had re-started ERT post-treatment.
 In December 2022 we received IND clearance of OTL-203 from the FDA, which allows us to initiate a global registrational study in MPS-IH. We plan to initiate the study, which will include centers across the US and Europe, in the second half of 2023.
The study will be a multi-center, randomized, active controlled clinical trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of OTL-203 in patients with MPS-IH compared to standard of care with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant. A total of 40 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS-IH who meet the study inclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to receive either OTL-203 or allogeneic HSCT. The study is powered to demonstrate superiority of OTL-203 over allo-HSCT.
 Gene therapy for treatment of MPS-IIIA
Disease overviews
 MPS-IIIA, also known as Sanfilippo syndrome type A, is a life-threatening metabolic disease that causes accumulation of glycosaminoglycan in cells, tissues and organs, particularly in the brain. Within the first years after birth, MPS-IIIA and MPS-IIIB patients begin to experience progressive neurodevelopmental delay and decline, including speech delay and eventual loss of language, behavioral disturbances and potentially severe dementia. Ultimately, most patients with MPS-IIIA progress to a vegetative state. Life expectancy for patients with MPS-IIIA is between 10 to 25 years.
The incidence of MPS-IIIA is currently estimated to be one in 100,000 live births per year.
Limitations of current therapies
Currently, there are no effective treatments or approved therapies for MPS-IIIA. Palliative care options involve medications for seizures and pain, antibiotics and sedatives, on a case-by-case basis, as well as physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and tube feeding or gastrostomy when patients can no longer eat without assistance. Palliative care addresses the symptoms of MPS-IIIA but does not slow or reverse the progression of the underlying disease. Systemic ERT is not an approved treatment option and HSCT is not considered to be an effective treatment option for these diseases. The severity of symptoms and lack of an effective treatment option to manage these symptoms is a significant burden to MPS-IIIA patients, their caregivers and families and healthcare systems.
Our solutions, OTL-201 for treatment of MPS-IIIA
 We are developing OTL-201 as an ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy for treatment of patients with MPS-IIIA. We believe pre-clinical studies in mice have shown that ex vivo autologous gene therapy has the potential to address the neurological manifestations of MPS-IIIA. We have obtained worldwide development and commercialization rights to OTL-201 from The University of Manchester.
OTL-201 has received orphan drug designation from the EMA and FDA for the treatment of MPS-IIIA and has received rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA.
Proof of concept trial in MPS-IIIA
We are supporting a proof-of-concept trial for the treatment of MPS-IIIA, which started enrollment in January 2020. The trial, which is being conducted by the Royal Manchester Children’s Hospital and sponsored by the Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust, completed enrollment in 2021 with the fifth patient treated in September 2021.
Early clinical findings, including the first neurocognitive results, from the proof-of-concept trial were presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting in December 2022 and at the WORLD Symposium in February 2023. The data, which encompassed follow-up ranging from 9 to 24 months, showed robust, prompt, sustained, multi-lineage engraftment of genetically modified cells. Supraphysiological levels of SGSH enzyme were seen in leukocytes, plasma and CSF and rapid and reduction of substrate (glycosaminoglycans, GAGs) observed in all compartments.
Early neurocognitive outcomes also indicated that since receiving OTL-201, four out of five patients showed gain of cognitive skills in line with development in healthy children. The oldest patient at last follow up has maintained this normal cognitive development since treatment, despite reaching a chronological age where cognition is observed to decline in natural history patients, showing improvement from this comparator. Three additional patients are currently within the normal development quotient (DQ) range at 9 to 18 months post-treatment but require longer follow-up to assess outcomes.
 Treatment with OTL-201 was generally well-tolerated in the initial study population. Of the six serious adverse events (SAEs) reported to date, four were determined to be due to conditioning or leukapheresis and one was related to background

disease. One patient had delayed platelet engraftment until day 52 post-treatment, likely due to Cytomegalovirus infection around the time of infusion.
 
Research program in FTD
Disease overview
Frontotemporal Dementia, or FTD, is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer Disease in people under the age of 65. FTD is due to the atrophy of the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain. The disease manifests with progressive changes in behavior and personality, starting with symptoms such as decline in social and personal interactions, depression, apathy, emotional blunting, disinhibition and language disorders, and then progressing to general cognitive impairment at a later stage. In ~5% of patients, FTD is caused by mutations in one copy (haploinsufficiency) of the gene that codes for progranulin, or GRN. GRN is a neurotrophic, anti-inflammatory factor that is produced and secreted among others by specialized cells in the brain called microglia cells. GRN produced by microglia cells can be taken up by neighboring neurons, helping them to be healthy and functional. Since GRN-FTD patients’ cells do not produce enough GRN, brain inflammation develops with time and neurons become progressively dysfunctional until they eventually die, leading to brain atrophy and the aforementioned symptoms.
We believe there are currently up to 2,500 people affected by GRN-FTD in Europe and the U.S., with approximately 800 new cases per year.
 Limitations of current therapies
There are no treatments available for FTD and death occurs six to nine years after onset.
 Our solution, OTL-204 for treatment of FTD
 OTL-204 is an ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy being developed to replace the defective microglia cells in the brain of GRN-FTD patients with genetically modified microglia cells that produce and secrete a corrective amount of GRN. These cells develop naturally from HSCs, which are collected from the patient and modified by using a viral vector that brings a functional copy of the GRN gene. When they are infused in the patient, the genetically modified HSCs naturally reach the brain and become resident microglia cells. OTL-204 is being developed in partnership with Professor Alessandra Biffi at the University of Padua in Italy. As part of the collaboration, we initiated a sponsored research agreement with the University of Padua and obtained an exclusive option with Boston Children’s Hospital to develop and exclusively license the program.
 Pre-clinical development of OTL-204
 Preliminary in vitro data obtained in 2020 have demonstrated that human cell lines and mouse HSCs can be efficiently transduced to produce GRN. GRN is then secreted in the culture medium and can be taken up by other types of cells that do not produce GRN themselves.
 Preliminary in vivo data from the pre-clinical proof-of-concept study showed that murine GRN-/- HSPCs, transduced with an LV expressing progranulin under the control of a novel promoter, are able to engraft and repopulate the brain myeloid compartment of FTD mice and to locally deliver the GRN enzyme.
 Immunological Disorders
Research program in NOD2-Crohn’s Disease
Disease overview
Crohn’s Disease, or CD, is a form of Inflammatory Bowel Disease, or IBD, a condition affecting the gastrointestinal tract caused by an uncontrolled and chronic inflammatory process directed against intestinal bacteria. Mutations in a number of genes are known to confer susceptibility to the risk of CD, and among these the NOD2 gene (nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 2) is known to be the most common genetic factor, with 20-40% of Crohn’s patients carrying mutations causing defective NOD2 activity. NOD2 encodes a cell receptor which controls bacterial elimination by innate immune cells such as macrophages through recognition of bacterial peptide (MDP) and induction of a pro-inflammatory immune response. NOD2 deficiency results in an impaired detection and clearance of bacteria penetrating the gut during gastrointestinal infection, creating an unchecked and relapsing inflammation within the intestinal tissues characterized by intestinal granuloma formation. This leads to recurrent clinical symptoms of chronic abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, fatigue, malnutrition and for some patients, more severe intestinal damage requiring surgical resection. NOD2-CD patients typically present with more severe symptoms and are reported to be more refractory to existing therapies.


The incidence of CD is high compared to our other indications, with estimates of 100 to 200 patients per million in Europe and North America. Epidemiological studies suggest NOD2 genetic variants causing functional defects are associated with 7 to 10% of all cases of CD, with up to 200,000 patients in the U.S. and Europe with two NOD2 mutated alleles.
 Limitations of current therapies
Current clinical management for Crohn’s disease includes use of immune-suppressive medications, biological agents such as anti-TNF, steroids and surgical resection. There is currently no cure for Crohn's disease, and long-term, effective treatment options are limited. Several clinical trials have evaluated autologous HSCT in Crohn’s disease, although with limited success. There remains a need for therapeutic modalities that target underlying causes of Crohn’s disease to achieve effective amelioration of symptoms and disease remission.
 Our solution, OTL-104 for treatment of NOD2-CD
 We are developing OTL-104 to evaluate its therapeutic efficacy as an ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy to treat patients with NOD2-CD through a single administration. As the pathogenesis of NOD2-CD is associated with the function of cells of the hematopoietic system, ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy may therefore be used to restore NOD2 function to immune cells such as tissue resident macrophages within the gastrointestinal tract. Our OTL-104 program is being designed to introduce the NOD2 gene into cells of the hematopoietic system by lentiviral transduction of a patient’s own blood or bone marrow derived HSCs, and the gene-modified cells can then be infused back into the patient. Clinical observations in the allogeneic transplant setting, where HSCT has resulted in the clinical reversion of Crohn’s Disease and other monogenic forms of IBD, supports the scientific rationale and mode of action of OTL-104. We own patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions and all other intellectual property rights associated with the OTL-104 program.
Pre-clinical development of OTL-104
 OTL-104 pre-clinical work has shown that restoration of NOD2 gene expression in murine and human stem cells can rescue a defective myeloid immune response to MDP. NOD2 defective inflammatory functions in primary human myeloid cells can be restored by both lentiviral and gene editing approaches. The OTL-104 lentiviral vector is designed to express NOD2 under the chimeric CathepsinG/cFES promoter to deliver myeloid directed transgene expression. Pre-clinical studies to evaluate the safety of this approach show that NOD2-LV gene modification of human CD34+stem cells and murine lineage negative stem cells does not affect HSC engraftment or immune subset development and differentiation following transplantation into NSG or NOD2-KO mice, respectively. Transplantation of NOD2-LV gene modified murine stem cells further demonstrates that HSC derived cells can efficiently migrate and reconstitute the myeloid cell compartments of intestinal tissue, restoring a normal biodistribution of NOD2 expression within the gut.
 Pre-clinical proof-of-concept studies include in vivo colitis disease modeling and a non-interventional clinical research study using NOD2-genetically defined patients with Crohn’s Disease. We have generated in vivo evidence that defective monocyte functions in NOD2-KO mice can be corrected by OTL-104 gene therapy, restoring NOD2-dependent systemic cytokine responses and innate immune cell mobilization. In vitro, myeloid cells differentiated from CD34+ cells obtained from peripheral blood of genetically characterized NOD2 deficient CD patients, are refractory to MDP stimulation and unable to generate a normal cytokine response profile. LV transduction of NOD2-deficient patient cells restores MDP-induced cytokine responses to levels comparable to those observed in monocytes derived from CD34+ cells from healthy donors, correcting a NOD2-defective phenotype. Orchard’s OTL-104 program is currently under development towards IND-/ CTA- enabling toxicology / biodistribution studies.
 Other programs
 In March 2022, we announced that we would discontinue our investment in and seek alternatives for Strimvelis, OTL-103 for treatment of WAS and OTL-102 for treatment of X-CGD.
 Future applications of our ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach
We believe that our versatile ex vivo autologous HSC gene therapy approach has the potential to deliver promising gene therapies to patients across a broad range of diseases. Although our near-term focus is on delivering our commercial and clinical-stage gene therapies to patients suffering from several rare diseases described above, we believe we can leverage our significant research and development experience and partnerships with academic institutions to identify other diseases in our target areas, including neurodegenerative, immunological and blood disorders, where ex vivo gene therapy may have a comparably higher probability of success as compared to other approaches our mid- to long-term strategy is to leverage our HSC gene therapy approach in additional larger indications, seeking development partnerships as the programs advance

towards the clinic. One partnership already established in 2021 is our collaboration with Pharming on OTL-105, as referenced above.
 Our regulatory strategy
The nature of our autologous gene therapy product candidates precludes the conduct of Phase 1 safety studies in healthy volunteers. Moreover, considering the indications our product candidates are intended to treat, which are often fatal without treatment and which are rare indications with high unmet medical need, we believe our clinical programs will generally be eligible to proceed to registration based on a single pivotal study given the bioethical considerations regarding the conduct of randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled clinical trials with gene therapies for such indications. Both the FDA and EMA provide expedited pathways for the development of drug product candidates for the treatment of rare diseases, particularly life-threatening diseases with high unmet medical need. Such drug product candidates may be eligible to proceed to registration following one or more clinical trials in a limited patient population, following review of the trial’s design, endpoints and clinical data by the applicable regulatory agencies. These determinations are based on the applicable regulatory agency’s scientific judgment and these determinations may differ in the United States and the European Union.
In some cases applicable regulatory agency may require us to perform analytical studies or conduct additional clinical trials to support analytical comparability of drug product, for example by demonstrating comparability of drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from a patient’s mobilized peripheral blood and drug product manufactured using HSCs derived from a patient’s bone marrow and/or comparability of drug product that has been cryopreserved and fresh drug product. For the purposes of this Annual Report we refer to these clinical trials as supportive clinical trials. In addition, certain of our product candidates may be evaluated in clinical trials for which clinical data is not intended to be pooled with data from our registrational trials for the purposes of a regulatory submission but will be submitted to the applicable regulatory agencies for informational purposes. For the purposes of this Annual Report we refer to these trials as additional clinical trials. In addition, in some cases patients may be ineligible for participation in our clinical trials and may receive treatment under a compassionate use program or an expanded access program. We expect that the available safety and efficacy results from all these trials would be included in any regulatory submission we may submit, and the applicable regulatory agency with respect to each clinical program will make a determination as to whether the available data is sufficient to support a regulatory submission.
Manufacturing
The diseases we are targeting affect patients across the world. Therefore, we are implementing plans to enhance our partnerships with CDMOs and leverage technologies that will allow us to deliver our gene therapies globally.
Global supply network with experienced CDMOs
We currently partner with a network of experienced CDMOs, including AGC Biologics S.p.A. (formerly MolMed S.p.A.) and Oxford BioMedica, for the supply of our vectors and drug products, including Libmeldy. We have established relationships with commercial CDMO partners with the resources and capacity to meet our clinical and existing and expected initial commercial needs. Our CDMO partners also provide us with access to their state-of-the art manufacturing technologies.
Manufacturing efficiencies and scalability
We are investing in human capital and advancing manufacturing technologies for HSC-based autologous ex vivo gene therapies. We have licensed lentiviral vector stable cell line technologies from GSK, completed transduction enhancer screening processes, established a vector process development lab at a Catapult Network facility in the UK, and are in the process of building cell therapy and analytical development capabilities at our London, UK global headquarters. We seek to enhance our product and process understanding while actively exploring and developing innovative technologies for vector and drug product manufacturing to improve the efficiency and scalability of manufacturing processes with an ultimate goal to reliably manufacture high quality products for rare diseases and larger indications at lower cost. For example, we have identified and validated several transduction enhancing compounds in order to facilitate lentiviral vector entry into HSCs, showing a greater than 50% reduction in vector requirements. We continue to invest in our people to support the commercialization and life cycle management of our pipeline products.
Cryopreservation of our gene therapy programs
Cryopreservation of gene-modified cells is a key component of our strategy to deliver innovative, potentially curative gene therapies to patients worldwide. We have developed cryopreserved formulations of our OTL-200 program and expect to demonstrate comparability of our cryopreserved formulations to earlier manufactured fresh formulations in support of future

submissions for marketing approval in the United States and Europe. Our programs in OTL-203 and OTL-201 have already started or will start with cryopreserved formulations. We plan to establish cryopreserved product formulations as the standard for all of our future gene therapy candidates.
In the cryopreservation process, a patient’s gene-modified HSCs are frozen at extremely low temperatures and then stored to allow quality control testing and release to be performed before introducing the gene-modified cells back into the patient. Our cryopreserved formulations are expected to have shelf-lives of months to years, enabling us to potentially distribute our products and product candidates from a few centralized manufacturing facilities to geographically dispersed treatment sites. Our ability to ultimately distribute our product candidates globally will facilitate access of the therapies to patients and reduce the logistical burden on patients and their families.
Commercial operations
 We have launched Libmeldy (OTL-200) for the treatment of early-onset MLD following receipt of full, or standard, marketing approval from the European Commission in December 2020. We have secured agreements with several major European markets, including the U.K., Italy, Germany and Sweden, to enable access and reimbursement for all eligible patients with MLD. In addition, we have secured the renewal of the early access program in France, under which the Company receives reimbursement for the treatment of any eligible patient with MLD. We have recognized revenue from commercial treatments from markets with reimbursement agreements, early access mechanisms, treatment abroad programs and European cross-border (S2) pathways. Subject to approval of OTL-200 by the FDA, we also plan to put in place commercial operations and treatment centers in the U.S.
We are building our commercial capabilities by employing individuals with broad experience in quality assurance and compliance, medical education, marketing, supply chain, sales, public policy, patient services, market access and product reimbursement. We will need to expand these capabilities as we continue to implement appropriate quality systems, compliance policies, systems and procedures, as well as internal systems and infrastructure in order to support our supply chain, qualify and train additional treatment centers, establish patient-focused programs, educate healthcare professionals, and secure reimbursement. The timing and conduct of these commercial activities will be dependent upon regulatory approvals and on agreements we have made or may make in the future with strategic collaborators.
As part of the commercialization process, we are engaged in discussions with stakeholders across the healthcare system, including public and private payors, patient advocates and organizations, and healthcare providers, to drive more timely patient identification through education, newborn screening, and diagnostic initiatives and to explore new payment models that we hope will enable broader patient access. We have initiated over a dozen newborn screening studies in Europe, the Middle East and the U.S., six of which are actively screening. To date, there have been three genetically confirmed cases of MLD after screening of approximately 96,000 newborns globally. One of these cases has been assessed clinically and referred for treatment with Libmeldy with the other two more recently identified patients pending clinical assessment.
 We are engaging with European country- and regional-level payment authorities to negotiate further reimbursement and access for Libmeldy.
 Intellectual property and barriers to entry
Our commercial success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect commercially important and proprietary aspects of our business, defend and enforce our intellectual property rights, preserve the confidentiality of our know-how and trade secrets, and operate without infringing, misappropriating and otherwise violating valid and enforceable intellectual property rights of others. In particular, we strive to protect the proprietary aspects of our business and to develop barriers to entry that we believe are important to the development and commercialization of our gene therapies. For example, where appropriate, we develop, or acquire exclusive rights to, clinical data, patents, know-how and trade secrets associated with each of our products and product candidates. However, we do not own any patents or patent applications that cover Libmeldy or any of our lead product candidates. We cannot guarantee that patents will issue from any of existing patent applications or from any patent applications that we or our licensors may file in the future, nor can we guarantee that any patents that may issue in the future from such patent applications will be commercially useful in protecting our products and product candidates. In addition, we plan to rely on regulatory protection based on orphan drug exclusivities, data exclusivities and market exclusivities. See “—Government regulation” for additional information.
We currently rely primarily on know-how and trade secret protection for aspects of our proprietary technologies that we or our licensors believe are not amenable to or appropriate for patent protection, including, for example, clinical data and production information for Libmeldy, Strimvelis and each of our product candidates. Nonetheless, know-how and trade secrets can be difficult to protect. Although we take steps to protect our know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary information, including restricting access to our premises and our confidential information, as well as entering into agreements with our employees, consultants, advisors and potential collaborators, third parties may independently develop the same or

similar know-how, trade secrets or proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to such know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary information or such know-how, trade secrets or other proprietary information may otherwise become known. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that our confidentiality agreements will provide meaningful protection or that they will not be breached, and we may not have an adequate remedy for any such breach. As a result, we may be unable to meaningfully protect our know-how, trade secrets and other proprietary information.
In addition, with regard to patent protection, the scope of coverage being sought in a patent application may be reduced significantly before a patent is issued, and even after issuance the scope of coverage may be challenged. As a result, we cannot guarantee that any of our product candidates will be protectable or remain protected by enforceable patents. We cannot predict whether the patent applications we are currently pursuing will issue as patents in any particular jurisdiction or whether the claims of any issued patents will provide sufficient proprietary protection from competitors. Any patents that we hold may be challenged, circumvented or invalidated by third parties.
With regards to OTL-200 and as discussed in detail in “—License agreements”, we have exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable licenses pursuant to our asset purchase and license agreement with GSK, or the GSK Agreement, and the R&D Agreement to anonymized patient-level data arising from the clinical trials of OTL-200 and know-how, including other clinical data and production information relating to OTL-200.
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we are seeking patent protection for our product candidates, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the term of a patent may be lengthened by a patent term adjustment to accommodate for administrative delays caused at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, or may be shortened if another patent has a terminal disclaimer with an earlier expiration date. Furthermore, in the United States, the term of a patent covering an FDA-approved drug may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments as compensation for the loss of patent term during the FDA regulatory review process. The period of extension may be up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent but cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent among those eligible for an extension may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and in certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if we obtain any additional issued U.S. patents covering one of our present or future product candidates, and if such product candidate receives FDA approval, we expect to apply for a patent term extension, if available, to extend the term of the patent covering such approved product candidate. We also expect to seek patent term extensions in any jurisdictions where they are available, but there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities, including the FDA, will agree with our assessment of whether such an extension should be granted, and even if granted, they may disagree with our assessment of the appropriate length of such an extension.
License agreements
GSK asset purchase and license agreement
In April 2018, we entered into the GSK Agreement, pursuant to which GSK transferred its portfolio of approved and investigational rare disease gene therapies to us, which included Strimvelis and OTL-200 for MLD, among other programs. GSK also simultaneously novated to us their R&D Agreement with Telethon-OSR.
 Under the GSK Agreement, we are subject to certain diligence obligations to develop and advance certain of the acquired product candidates. For example, we were required to use best endeavors to file an MAA for OTL-200 for MLD in either Europe or a BLA for MLD in the United States and to subsequently use commercially reasonable efforts to file an MAA or BLA, as applicable, in the other jurisdiction and to market, sell and promote OTL-200 in such jurisdictions. In December 2020, we received full, or standard, marketing authorization for Libmeldy in the European Union as well as the United Kingdom, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway.
 We are also required to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a priority review voucher, or PRV, from the FDA for certain programs, including OTL-200, and to transfer the first such PRV to GSK. GSK also has an option to acquire at a defined price any PRVs granted to us thereafter for certain programs. In the event that GSK does not exercise this option with respect to any PRV, we may sell the PRV to a third party and must share any proceeds in excess of a specified sale price equally with GSK.
Under the GSK Agreement we are also obligated to pay non-refundable royalties and milestone payments in relation to the gene therapy programs acquired. For example, for Libmeldy, we pay a tiered royalty rate at percentages from the mid-teens to the low twenties. These royalties owed to GSK are in addition to any royalties owed to other third parties under various license agreements for the GSK programs. In aggregate, we may pay up to £90.0 million in milestone payments upon achievement of certain sales milestones. Our royalty obligations with respect to OTL-200 may be deferred for a certain

period in the interest of prioritizing available capital to develop each product. Our royalty obligations are subject to reduction on a product-by-product basis in the event of market control by biosimilars and will expire in April 2048.
We may terminate our development or commercialization activities of any of the programs under the GSK Agreement upon the occurrence of a serious adverse event, or SAE, if we believe such program poses a safety risk to patients and in certain additional situations. GSK may require us to grant a third party a non-exclusive license under the intellectual property we have acquired from GSK under the GSK Agreement if we materially breach our obligations to use best endeavors or commercially reasonable efforts, as applicable, to develop and commercialize the acquired programs and fail to develop and implement a mutually agreeable plan to cure such material breach within a specified time period. The foregoing hypothetical license would only continue until such time as we cured our material breach, and we would be required to pay GSK all amounts we received from the third party in connection with such license.
Telethon-OSR research and development collaboration and license agreement
In April 2018, in connection with our entering into the GSK Agreement, we entered into a deed of novation with GSK, Telethon Foundation and San Raffaele Hospital, together referred to as Telethon-OSR, pursuant to which we acquired and assumed all of GSK’s rights and obligations under the R&D Agreement with Telethon-OSR for the research, development and commercialization of ex vivo HSC gene therapies for certain programs, including OTL-200 and Strimvelis.
 Pursuant to the R&D Agreement, Telethon-OSR granted to GSK an exclusive, worldwide, sublicensable license under certain intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize ex vivo gene therapy products for the treatment of ADA-SCID. In addition, Telethon-OSR had granted to GSK an exclusive option for an exclusive, sublicensable, worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights to develop and commercialize certain vectors and gene therapy products from disease-specific development programs for the treatment of certain other diseases, including MLD. At the time we entered into the novation agreement, GSK had completed development, launched and commercialized Strimvelis for ADA-SCID in the European Union, and had exercised its exclusive option to obtain exclusive licenses from Telethon-OSR to certain programs, including MLD. We acquired Strimvelis and GSK’s exclusive licenses relating to the ADA-SCID and MLD programs, among others, pursuant to the GSK Agreement and the deed of novation.
Under the R&D Agreement, Telethon-OSR is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct each of the collaboration programs in accordance with development plans approved by a joint steering committee. With respect to those programs in relation to which our option has been exercised, we are required to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop, obtain regulatory approval, launch and promote in both the European Union and the United States all licensed products and to commercialize and manufacture such products at levels sufficient to meet commercial demands. We are required to use best efforts to renew the European Union marketing authorization for Strimvelis to enable patients to be treated at the San Raffaele hospital from all referring centers globally, as permitted by applicable law. We are responsible for the costs and activities associated with the continued development of Strimvelis and each program for which an option under the R&D Agreement is exercised.
As consideration for the licenses and options granted under the R&D Agreement, we are required to make payments to Telethon-OSR upon achievement of certain product development milestones. We are obligated to pay up to an aggregate of €31.0 million in connection with product development milestones with respect to those programs for which we have exercised an option under this agreement, including OTL-200. Additionally, we are required to pay to Telethon-OSR a tiered mid-single to low-double digit royalty percentage on net annual sales of licensed products on a country-by-country basis, as well as a low double-digit percentage of sublicense income received from any certain third party sublicensees of the collaboration programs. Our royalty obligation expires on a licensed product-by-licensed product and country-by-country basis upon the latest to occur of the expiration of the last valid claim under the licensed patent rights in such country, the 10th anniversary of the first commercial sale of such licensed product in such country, and the expiration of any applicable regulatory exclusivity in such country, provided that our royalty obligation will terminate immediately in the event significant generic or biosimilar competition to a licensed product achieves a certain threshold percentage of the market share.
Unless terminated earlier, the R&D Agreement will expire (i) on a product-by-product and country-by-country basis upon the expiration of all payment obligations with respect to such product in such country, (ii) in its entirety upon the expiration of all payment obligations with respect to the last product in all countries in the world, and (iii) on a program-by-program basis when no vector or gene therapy product is being researched, developed or commercialized. Either we or Telethon-OSR may terminate the R&D Agreement in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis if the other party commits a material breach and fails to cure such breach within a certain period of time. Additionally, either we or Telethon-OSR may terminate involvement in a collaboration program for compelling safety reasons, and either we or Telethon-OSR may terminate the R&D Agreement if the other party becomes insolvent. We may also terminate the R&D Agreement either in its entirety or on a program-by-program basis for any reason upon notice to Telethon-OSR.

Oxford BioMedica license and development agreement
In November 2016, we entered into a license and development agreement, or the Oxford Development Agreement, with Oxford BioMedica (UK) Limited, or Oxford BioMedica, for the development of gene therapies for ADA-SCID, MPS-IIIA and certain other diseases that we may request be included under the Oxford Development Agreement, such other diseases referred to as Subsequent Indications. The Oxford Development Agreement was amended on multiple occasions and most recently in April 2020.
 Pursuant to the Oxford Development Agreement, Oxford BioMedica granted us an exclusive, worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights for the purposes of research, development and commercialization of ex vivo gene therapy products for the treatment of ADA-SCID, MPS-IIIA and Subsequent Indications, except that such license is non-exclusive to the extent the treatment of a Subsequent Indication is the subject of a certain previous license granted by Oxford BioMedica. Oxford BioMedica also granted us a non-exclusive, worldwide license under certain intellectual property rights for the purposes of research, development, commercialization and manufacture of ex vivo gene therapy products for the treatment of certain diseases other than ADA-SCID, MPS-IIIA and Subsequent Indications. Under the Oxford Development Agreement, Oxford BioMedica is required to use commercially reasonable efforts to perform the activities set forth in a collaboration plan approved by a joint steering committee, and we are responsible for certain costs of the activities set forth in such collaboration plan.
As consideration for the licenses granted under the agreement, we issued 588,220 of our ordinary shares to Oxford BioMedica. We are also obligated to issue additional equity upon the achievement of certain milestones, pursuant to which we issued 150,826 ordinary shares upon the achievement of the first milestone in November 2017 and 150,826 ordinary shares were issued upon the achievement of further milestones in August 2018. In April 2020, the fifth milestone was deemed to have been met upon execution of the amended agreement in April 2020, and the Company issued another 75,413 ordinary shares to Oxford BioMedica. Additionally, we are obligated to pay low single-digit percentage royalties on net sales of licensed products until January 31, 2039. The foregoing royalties are reduced by a mid-double digit percentage in the case of compassionate use of a licensed product in a country until the first commercial sale following marketing authorization in such country. We are also required to pay a set monthly fee to Oxford BioMedica in the event we use a certain Oxford BioMedica system for generating stable cell lines.
Unless terminated earlier, the Oxford Development Agreement will expire when no further payments are due to Oxford BioMedica. We may terminate the performance of the collaboration plan upon notice to Oxford BioMedica, and either party may terminate the performance of the collaboration plan or the Oxford Development Agreement if the other party commits a material breach that is not cured within a certain period of time. Either party may also terminate the Oxford Development Agreement in the event the other party becomes insolvent.
Telethon-OSR license agreement
 In May 2019, we entered into a license agreement with Telethon-OSR under which Telethon-OSR granted us an exclusive worldwide license for the research, development, manufacture and commercialization of ex vivo autologous HSC lentiviral based gene therapy products for the treatment of MPS-I, including MPS IH. Under the terms of the agreement, Telethon-OSR is entitled to receive an upfront payment, and we may be required to make milestone payments if certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones are achieved. Additionally, we will be required to pay Telethon-OSR a tiered mid-single to low-double digit royalty percentage on annual net sales of licensed products.
 Competition
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products. While we believe that our portfolio of product candidates and scientific expertise in gene therapy provides us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources.
We face competition not only from gene therapy companies, but also from companies that are developing novel, non-gene therapy approaches or improving existing treatment approaches. Depending on how successful these efforts are, it is possible they may increase the barriers to adoption and success for our product candidates, if approved.
We are currently aware of the following competitive approaches among our products and clinical programs:
•MLD: To our knowledge, beyond Libmeldy in Europe, there is currently no other effective treatment option for patients with MLD. HSCT, for example, has demonstrated limited efficacy in halting disease progression and is therefore not considered a standard of care for this disease. A number of alternative approaches to HSCT are under investigation. For instance, Homology Medicines is at the pre-clinical stage of developing an in vivo AAV gene therapy for MLD delivered intravenously, Passage Bio has a pre-clinical development program for MLD, and Affinia has a pre-clinical program for in vivo AAV gene therapy for MLD through lumbar puncture 


(LP) administration. We are also aware that Takeda is investigating an ERT for MLD with a biweekly intrathecal infusion, and Denali Therapeutics is at the pre-clinical stage of developing a recombinant ARSA enzyme engineered to cross the blood-brain barrier.
 •MPS-I: The current standard of care for MPS-IH patients is HSCT before the age of 30 months. We are aware that REGENXBIO is developing an AAV-based gene therapy, which is in Phase I trials and to be delivered intracisternally. bluebird bio and Immusoft have both reported that they are developing ex vivo cell therapies in the pre-clinical stage. For MPS-I patients that are not suitable candidates for HSCT because they lack a suitable donor, were diagnosed later in life, or have a less severe subtype of MPS-I, the current standard of care for the treatment of MPS-I involves regular intravenous injections of laronidase (Aldurazyme), an ERT commercialized by BioMarin and Sanofi Genzyme. A formulation of laronidase for intrathecal administration is currently under evaluation. JCR Pharmaceuticals is developing an ERT, which is in Phase I trials. Denali Therapeutics has an ERT program in the discovery stage.
 •MPS-IIIA: There are currently no effective disease modifying treatment options for patients with MPS-IIIA. We are aware of three gene therapy candidates in clinical development. Lysogene is developing an AAV gene therapy product administered through intracerebral injections and regained global commercial rights after its collaboration with Sarepta Therapeutics terminated in July 2022; Abeona Therapeutics has been developing an AAV gene therapy product administered intravenously, which was licensed to Ultragenyx in May 2022 for further clinical development; and Esteve is developing an AAV gene therapy administered through intracerebroventricular injection. Amicus Therapeutics is at the pre-clinical stage of developing an AAV gene therapy for MPS-IIIA. JCR Pharmaceuticals and Denali Therapeutics each have a pre-clinical stage ERT program for MPS-IIIA.
 •GRN-FTD: There are no approved disease modifying treatments for GRN-FTD. Each of Prevail Therapeutics (now owned by Eli Lilly & Company) and Passage Bio is developing in early-stage clinical trials an AAV gene therapy to be delivered intra-cisterna magna. Alector is developing a monoclonal antibody designed to increase levels of GRN in the brain in late-stage clinical trials, and Denali Therapeutics is developing a modified protein designed to penetrate across the blood-brain barrier at the pre-clinical stage in collaboration with Takeda.
 •NOD2-Crohn’s: There are no approved treatment options specifically for the NOD-2 form of Crohn’s disease, and many patients with Crohn’s disease have uncontrolled symptoms despite treatment with standard of care, including multiple anti-inflammatory biologics and surgical interventions. We are not aware of any other treatments in development specifically for the NOD-2 form of Crohn’s disease. 
 Many of our potential competitors, alone or with their strategic partners, have substantially greater financial, technical and other resources than we do, such as larger research and development, clinical, marketing and manufacturing organizations. Mergers and acquisitions in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of competitors. Our commercial opportunity could be reduced or eliminated if competitors develop and commercialize products that are safer, more effective, have fewer or less severe side effects, are more convenient or are less expensive than any products that we may develop. Competitors also may obtain FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. Additionally, technologies developed by our competitors may render our potential product candidates uneconomical or obsolete, and we may not be successful in marketing our product candidates against competitors.
Government regulation
In the United States, biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations govern, among other things, the research, development, clinical trial, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. Each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product must be reviewed by the FDA. FDA approval must be obtained before the marketing of biological products. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals.
Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research could result in additional laws and regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state legislatures, agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive laws and

regulations or interpretations of existing laws or regulations, or claims that our products are unsafe or pose a hazard, could prevent us from commercializing any products. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be.
U.S. biological products development process
The process required by the FDA before a biological product may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following:
•completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to good laboratory practices, or GLPs, unless justified, and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an application for an investigational new drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •approval of the protocol and related documentation by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, or ethics committee at each clinical trial site before each study may be initiated; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to the FDA’s regulations commonly referred to as good clinical practices, or GCPs, and any additional requirements for the protection of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product for its intended use; 
 •submission to the FDA of a biologics license application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes sufficient evidence of establishing the safety, purity, and potency of the proposed biological product for its intended indication, including from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product’s identity, strength, quality and purity and, if applicable, the FDA’s current good tissue practices, or CGTPs, for the use of human cellular and tissue products; 
 •potential FDA audit of the nonclinical study and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA in accordance with any applicable expedited programs or designations; 
 •review of the product candidate by an FDA advisory committee, where appropriate or if applicable;
 •payment of user fees for FDA review of the BLA (unless a fee waiver applies); and 
 •FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA. 
 Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product, in humans, the product candidate enters the pre-clinical testing stage. Pre-clinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product biological characteristics, chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the pre-clinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including GLPs.
An IND is an exemption from the FD&C Act that allows an unapproved product candidate to be shipped in interstate commerce for use in an investigational clinical trial and a request for FDA authorization to administer such investigational product to humans. Such authorization must be secured prior to interstate shipment and administration of any product candidate that is not the subject of an approved BLA. In support of a request for an IND, applicants must submit a protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, the results of the pre-clinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and plans for clinical trials, among other things, must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND. The FDA requires a 30-day waiting period after the filing of each IND before clinical trials may begin. This waiting period is designed to allow the FDA to review the IND to determine whether human research subjects will be exposed to unreasonable health risks. At any time during this 30-day period the FDA may raise concerns or questions about the conduct of the trials as outlined in the IND and impose a clinical hold or partial clinical hold. In this case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin.

Following commencement of a clinical trial, the FDA may also place a clinical hold or partial clinical hold on that trial. A clinical hold is an order issued by the FDA to the sponsor to delay a proposed clinical investigation or to suspend an ongoing investigation. A partial clinical hold is a delay or suspension of only part of the clinical work requested under the IND. No more than 30 days after imposition of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, the FDA will provide the sponsor a written explanation of the basis for the hold. Following issuance of a clinical hold or partial clinical hold, an investigation may only resume after the FDA has notified the sponsor that the investigation may proceed.
A sponsor may choose, but is not required, to conduct a foreign clinical trial under an IND. When a foreign clinical trial is conducted under an IND, all FDA IND requirements must be met unless waived. When a foreign clinical trial is not conducted under an IND, the sponsor must ensure that the study complies with certain regulatory requirements of the FDA in order to use the study as support for an IND or application for marketing approval or licensing. In particular, such studies must be conducted in accordance with GCP, including review and approval by an independent ethics committee, or IEC, and informed consent from subjects. The FDA must be able to validate the data through an onsite inspection, if deemed necessary by the FDA.
An IRB representing each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution, and the IRB must conduct continuing review and re-approve the study at least annually. The IRB must review and approve, among other things, the study protocol and informed consent information to be provided to study subjects. An IRB must operate in compliance with FDA regulations. An IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution, or an institution it represents, if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Some trials are overseen by an independent group of qualified experts organized by the trial sponsor, known as a data safety monitoring board or committee, or DSMB. This group provides authorization as to whether or not a trial may move forward at designated check points based on access that only the group maintains to available data from the study.
In addition to the submission of an IND to the FDA before initiation of a clinical trial in the United States, certain human clinical trials involving recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules are subject to oversight of institutional biosafety committees, or IBCs, as set forth in the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or NIH Guidelines. Under the NIH Guidelines, recombinant and synthetic nucleic acids are defined as: (i) molecules that are constructed by joining nucleic acid molecules and that can replicate in a living cell (i.e., recombinant nucleic acids); (ii) nucleic acid molecules that are chemically or by other means synthesized or amplified, including those that are chemically or otherwise modified but can base pair with naturally occurring nucleic acid molecules (i.e., synthetic nucleic acids); or (iii) molecules that result from the replication of those described in (i) or (ii). Specifically, under the NIH Guidelines, supervision of human gene transfer trials includes evaluation and assessment by an IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees research utilizing recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecules at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment, and such review may result in some delay before initiation of a clinical trial. While the NIH Guidelines are not mandatory unless the research in question is being conducted at or sponsored by institutions receiving NIH funding of recombinant or synthetic nucleic acid molecule research, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them.
 Information about clinical trials must be submitted within specific time frames to the NIH for public dissemination on its ClinicalTrials.gov website.
Clinical trials typically are conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined:
•Phase 1. The biological product is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety. In the case of some products for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 •Phase 2. The biological product is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule. 
 •Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency, and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for approval and product labeling. 
 Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be conducted after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic

indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. The FDA generally recommends that sponsors of human gene therapy products integrating vectors such as gammaretroviral and lentiviral vectors and transposon elements observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events for a 15-year period, including a minimum of five years of annual examinations followed by ten years of annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of study subjects.
Both the FDA and the EMA provide expedited pathways for the development of drug product candidates for treatment of rare diseases, particularly life-threatening diseases with high unmet medical need. Such drug product candidates may be eligible to proceed to registration following a single clinical trial in a limited patient population, sometimes referred to as a Phase 1/2 trial, but which may be deemed a pivotal or registrational trial following review of the trial’s design and primary endpoints by the applicable regulatory agencies. Determination of the requirements to be deemed a pivotal or registrational trial is subject to the applicable regulatory authority’s scientific judgment and these requirements may differ in the U.S. and the European Union.
During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, the NIH and the investigators for serious and unexpected adverse events, any findings from other studies, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, or any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, acting on its own or based on a recommendation from the sponsor’s data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.
Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Because this is a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions, there can be no assurance as to the length of the study period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the studies in order to establish the safety, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in these studies will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval.
Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and also must develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product in commercial quantities in accordance with cGMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life.
U.S. review and approval processes
After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product. The BLA must include results of product development, laboratory and animal studies, human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product, proposed labeling and other relevant information. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all.

Within 60 days following submission of the application, the FDA reviews a BLA submitted to determine if it is substantially complete before the FDA accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. In most cases, the submission of a BLA is subject to a substantial application user fee, although the fee may be waived under certain circumstances. Under the performance goals and policies implemented by the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, for original BLAs, the FDA targets ten months from the filing date in which to complete its initial review of a standard application and respond to the applicant, and six months from the filing date for an application with priority review. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates, and the review process is often significantly extended by FDA requests for additional information or clarification. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the BLA is submitted to the FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a ‘‘filing’’ decision. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended, for example, by three months if the BLA sponsor submits a major new clinical study report, a major re-analysis of a previously submitted study or other major amendment at any time during the review cycle.
Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product is safe, pure and potent, for its intended use, and whether the product is being manufactured in accordance with cGMP to ensure the continued safety, purity and potency of such product. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult or novel questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to assure the safe use of the biological product. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required.
Before approving a BLA, the FDA typically will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. For a gene therapy product, the FDA also will not approve the product if the manufacturer is not in compliance with the CGTPs. These are FDA regulations that govern the methods used in, and the facilities and controls used for, the manufacture of human cells, tissues, and cellular and tissue-based products, or HCT/Ps, which are human cells or tissue intended for implantation, transplant, infusion, or transfer into a human recipient. The primary intent of the CGTP requirements is to ensure that cell and tissue-based products are manufactured in a manner designed to prevent the introduction, transmission and spread of communicable disease. FDA regulations also require tissue establishments to register and list their HCT/Ps with the FDA and, when applicable, to evaluate donors through appropriate screening and testing. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND study requirements and GCP requirements. During the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions preventing the conduct or completion of facility or clinical site inspections have led to FDA deferred action on marketing applications or the issuance of complete response letters. To assure cGMP, CGTP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
Under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA for a novel product (e.g., new active ingredient, new indication, etc.) must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the FDA decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application.

If a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, including to subpopulations of patients, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings precautions or interactions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post-marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Orphan drug designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan designation to a drug or biological product intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or more than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan product designation must be requested before submitting a BLA. After the FDA grants orphan product designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
Orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers. If a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. Competitors, however, may receive approval of different products for the indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity or obtain approval for the same product but for a different indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same biological product for the same use or indication, and we are unable to demonstrate that our product is clinically superior to the previously approved drug for the same use or indication. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits.
 
Rare Pediatric Disease Designation and Priority Review Vouchers
Under the FD&C Act, the FDA incentivizes the development of drugs and biological products that meet the definition of a “rare pediatric disease,” defined to mean a serious or life-threatening disease in which the serious of life-threatening manifestations primarily affect individuals aged from birth to 18 years and the disease affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States or affects more than 200,000 in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making in the United States a drug or biological product for such disease or condition will be received from sales in the United States of such drug or biological product. The sponsor of a product candidate for a rare pediatric disease may be eligible for a voucher that can be used to obtain a priority review for a subsequent human drug or biological product application after the date of approval of the rare pediatric disease drug or biological product, referred to as a priority review voucher, or PRV. A sponsor may request rare pediatric disease designation from the FDA prior to the submission of its BLA. A rare pediatric disease designation does not guarantee that a sponsor will receive a PRV upon approval of its BLA. Moreover, a sponsor who chooses not to submit a rare pediatric disease designation request may nonetheless receive a PRV upon approval of their marketing application if they request such a voucher in their original marketing application and meet all of the eligibility criteria. If a PRV is received, it may be sold or transferred an unlimited number of times. Congress has extended the PRV program through September 30, 2024, with the potential for PRVs to be granted through September 30, 2026.
 Expedited development and review programs
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track designation, breakthrough therapy designation, accelerated approval and priority review, that are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs and biologics that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions. These programs do not change the standards for approval but may help expedite the development or approval process. To be eligible for fast track designation, new drugs and biological products must be intended to treat a serious or life-threatening condition and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs for the condition. Fast Track designation applies to the

combination of the product and the specific indication for which it is being studied. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product at any time during the clinical development of the product. One benefit of fast track designation, for example, is that the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application for a product that has received Fast Track designation on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted.
Under the FDA’s breakthrough therapy program, products intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition may be eligible for the benefits of the Fast Track program when preliminary clinical evidence demonstrates that such product may have substantial improvement on one or more clinically significant endpoints over existing therapies. Additionally, the FDA will seek to ensure the sponsor of a breakthrough therapy product receives timely advice and interactive communications to help the sponsor design and conduct a development program as efficiently as possible.
Any product is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review. Under priority review, the FDA’s goal is to review an application in six months once it is filed, compared to ten months for a standard review.
Additionally, a product may be eligible for accelerated approval. Drug or biological products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may receive accelerated approval, which means that they may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, or on the basis of an effect on an intermediate clinical endpoint other than survival or irreversible morbidity. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product receiving accelerated approval perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. Under the Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022, or FDORA, the FDA is permitted to require, as appropriate, that a post-approval confirmatory study or studies be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period after the date of accelerated approval was granted. FDORA also requires sponsors to send updates to the FDA every 180 days on the status of such studies, including progress toward enrollment targets, and the FDA must promptly post this information publicly. FDORA also gives the FDA increased authority to withdraw approval of a drug or biologic granted accelerated approval on an expedited basis if the sponsor fails to conduct such studies in a timely manner, send the necessary updates to the FDA, or if such post-approval studies fail to verify the drug’s predicted clinical benefit. Under FDORA, the FDA is empowered to take action, such as issuing fines, against companies that fail to conduct with due diligence any post-approval confirmatory study or submit timely reports to the agency on their progress. In addition, for products being considered for accelerated approval, the FDA generally requires, unless otherwise informed by the agency, that all advertising and promotional materials intended for dissemination or publication within 120 days of marketing approval be submitted to the agency for review during the pre-approval review period.
RMAT designation
As part of the 21st Century Cures Act, enacted in December 2016, Congress amended the FD&C Act to facilitate an efficient development program for, and expedite review of RMAT, which include cell and gene therapies, therapeutic tissue engineering products, human cell and tissue products, and combination products using any such therapies or products. RMAT do not include those HCT/Ps regulated solely under section 361 of the PHS Act and 21 CFR Part 1271. This program is intended to facilitate efficient development and expedite review of regenerative medicine therapies, which are intended to treat, modify, reverse, or cure a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and qualify for RMAT designation. A drug sponsor may request that FDA designate a drug as a RMAT concurrently with or at any time after submission of an IND. FDA has 60 calendar days to determine whether the drug meets the criteria, including whether there is preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the drug has the potential to address unmet medical needs for a serious or life-threatening disease or condition. A BLA for a regenerative medicine therapy that has received RMAT designation may be eligible for priority review or accelerated approval through use of surrogate or intermediate endpoints reasonably likely to predict long-term clinical benefit, or reliance upon data obtained from a meaningful number of sites. Benefits of RMAT designation also include early interactions with FDA to discuss any potential surrogate or intermediate endpoint to be used to support accelerated approval. A regenerative medicine therapy with RMAT designation that is granted accelerated approval and is subject to post-approval requirements may fulfill such requirements through the submission of clinical evidence from clinical trials, patient registries, or other sources of real world evidence, such as electronic health records; the collection of larger confirmatory data sets; or post-approval monitoring of all patients treated with such therapy prior to its approval. Like some of FDA’s other expedited development programs, RMAT designation does not change the standards for approval but may help expedite the development or approval process.

Post-approval requirements
Maintaining substantial compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to cGMP. We currently rely, and may continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the cGMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products, include reporting of cGMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product also may be subject to official lot release. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA also may perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products.
We also must comply with the FDA’s advertising and promotion requirements, such as those related to direct-to-consumer advertising, the prohibition on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”), industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities, and promotional activities involving the internet. Discovery of previously unknown problems or the failure to comply with the applicable regulatory requirements may result in restrictions on the marketing of a product or withdrawal of the product from the market as well as possible civil or criminal sanctions. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant or manufacturer to administrative or judicial civil or criminal sanctions and adverse publicity. FDA sanctions could include refusal to approve pending applications, withdrawal of an approval, clinical holds, warning or untitled letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors or other stakeholders, debarment, restitution, disgorgement of profits, or civil or criminal penalties. Any agency or judicial enforcement action could have a material adverse effect on us.
Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products and those supplying products, ingredients and components of them, are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. Discovery of problems with a product after approval may result in restrictions on a product, manufacturer, or holder of an approved BLA, including withdrawal of the product from the market. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval.
U.S. patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of the FDA approval of the use of our product candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. In addition, a patent can only be extended once and only for a single product. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may intend to apply for restoration of patent term for one of our patents, if and as applicable, to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA.
A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study.

The ACA, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic.
A reference biological product is granted four- and 12-year exclusivity periods from the time of first licensure of the product. FDA will not accept an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until four years after the date of first licensure of the reference product, and FDA will not approve an application for a biosimilar or interchangeable product based on the reference biological product until twelve years after the date of first licensure of the reference product. “First licensure” typically means the initial date the particular product at issue was licensed in the United States. Date of first licensure does not include the date of licensure of (and a new period of exclusivity is not available for) a biological product if the licensure is for a supplement for the biological product or for a subsequent application by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product (or licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device or strength, or for a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency. Therefore, one must determine whether a new product includes a modification to the structure of a previously licensed product that results in a change in safety, purity, or potency to assess whether the licensure of the new product is a first licensure that triggers its own period of exclusivity. Whether a subsequent application, if approved, warrants exclusivity as the “first licensure” of a biological product is determined on a case-by-case basis with data submitted by the sponsor.
Additional regulation
In addition to the foregoing, state and federal laws regarding environmental protection and hazardous substances, including the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Resource Conservancy and Recovery Act and the Toxic Substances Control Act, affect our business. These and other laws govern our use, handling and disposal of various biological, chemical and radioactive substances used in, and wastes generated by, our operations. If our operations result in contamination of the environment or expose individuals to hazardous substances, we could be liable for damages and governmental fines. We believe that we are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and that continued compliance therewith will not have a material adverse effect on our business. We cannot predict, however, how changes in these laws may affect our future operations.
U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, to which we are subject, prohibits corporations and individuals from engaging in certain activities to obtain or retain business or to influence a person working in an official capacity. It is illegal to pay, offer to pay or authorize the payment of anything of value to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business or to otherwise influence a person working in an official capacity.
Government regulation outside of the United States
In addition to regulations in the United States, we are subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, research and development, clinical trials, testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, record keeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products as well as authorization and approval of our products. Because biologically sourced raw materials are subject to unique contamination risks, their use may be restricted in some countries.
The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical trials, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension of clinical trials, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.
 Clinical trials regulation


Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries. Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical trial application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical trials.
In April 2014, the EU adopted the new Clinical Trials Regulation (EU) No 536/2014, or Regulation, which replaced the Clinical Trials Directive 2001/20/EC, or Directive, on January 31, 2022. The transitory provisions of the new Regulation provide that, by January 31, 2025, all ongoing clinical trials must have transitioned to the new Regulation. The new Regulation overhauled the system of approvals for clinical trials in the EU. Specifically, the new Regulation, which is directly applicable in all Member States (meaning that no national implementing legislation in each EU Member State is required), aims at simplifying and streamlining the approval of clinical trials in the EU. The main characteristics of the regulation include: a streamlined application procedure via a single-entry point through the Clinical Trials Information System, or CTIS; a single set of documents to be prepared and submitted for the application as well as simplified reporting procedures for clinical trial sponsors; and a harmonized procedure for the assessment of applications for clinical trials, which is divided in two parts (Part I contains scientific and medicinal product documentation and Part II contains the national and patient-level documentation). Part I is assessed by a coordinated review by the competent authorities of all EU Member States in which an application for authorization of a clinical trial has been submitted (Member States concerned) of a draft report prepared by a Reference Member State. Part II is assessed separately by each Member State concerned. Strict deadlines have been established for the assessment of clinical trial applications. The role of the relevant ethics committees in the assessment procedure will continue to be governed by the national law of the concerned EU Member State. However, overall related timelines will be defined by the Clinical Trials Regulation.
 Drug review and approval
In the EU, medicinal products, including advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, are subject to extensive pre- and post-market regulation by regulatory authorities at both the EU and national levels. ATMPs comprise gene therapy products, somatic cell therapy products and tissue engineered products. Gene therapy products deliver genes into the body that lead to a therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic effect. Libmeldy is authorized as a gene therapy product in the EU, and we anticipate that our gene therapy development products would also be regulated as ATMPs in the EU.
To obtain regulatory approval of an ATMP under EU regulatory systems, we must submit an MAA under the centralized procedure administered by the EMA. The application used to submit the BLA in the United States is similar to that required in the EU, with the exception of, among other things, certain specific requirements set out in Regulation (EC) No 1394/2007 on advanced therapy medicinal products, or the ATMP Regulation, for example certain particulars to be contained in the summary of product characteristics. The centralized procedure provides for the grant of a single marketing authorization by the European Commission that is valid across all of the EU, and in the additional Member States of the European Economic Area (Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway), or EEA. As provided for in the ATMP Regulation, the scientific evaluation of MAAs for ATMPs is primarily performed by a specialized scientific committee called the Committee for Advanced Therapies, or CAT. The CAT prepares a draft opinion on the quality, safety and efficacy of the ATMP which is the subject of the MAA, which is sent for final approval to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, or CHMP. The CHMP recommendation is then sent to the European Commission, which adopts a decision binding in all EU Member States. The maximum time frame for the evaluation of an MAA for an ATMP is 210 days from receipt of a valid MAA, excluding clock stops when additional information or written or oral explanation is to be provided by the applicant in response to questions asked by the CAT and/or CHMP. Clock stops may extend the time frame of evaluation of an MAA considerably beyond 210 days. Where the CHMP gives a positive opinion, the EMA provides the opinion together with supporting documentation to the European Commission, who make the final decision to grant a marketing authorization, which is issued within 67 days of receipt of the EMA’s recommendation. Accelerated assessment may be granted by the CHMP in exceptional cases, when a medicinal product is of major public health interest, particularly from the viewpoint of therapeutic innovation. If the CHMP accepts such a request, the time frame of 210 days for assessment will be reduced to 150 days (excluding clock stops), but it is possible that the CHMP may revert to the standard time limit for the centralized procedure if it determines that the application is no longer appropriate to conduct an accelerated assessment.
 Now that the UK (which comprises Great Britain and Northern Ireland) has left the EU, Great Britain is no longer covered by centralized marketing authorizations (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, centralized marketing authorizations continue to be recognized in Northern Ireland). All medicinal products with an existing centralized marketing authorization were automatically converted to Great Britain marketing authorizations on January 1, 2021. For a period of three years from January 1, 2021, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, the UK medicines regulator, could rely on a decision taken by the European Commission on the approval of a new marketing authorization in the centralized procedure, in order to more quickly grant a new Great Britain marketing authorization. A separate application will, however, still be required. On January 24, 2023, the MHRA announced that a new international recognition framework will be put in

place from January 1, 2024, which will have regard to decisions on the approval of marketing authorizations made by the European Medicines Agency and certain other regulators when determining an application for a new Great Britain marketing authorization.
 Data and marketing exclusivity
 The EU also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving a marketing authorization in the EU, innovative medicinal products generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents generic or biosimilar applicants from referencing the innovator’s pre-clinical and clinical trial data contained in the dossier of the reference product when applying for a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization during a period of eight years from the date on which the reference product was first authorized in the EU. During the additional two-year period of market exclusivity, a generic or biosimilar marketing authorization can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic or biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity period. The overall ten-year period will be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years of those ten years, the marketing authorization holder obtains an authorization for one or more new therapeutic indications which, during the scientific evaluation prior to authorization, is held to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies. Even if an innovative medicinal product gains the prescribed period of data exclusivity, another company may market another version of the product if such company obtained marketing authorization based on an MAA with a complete and independent data package of pharmaceutical tests, pre-clinical tests and clinical trials. There is, however, no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU’s regulatory authorities to be an innovative medicinal product, and products may therefore not qualify for data exclusivity.
Orphan designation and exclusivity
 Products with an orphan designation in the EU can receive ten years of market exclusivity, during which time “no similar medicinal product” for the same indication may be placed on the market. A “similar medicinal product” is defined as a medicinal product containing a similar active substance or substances as contained in an authorized orphan medicinal product, and which is intended for the same therapeutic indication. An orphan medicinal product can also obtain an additional two years of market exclusivity in the EU where an agreed pediatric investigation plan for pediatric studies has been complied with. No extension to any supplementary protection certificate can be granted on the basis of pediatric studies for orphan indications.
The criteria for designating an “orphan medicinal product” in the EU are similar in principle to those in the United States. Under Article 3 of Regulation (EC) 141/2000, a medicinal product may be designated as an orphan medicinal product if it meets the following criteria: (1) it is intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of a life-threatening or chronically debilitating condition; and (2) either (i) the prevalence of such condition must not be more than five in 10,000 persons in the EU when the application is made, or (ii) without the benefits derived from orphan status, it must be unlikely that the marketing of the medicine would generate sufficient return in the EU to justify the investment needed for its development; and (3) there exists no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of such condition authorized for marketing in the EU, or if such a method exists, the product will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition, as defined in Regulation (EC) 847/2000. Orphan medicinal products are eligible for financial incentives such as reduction of fees or fee waivers and are, upon grant of a marketing authorization, entitled to ten years of market exclusivity for the approved therapeutic indication. The application for orphan designation must be submitted before the application for marketing authorization. The applicant will receive a fee reduction for the MAA if the orphan designation has been granted, but not if the designation is still pending at the time the marketing authorization is submitted. Orphan designation does not convey any advantage in, or shorten the duration of, the regulatory review and approval process. A marketing authorization may be granted to a “similar medicinal product” for the same orphan indication at any time if:
 •a second applicant can establish that its product, although similar, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior; 
 •the marketing authorization holder of the authorized orphan product consents to a second orphan medicinal product application; or 
 •the marketing authorization holder of the authorized orphan product cannot supply enough orphan medicinal product. 
 Since January 1, 2021, a separate process for orphan designation has applied in Great Britain. There is now no pre-marketing authorization orphan designation (as there is in the EU) in Great Britain and the application for orphan designation will be reviewed by the MHRA at the time of an MAA for a UK or Great Britain marketing authorization. The criteria for orphan designation are the same as in the EU, save that they apply to Great Britain only (e.g., there must be no satisfactory method

of diagnosis, prevention or treatment of the condition concerned in Great Britain, as opposed to the EU, and the prevalence of the condition must not be more than five in 10,000 persons in Great Britain).
 Pediatric development
In the EU, companies developing a new medicinal product must agree upon a pediatric investigation plan, or PIP, with the EMA’s Pediatric Committee, or PDCO, and must conduct pediatric clinical trials in accordance with that PIP, unless a waiver applies, (e.g., because the relevant disease or condition occurs only in adults). The PIP sets out the timing and measures proposed to generate data to support a pediatric indication of the product for which a marketing authorization is being sought. The MAA for the product must include the results of pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP, unless a waiver applies, or a deferral has been granted by the PDCO of the obligation to implement some or all of the measures of the PIP until there are sufficient data to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of the product in adults, in which case the pediatric clinical trials must be completed at a later date. Products that are granted a marketing authorization with the results of the pediatric clinical trials conducted in accordance with the PIP are eligible for a six-month extension of the protection under a supplementary protection certificate, or SPC (provided an application for such extension is made at the same time as filing the SPC application for the product, or at any point up to 2 years before the SPC expires) even where the trial results are negative. In the case of orphan medicinal products, a two-year extension of the orphan market exclusivity may be available. This pediatric reward is subject to specific conditions and is not automatically available when data in compliance with the PIP are developed and submitted.

PRIME Designation
In March 2016, the EMA launched an initiative to facilitate development of product candidates in indications, often rare, for which few or no therapies currently exist. The PRIority MEdicines, or PRIME, scheme is intended to encourage drug development in areas of unmet medical need and provides accelerated assessment of products representing substantial innovation, where the MAA will be made through the centralized procedure. Eligible products must target conditions for which there is an unmet medical need (there is no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention or treatment in the EU or, if there is, the new medicine will bring a major therapeutic advantage) and they must demonstrate the potential to address the unmet medical need by introducing new methods of therapy or improving existing ones. Products from small- and medium-sized enterprises may qualify for earlier entry into the PRIME scheme than larger companies. Many benefits accrue to sponsors of product candidates with PRIME designation, including but not limited to, early and proactive regulatory dialogue with the EMA, frequent discussions on clinical trial designs and other development program elements, and accelerated MAA assessment once a dossier has been submitted. Importantly, a dedicated EMA contact and rapporteur from the CHMP or CAT are appointed early in the PRIME scheme facilitating increased understanding of the product at the EMA’s Committee level. A kick-off meeting initiates these relationships and includes a team of multidisciplinary experts at the EMA to provide guidance on the overall development and regulatory strategies. Where, during the course of development, a medicine no longer meets the eligibility criteria, support under the PRIME scheme may be withdrawn.
 Post-approval controls
Following approval, the holder of the marketing authorization is required to comply with a range of requirements applicable to the manufacturing, marketing, promotion and sale of the medicinal product. These include the following:
 •The holder of a marketing authorization must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance, who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs. 
 •All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the marketing authorization. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies. RMPs and PSURs are routinely available to third parties requesting access, subject to limited redactions. 
 •All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved SmPC and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each EU Member State and can differ from one country to another. 
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the EEA.


Brexit and the Regulatory Framework in the UK
The UK left the EU (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) in January 2020. The UK and EU entered a trade and cooperation agreement, or TCA, which has been formally applicable since May 2021. The TCA includes specific provisions concerning pharmaceuticals, which include the mutual recognition of GMP, inspections of manufacturing facilities for medicinal products and GMP documents issued, but does not provide for wholesale mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical regulations. At present, Great Britain has implemented EU legislation on the marketing, promotion and sale of medicinal products through the Human Medicines Regulations 2012 (as amended) (under the Northern Ireland Protocol, the EU regulatory framework continues to apply in Northern Ireland). Except in respect of the new EU Clinical Trials Regulation, the regulatory regime in Great Britain therefore largely aligns with current EU regulations. However, it is possible that these regimes will diverge more significantly in future now that Great Britain’s regulatory system is independent from the EU and the TCA does not provide for mutual recognition of UK and EU pharmaceutical legislation. However, notwithstanding that there is no wholesale recognition of EU pharmaceutical legislation under the TCA, under the new framework mentioned above which will be put in place by the MHRA from January 1, 2024, the MHRA has stated that it will take into account decisions on the approval of marketing authorizations from the EMA (and certain other regulators) when considering an application for a Great Britain marketing authorization.
 Other healthcare laws and compliance requirements
In the United States, our current and future operations are subject to regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including but not limited to, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS (such as the Office of Inspector General, Office for Civil Rights and the Health Resources and Service Administration), the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the DOJ, and state and local governments. For example, our clinical research, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs may have to comply with the anti-fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, the false claims laws, the privacy and security provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and similar state laws, each as amended, as applicable:
 •the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce, or in return for, either the referral of an individual, or the purchase, lease, order, arrangement or recommendation of any good, facility, item or service for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute or specific intent to violate it to have committed a violation. In addition, the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute; 
 •the federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the False Claims Act, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the False Claims Act even when they do not submit claims directly to government payers if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The False Claims Act also permits a private individual acting as a “whistle blower” to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the False Claims Act and to share in any monetary recovery; 
 •the anti-inducement law, which prohibits, among other things, the offering or giving of remuneration, which includes, without limitation, any transfer of items or services for free or for less than fair market value (with limited exceptions), to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary’s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental program; 


•HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false, fictitious, or fraudulent statements or representations in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters; similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation; 
 •HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their respective implementing regulations, which impose requirements on certain covered healthcare providers, health plans, and healthcare clearinghouses as well as their respective business associates that perform services for them that involve the use, or disclosure of, individually identifiable health information, relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information; 
 •the federal transparency requirements under the ACA, including the provision commonly referred to as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, and its implementing regulations, which requires applicable manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children’s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by the physicians described above and their immediate family members. Effective January 1, 2022, these reporting obligations extend to include transfers of value made to certain non-physician providers such as physician assistants and nurse practitioners; 
 •federal government price reporting laws, which require us to calculate and report complex pricing metrics in an accurate and timely manner to government programs; and 
 •federal consumer protection and unfair competition laws, which broadly regulate marketplace activities and activities that potentially harm consumers. 
 Additionally, we are subject to state and foreign equivalents of each of the healthcare laws and regulations described above, among others, some of which may be broader in scope and may apply regardless of the payor. Many U.S. states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and False Claims Act, and may apply to our business practices, including, but not limited to, research, distribution, sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental payors, including private insurers. In addition, some states have passed laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the April 2003 Office of Inspector General Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and/or the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America’s Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals. Several states also impose other marketing restrictions or require pharmaceutical companies to make marketing or price disclosures to the state. There are ambiguities as to what is required to comply with these state requirements and if we fail to comply with an applicable state law requirement, we could be subject to penalties. Finally, there are state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information (e.g., the California Consumer Privacy Act), many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.

We may also be subject to additional privacy restrictions. The collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the European Economic Area, or EEA, including personal health data, is subject to the General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (EU GDPR), which became effective in May 2018. Following Brexit and the expiration of the subsequent transition period on December 31, 2020, the EU GDPR has been brought into UK law as the “UK GDPR” which, along with the UK Data Protection Act 2018, governs the collection, use, storage, disclosure, transfer, or other processing of personal data regarding individuals in the UK. In the present document, references to “GDPR” are meant to include both the EU GDPR and the UK GDPR, unless specified. The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data.
Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.
Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including penalties, fines, imprisonment and/or exclusion or suspension from federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid and debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions on behalf of the U.S. government under the federal False Claims Act as well as under the false claims laws of several states.
Law enforcement authorities are increasingly focused on enforcing fraud and abuse laws, and it is possible that some of our practices may be challenged under these laws. Efforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties, and our business generally, will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. If our operations, including our arrangements with physicians and other healthcare providers are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs (such as Medicare and Medicaid), and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. In addition, our gene therapy programs for Strimvelis and Libmeldy were approved by the EMA in 2016 and 2020, respectively, and the approval and commercialization of Strimvelis and Libmeldy subjects us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws. The approval and commercialization of any of our other gene therapies outside the United States will also likely subject us to foreign equivalents of the healthcare laws mentioned above, among other foreign laws.
If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business are found to be not in compliance with applicable laws, they may be subject to criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs, which may also adversely affect our business.
The risk of our being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of these laws have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are open to a variety of interpretations. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management’s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain a robust system to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance and reporting requirements increases the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements. Efforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial cost.
Healthcare reform
 The United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes that affect the healthcare system and which could prevent or delay marketing approval of our potential products, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell products, if approved.
In the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. As one example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or the ACA, was passed, which substantially changed the way health care is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. Since its enactment, there have been numerous judicial, administrative, executive and legislative challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as we expect there will be additional challenges and amendments to the ACA in the future.
In Europe, delivery of healthcare is largely a matter of national law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of health care and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. Budgetary constraints could affect our ability to profitably sell approved products in certain jurisdictions.

We expect that healthcare reform measures may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and downward pressure on the price that we receive for approved products. There have been, and likely will continue to be, legislative and regulatory proposals at the foreign, federal and state levels directed at lowering the cost of healthcare. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from generating sufficient revenue, attaining profitability or commercializing additional products.
 Coverage and reimbursement
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any gene therapies for which we obtain regulatory approval. In the United States and markets in other countries, sales of any gene therapies for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend, in part, on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from payors. Payors include government authorities, managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations. Patients who are prescribed treatments for their conditions and providers generally rely on these third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the associated healthcare. The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product may be separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list, or formulary, which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. A decision by a payor not to cover our gene therapies could reduce physician utilization of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be approved. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development and manufacturing costs.
The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or IRA, includes several provisions that may impact our business to varying degrees, including provisions that reduce the out-of-pocket cap for Medicare Part D beneficiaries to $2,000 starting in 2025; impose new manufacturer financial liability on certain drugs under Medicare Part D, allow the U.S. government to negotiate Medicare Part B and Part D price caps for certain high-cost drugs and biologics without generic or biosimilar competition, require companies to pay rebates to Medicare for certain drug prices that increase faster than inflation, and delay the rebate rule that would limit the fees that pharmacy benefit managers can charge. Further, under the IRA, orphan drugs are exempted from the Medicare drug price negotiation program, but only if they have one rare disease designation and for which the only approved indication is for that disease or condition. If a product receives multiple rare disease designations or has multiple approved indications, it may not qualify for the orphan drug exemption. The effects of the IRA on our business and the healthcare industry in general is not yet known.
 In addition, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payor to payor. One payor’s decision to cover a particular medical product or service does not ensure that other payors will also provide coverage for the medical product or service, or will provide coverage at an adequate reimbursement rate. In the United States, the principal decisions about reimbursement for new medicines are typically made by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. CMS decides whether and to what extent a new medicine will be covered and reimbursed under Medicare and private payors tend to follow CMS to a substantial degree.
 Additionally, the coverage determination process will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately and will be a time-consuming process.
Payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain and maintain coverage and reimbursement for any product, we may need to conduct expensive evidence generation studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of such a product, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. If payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to current standards of care, they may not cover the product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to cover its costs or make a profit.
Outside of the United States, the pricing of pharmaceutical products is subject to governmental control in many countries. For example, in the EU, pricing and reimbursement schemes vary widely from country to country. Some countries provide that products may be marketed only after a reimbursement price has been agreed with the government authority. Furthermore, some countries may require the completion of additional studies that compare the effectiveness and/or cost-effectiveness of a particular therapy to current standards of care as part of so-called health technology assessments, or HTAs, in order to obtain reimbursement or pricing approval. Additionally, there may be a need for activities to secure reimbursement for procedures associated with products administered in a hospital setting, such as Libmeldy, under the diagnosis-related group, or DRG, system, whereby a billing code may not exist or may be currently insufficient to cover the cost of the procedure. In other instances, countries may monitor and control product volumes and issue guidance to physicians to limit prescriptions in the form of treatment policies. Efforts to control prices and utilization of pharmaceutical products will likely continue as countries attempt to manage healthcare expenditures.
