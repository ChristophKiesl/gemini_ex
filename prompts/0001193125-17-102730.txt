Overview 
 RXi is a clinical-stage company developing innovative therapeutics based on our proprietary self-delivering RNAi (sd-rxRNA®) platform and Samcyprone, a topical immunomodulator, which address significant unmet medical needs. The Companys clinical development programs include RXI-109, an sd-rxRNA for the treatment of dermal and ocular scarring, and Samcyprone, for the treatment of warts. In January 2017, RXi acquired MirImmune Inc. (MirImmune), a privately-held company focused on the development of next generation immunotherapies for the treatment of cancer. With the acquisition of MirImmune, the Companys development programs have expanded from dermatology and ophthalmology to also include cell-based cancer immunotherapy. The Companys pipeline, coupled with our extensive patent portfolio, provides for product development and business development opportunities across a broad spectrum of therapeutic areas. 
Our Pipeline 
 Our pipeline focuses on three areas: dermatology, including cosmetic product development, ophthalmology and cell-based cancer immunotherapy. Our RNAi therapies are designed to silence, or down-regulate, the expression of a specific gene that may be over-expressed in a disease condition and our topical immunotherapy agent, Samcyprone, treats diseases by inducing, enhancing or suppressing an immune response in the skin. The following is a summary of our current product candidates and their development status:

Dermatology Franchise 
 RXI-109  Dermal Scarring 
 The Companys lead product candidate and first RNAi clinical product candidate, RXI-109, is a self-delivering RNAi compound (sd-rxRNA) that commenced human clinical trials in 2012. RXI-109 is designed to reduce the expression of connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), a critical regulator of several biological pathways involved in fibrosis, including scar formation in the skin and eye. RXI-109 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2 clinical trial, Study 1402, to prevent or reduce dermal scarring following scar revision surgery of an existing hypertrophic scar. 
 The Company initially conducted two Phase 1 clinical trials evaluating RXI-109 in a surgical setting. Both trials demonstrated the safety and tolerability of RXI-109 in ascending single and multi-doses, and also provided the first evidence of clinical activity in a surgical setting. With the successful completion of the Phase 1 trials, in November 2013 the Company initiated its Phase 2 program for RXI-109 with Study 1301, a Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating the use of RXI-109 to prevent the recurrence of hypertrophic scars following scar revision surgery. Enrollment and dosing for this study have been completed. 
 Preliminary data observations from Study 1301 were used in the design of the Companys second Phase 2 clinical trial in hypertrophic scars, Study 1402, which commenced in July 2014. In October 2015, we reported that preliminary data from Study 1402 demonstrated that scars at revision sites were judged to be better at three months after a treatment regimen with five mg/cm intradermal administration of RXI-109 than scars at untreated revision sites in those same subjects. Based in part on this new information, two more cohorts were added to Study 1402 in November 2015. For these two cohorts, the number of doses was increased to either eight or nine doses of RXI-109 over a six-month period to better cover the extended wound healing/scarring profile of hypertrophic scars. Enrollment of subjects into these two new cohorts completed ahead of schedule during the third quarter of 2016. 
 In December 2016, the Company announced that preliminary data from the first two cohorts from Study 1402 at nine months confirmed the positive differentiation of treated surgery incisions from untreated for a subset of subjects treated with five mg/cm of RXI-109 that was observed at three months. In addition, these data extend this observation to all time points, including the post-treatment follow-up period through nine months post-surgery. RXI-109 was safe and well tolerated. A complete read-out of the whole study, including all four cohorts with follow-up until nine months post-surgery, is expected in the second half of 2017. 
 Scarring represents a high unmet medical need as there are currently no U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved therapies in the U.S. for the treatment and prevention of scars in the skin. Scar revision surgery is one treatment option, but often the scar recurs. If approved, RXI-109 could be a first-in-class RNAi treatment for the prevention or reduction of post-surgical dermal scarring. Given the large number of surgical procedures, there is a significant market for a scar prevention therapeutic such as RXI-109.
Samcyprone   Warts
In December 2014, the Company broadened its clinical pipeline with an exclusive, global license to Samcyprone, our second clinical candidate. Samcyprone is a proprietary topical formulation of the small molecule diphenylcyclopropenone (DPCP), an immunomodulator that works by initiating a T-cell response. The use of Samcyprone allows sensitization using much lower concentrations of DPCP than are used with existing compounded DPCP solutions, avoiding hyper-sensitization to subsequent challenge doses. DPCP, the active ingredient in Samcyprone, has long been used to treat warts and has also been used for several other indications, such as to stimulate hair re-growth in alopecia areata and to clear cutaneous metastases of melanoma. In March 2015, the FDA granted Orphan Drug Designation to the Company for Samcyprone for the treatment of malignant melanoma stages IIb to IV. Samcyprone is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2a clinical trial, Study 1502, for the clearance of common warts. 
 Study 1502, initiated in December 2015, includes a sensitization phase in which a spot on the subjects upper arm and one or more warts are treated with Samcyprone. After being sensitized in this way, the subjects will enter into the treatment phase where up to four warts are treated on a once weekly basis for ten weeks with a ten-fold lower concentration of Samcyprone than in the sensitization phase. During the trial, the warts are scored, photographed and measured to monitor the level of clearance. The Company has added a second cohort to the study and is currently enrolling subjects to explore the opportunity to reduce the sensitization dose level and potentially reduce the treatment length. With this second cohort, enrollment is expected to be completed in the second half of 2017.

In December 2016, the Company announced the results from a preliminary review of sensitization and wart clearance data from a subset of subjects that have completed the ten-week treatment phase of Study 1502. Results showed that greater than 90% of the subjects demonstrated a sensitization response, a prerequisite to be able to develop a therapeutic response. Additionally, more than 60% of the subjects responded to the treatment by exhibiting either complete or greater than 50% clearance of all treated warts with up to ten weekly treatments. Samcyprone treatment has been generally safe and well tolerated and has had drug-related adverse events relating to local reactions, which are typically expected for this type of treatment due to the sensitization and challenge responses in the skin. The complete readout of the final study is anticipated in the second half of 2017. 
 Cutaneous warts are extremely common, being experienced by most people at some time during their lives. Although most warts will spontaneously disappear without treatment, treatment is sought for recalcitrant warts and to prevent recurrence. There are many different treatment modalities for warts, including physical destruction and immunomodulation. However, treatment of warts is complicated by low success rates, prolonged duration of therapy and the potential for recurrence. There is a clear unmet need for new therapies for warts, and if approved, Samcyprone could be a more effective and convenient treatment than the currently available therapies. 
 Additional Dermatology Programs
In addition to our dermal scarring and wart programs, we continue to advance our preclinical and discovery programs with our sd-rxRNA technology. The Company has selected tyrosinase (TYR) and collagenase (MMP1) as targets for our self-delivering platform because they are relevant for both consumer health and therapeutic development. TYR is a key enzyme in the synthesis of melanin. Melanin is produced by melanocytes and is the pigment that gives human skin, hair and eyes their color. The inhibition of TYR can play a key role in the management of skin conditions including cutaneous hyperpigmentation disorders such as lentigines (freckles, age spots and liver spots) and possibly melanoma. MMP1 is a key enzyme involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix. Reduction of MMP1 may be beneficial in the treatment of skin aging disorders, arthritis, acne scarring, blistering skin disorders, corneal erosions, endometriosis and possibly cancer metastasis. 
Cosmetic Development 
 Cosmetics are compounds that affect the appearance of the skin and make no preventative or therapeutic claims. These compounds may be developed more rapidly than therapeutics, therefore the path to market may be much shorter and less expensive. In October 2015, we announced the selection of lead compounds targeting TYR and MMP1 for cosmetic development. 
 RXI-231  Uneven Skin Tone and Pigmentation 
 RXI-231, an sd-rxRNA compound targeting TYR, is in development as a cosmetic ingredient that may improve the appearance of uneven skin tone and pigmentation. Efficacy and toxicity testing in cell culture and skin equivalents for RXI-231 was successfully completed in December 2016. The Company is currently coordinating with a U.S. clinical testing site to initiate human testing of RXI-231 in the second quarter of 2017. RXI-231 has been manufactured in sufficient quantities to support this activity. In addition to evaluating safety, the effect of RXI-231 on the appearance of skin pigmentation will be assessed. 
 RXI-185  Wrinkles and Skin Laxity 
 RXI-185, an sd-rxRNA compound targeting MMPI, is in development as a cosmetic ingredient that may improve the appearance of wrinkles or skin laxity. Results from studies by the Company have shown a pronounced reduction in MMPI mRNA levels that correspond to a similar reduction in MMPI enzyme activity in cell culture in vitro. 
Ophthalmology Franchise 
 RXI-109  Retinal Scarring 
 As in dermal scarring, RXI-109 can also be used to target CTGF in the eye, where CTGF is known to be involved in retinal scarring. Building on the work in our dermal clinical program, the Company filed a new investigational drug application (IND) in July 2015 for RXI-109 as a potential therapeutic for the scarring component of retinal diseases in the eye, such as wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In November 2015, we initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to evaluate the safety and clinical activity of RXI-109 in reducing the progression of retinal scarring.

Study 1501 is a multi-dose, dose escalation study conducted in subjects with AMD with evidence of subretinal fibrosis. Each subject will receive four doses of RXI-109 by intraocular injection at one month intervals for a total dosing period of three months. The safety and tolerability of RXI-109, as well as the potential for clinical activity, will be evaluated over the course of the study using numerous assessments to monitor the health of the retina and to assess visual acuity. The first two cohorts in Study 1501 have been completely enrolled and dosing in the third cohort at the highest planned dose level has begun. To date there have been no safety issues that precluded continuation of dosing. Complete enrollment is anticipated in the first half of 2017, ahead of our original plan, with complete subject participation anticipated in the second half of 2017. 
 Currently, there is no effective way to prevent the formation or progression of retinal scars that may occur as a consequence of a number of debilitating ocular diseases. In advanced neo-vascular or wet-AMD, our first area of study, retinal scarring often results in continued vision loss even if the patient is being treated with an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. RXI-109 has the potential to fill this unmet medical need by reducing this continuing damage to the retina and in doing so help preserve these patients vision for a longer period of time. 
 Additional Ophthalmology Programs 
 In addition to the clinical trial for the use of RXI-109 as a potential therapeutic for retinal scarring, we are advancing other early-stage ophthalmology programs. Currently, the Company is directing its development efforts toward advancing RXI-109 for the treatment of corneal scarring. To date, our preclinical studies have shown that CTGF protein levels are reduced in a dose-dependent manner in both the retina and cornea following an intravitreal injection of RXI-109 in monkeys. Elevated CTGF is implicated in the formation of corneal scarring that can occur after eye injury or after certain infections, and it has been proposed that a reduction of CTGF may be an important step towards reducing corneal scarring. Scarring of the cornea can impact the transparency of the cornea, and thus negatively impact vision. We are currently working towards a non-invasive delivery formulation of RXI-109 to reduce CTGF in the front of the eye. 
 Cell-based Cancer Immunotherapy 
 In January 2017, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement (the Stock Purchase Agreement) pursuant to which it acquired 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of MirImmune for an aggregate of 2,750,351 shares of common stock of the Company and 1,115,579 shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (the Series C Preferred Stock), subject to a holdback of 3% of the aggregate closing consideration for any purchase-price adjustments. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, if certain development or commercial milestones are achieved within two years, the Company will be required to either (i) issue to the sellers a number of shares of common stock or (ii) pay the equivalent value in cash. 
 Prior to its acquisition by the Company, MirImmune was a privately held biopharmaceutical company engaged in the development of cancer immunotherapies. The Company previously granted an exclusive license to MirImmune in March 2015 to utilize the Companys novel and proprietary sd-rxRNA technology for use in developing ex vivo cell-based cancer immunotherapies. 
 Our approach to immunotherapy builds on well-established methodologies of adoptive cell transfer. Immune cells, such as T-lymphocytes, are isolated from specific patients or retrieved from allogeneic immune cell banks and then expanded and sometimes processed to express tumor-binding receptors. Our method will introduce a new and important step in ex vivo processing of immune cells. This step uses our sd-rxRNA technology to reduce or eliminate the expression of immunosuppressive receptors or proteins by the therapeutic immune cells, potentially making them less sensitive to tumor resistance mechanism and thus improving their ability to destroy the tumor cells. 
 The Companys approach builds on current immunotherapy approaches but provides some key advantages. One major advantage is that pre-treatment with our targeted compounds allows multiple immune checkpoints to be attenuated within the same therapeutic cell, an improvement which could dramatically increase their tumor cell killing capability. In addition, these therapeutic immune cells may lack some known side effects associated with the checkpoint inhibitor toxicity while potentially improving efficacy over current immunotherapy approaches.

Using our sd-rxRNA technology, MirImmune demonstrated in vitro that multiple sd-rxRNA compounds can be used alone or in combination to target and silence extracellular, as well as intracellular, checkpoints in immune cells. Additional in vitro data demonstrated that PD-1 silencing by sd-rxRNA in patient-derived tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) resulted in enhanced killing of melanoma tumor cells from the same patient in culture. MirImmune also showed in a mouse model of human ovarian cancer that in vivo treatment with mesothelin-targeting CAR T-cells transfected with a PD-1 targeting sd-rxRNA significantly reduced the rate of tumor growth as compared to vehicle control. Furthermore, the silencing of PD-1 in the CAR T-cells isolated from these tumors persisted for at least one month. 
 In December 2016, new data was provided by MirImmune demonstrating silencing of a number of undisclosed immunosuppressive targets in natural killer cells (NK cells) using our sd-rxRNA compounds. This adds to a remarkable set of immune checkpoint modulation studies in human T cells, including CAR T-cells and TILs. In immune cells tested to date, the sd-rxRNA treatment results in potent silencing while maintaining close to 100% transfection efficiency and nearly full cell viability. Moreover, the silencing effect has been validated in a number of clinically used cell treatment protocols. 
 MirImmune identified lead sd-rxRNA compounds for each of six different checkpoints, including PD-1, CTLA-4 and other extracellular and intracellular targets. The Company plans to build on the work completed by MirImmune prior to its acquisition by the Company to advance the potential of our sd-rxRNA platform for use in cell-based cancer immunotherapy. In 2017, the Company plans to (i) initiate an internal program to evaluate the reduction of cytokines involved in cytokine release syndrome, (ii) release data on multiple checkpoint inhibiting sd-rxRNA compounds co-transfected in CAR T-cells in mouse models for solid tumors and (iii) share preclinical results on our use of sd-rxRNA with TILs in melanoma. 
 Market Opportunity 
 As there are currently no FDA-approved drugs to prevent scar formation, a therapeutic of this type could have great benefit for trauma and surgical patients, particularly as a treatment during the surgical revision of existing unsatisfactory scars. According to the American Society for Plastic Surgery, there are approximately 180,000 scar revision surgeries in the United States every year. In addition to cosmetic and reconstructive surgeries, medical interventions which could incorporate an anti-scarring agent include treatment of scarring that results from trauma, surgery or burns (especially relating to raised or hypertrophic scarring or contracture scarring), and surgical revision of existing unsatisfactory scars. Moreover, there are over 42 million medical procedures in the U.S. each year that could potentially benefit from a therapeutic treatment that could successfully reduce or prevent scarring; thus, the market potential is quite large. 
 AMD is the leading cause of severe vision loss in adults over age 50. According to the National Eye Institute, in 2010 approximately 2.07 million people had AMD. The National Eye Institute further states that as the proportion of people in the U.S. age 65 and older grows larger, more people are developing age-related diseases, such as AMD. Due to the aging population, this number is expected to double to an estimated 5.44 million people in the year 2050. There is no cure for AMD and over 50% of patients start to develop scarring after 2 years on anti-VEGF therapy, the current standard of care. This represents a large number of patients with an unmet medical need that could benefit from a therapeutic treatment that could successfully reduce or prevent scarring in the retina, and thereby improve vision loss. 
 Overexpression of CTGF is implicated in dermal scarring, subretinal fibrosis and other fibrotic diseases. Because of this, we believe that RXI-109 or other CTGF-targeting RNAi compounds may be able to treat the fibrotic component of numerous additional indications. These indications are as wide ranging as acute spinal injury, endometriosis, organ fibrosis including liver and pulmonary fibrosis, cutaneous scleroderma and vascular restenosis, in addition to numerous ocular diseases that result in retinal scarring. If the current clinical trials of RXI-109 produce successful results, we may explore opportunities in these additional indications that can be accessed by local administration, starting with intradermal or intravitreal injection. Although the Company does not intend to develop systemic uses of RXI-109 at this time, the Company is open to business development and out-licensing opportunities for those applications. 
 DPCP, the active ingredient in Samcyprone, is a small molecule that has been used since the late 1970s to stimulate regrowth of hair in patients with alopecia areata. Recent publications have supported its use as an immunomodulator for the treatment of alopecia areata, warts and cutaneous metastases of malignant melanoma, a combined market potential of over an estimated $1 billion. Although it has been used by physicians for several decades, it has never been reviewed or approved by a regulatory authority as a drug. If FDA approval is granted, Samcyprone, RXis proprietary formulation of DPCP, is expected to achieve market exclusivity.

Despite many advances, there is still a significant unmet need for cancer treatments. There are currently close to 180 therapies across various phases of development in the T-cell immunotherapy market. This growth is supported by robust and opportunistic pipelines targeting various indications. Pharmaceutical and large biotechnology companies are actively looking for complementary technology platforms that enhance their cellular pipelines. Initial clinical trials of adoptive cell transfer, our approach to immunotherapy, have shown limited success in treatment of solid tumors. One of the major issues is the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Multiple inhibitory receptors, or immune checkpoints, are responsible for immunosuppression. Our sd-rxRNA treatment can be seamlessly integrated in existing and new adoptive cell transfer therapies to overcome immunosuppression issues. Our sd-rxRNA compounds silence various immunosuppressive genes and boost the ability of therapeutic cells to kill tumors, while offering a safe and versatile approach to reduction of immunosuppression in therapeutic cells. 
 Introduction to RNAi 
 RNAi is a naturally occurring phenomenon where short, double-stranded RNA molecules interfere with the expression of targeted genes. The discovery of RNAi is regarded as a significant advancement in the scientific community, as evidenced by the 2006 Nobel Prize in Medicine awarded to the co-discoverers of RNAi, including Dr. Craig Mello, one of the founders of RXi. 
 RNAi offers a novel approach to the drug development process because RNAi compounds can potentially be designed to target any one of the thousands of human genes, many of which are undruggable by other modalities. The specificity of RNAi is achieved by an intrinsic, well-understood biological mechanism based on designing the sequence of an RNAi compound to match the sequence of the targeted gene. The sequence of the entire human genome is now known, and the mRNA coding sequence for many proteins is already available. Supported by numerous gene-silencing reports and our own research, we believe that this sequence information can be used to design RNAi compounds to interfere with the expression of almost any specific gene. 
 Our RNAi Therapeutic Platform 
 The first design of RNAi compounds to be pursued for the development of human therapeutics were short, double-stranded RNAs that included at least one overhanging single-stranded region and limited modifications, known as small-interfering RNA, or siRNA, which we will also refer to as classic siRNA. 
 We believe that classic siRNAs have drawbacks that may limit the usefulness of those agents as human therapeutics, and that we may be able to utilize the technologies we have licensed and developed internally to optimize RNAi compounds for use as human therapeutic agents. For sd-rxRNA, it is the combination of the duplex length, the nucleotide sequence and the configuration of chemical modifications that are important for effective RNAi therapeutics. 
 Drug delivery has been the primary challenge in developing RNAi therapeutics since its initial discovery. One conventional solution to the delivery problem involves encapsulation into a lipid-based particle, such as a liposome, to improve circulation time and cellular uptake. Scientists at RXi have used an alternative approach to delivery in which drug-like properties were built into the RNAi compound itself. These novel compounds are termed self-delivering RNAi compounds or sd-rxRNA.
sd-rxRNAs are hybrid oligonucleotide compounds that the Company believes combine the beneficial properties of both conventional RNAi and antisense technologies. Traditional, single-stranded antisense compounds have favorable tissue distribution and cellular uptake properties. However, they do not have the intracellular potency that is a hallmark of double-stranded RNAi compounds. Conversely, the duplex structure and hydrophilic character of traditional RNAi compounds results in poor tissue distribution and cellular uptake. In an attempt to combine the best properties of both technologies, sd-rxRNA have a single-stranded phosphorothioate region, a short duplex region, and contain a variety of nuclease-stabilizing and lipophilic chemical modifications. The combination of these features allows sd-rxRNA to achieve efficient spontaneous cellular uptake and potent, long-lasting intracellular activity.

We believe that our next generation sd-rxRNA compounds offer significant advantages over siRNAs used by other companies developing RNAi therapeutics, highlighted by the following characteristics: 
 

 | Efficient cellular uptake in the absence of a delivery vehicle;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------


 | Potent RNAi activity;
--+----------------------


 | More resistant to nuclease degradation than unformulated oligonucleotides;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Able to suppress long non-coding RNAs, both in cytoplasm and the nucleus;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Readily manufactured;
--+----------------------


 | Potentially more specific for the target gene; and
--+---------------------------------------------------


 | More reliable at blocking immune side effects than classic siRNA.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Route of Administration 
 The route by which an RNAi therapeutic is brought into contact with the body depends on the intended organ or tissue to be treated. Delivery routes can be simplified into two major categories: (1) local (when a drug is delivered directly to the tissue of interest); and (2) systemic (when a drug accesses the tissue of interest through the circulatory system). Local delivery may avoid some hurdles associated with systemic approaches such as rapid clearance from circulation and inefficient tissue extravasation (crossing the endothelial barrier from the blood stream). However, the local delivery approach can only be applied to a limited number of organs or tissues (e.g., skin, eye, lung and potentially the central nervous system). 
 The key to therapeutic success with RNAi lies in delivering intact RNAi compounds to the target tissue and the interior of the target cells. To accomplish this, we have developed a comprehensive platform that includes chemically synthesized RNAi compounds that are optimized for stability and efficacy and combine efficient cellular uptake with a local delivery approach. 
 Our sd-rxRNA molecules have unique properties that improve tissue and cell uptake. We have studied sd-rxRNA molecules in animal models for dermal and ocular delivery. Direct administration of sd-rxRNA via injection with no additional delivery vehicle to the skin or to the eye demonstrates that target gene silencing can be measured after local administration. The dose levels required for these direct-injection methods are small and suitable for clinical development. The Company has a number of clinical trials currently ongoing with RXI-109, an sd-rxRNA compound, for local delivery in the skin and the eye. Other target tissues that are potentially accessible for local delivery using sd-rxRNA compounds include the lung, the central nervous system, mucosal tissues and sites of inflammation and tumor (direct administration). 
 We have also studied our sd-rxRNA compounds for use in the well-established methodologies of adoptive cell transfer. Immune cells are isolated from specific patients or retrieved from allogeneic immune cell banks and then expanded and possibly processed to express tumor-binding receptors. Our process involves ex vivo treatment of the immune cells with our sd-rxRNA compounds to inhibit the expression of immune checkpoint genes. The enhanced cells are then returned and used to treat the same patient. 
 Introduction to Samcyprone 
 Immunotherapy is the treatment of disease by inducing, enhancing or suppressing an immune response. Active agents in immunotherapy are collectively called immunomodulators. They are a diverse array of recombinant, synthetic and natural preparations that help to regulate or normalize the immune system. 
Our Samcyprone Therapeutic Pipeline 
 Samcyprone, licensed by the Company in 2014, is a proprietary topical formulation of the small molecule DPCP. DPCP has been used for decades as a treatment to stimulate hair re-growth in patients with alopecia areata and more recently as a treatment for recalcitrant wart removal and as an aid in the reduction of cutaneous metastases of melanoma. As it is currently used, a doctor must prescribe DPCP to be formulated by a compounding facility, generally in acetone.

 There are no standardized methods of formulation or procedures for use. Because it works by causing an immune response, the level of response can vary greatly from person to person. Moreover, some pharmacies will not even compound it, even if it is prescribed. 
 Samcyprone works by initiating a T-cell response. T-cells or T lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell that play a key role in cell-mediated immunity. The use of Samcyprone will improve ease of use, allow for lower sensitizing and challenge doses than in current use and should result in an improved safety margin and a more consistent immune response. 
 There will be several advantages to using an FDA regulated formulation like the one we are developing. First, the amount of DPCP used in our own ointment formulation is lower than that generally used in acetone formulation. This should result in reduced side effects that happen due to accidental over-sensitization when a higher than necessary concentration is used. Second, we are developing an optimized dosing regimen so that a standardized response can be expected. And third, the ointment formulation will be easier to prescribe and to use than an acetone formulation, allowing for ease of application at the appropriate site on the skin. 
 Intellectual Property 
 We protect our proprietary information by means of United States and foreign patents, trademarks and copyrights. In addition, we rely upon trade secret protection and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information and products. We have pending patent applications that relate to potential drug targets, compounds we are developing to modulate those targets, methods of making or using those compounds and proprietary elements of our drug discovery platform. 
 Much of our technology and many of our processes depend upon the knowledge, experience and skills of key scientific and technical personnel. To protect our rights to our proprietary know-how and technology, we require all employees, as well as our consultants and advisors when feasible, to enter into confidentiality agreements that require disclosure and assignment to us of ideas, developments, discoveries and inventions made by these employees, consultants and advisors in the course of their service to us, and we vigorously defend that position with partners, as well as with employees who leave the Company. 
 We have also obtained rights to various patents and patent applications under licenses with third parties, which require us to pay royalties, milestone payments, or both. The degree of patent protection for biotechnology products and processes, including ours, remains uncertain, both in the United States and in other important markets, because the scope of protection depends on decisions of patent offices, courts and lawmakers in these countries. There is no certainty that our existing patents or others, if obtained, will afford us substantial protection or commercial benefit. Similarly, there is no assurance that our pending patent applications or patent applications licensed from third parties will ultimately be granted as patents or that those patents that have been issued or are issued in the future will stand if they are challenged in court. We assess our license agreements on an ongoing basis, and may from time to time terminate licenses to technology that we do not intend to employ in our technology platforms, or in our product discovery or development activities. 
 Patents and Patent Applications 
 We are actively prosecuting thirty-two patent families, including those acquired from MirImmune, covering our compounds and technologies, including RXI-109 and Samcyprone. A combined summary of these patents and patent applications is set forth below in the following table:

 Advirna LLC. In September 2011, we entered into an agreement with Advirna, LLC (Advirna) pursuant to which Advirna assigned to us its existing patent and technology rights related to sd-rxRNA technology in exchange for our agreement to issue 5% of the Companys fully-diluted shares, pay an annual maintenance fee of $100,000 and pay a one-time milestone payment of $350,000 upon the issuance of the first patent with valid claims covering the assigned technology. The common shares of the Company were issued to Advirna in 2012 and the one-time milestone payment was paid in 2014. Additionally, we will be required to pay a 1% royalty to Advirna on any license revenue received by us with respect to future licensing of the assigned Advirna patent and technology rights. We also granted back to Advirna a license under the assigned patent and technology rights for fields of use outside human therapeutics and diagnostics. 
 Our rights under the Advirna agreement will expire upon the later of: (i) the expiration of the last-to-expire of the patent rights (as defined therein) or (ii) the abandonment of the last-to-be abandoned of such patents, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the provisions of the agreement. 
 We may terminate the Advirna agreement at any time upon 90 days written notice to Advirna, and Advirna may terminate the agreement upon 90 days prior written notice in the event that we cease using commercially reasonable efforts to research, develop, license or otherwise commercialize the patent rights or royalty-bearing products (as defined therein), provided that we may refute such claim within such 90-day period by showing budgeted expenditures for the research, development, licensing or other commercialization consistent with other technologies of similar stage of development and commercial potential as the patent rights or royalty-bearing products. Further, either party at any time 
 
10 
 
 may provide to the other party written notice of a material breach of the agreement. If the other party fails to cure the identified breach within 90 days after the date of the notice, the aggrieved party may terminate the agreement by written notice to the party in breach. 
 Hapten Pharmaceuticals, LLC. In December 2014, the Company entered into an Assignment and License Agreement with Hapten Pharmaceuticals, LLC (Hapten) under which Hapten agreed, effective at a closing that was subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions which occurred in February 2015, to sell and assign to us certain patent rights and related assets and rights, including an investigational new drug application and clinical data, for Haptens Samcyprone products for therapeutic and prophylactic use. Under the Assignment and License Agreement and upon the closing, Hapten received a one-time upfront cash payment of $100,000 and we issued to Hapten 20,000 shares of common stock of the Company. Pursuant to the Assignment and License Agreement, Hapten will be entitled to receive: (i) future milestone payments tied to the achievement of certain clinical and commercial objectives (all of which payments may be made at our option in cash or through the issuance of common stock) and (ii) escalating royalties based on product sales by us and any sublicensees. 
 We have certain customary diligence obligations under the Assignment and License Agreement requiring us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize one or more products covered by the Assignment and License Agreement, which obligations, if not performed, could result in rights assigned or licensed to us reverting back to Hapten. 
 In addition to the license agreements listed above, the Company has entered into and may enter into other license agreements that may benefit us as we develop our RNAi and Samcyprone pipelines. 
 Other Strategic Agreements 
 OPKO Health, Inc. In March 2013, the Company entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with OPKO Health, Inc. (OPKO) (the Asset Purchase Agreement), in which we acquired substantially all of its RNAi-related assets, which included patents and patent applications, licenses, clinical and preclinical data and other related assets. In exchange for the assets that we purchased from OPKO, we issued 166,667 shares of our common stock and agreed to pay, if applicable: (i) up to $50 million in development and commercialization milestones for the successful development and commercialization of each Qualified Drug (as defined therein) and (ii) royalty payments equal to: (a) a mid-single-digit percentage of Net Sales (as defined therein) with respect to each Qualified Drug sold for an ophthalmologic use during the applicable Royalty Period (as defined therein) and (b) a low-single-digit percentage of Net Sales with respect to each Qualified Drug sold for a non-ophthalmologic use during the applicable Royalty Period. 
 We have certain customary diligence obligations under the Asset Purchase Agreement requiring us to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop and commercialize one or more products covered by the Asset Purchase Agreement, which obligations, if not performed, could result in assets transferred and rights assigned or licensed to us reverting back to OPKO. 
 MirImmune Inc. In March 2015, RXi granted an exclusive license to MirImmune to utilize the Companys novel and proprietary sd-rxRNA technology for MirImmunes use in developing ex vivo cell-based cancer immunotherapies to target immune inhibitory pathways (checkpoints) which are responsible for limiting the efficacy of cancer immunotherapies. Under the terms of the agreement, MirImmune was responsible for all research, development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization activities for the licensed products. 
 On October 7, 2016, RXi entered into an exclusive option agreement pursuant to which the Company had the exclusive option, but not the obligation, to purchase 100% of the outstanding capital stock of MirImmune. In January 2017, the Company exercised the option and entered into the Stock Purchase Agreement pursuant to which it acquired 100% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of MirImmune for an aggregate of 2,750,371 shares of common stock of the Company and 1,115,579 shares of Series C Preferred Stock, subject to a holdback of 3% of the aggregate closing consideration for any purchase-price adjustments. Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, if certain development or commercial milestones are achieved within two years, the Company will be required to either (i) issue to MirImmunes shareholders a number of shares of common stock or (ii) pay the equivalent value in cash. 
 
11 
 
Thera Neuropharma, Inc. In May 2016, RXi granted an exclusive license to Thera Neuropharma, Inc. (Thera) to the Companys novel and proprietary sd-rxRNA platform to develop therapeutics for neurodegenerative diseases. Under the terms of the agreement, Thera will be responsible for all research, development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization activities for the licensed products. Theras initial focus will be on sd-rxRNA compounds targeting superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) for use in developing innovative treatments for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), commonly known as Lou Gehrigs disease. Upon execution of the license agreement, RXi was issued shares of common stock of Thera and was granted a five year warrant to purchase additional shares of common stock of Thera pursuant to the terms of the license agreement. The Company is eligible to receive future cash, additional equity and royalties based on the achievement of certain milestones. 
 Research and Development 
 To date, our research programs have primarily focused on developing technology necessary to make RNAi compounds available by local administration for diseases for which we intend to develop an RNAi therapeutic, identifying and testing RNAi compounds against therapeutically relevant targets in the fields of dermatology and ophthalmology and identifying lead product candidates and moving those product candidates into the clinic. With our recent acquisition of MirImmune, our research programs will also focus on developing, identifying and testing RNAi therapeutics in the field of cell-based cancer immunotherapy. Since we commenced operations, research and development has composed a significant proportion of our total operating expenses and is expected to compose the majority of our spending for the foreseeable future. 
 There are risks in any new field of drug discovery that preclude certainty regarding the successful development of a product. We cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of, or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from, any product candidate. Our inability to make these estimates results from the uncertainty of numerous factors, including but not limited to: 
 

 | Our ability to advance product candidates into preclinical research and clinical trials;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The scope and rate of progress of our preclinical program and other research and development activities;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The scope, rate of progress and cost of any clinical trials we commence;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The cost of filing, prosecuting, defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | Clinical trial results;
--+------------------------


 | The terms and timing of any collaborative, licensing and other arrangements that we may establish;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The cost and timing of regulatory approvals;
--+---------------------------------------------


 | The cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The cost and timing of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The effect of competing technological and market developments; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------


 | The effect of government regulation and insurance industry efforts to control healthcare costs through reimbursement policy and other cost management strategies.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Failure to complete any stage of the development of our product candidates in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial position and liquidity. 
 Research and Development Expense 
 Research and development expense consists of compensation-related costs for our employees dedicated to research and development activities, fees related to our Scientific Advisory Board members, expenses related to our ongoing research and development efforts primarily related to our clinical trials, drug manufacturing, outside contract services, licensing and patent fees and laboratory supplies and services for our research programs. We expect research and development expenses to increase as we expand our discovery, preclinical and clinical activities. 
 
12 
 
Total research and development expense for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $5,415,000 and $6,925,000, respectively. 
 Competition 
 We believe that numerous companies are investigating or plan to investigate a variety of proposed anti-scarring therapies or cell-based immunotherapies in clinical trials or are working in the RNAi area generally. Many other companies are pursuing non-RNAi-based therapies for one or more fibrotic disease indications, including ocular scarring or other indications that we may seek to pursue. The companies include large and small pharmaceuticals, chemical and biotechnology companies, as well as universities, government agencies and other private and public research organizations. 
 We believe that other companies currently developing anti-scarring therapies, both dermal and ocular, include CoDa Therapeutics, Inc., Sirnaomics, Inc., FirstString Research, Inc., Promedior, Inc., FibroGen, Inc., miRagen Therapeutics, Inc., Ophthotech Corporation, Vascular BioSciences, Allergan plc, and Suneva Medical, Inc. 
 We believe that other companies currently developing cell-based cancer immunotherapies include Juno Therapeutics, Inc., Kite Pharma, Inc., Cellectis S.A., Adaptimmune Therapeutics plc, Lion Biotechnologies, Inc., Bellicum Pharmaceuticals, Inc., and NantKwest, Inc. Many larger pharmaceutical companies such as Novartis International AG, Celgene Corporation, Pfizer Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, Amgen, Inc., Johnson & Johnson and EMD Serono, Inc. have entered the field through major deals with biotechnology companies and academia. 
 We believe that other companies working in the RNAi area, generally, include Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Benitec Biopharma Limited, Silence Therapeutics plc, Quark Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Arbutus Biopharma Corporation, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Dicerna Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Sylentis, S.A. and Roche Innovation Center Copenhagen A/S, as well as a number of large pharmaceutical companies. 
 We do not believe that there are any companies developing treatments for cutaneous warts that would be considered direct competitors with the Company; however, there are several existing treatments for cutaneous warts with which Samcyprone could potentially compete. Current topical medicinal treatments for warts include salicylic acid, off label use of Imiquimod and Picato® and the most common ablative treatments include removal through medical procedures, such as cryotherapy, surgery or chemical peels. 
 Government Regulation 
 The United States and many other countries extensively regulate the preclinical and clinical testing, manufacturing, labeling, storage, record-keeping, advertising, promotion, export, marketing and distribution of drugs and biologic products. The FDA regulates pharmaceutical and biologic products under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Public Health Service Act and other federal statutes and regulations. 
 To obtain approval of our future product candidates from the FDA, we must, among other requirements, submit data supporting safety and efficacy for the intended indication as well as detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate. In most cases, this will require extensive laboratory tests and preclinical and clinical trials. The collection of these data, as well as the preparation of applications for review by the FDA involve significant time and expense. The FDA also may require post-marketing testing to monitor the safety and efficacy of approved products or place conditions on any approvals that could restrict the therapeutic claims and commercial applications of these products. Regulatory authorities may withdraw product approvals if we fail to comply with regulatory standards or if we encounter problems at any time following initial marketing of our products. 
 The first stage of the FDA approval process for a new biologic or drug involves completion of preclinical studies and the submission of the results of these studies to the FDA. These data, together with proposed clinical protocols, manufacturing information, analytical data and other information submitted to the FDA in an IND application, must become effective before human clinical trials may commence. Preclinical studies generally involve FDA regulated laboratory evaluation of product characteristics and animal studies to assess the efficacy and safety of the product candidate. 
 
13 
 
After the IND becomes effective, a company may commence human clinical trials. These are typically conducted in three sequential phases, but the phases may overlap. Phase 1 trials consist of testing the product candidate in a small number of patients or healthy volunteers, primarily for safety at one or more doses. Phase 2 trials, in addition to safety, evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate in a patient population somewhat larger than Phase 1 trials. Phase 3 trials typically involve additional testing for safety and clinical efficacy in an expanded population at multiple test sites. A company must submit to the FDA a clinical protocol, accompanied by the approval of the Institutional Review Board (IRB) at the institutions participating in the trials, prior to commencement of each clinical trial. 
 To obtain FDA marketing authorization, a company must submit to the FDA the results of the preclinical and clinical testing, together with, among other things, detailed information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, in the form of a new drug application (an NDA), or, in the case of a biologic, a biologics license application (a BLA). 
 The amount of time taken by the FDA for approval of an NDA or BLA will depend upon a number of factors, including whether the product candidate has received priority review, the quality of the submission and studies presented, the potential contribution that the compound will make in improving the treatment of the disease in question and the workload at the FDA. 
 The FDA may, in some cases, confer upon an investigational product the status of a fast track product. A fast track product is defined as a new drug or biologic intended for the treatment of a serious or life threatening condition that demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition. The FDA can base approval of an NDA or BLA for a fast track product on an effect on a surrogate endpoint, or on another endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. If a preliminary review of clinical data suggests that a fast track product may be effective, the FDA may initiate review of entire sections of a marketing application for a fast track product before the sponsor completes the application. 
 We anticipate that our products will be manufactured by our strategic partners, licensees or other third parties. Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured and will not approve the product unless the manufacturing facilities are in compliance with the FDAs current good manufacturing practices (cGMP), which are regulations that govern the manufacture, holding and distribution of a product. Manufacturers of biologics also must comply with the FDAs general biological product standards. Our manufacturers also will be subject to regulation under the Occupational Safety and Health Act, the Nuclear Energy and Radiation Control Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act and the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and other applicable environmental statutes. Following approval, the FDA periodically inspects drug and biologic manufacturing facilities to ensure continued compliance with the cGMP. Our manufacturers will have to continue to comply with those requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements subjects the manufacturer to possible legal or regulatory action, such as suspension of manufacturing or recall or seizure of product. Adverse patient experiences with the product must be reported to the FDA and could result in the imposition of marketing restrictions through labeling changes or market removal. Product approvals may be withdrawn if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems concerning safety or efficacy of the product occur following approval. 
 The labeling, advertising, promotion, marketing and distribution of a drug or biologic product also must be in compliance with FDA and Federal Trade Commission requirements which include, among others, standards and regulations for off-label promotion, industry sponsored scientific and educational activities, promotional activities involving the internet, and direct-to-consumer advertising. We also will be subject to a variety of federal, state and local regulations relating to the use, handling, storage and disposal of hazardous materials, including chemicals and radioactive and biological materials. In addition, we will be subject to various laws and regulations governing laboratory practices and the experimental use of animals. In each of these areas, as above, the FDA has broad regulatory and enforcement powers, including the ability to levy fines and civil penalties, suspend or delay issuance of product approvals, seize or recall products and deny or withdraw approvals. 
 We will also be subject to a variety of regulations governing clinical trials and sales of our products outside the United States. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product candidate by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries and regions must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies from one regulatory authority to another and the time may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. In the European Union, Canada and Australia, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar, in principle, to those in the United States.

Environmental Compliance 
 Our research and development activities involve the controlled use of potentially harmful biological materials as well as hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specific waste products. We are also subject to numerous environmental, health and workplace safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures, exposure to blood-borne pathogens and the handling of bio-hazardous materials. The cost of compliance with these laws and regulations could be significant and may adversely affect capital expenditures to the extent we are required to procure expensive capital equipment to meet regulatory requirements. 
Employees 
 As of March 15, 2017, we had fifteen full-time employees, eight of whom were engaged in research and development, and seven of whom were engaged in management, administration and finance. None of our employees are represented by a labor union or covered by a collective bargaining agreement nor have we experienced any work stoppages.
