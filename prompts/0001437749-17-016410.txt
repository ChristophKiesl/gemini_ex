ITEM 1. – BUSINESS
Company Overview
 
Our principal business is the acquisition, exploration and development of mineral resources. We are primarily focused on the development of the Molo Graphite Project into a fully operational and sustainable graphite mine. 
 
The Molo Graphite Project currently consists of a commercially minable graphite deposit situated in the African country of Madagascar. No mine infrastructure currently exists at the Molo Graphite Project site. We have additional exploration-stage mineral properties situated in Madagascar, including the Green Giant Property. 
 
We have not generated operating revenues or paid dividends since inception on March 1, 2004 to the period ended June 30, 2017 and we are unlikely to do so in the immediate future. Our business activities have been entirely financed from the proceeds of securities subscriptions.
 
Our executive offices are situated at 1001–145 Wellington Street West, Toronto, Ontario, Canada, M5J 1H8 and the primary telephone number is (416) 364-4986. Our website is www.nextsourcematerials.com (which website is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing). 
 
We are incorporated in the State of Minnesota, USA and have a fiscal year end of June 30.
 
On April 19, 2017, the Company changed its name from Energizer Resources Inc. to NextSource Materials Inc. as part of our rebranding effort and to better reflect our evolution from an exploration-stage company into a mine-development company. Our new symbol on the Toronto Stock Exchange is “NEXT” and on the OTC Markets is “NSRC.”
 
During fiscal 2008, the Company incorporated Energizer (Mauritius) Ltd. (“ERMAU”), a Mauritius subsidiary, and Energizer Madagascar Sarl. (“ERMAD”), a Madagascar subsidiary of ERMAU. During fiscal 2009, the Company incorporated THB Ventures Ltd. (“THB”), a Mauritius subsidiary of ERMAU, and Energizer Minerals Sarl. (“ERMIN”), a Madagascar subsidiary of THB, which holds the 100% ownership interest of the Green Giant Property in Madagascar (see note 5). During fiscal 2012, the Company incorporated Madagascar-ERG Joint Venture (Mauritius) Ltd. (“ERGJVM”), a Mauritius subsidiary of ERMAU, and ERG (Madagascar) Sarl. (“ERGMAD”), a Madagascar subsidiary of ERGJVM, which holds the Malagasy Joint Venture Ground. During fiscal 2014, the Company incorporated 2391938 Ontario Inc., an Ontario, Canada subsidiary. 
 
Our authorized capital is 650,000,000 shares, with a par value of $0.001 per share, of which 640,000,000 are deemed common shares and the remaining 10,000,000 are deemed eligible to be divisible into classes, series and types with rights and preferences as designated by our Board of Directors. 
 
We have not had any bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceeding since incorporation. Except as described below, there have been no material reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or purchases or sales of any significant amount of assets not in the ordinary course of business since the date of incorporation.

Further details regarding each of our Madagascar properties, although not incorporated by reference, including the comprehensive feasibility studies prepared in accordance with Canada’s National Instrument 43-101 - Standards of Disclosure for Mineral Projects (“NI 43-101”) for the Molo Graphite Project and separately the technical report on the Green Giant Property in Madagascar can be found on the Company’s website at www.nextsourcematerials.com (which website is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing) or in the Company’s Canadian regulatory filings at www.sedar.com (which website and content is expressly not incorporated by reference into this filing).
 
We report mineral reserve estimates in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Industry Guide 7 (“Guide 7”) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “U.S. Securities Act”). As a reporting issuer in Canada with our primary trading market in Canada, we are also required to prepare reports on our mineral properties in accordance with NI 43-101. The technical reports referenced in this document use the terms “mineral resource,” “measured mineral resource,” “indicated mineral resource” and “inferred mineral resource”. These terms are defined in and required to be disclosed by NI 43-101; however, these terms are not defined terms under Guide 7 and are normally not permitted to be used in reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result, information in respect of our mineral resources determined in accordance with NI 43-101 is not contained in this document. 

Cautionary Note
 
Based on the nature of our business, we anticipate incurring operating losses for the foreseeable future. We base this expectation, in part, on the fact that very few mineral properties in the exploration stage are ultimately developed into producing and profitable mines. Our future financial results are uncertain due to a number of factors, some of which are outside the Company’s control. These factors include, but are not limited to: (a) our ability to raise additional funding; (b) the market price for graphite, vanadium, gold and/or uranium; (c) the results of the exploration programs and metallurgical analysis of our mineral properties; (d) the political instability and/or environmental regulations that may adversely impact costs and ability to operate in Madagascar; and (e) our ability to find joint venture and/or off-take partners in order to advance the development of our mineral properties.
 
Any future equity financing will cause existing shareholders to experience dilution of their ownership interest in the Company. In the event the Company is not successful in raising additional financing, we anticipate the Company will not be able to proceed with its business plan. In such a case, the Company may decide to discontinue or modify its current business plan and seek other business opportunities in the resource sector.
 
During this period, the Company will need to maintain periodic filings with the appropriate regulatory authorities and will incur legal, accounting, administrative and listing costs. In the event no other such opportunities are available and the Company cannot raise additional capital to sustain operations, the Company may be forced to discontinue the business. The Company does not have any specific alternative business opportunities under consideration and have not planned for any such contingency.
 
Due to the present inability to generate revenues, accumulated losses, recurring losses and negative operating cash flows, the Company has stated its opinion in Note 1 of our audited financial statements, as included in this annual report, that there currently exists substantial doubt regarding the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
 
Summary of Milestones
 
In July 2016, we appointed UK-based HCF International Advisers Limited ("HCF") as advisor in negotiating and structuring strategic partnerships, off take agreements and debt financing for our Molo Graphite Project in Madagascar. Discussions in respect of these matters have been ongoing for the past 26 months and are expected to continue during the coming months with no assurances as to the conclusion or results of these discussions. 
 
In August 2016, we initiated a Front-End Engineering Design Study (the “FEED Study”) and value engineering for our Molo Graphite Project in Madagascar. The FEED Study was undertaken in order to optimize the mine plan as envisioned in the technical report titled "Molo Feasibility Study – National Instrument 43-101 Technical Report on the Molo Graphite Project located near the village of Fotadrevo in the Province of Toliara, Madagascar", dated July 13, 2017, effective as of July 13, 2017 (the “Molo Feasibility Study”) and determine the optimal development path based on discussions with prospective strategic partners. All costing aspects were examined with the goal of providing a method to produce meaningful, multi-tonne test samples of Molo graphite concentrate to potential off-takers while reducing the CAPEX and time required to the commencement of commercial production.
 
 4



On November 7, 2016, we outlined a phased mine development plan for the Molo Graphite Project based on the FEED Study and value engineering. The results supported the construction of a plant to test and verify the flow sheet design from the Molo Feasibility Study. Under the existing Exploration Permit, the Company is limited to an ore input of 20,000 cubic meters (or approximately 50,000 tonnes) of front-end feed into the demonstration plant. Upon approval of a full mining permit, the 20,000-cubic meter test limit would be removed and at full capacity, the demonstration plant would be capable of processing up to 240,000 tonnes of feed per annum, which equates to 30 tonnes per hour of ore feed and roughly 1 to 3 tonnes of flake graphite concentrate production per hour. 
 
Phase 1
 
Phase 1 would consist of a fully operational and sustainable graphite mine with a permanent processing plant capable of producing, in our estimation, approximately 17,000 tpa of high-quality SuperFlake™ graphite concentrate with a mine life of 30 years (as discussed below). The fully-modularized mining operation in this phase will use a 100% owner-operated fleet that we believe will process an average of 240,000 tonnes of ore per year (or 30 tonnes per hour) of mill feed (ore) that will be processed on site. Phase 1 will provide “proof of concept” for the modular methodology and allow NextSource the flexibility to optimize further the process circuit while being capable of supplying a true “run-of-mine” flake concentrate to potential off-takers and customers for final product validation. All supporting infrastructure including water, fuel, power, dry-stack tailings and essential buildings will be constructed during Phase 1 to sustain the fully operational and permanent processing plant. The plant will utilize dry-stack tailings in order to eliminate the up-front capital costs associated with a tailings dam. NextSource’s existing camp adjacent to the nearby town of Fotadrevo will be used to accommodate employees and offices, with additional housing available within the town for additional employees. 
Phase 2
 
Phase 2 would consist of a modular expansion to plant capable of producing approximately 50,000 tpa of high-quality SuperFlake™ graphite concentrate. Timing of the implementation of Phase 2 will be determined by market demand for SuperFlake™ graphite and will incorporate the unique full-modular build approach used in Phase 1. This phase will include the construction of additional on-site accommodation and offices, upgrading of road infrastructure, port facility upgrades, a wet tailings dam facility and further equipment purchases to provide redundancy within the processing circuit. The costs for these capital expenditures are unknown at this time, but will be assessed as part of an economic analysis completed in parallel with Phase 1 development. 
 
On June 1, 2017, we released the results of a positive updated Molo Feasibility Study for Phase 1 of the mine development plan utilizing a fully modular build-out approach which was based on the FEED Study and subsequent detailed engineering studies. Phase 1 would consist of a fully operational and sustainable graphite mine with a permanent processing plant capable of producing, in our estimation, approximately 17,000 tpa of high-quality SuperFlake™ graphite concentrate per year with a mine life of 30 years. The Phase 1 production costs were estimated at $433 per tonne at the plant and $688 per tonne delivered CIF port of Rotterdam. The Phase 1 capital costs were estimated at $18.4 million with a construction projected but not guaranteed timeline of approximately 9 months. Based on an average selling cost of $1,014 per tonne, the Phase 1 was estimated to have a pre-tax NPV of $34 million using an 8% discount rate, a pre-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 25.2%, and a post-tax IRR of 21.5%.
 
Summary of Future Plans

We have applied for a mining permit from the Government of Madagascar to begin construction of Phase 1 of the Molo Graphite Project. Although the Company believes it has complied with all permit requirements and has submitted all necessary documents, there can be no assurances as to the timing of the receipt of a mining permit.
 
In anticipation of receiving the mine permit and of eventual graphite production, we have continued to pursue negotiations in respect of potential off-take agreements with graphite end-users and intermediaries with the intention of securing project financing alternatives, which may include debt, equity and derivative instruments.
 
From the date of this report, and subject to availability of capital and unforeseen delays in receiving the mining permit for the Molo Graphite Project, our business plan during the next 12 months is to incur between $2,200,000 to $23,000,000 on further permitting, engineering, construction, professional fees, G&A and working capital costs to achieve initial production at the Molo Graphite Project by July 2018. No assurances can be provided that we will achieve our production objective by that date.

The following is a summary of the amounts budgeted to be incurred (presuming all $23,000,000 is required):
 

Professional Fees and General and Administrative | $ | 1,500,000 
-------------------------------------------------+---+-----------
Environmental and Permitting Fees | $ | 700,000 
Phase 1 Processing Plant CAPEX | $ | 14,500,000
Phase 1 Infrastructure CAPEX | $ | 400,000 
Construction Financing Costs | $ | 1,100,000 
Construction Contingency Costs (10%) | $ | 1,700,000 
Working Capital for Mine Startup | $ | 3,100,000 
Total | $ | 23,000,000

 
The above amounts may be updated based on actual costs and the timing may be delayed or adjusted based on several factors, including the availability of capital to fund the budget. We anticipate that the source of funds required to complete the budgeted items disclosed above will come from private placements in the capital markets, but there can be no assurance that financing will be available on terms favorable to the Company or at all.
 
We will also assess the addition of back-end value-added processing for lithium-ion battery and graphite foil applications in the classification portion of the plant. The costs for any value-added processing is unknown at this time, but will be assessed in parallel with the development of Phase 1.
 
Employees
 
As of the date of this annual report, we have 4 full-time employees and consultants based in Toronto and South Africa engaged in the management of the Company as well as several additional consultants in South Africa and Madagascar that serve managerial and non-managerial functions.
 
Competitive Conditions in our Industry
 
The mineral exploration and mining industry is competitive in all phases of exploration, development and production. We compete with a number of other entities and individuals in the search for, and acquisition of, attractive mineral properties. As a result of this competition, the majority of which is with companies with greater financial resources than us, we may not in the future be able to acquire attractive properties on terms our management considers acceptable. Furthermore, we compete with other resource companies, many of whom have greater financial resources and/or more advanced properties that are better able to attract equity investments and other capital. Factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of minerals mined or discovered by us.
 
Government Regulations and Permitting
 
The receipt of the exploitation permit is a critical step in the larger permitting and licensing regime.  The permitting and licensing of the Molo Graphite Project requires dedicated attention to ensure momentum is maintained during the application for and delivery of all necessary permits and licenses. 
 
The Molo Graphite Project exploration permit PR 3432 is currently held under the name of one of our Madagascar subsidiary ERG Madagascar SARLU. Our Madagascar subsidiaries have paid all taxes and administrative fees to the Madagascar government and its mining ministry with respect to all the mining permits held in country.  These taxes and administrative fee payments have been acknowledged and accepted by the Madagascar government.  In addition, we continue to diligently work with the Madagascar government to obtain the necessary permits as the country clears its backlog of applications and amendments.
 
We have applied to have the Molo Graphite Project exploration permit converted into an exploitation permit, which is expected to be completed in due course. The exploitation permit is required to advance the Molo Project into the developmental stage.
 
A comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment ("ESIA"), developed to local Malagasy, Equator Principles, World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) standards, is nearing completion. This process was preceded by an Environmental Legal Review and an Environmental and Social Screening Assessment; both providing crucial information to align the project development and design with international best practice on sustainable project development.
 
 6



Application for all necessary permits to construct and operate the mine, including water use, construction, mineral processing, transportation, export, and labour will be undertaken within the ESIA review period (6 months), which is expected to be from September 2017 till February 2018.
 
Security of land tenure is a process that is estimated to take 6-9 months to complete.  Compilation of a comprehensive legal register will also be required.
 
The Company cannot provide any assurance as to the timing of the receipt of the required permits and licenses.
 
Graphite Prices
 
Graphite prices are highly variable depending on the flake size, carbon content and level of processing.
 
Natural flake graphite prices rose steeply in 2010 and 2011 before declining steadily until mid-2016. This price peak was the result of graphite consumer fears that Chinese consolidation in the flake graphite sector, coupled with bullish forecasts for demand growth for use in lithium-ion batteries, would create an eventual shortage of supply and encouraged producers to hoard stocks and traders to speculate on prices. Instead, Chinese flake graphite consolidation continued but at a slower than expected pace and lithium-ion-based electric vehicle (“EV”) adoption rates were also been slower than first predicted.
 
This is expected to change over the next decade as the market for lithium-ion battery components increases graphite demand, resulting in price increases for battery grades.
 
Larger flake sizes and higher carbon grades have always achieved the highest price. The jumbo flake price premium is justified because of the use of the larger fractions in specialist applications. The actual market size for these larger fractions is relatively small but is forecast to grow over the next ten years.
 
The 3-year historic average price for global flake graphite across different flake sizes were as follows:
 

Global Flake Graphite Weighted Average Selling Price 
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 | 2014 | | 2015 | | | 2016 | | 3-Year Average
Jumbo Flake | $ | 1,821 | | $ | 1,530 | | $ | 1,470 | $ | 1,607
Large Flake | $ | 1,317 | | $ | 1,183 | | $ | 861 | $ | 1,120
Medium Flake | $ | 1,042 | | $ | 1,025 | | $ | 770 | $ | 946 
Fine Flake | $ | 965 | | $ | 846 | | $ | 668 | $ | 826 
Source: Flake graphite average prices provided by Roskill Consulting Group Ltd.

 
The rapid uptake of lithium-ion batteries between 2017 and 2030 is expected to encourage growth in the demand for fine and medium size flake graphite. The future price of flake graphite from 2017 until 2030 will be influenced by several factors until 2030, including:
 
● | Amount of graphite supply from new projects and expansions of existing projects in China and ROW
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Curtailment of flake graphite production in China as the government imposes environmental controls
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Demand and supply balance by graphite flake size
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | Growth of the lithium-ion battery market
--+-----------------------------------------


● | Competition from synthetic graphite
--+------------------------------------


● | Recycling of refractory graphite products

Cautionary note to U.S. investors regarding estimates of measured, indicated and inferred resources and proven and probable reserves
 
As used in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the terms “mineral reserve”, “proven mineral reserve” and “probable mineral reserve” are Canadian mining terms as defined in accordance with NI 43-101 and the Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM)-CIM Definition Standards on Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves, adopted by the CIM Council, as amended (“CIM Definition Standards”).
 
These definitions differ from the definitions in Guide 7 under the Securities Act. However, despite the differences in the definition between NI 43-101 and Guide 7:
 

● | Erudite Strategies (Pty) Ltd. has stated that the Proven and Probable Reserves reported in the Molo Feasibility Study are equal to the proven and probable reserves which would have been reported had the reports been prepared pursuant to Guide 7 standards, and in such disclosures, the procedures and definitions employed in the estimation of proven and probable reserves is also consistent with Guide 7 definitions
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Proven and probable reserves are based on extensive drilling, sampling, mine modeling and metallurgical testing from which we determined economic feasibility. The term “proven reserves” means mineral reserves for which (i) quantity is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or drill holes; (ii) grade and/or quality are computed from the results of detailed sampling; and (iii) the sites for inspection, sampling and measurements are spaced so closely and the geologic character is sufficiently defined that size, shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established. The term “probable reserves” means mineral reserves for which quantity and grade are computed from information similar to that used for proven reserves, but the sites for sampling are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation. The price sensitivity of reserves depends upon several factors including grade, metallurgical recovery, operating cost, waste-to-ore ratio and ore type. Metallurgical recovery rates vary depending on the metallurgical properties of each deposit and the production process used. 
 
The proven and probable reserve figures presented herein are estimates based on information available at the time of calculation. No assurance can be given that the indicated levels of recovery of minerals will be realized. Minerals included in the proven and probable reserves are those contained prior to losses during metallurgical treatment. Reserve estimates may require revision based on actual production. Market fluctuations in the price of minerals, as well as increased production costs or reduced metallurgical recovery rates, could render certain proven and probable reserves containing lower grades of mineralization uneconomic to exploit and might result in a reduction of reserves
 
Mr. Craig Scherba, President and CEO of the Company, is designated as the “qualified person” who reviewed and approved the technical disclosure contained in this document.

Molo Graphite Project, Southern Madagascar, Africa
 
Madagascar has been a traditional producer of flake graphite for over a century but has never exceeded 12,000 tonnes of production annually. Currently, Madagascar’s annual production of flake graphite averages about 5,000 tonnes. The Molo Graphite Project deposit represents the first new and substantial graphite discovery in the country in over 50 years.
Project Timeline
 
The Molo Graphite Project is one of seven surficial graphite trends discovered and drill tested by NextSource in late 2011 and announced to the market in early January 2012. The Molo deposit itself occurs in a flat, sparsely populated and dry savannah grassland region that has easy access via a network of seasonal secondary roads. 
The Molo Graphite Project graphitic zone consists of multi-folded graphitic strata with a surficially exposed strike length of over two kilometres. Outcrop mapping and trenching on the Molo Graphite Project has shown the surface geology to be dominated by resistant ridges of graphitic schist and graphitic gneiss, as well as abundant graphitic schist float. Geological modeling has shown that the Molo Graphite Project deposit consists of various zones of mineralized graphitic gneiss, with a barren footwall composed of garnetiferous gneiss. The host rock of the mineralized zones on the Molo Graphite Project is graphitic gneiss.
 
Resource delineation, drilling and trenching on the Molo Graphite Project took place between May and November of 2012, which resulted in a maiden mineral resource estimate to be released in early December of the same year. This maiden mineral resource estimate formed the basis for the Company’s Preliminary Economic Assessment (the “PEA”), which was undertaken by DRA Mineral Projects and released in 2013.
 
The positive outcome of the PEA led NextSource to undertake another phase of exploratory drilling and sampling in 2014 to upgrade the deposit and its contained mineral resources to mineral reserves. The process included an additional 32 diamond drill holes (totaling 2,063 metres) and 9 trenches (totaling 1,876 metres). The entire database upon which the upgraded resource estimate was based contained 80 drill holes (totaling 11,660 metres) and 35 trenches (totaling 8,492 metres). This new mineral resource formed the basis of the Molo Feasibility Study, which was originally released in February 2015.
 
In July 2016, we appointed HCF as advisor in negotiating and structuring strategic partnerships, off-take agreements and debt financing for its Molo Graphite Project.
 
In August 2016, we initiated the FEED Study and value engineering for our Molo Graphite Project in Madagascar. The FEED Study was undertaken in order to optimize the mine plan as envisioned in the Molo Feasibility Study and determine the optimal development path based on discussions with prospective strategic partners. All costing aspects were examined with the goal of providing a method to produce meaningful, multi-tonne test samples of Molo graphite concentrate to potential off-takers while reducing the CAPEX and time required to the commencement of commercial production.
 
On November 7, 2016, we outlined a phased mine development plan for the Molo Graphite Project based on the FEED Study and value engineering. The results supported the construction of a cost-effective demonstration plant to test and verify the flow sheet design from the Molo Feasibility Study. Under the Exploration Permit, the Company would initially be limited to an ore input of 20,000 cubic meters (or approximately 50,000 tonnes) of front-end feed into the demonstration plant. Upon approval of a full mining permit, the 20,000 cubic meter test limit would be removed and at full capacity, the demonstration plant would be capable of processing up to 240,000 tonnes of feed per annum, which equates to 30 tonnes per hour of ore feed and roughly 1 to 3 tonnes of flake graphite concentrate production per hour. 
 
On June 1, 2017, we released the results of a positive updated Molo Feasibility Study for Phase 1 of the mine development plan utilizing a fully modular build-out approach and based on the FEED Study and subsequent detailed engineering studies. Phase 1 would consist of a fully operational and sustainable graphite mine with a permanent processing plant capable of producing approximately 17,000 tpa of high-quality SuperFlake™ graphite concentrate per year with a mine life of 30 years. The Phase 1 production costs were estimated at $433 per tonne at the plant and $688 per tonne delivered CIF port of Rotterdam. The Phase 1 capital costs were estimated at US$18.4 million with a construction timeline of approximately 9 months. Based on an average selling cost of $1,014 per tonne, the Phase 1 financials were estimated to have a pre-tax NPV of $34M using an 8% discount rate, a pre-tax internal rate of return (IRR) of 25.2%, and a post-tax IRR of 21.5%.  The average selling price of $1,014 per tonne is the weighted average selling price for the different graphite sizes that we expect to sell.  The average selling price is less than the comparable 3-year historic weighted average price.

Overview
 
The Molo Feasibility Study was undertaken to reflect the Company’s decision to revise Phase 1 of its Molo Graphite Project mine plan from a demonstration plant to a fully operational and sustainable graphite mine with a permanent processing plant capable of producing, in our estimation, approximately 17,000 tpa of high-quality SuperFlake™ concentrate per year with a mine life of 30 years. 
The Molo Feasibility Study for Phase 1 of the Molo Graphite Project was based on FEED Study and subsequent detailed engineering studies. The updated Molo Feasibility Study incorporates the procurement of all mining equipment, off-site modular fabrication and assembly, factory acceptance testing (“FAT”), module disassembly, shipping, plant infrastructure construction, onsite module re-assembly, commissioning, project contingencies and three months of capital. All capital and operating costs expressed below are considered to be accurate to +/- 10%.

Project Description, Location and Access 
 
Property and Site Description
 
The Molo Graphite Project deposit is situated 160 km southeast of the city of Toliara, in the Tulear region of south-western Madagascar, and about 220 km NW of Fort Dauphin. The deposit occurs in a sparsely populated, dry savannah grassland region, which has easy access via a network of seasonal secondary roads radiating outward from the village of Fotadrevo. Fotadrevo in turn has an all-weather airstrip and access to a road system that leads to the regional capital (and port city) of Toliara and the Port of Ehoala at Fort Dauphin via the RN10, or RN13. 
 
The Project is centred on UTM coordinates 413,390 Easting 7,345,713 Northing (UTM 38S, WGS 84 datum). The Molo Graphite Project covers an area of 62.5 hectares (“ha”). The Government of Madagascar designates individual claims by a central LaBorde UTM location point, comprising a square with an area of 6.25 km2.
 
Geologically, the Molo Graphite Project is situated in the Bekikiy block (Tolagnaro-Ampanihy high grade metamorphic province) of southern Madagascar. The deposit is underlain predominantly by moderately to highly metamorphosed and sheared graphitic (biotite, chlorite and garnet- rich) quartzo-feldspathic schists and gneisses, which are variably mineralised. Near surface rocks are oxidised, and saprolitic to a depth, usually of less than 5m.
The Molo Graphite Project is one of several surficial graphite trends discovered by the Company in late 2011 and announced in early January 2012. The deposit was originally drill tested in 2012, with an initial seven holes being completed. Resource delineation, drilling and trenching on the Molo Graphite Project took place between May and November of 2012, and allowed for a maiden mineral resource estimates to be stated in early December of the same year. This maiden mineral resource estimate formed the basis for the PEA, which was undertaken by DRA Mineral Projects in 2013. The positive outcome of the PEA led the Company to undertake another phase of exploratory drilling and sampling in 2014, which was done under the supervision of Caracle Creek International Consulting (Proprietary) Limited (“Caracle Creek”). This phase of exploration was aimed at improving the geological confidence of the deposit and the contained mineral resources, and included an additional 32 diamond drill holes (totalling 2,063 metres) and 9 trenches (totalling 1,876 metres). Caracle Creek were subsequently engaged to update the geological model and mineral resource estimate. The entire database on which this new model and mineral resource estimate is based contains 80 drill holes (totalling 11,660 metres) and 35 trenches (totalling 8,492 metres). This new mineral resource forms the basis for the original feasibility study completed on the Molo Graphite Project in 2015 which targeted 860ktpa of ore processing capacity.
The Molo Feasibility Study utilises the knowledge base of the original feasibility study completed on the Molo Graphite Project in 2015 on a smaller scale low capital cost 240ktpa process capacity option.

Ownership
 
On December 14, 2011, we entered into a Definitive Joint Venture Agreement ("JVA") with Malagasy Minerals Limited ("Malagasy"), a public company on the Australian Stock Exchange, to acquire a 75% interest to explore and develop a group of industrial minerals, including graphite, vanadium and approximately 25 other minerals at the Molo Graphite Project. The land position covers 2,119 permits and 827.7 square kilometres and is mostly adjacent to the south and east of the Company's 100% owned Green Giant Property. We paid $2,261,690 and issued 7,500,000 common shares valued at $1,350,000 to Malagasy.
 
On April 16, 2014, we signed a Sale and Purchase Agreement and a Mineral Rights Agreement with Malagasy to acquire the remaining 25% interest in the Molo Graphite Project. We made the following payments at that time: $364,480 (CAD$400,000); issued 2,500,000 common shares subject to a 12 month voluntary vesting period and valued at $325,000; and issued 3,500,000 common share purchase warrants, valued at $320,950 using the Black Scholes pricing model with an exercise price of $0.14 and an expiry date of April 15, 2019.
 
On May 20, 2015 we paid $546,000 (CAD$700,000), and issued 1,000,000 common shares due to the completion of a bankable feasibility study (“BFS”) for the Molo Graphite Project. Further, a cash payment of $801,584 (CAD$1,000,000) will be due within five days of the commencement of commercial production. Malagasy retains a 1.5% net smelter return royalty ("NSR") on the Molo Graphite Project. We also acquired a 100% interest to the industrial mineral rights on approximately 1 1/2 additional claim blocks comprising 10,811 hectares to the east and adjoining the Molo Graphite Project.

Government Regulations and Permitting
The Molo Graphite Project is located within Exploration Permit #3432 (the “Exploration Permit” or “PR 3432”) as issued by the Bureau de Cadastre Minier de Madagascar (“BCMM”) pursuant to the Mining Code 1999 (as amended) and its implementing decrees. 
Carracle Creek  International Consulting (Pty) Ltd., which was a consultant for the Molo Feasibility Study, has had sight of and reviewed a copy of the “Contrat d’amodiation” pertaining to this right and are satisfied that the rights to explore this Exploration Permit have been ceded to the Company or one of its Madagascar subsidiaries.
The Company holds the exclusive right to explore for a defined group of industrial minerals within the Exploration Permit listed above. These industrial minerals include the following: Vanadium, Lithium, Aggregates, Alunite, Barite, Bentonite, Vermiculite, Carbonatites, Corundum, Dimensional stone (excluding labradorite), Feldspar (excluding labradorite), Fluorspar, Granite, Graphite, Gypsum, Kaolin, Kyanite, Limestone / Dolomite, Marble, Mica, Olivine, Perlite, Phosphate, Potash–Potassium minerals, Pumice Quartz, Staurolite, and Zeolites.
 
Reporting requirements of exploration activities carried out by the titleholder on an Exploration Permit are minimal. A titleholder must maintain a diary of events and record the names and dates present of persons active on the project. In addition, a site plan with a scale between 1/100 and 1/10,000 showing “a map of the work completed” must be presented. Upon establishment of a mineral resource, Exploration Permits may be converted into Exploitation Permits by application. Carracle Creek is of the opinion that the Company is compliant in terms of its commitments under these reporting requirements.
 
The Molo Graphite Project has not been legally surveyed; however, since all claim boundaries conform to the predetermined rectilinear LaBorde Projection grid, these can be readily located on the ground by use of Global Positioning System (“GPS”) instruments. Most current GPS units and software packages do not however offer LaBorde among their available options, and therefore defined shifts have to be employed to display LaBorde data in the WGS 84 system. For convenience, all Company positional data is collected in WGS 84, and if necessary converted back to LaBorde Royalties.
 
The receipt of the exploitation permit is a critical step in the larger permitting and licensing regime.  The permitting and licensing of the Molo Graphite Project requires dedicated attention to ensure momentum is maintained during the application for and delivery of all necessary permits and licenses.

The Molo Graphite Project exploration permit PR 3432 is currently held under the name of one of our Madagascar subsidiary ERG Madagascar SARLU. Our Madagascar subsidiaries have paid all taxes and administrative fees to the Madagascar government and its mining ministry with respect to all the mining permits held in country.  These taxes and administrative fee payments have been acknowledged and accepted by the Madagascar government.  In addition, we continue to diligently work with the Madagascar government to obtain the necessary permits as the country clears its backlog of applications and amendments.
 
We have applied to the BCMM to have the Molo Graphite Project exploration permit converted into an exploitation permit, which is expected to be completed in due course. The exploitation permit is required to advance the Molo Project into the developmental stage.
 
A comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment ("ESIA"), developed to local Malagasy, Equator Principles, World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) standards, is nearing completion. This process was preceded by an Environmental Legal Review and an Environmental and Social Screening Assessment; both providing crucial information to align the project development and design with international best practice on sustainable project development.
 
Application for all necessary permits to construct and operate the mine, including water use, construction, mineral processing, transportation, export, and labour will be undertaken within the ESIA review period (6 months), which is expected to be from September 2017 till February 2018.
 
Security of land tenure is a process that is estimated to take 6-9 months to complete.  Compilation of a comprehensive legal register will also be required.
 
The Company cannot provide any assurance as to the timing of the receipt of the required permits and licenses.
 
Geological Setting, Mineralization and Deposit Types
 
Regional Geology
 
Madagascar comprises a fragment of the African Plate, which rifted from the vicinity of Tanzania at the time of the breakup of Gondwana, some 180 million years ago. At that time Madagascar remained joined with India, moving east-by-south until the late Cretaceous (approximately 70 million years ago), whereupon the two land masses split apart. On a regional scale Madagascar can be described as being formed by two geological entities, a Precambrian crystalline basement, and a much younger Phanerozoic sedimentary cover Figure 12 that hosts potentially economic coal deposits. The central and eastern two thirds of the island are mainly composed of Neoproterozoic-aged, crystalline basement rocks, composed of a complex mélange of metamorphic schist and gneiss intruded by younger granitic and basic igneous Carboniferous to Permian-Triassic. These rocks correlate with the Karoo Super group successions of sub-Saharan Africa, which was widespread in the former supercontinent of Gondwana.
 
The geology of the basement of Madagascar is composed of intercontinental tectonic blocks made up of ancient poly-deformed, high-grade metamorphic rocks and later igneous intrusions. The tectonic and metallogenic basement framework was originally subdivided into four blocks (Besarie, 1967), these beingthe: northern Bemarivo Block; northeastern Antongil Block; central Antananarivo Block; and the southern Bekily Block. The Molo Graphite Project lies entirely within the bounds of the Bekily Block.
 
Molo Graphite Project Geology
 
The Molo Graphite Project graphitic zone consists of multi-folded graphitic strata with a surficially exposed strike length of over two kilometres. Outcrop mapping and trenching on Molo Graphite Project has shown the surface geology to be dominated by resistant ridges of graphitic schist and graphitic gneiss, with fracture-lined vanadium mineralisation, as well as abundant graphitic schist float. Geological modelling has shown that the deposit consists of various zones of mineralised graphitic gneiss, with a barren footwall composed of garnetiferous gneiss. The host rock of the mineralised zones is graphitic gneiss.
 
No academic studies have been undertaken on the graphitic schists and gneisses of the Molo Graphite Project deposit and at present the deposit is still not fully understood. There is, however, no indication of secondary hydrothermal, or other transported, post-metamorphic graphitic mineralisation or upgrading and the present distribution and crystallinity of the graphite zones seem to be primarily due to regional metamorphic and structural events.
 
Deposit Types
 
The Molo Graphite Project primarily hosts at least two different deposit types: (i) metamorphosed black shale/roll front redox vanadium deposits, and deposit types; and (ii) flake graphite deposits.
 
Exploration History
 
The region around the Molo Graphite Project has primarily been explored for base metal type occurrences, although colonial geologic services were alert to all kinds of mineral potential in the region. In 1985 the Bureau de Recherches Géologiques et Minières (“BRGM”) produced a three-volume country scale compilation of all exploration and mineral inventory data in their files. Relatively little exploration and development work has been completed in south-western Madagascar after that of BRGM, and therefore these volumes are key to retracing any historical data. Archival research by the Company has not revealed evidence of mineral exploration in the past fifty years within the Molo Graphite Project area.
 
Prior to the exploration work completed by the Company in 2007, there is no record of any previous exploration activity within the Molo Graphite Project area and no historical resource estimates exist for the area. Between 2007 and 2011 the Company retained Taiga Consultants Limited (“Taiga”) to manage exploration activities on the Molo Graphite Project.
 
 15



The identification of graphite as a potential credit to the the Company’s NI 43-101 compliant vanadium resources led to a reconnaissance exploration programme being undertaken on the Molo Graphite Project in September 2011, with the goal of delineating new graphitic trends. Activities during this phase of exploration included prospecting, grab and trench sampling, and diamond drilling.
 
Based on the results of this programme, the Company launched a second phase of exploration in November 2011. The objective of this second programme was to use geophysical techniques to delineate additional graphite mineralisation, as well as to drill test the known graphitic. The signing of the JVA with Malagasy in November, 2011 prompted additional exploration to ascertain the industrial mineral potential of the Molo Graphite Project area. Exploration activities consisted of, geologic mapping, prospecting and sampling, (including metallurgical), ground geophysical surveying (EM-31), trenching, and diamond drilling. As a consequence of the work undertaken during 2011, the Molo Graphite Project was identified and targeted for additional work, which was undertaken between May 2012 and June 2014.
 
As at the effective date of the Molo Feasibility Study, no further exploration work is currently planned.
 
Drilling
 
The Molo Graphite Project is one of seven surficial graphite trends discovered and drill tested by the Company in late 2011 and announced to the market in early January 2012. 
 
Resource delineation, drilling and trenching on the Molo Graphite Project took place between May and November of 2012, and allowed for a maiden mineral resource estimates to be stated in early December of the same year. This maiden mineral resource estimate formed the basis for the Company’s Preliminary Economic Assessment (the “PEA”), which was undertaken by DRA Mineral Projects and released to the market in 2013.
 
The positive outcome of the PEA led NextSource to undertake another phase of exploratory drilling and sampling in 2014 to upgrade the deposit and its contained mineral resources to mineral reserves. The process included an additional 32 diamond drill holes (totaling 2,063 metres) and 9 trenches (totaling 1,876 metres). The entire database upon which the upgraded resource estimate was based contained 80 drill holes (totaling 11,660 metres) and 35 trenches (totaling 8,492 metres). This new mineral resource formed the basis of the Molo Feasibility Study, which was originally released in February 2015.
 
Sampling, Analysis and Data Verification
 
At all times during sample collection, storage, and shipment to the laboratory facility, the samples are in the control of the Company, or our agents. When sufficient sample material (grab, trench, or core) has been collected, the samples are trucked, or flown to the Company’s storage location in Antananarivo, at all times accompanied by an employee of the Company.
 
From there, samples are further shipped to either South Africa (Mintek, or Genalysis), or Canada (Activation Labs) for ICP-MS analysis. Drill core samples collected during 2011 were directed to two major laboratories. All samples collected during Phase I of 2011 were sent to Mintek, South Africa. Samples were then tested for Carbon content (Total Organic Carbon and Overall Carbon content), as well as the full range of elements available through ICP-OES (Mintek code FA5) and XRF analysis.
 
The remainder of samples collected during Phase II of the 2011 exploration programme were submitted for analysis to Activation Labs, Canada. Samples were again submitted for analysis of Carbon content, as well as for a large range of elemental analysis. During 2012 all samples were submitted to Intertek Genalysis. All work undertaken by Intertek is performed in accordance with the Intertek Minerals Standard Terms and Conditions of which can be downloaded from their web page. All analytical results were e-mailed directly by both Genalysis and Mintek to the Project Manager, as well as the Company’s executive staff, and were posted on a secure website and downloaded by Company personnel using a secure username and password. Following the site inspection in May 2012, all analytical results were also e-mailed directly to Dr. Hancox (Carracle Creek) and these were compared against the final data set as presented by the Company.
 
All of the laboratories that carried out the sampling and analytical work are independent of the Company.
 
 16



Quality Control Measures
 
In order to carry out QA/QC protocols on the assays, blanks, standards and duplicates were inserted into the sample streams. This was done once in every 30 samples, representing an insertion rate of 3.33% of the total.
Data Verification
 
Prior to Carracle Creek’s involvement with the Company and the Molo Graphite Project, all information published regarding the 2011 exploration programme was reviewed by an independent Qualified Person as it became available.
 
The database received by Carracle Creek from the Company contained 80 drill holes totalling 11,660 m and data from 35 trenches totalling 8,492m. With regards to the database, Carracle Creek performed various tests to verify the integrity of the collar co-ordinates, logging and sampling procedures, and assay results. Leapfrog™ Geo software was used for most of the checks.
 
Metallurgical Test Work
 
The Molo Feasibility Study is based on a full suite of metallurgical test work performed by SGS Canada Metallurgical Services Inc. in Lakefield, Ontario, Canada. These tests included laboratory scale metallurgical work and a 200 tonne bulk sample / pilot plant program. The laboratory scale work included comminution tests, process development and optimization tests, variability flotation, and concentrate upgrading tests.
 
Comminution test results place the Molo Graphite Project ore into the very soft to soft category with low abrasivity. A simple reagent regime consists of fuel oil number 2 and methyl isobutyl carbinol at dosages of approximately 120 g/t and 195 g/t, respectively. A total of approximately 150 open circuit and locked cycle flotation tests were completed on almost 70 composites as part of the process development, optimization, and variability flotation program. The metallurgical programs culminated in a process flowsheet that is capable of treating the ore using proven mineral processing techniques and its robustness has been successfully demonstrated in the laboratory and pilot plant campaigns.
 
The metallurgical programs indicated that variability exists with regards to the metallurgical response of the ore across the deposit, which resulted in a range of concentrate grades between 88.8% total carbon and 97.8% total carbon. Optical mineralogy on representative concentrate samples identified interlayered graphite and non-sulphide gangue minerals as the primary source of impurities. The process risk that was created by the ore variability was mitigated with the design of an upgrading circuit, which improved the grade of a concentrate representing the average mill product of the first five years of operation from 92.1% total carbon to 97.1% total carbon.
 
The overall graphitic carbon recovery into the final concentrate is 87.8% based on the metallurgical response of composites using samples from all drill holes within the five year pit design of the original feasibility study at the higher concentrate production rate of 53,000 tpa. The average composition of the combined concentrate grade is presented in the table below entitled “Metallurgical Data - Flake Size Distribution and Product Grade”. The size fraction analysis results were converted into a grouping reflecting a typical pricing matrix, which is shown in table below entitled “Pricing Matrix - Flake Size Distribution Grouping and Product Grade”.
 
All assays were completed using control quality analysis and cross checks were completed during the mass balancing process to verify that the results were within the estimated measurement uncertainly of up to 1.7% relative for graphite concentrate grades greater than 90% total carbon.

Mineral Reserve Estimate
 
As at the date of the Molo Feasibility Study, the following proven and probable mineral reserves are declared:
 
Mineral Reserves
 
Category | Tonnes | | C Grade (%)
--------------------+--------+-----------+------------
Proven | | 5,881,243 | | 8.04
Probable | | 1,278,757 | | 8.07
Proven and Probable | | 7,160,000 | | 8.05

Proven reserves are reported as the measured resources inside the designed open pit and above the grade cut off of 5.5% C. Similarly, the probable reserves are reported as the indicated resources inside the designed open pit and above the grade cut-off of 5.5% C.
Mining Methods
 
The surficial, lateral expanse and the massive nature of the Molo Graphite Project deposit make it suitable for open-pit mining methods. It is a typical pipe-shaped and steeply dipping ore body, with extended mineral outcrop along the strike (north-south direction) of the deposit. In this mining method, the following activities are executed:

● | The land is cleared, topsoil is removed and stockpiled at designated sites for use in the future land rehabilitation. Depending on the extent of the abse of weathering, any further waste or ore that can be removed by free-digging is removed and stockpiled accordingly. The topsoil is planned to be used as a berm around the pit to prevent water flow into the pit and minimize transportation costs
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
 18




● | In a number of cyclic processes the waste and/or ,mineralized material is drilled, charged with explosives and blasted, excavated, hauled and dumped in designated sites
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | At strategically planned periods the waste around the boundary of the pit is removed in order to mine out deeper ore
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
The conventional open-pit mining activities are carried out with small to medium sized mining equipment including 30t dump trucks, an excavator and a front end loader.
 
Detailed geotechnical and hydro-geological studies have been conducted and the reports indicated that there are no fatal flaws regarding the adoption of the open-pit mining as the preferred mining method.
 
Processing and Recovery Methods
 
The process design is based on an annual feed plant throughput capacity of 240 kilotonnes at a nominal head grade of 7.04% C(t) producing an estimated average of 15-17 kilotonnes per annum (“ktpa”) of final concentrate.
 
The ore processing circuit consists of three stages of crushing which comprises jaw crushing in the primary circuit, followed by secondary cone crushing and tertiary cone crushing; the secondary and tertiary crushers operate in closed circuit with a double deck classification screen. Crushing is followed by primary milling and screening, graphite recovery by froth flotation and concentrate upgrading circuit, and graphite product and tailings effluent handling unit operations. The crusher circuit is designed to operate 365 days per annum for 24 hours per day at ±55% utilization. The crushed product (P80 of approximately 13 mm) passes through a surge bin from where it is fed to the milling circuit.
 
The milling and flotation circuits are designed to operate 365 days per annum for 24 hours per day at 92% utilization. A single stage primary ball milling circuit is employed, incorporating a closed circuit classifying screen and a scalping screen ahead of the mill. The scalping screen undersize feeds into a flash flotation cell before combining with the mill discharge material. Scalping and classification screen oversize are the fed to the primary mill.
 
Primary milling is followed by rougher flotation which, along with flash flotation, recovers graphite to concentrate from the main stream. Rougher flotation employs six forced-draught trough cells. The primary, fine-flake and attritioning cleaning circuits upgrade the concentrate to the final product grade of above 94% C(t). Concentrate from the main stream feeds into the primary cleaning circuit consisting essentially of a dewatering screen, a polishing ball mill, a column flotation cell and flotation cleaner/cleaner scavenger trough cells.
 
The primary cleaner column cell concentrate gravitates to a 212 µm classifying screen, from where the large-flake oversize stream is pumped to a high rate thickener located in the concentrate attritioning circuit whilst the undersize is pumped to the fine-flake cleaning circuit.
 
The fine flake cleaning circuit consists primarily of a dewatering screen, a polishing ball mill, a column flotation cell and flotation cleaner/cleaner scavenger trough cells. The attritioning cleaning circuit employs a high rate thickener, an attritioning stirred media mill, a column flotation cell and flotation cleaner/cleaner scavenger trough cells. Fine flake column concentrate is combined with the +212 µm primary cleaner classifying screen oversize as it feeds the attritioning circuit thickener. Concentrate from the attrition circuit is pumped to the final concentrate thickener.
 
The combined fine flake cleaner concentrate and the +212 µm may also be processed through the secondary attrition circuit which consists of a dewatering screen, an attrition scrubber, column flotation cell and cleaner/cleaner scavenger trough cells. Concentrate from this circuit is pumped to the final concentrate. The secondary attrition circuit is optimal.
 
Combined rougher and cleaner flotation final tailings are pumped to the final tailings thickener. Thickened final concentrate is pumped to a filter press for further dewatering before the filter cake is stockpiled prior to load and haul.
 
The concentrate thickener underflow is pumped to a linear belt filter for further dewatering and fed to a diesel-fired rotary kiln for drying. The dried concentrate is then screened into four size fractions:
 
• | +48 mesh
--+---------


• | -48 + 80 Mesh
--+--------------


• | -80 +100 mesh
--+--------------


• | -100 mesh
--+----------

 
 19



The various product sizes are bagged and readied for shipping.
 
Chemical reagents are used throughout the froth flotation circuits and thickeners. Diesel fuel is used as collector and liquid MIBC (methyl isobutyl carbinol) frother are used within the flotation circuits. Diesel collector is pumped from a diesel storage isotainer, from where it enters a manifold system which supplies multiple variable speed peristaltic pumps which discretely pump the collector at set rates to the various points-of-use within the flotation circuits.
 
MIBC (methyl isobutyl carbinol) frother is delivered by road to an isotainer. A manifold system on the storage isotainer supplies multiple variable speed peristaltic pumps, which discretely pump the frother at set rates to the various points-of-use within the flotation circuits.
 
Flocculant powder (Magnafloc 24) is delivered by road to the plant reagent store in 25 kg bags. The bags are collected by forklift as required and delivered to a flocculant mixing and dosing area. Here the flocculant is diluted as required using parallel, duplicate vendor-package automated make-up plants, each one being dedicated to supplying the concentrate and tailings thickeners due to the flocculant types required being different for each application. Variable speed peristaltic pumps discretely pump the flocculant at set rates to the thickeners’ points-of- use.
 
Coagulant powder (Magnafloc 1707) for thickening enhancement is handled similarly to the flocculant as described above, the exception being that a single make-up system is provided to supply both the concentrate and tailings thickeners. Again, variable speed peristaltic pumps discretely pump the coagulant at set rates to the thickeners’ points-of-use.
 
Infrastructure, Logistics and Permitting
 
The Molo Graphite Project is located in a relatively remote part of Southwestern Madagascar, approximately 13 km NE of the local village of Fotadrevo. There is currently limited infrastructure on site and project infrastructure will have to be constructed.
 
The following elements are all part of the Molo Graphite Project scope:
 
• | Raw water supply (from a network of bore holes extracting ground water)
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Power supply (temporary during construction) and then a permanent diesel power station to supply the plant and permanent camp

The following section describes the methods, assumptions and specifications used in the preliminary design of the civil, structural and infrastructure portions of the proposed new modular graphite plant. As the proposed new plant is a temporary pilot plant for a potentially much larger process plant and mining operation, the brief form the client was to develop a “fit for purpose” and cost-effective design without compromising on safety or quality.
 
Basis of Civil, Structural and Infrastructure Design
 
The scope of the civil and structural design covers the following facilities and areas:
 
• | Bulk earthworks and terraces for the process plant, administration and workshop areas
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Earthworks for laydown areas
--+-----------------------------


• | Bulk earthworks and retaining walls for the Run of Mine (ROM) tip ramp
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Foundations and slabs for:
--+---------------------------


- | Front end crushing circuit
--+---------------------------


- | Conveyors, transfer stations and bins
--+--------------------------------------

- | Modular water treatment plant
--+------------------------------


- | Modular sewer treatment plant
--+------------------------------


- | Diesel generators
--+------------------


• | In plant roads and access
--+--------------------------


• | Fuel storage and bund area
--+---------------------------


• | Storm water drainage (Concrete lined v-drains) and protection berms
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Plant pollution control dam
--+----------------------------

 
As the process plant is supplied in modular units by a vendor, the design of these structures are not included in this section. Critical structural design criteria are however still included.
 
Bulk Earthworks
 
Geotechnical
 
The geotechnical investigation conducted by SRK Consulting in 2014 was used as reference document for the design and planning of this phase of the project.
 
In summary, transported soils are present across all areas investigated to shallow depths not exceeding a maximum depth of 0.6 m. From the consistencies noted during test pit excavations the transported soils are anticipated to have a maximum allowable bearing capacity of 100 kPa, limiting total consolidation settlement to 25 mm.
 
Residual soils were noted in the majority of the test pits excavated and comprised dense to very dense silty and/ or clayey sands. The residual soils are expected to have a maximum allowable bearing capacity of 200 kPa, limiting total consolidation settlement to 25 mm (differential settlement expected to be half this value).
 
As rock is located at a shallow depth at most locations it is recommended that structures generally be founded on rock rather than the overlying thin soils. However, light structures with loads of less than 100 kPa could be founded on the soils if necessary.
 
Site Clearance
 
The entire plant area is to be cleared and grubbed. Topsoil shall be stripped nominally 150mm deep after clearing and grubbing and stockpiled in designated areas for possible re-use in accordance with the recommendations of the EIA. Topsoil may also be used for screen and drainage berms.
Terrace Design
 
Bulk earthworks are required for the process plant and building platforms, plant roads, storm water drainage, access ramps and laydown areas.
 
Finished surface levels for bulk earthworks at all plant will be 200 mm below the nominated top of concrete of all footings and foundation slabs with grading of the surface surrounding the foundation to ensure runoff is directed away from the foundations.
 
All fill areas will be compacted to a minimum modified AASHTO density of at least 95%. The terraces will be formed using a cut to fill operation with suitable in-situ material after all unsuitable topsoil has been removed. A borrow pit has been identified for any shortfall fill material.
 
The terrace design has been done to allow for a minimum load bearing capacity of 150kPa for concrete foundations and structures.
 
All fill slopes will be between 1:1.5 and 1:3 in accordance with the geotechnical report.
 
Plant Roads
 
Site roads will be formed from existing site material and be shaped to assist rainfall runoff. In plant roads will be 6m wide and constructed of in situ material. Borrow pit material is to be used for heavy vehicle haul roads.
 
 21



Run of Mine (ROM) Ram
 
The ROM ramp will be constructed from borrow pit material with a ramp slope of 10 degrees. The ROM ramp retaining walls will be constructed with gabion baskets on a concrete footing.
 
Soil and Compaction Testing
 
All tests test work shall be done in accordance with the latest and applicable SANS 1200 specification.
 
Storm Water Runoff
 
Storm water runoff within the process plant areas are dealt with by a minimum slope on the terrace platform. Runoff is then collected in concrete lined V-drains. All V-drains form the process plant area will be routed to the plant pollution control dam.
 
Earth berms are proposed on the high sides of the process plant to prevent rainwater runoff from entering the process plant area and possibly becoming contaminated by plant spills or materials.
 
All runoff not affected by possibly contaminated areas will be routed to local low areas and natural seasonal watercourses.
 
Plant Pollution Control Dam
 
A pollution control dam will be constructed on the low side of the plant. All potentially contaminated water runoff from the process plant will be routed to this dam. The dam will be an earth wall dam constructed from in situ materials. If required by the Environmental Impact Assessment the dam will be lined.
 
Raw Water Supply
 
Water is supplied by a network of boreholes. A detailed water demand and supply analysis was done as part of the feasibility study, and this has shown that the water demands of the plant can be accommodated by boreholes within a radius of 5km from the plant. The daily maximum raw water make up requirement is estimated to be 561m3 per day, decreasing to 222m3 per day for latter part of the life of mine.
Power Supply
 
Due to the remote location of the Molo site, no other power or electrical infrastructure is available on the site, hence the supply to the Molo Graphite plant shall be independent by stand-alone diesel generators and not grid tied.
 
The total installed generation capacity equals to 2.8MW. Power to the plant and infrastructure shall be supplied by 2 x 1.4 MW, 3-ph, 400Vac diesel generators, interlocked and operating either in parallel or independently. Power to remote areas, such as the water wells shall be supplied via independent stand - alone 15kVA, 3-ph, 400Vac diesel generators.
 
Subject to the sequential starting of the larger loads for e.g. the Mill, it might be required during an ore loaded start-up, that both generators run in parallel. Once the plant has reached equilibrium the standby generator shall be stepped back. During continuous normal operation of the plant, one generator will suffice. The second unit shall primarily be used during maintenance and operational rotations
 
Product Pricing
 
Graphite prices are based on current quotes and projected estimates provided by UK-based Roskill Consulting Group Ltd ("Roskill"), recognized as a leader in providing independent and unbiased market research, pricing trends, and demand and supply analysis for the natural flake graphite market.
 
The weighted average price per tonne of graphite concentrate used for this study is based on the findings of Roskill and yielded $1,014/tonne. This is a basket price and reflects the contribution of the different flake sizes and carbon grades to the overall price. The start- up price (in 2018 terms) for a tonne graphite concentrate is a projection based on Roskill information. The nominal graphite price was used in the financial model, which in essence ‘flat-lines’ the price forecast over the life of mine. The reader is cautioned that these are forecasts and may change subject to market dynamics.
 
 22



Logistics
 
The cost to transport one tonne of dry concentrate (0.5% moisture content) from the Molo Graphite Project to Rotterdam via Fort Dauphin, Madagascar, in December 2014 terms is $337 per tonne. This is based on shipping 26 tonnes of concentrate in 1 m3 bags placed inside a 40 ft. container.
 
The route from the Molo Graphite Project to Fort Dauphin runs either via the RN 10 or the RN 13. Both these routes are in relatively poor condition and trucks are expected to take between four and five days to make the round trip. A truck was run over the route by a Madagascan trucking contractor to gauge cycle times and they completed the journey in two long days each way. This was in the dry season and in the wet season there may be periods of time when the roads become impassable. No money has been budgeted for roads repairs or upgrades.
 
The Port of Ehoala at Fort Dauphin is a modern (2009) port developed by Rio Tinto for the QMM project. It has a 15m draft with shipping lines calling on a regular basis. There are however no crane facilities and vessels require their own cranes.

Environmental Permitting and Social Impact Assessment
 
A comprehensive Environmental and Social Impact Assessment ("ESIA"), developed to local Malagasy, Equator Principles, World Bank and International Finance Corporation (IFC) standards, is nearing completion. This process was preceded by an Environmental Legal Review and an Environmental and Social Screening Assessment; both providing crucial information to align the project development and design with international best practice on sustainable project development.
 
 23



The ESIA submission is subject to approval of the investment amount by Madagascar's Ministry of Mines, which is anticipated in October 2017. The investment application was submitted on June 21, 2017. The Company will receive a Global Environmental Permit upon approval of the ESIA, a process which is expected to take six months from date of submission.
 
A comprehensive permitting register is in place and additional sectorial permit applications will form part of the early execution phase. Approval of the sectorial applications is expected within the same six month period as the ESIA review.
 
No material issues were identified in relation to Environmental, Social and Permitting processes and through the stakeholder engagement process the local and regional community has expressed a desire for the project to move forward.
 
Capital and Operating Costs
 
The capital cost for the project is estimated to be $18.4 million, including a contingency of $1.7 million. A firm offer was obtained for the beneficiation facility, and supporting earthworks and civils have been quantified based on detailed designs and firm price offers from contractors established on the island.
 
The base date for the capital costs is April 2017 and no provision has been made for escalation. The accuracy of capital costs is considered to be accurate to +/- 10%.
 
Initial Capital Cost Summary

• | replacement of the power plant,
--+--------------------------------


• | process plant replacement items,
--+---------------------------------


• | administration facilities maintenance
--+--------------------------------------


• | and for rehabilitation at the end of the project.
--+--------------------------------------------------

 
 24



Over the life of mine the sustaining capital accounts for $3.3 million. Additionally, three months working capital is estimated at $3.1 million.
 
The operating costs per tonne of finished graphite flake concentrate delivered on a CIF basis in Rotterdam are outlined in the table below.
 
Operating Costs per Tonne of Finished Graphite Concentrate
 
Category | | 
-------------------------------------------------+---+-------
Mining (US$/T) | | 102.81
Processing (US$/T) | | 265.82
Trucking to local port / Ft. Dauphin (US$/T) | | 133.01
Shipping to customer port; CIF Rotterdam (US$/T) | | 122.50
General and Administration (US$/T) | | 64.29 
Total | $ | 688.43

 

The operating costs expressed above are considered to be accurate to +/- 10%, and assume a varying USD inflation rate of 1.6% in 2015 and escalating to 2.0% from 2017 onward. Currency inflation rates were also considered in the financial model and were applied to the South African Rand and Malagasy Ariary portions of the operating costs.
 
Please note that these operating costs assume that the plant is able to successfully handle the variability in the ore body, as shown by the SGS test work. Should the plant not perform as expected this could have a material impact on operating costs as:
 

• | The flake size distribution could be worse than expected
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | The product grade could be lower than expected
--+-----------------------------------------------


• | The recoveries could be lower than expected or a combination of all of these
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
Economic analysis
 
The table below summarizes the economic analysis of the project using discounted cash flow methods.  The weighted average selling price is less than the 3-year historic average price for Madagascar exports of flake graphite across all flake sizes to the USA and Germany, which was $1,000-1,200 per tonne between 2014 and 2016, and averaged $1,088 per tonne.

Molo Feasibility Study Conclusions
 
Geology
 
The Company’s 2011 exploration programme delineated a number of new graphitic trends in southern Madagascar. The resource delineation drilling undertaken during 2012-2014 focussed on only one of these, the Molo Graphite Project deposit, and this has allowed for an Independent, CIM compliant, updated resource statement for the Molo deposit.
Mining
 
Maiden mineral reserves of 7,160,000 tonnes have been declared for in the Molo Feasibility Study at an average grade of 8.05% and based on such information it is possible to economically mine the Molo Graphite Project deposit.
Tailings
 
Due to the substantially reduced tonnages for the project as envisaged, tailings will be dried and co- disposed with the waste rock generated as part of the open cast mining. Despite this co-disposal approach, a detailed design has been completed, complete with environmental and social impact assessment and closure to allow for the upgrade to a more conventional, cyclone facility, should the throughput be increased during the life of the mine. This approach has been pursued to ensure that sufficient flexibility is built into the project development strategy to accommodate the anticipated increase in market demand.
Risks
 
In addition to the qualitative risk assessment completed during the previous BFS, a comprehensive HAZID study was completed as part of this study.
 
Permitting
 
Various permits will have to be obtained for the project including an Environmental Permit, a Mining permit, land tenure and land use approvals and finally supplementary sectoral permits. The most urgent permit is for the Company to obtain the exploitation permit for the right to mine and produce.
 
Metallurgical Test Work
 
Comprehensive metallurgical test programs culminated in a process flowsheet that is capable of treating the ore using conventional and established mineral processing techniques.
 
Process risks associated with the variability with regards to metallurgical performance have been mostly mitigated through the addition of an upgrading circuit. The upgrading circuit treated the combined concentrate after the secondary cleaning circuit. Reduced flake degradation and an improved process flexibility may be obtained by employing separate upgrading circuits for the coarse and fine flakes.
Molo Feasibility Study Recommendations
 
Geology
 
No further recommendations.
 
Mining
 
The following recommendations are made for the mine planning and production stage:
 
The Molo Graphite Project will allow for potential optimization of drilling and blasting designs during execution that could reduce operating costs slightly.
 
From a pure mining perspective, the Molo Graphite Project is very small and provided reasonable levels of short term planning are applied it should have very few challenges in delivering the required tonnages at the required grade to meet the production targets set out in this study.
 
 26



Metallurgical Test Work
 
The following recommendations are made for the detailed engineering stage:
 

o | Investigate the metallurgical impact of different attrition mill technologies such as stirred media mills or attrition scrubbers
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Evaluate a range of different grinding media (e.g. different size, shape, material) to determine if flake degradation can be reduced without affecting the concentrate grade
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Develop a grinding energy versus concentrate grade relationship for the best grinding media. This will allow a more accurate prediction of the required attrition mill grinding energy as a function of the final concentrate grade
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Conduct attrition mill vendor tests to aid in the sizing of the equipment
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Carry out vendor testing on graphite tailings using the optimized reagent regime proposed by the reagent supplier
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Complete a series of flotation tests on samples covering mine life intervals for the Molo Feasibility Study pit design
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Recovery Methods
 
The following recommendations are made for the detailed engineering stage:
 

o | The process plant has been designed to easily optimize the final product grade, this is achieved by having two options in the attrition cleaning step. It is however recommended that additional laboratory test work be conducted to test the current plant configuration for treatment for higher feed grade material.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Infrastructure
 
The following are recommended prior to the detailed design stage:
 

o | Additional geotechnical investigations at the proposed new construction and permanent camp site, particularly at the location of the new potable water storage tanks
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | A detailed geotechnical investigation will need to be undertaken to identify and confirm suitable sources of concrete aggregate and concrete sand materials at the location of the project site. This testing will need to include for concrete material testing and the production of concrete trial mixes with the material identified
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The geotechnical information will also need to confirm the suitability for construction of all the material to be excavated from the Return Water Dam. It is proposed that all the material excavated from the Return Water Dam is utilized in the works as processed fill material
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Confirmation as to whether the material from the proposed borrow pit near Fotadrevo (which will be used to supply all fill material for the TSF starter wall construction) can be utilized as fill material, or if this material can be stabilized in some manner and used in the works
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | A detailed topographical survey will need to be undertaken of the proposed construction site, borrow pit areas and the access road between Fotadrevo and the mine site. This information is required prior to the final detailed design of the plant layout and associated earthworks
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Water
 
The following is recommended during the detailed design phase:
 

o | Water quality and quantity data is required to provide a baseline for comparison once the Molo Graphite Project mine is commissioned. To provide the necessary baseline data, regular ground and surface water quality monitoring must be carried out leading up to the date when the mine will be commissioned. Additionally, proposed monitoring boreholes must be installed. This also should include the installation of flow meters on relevant pipelines to verify the dynamic water balance with measured flow rates during operations.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | The installation of a weather station on the Molo Graphite project site should be done as soon as possible.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Quantitative and predictive water balance, groundwater and geochemical analyses should be undertaken on regular intervals in order to update the water management plan.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environmental, Social
 
The following is recommended during the development and production phases:
 

o | The installation of a suitable weather station at or as near as possible to the proposed project site, even before construction commences, is recommended. Accurate, local weather data is almost non-existent in Madagascar. This data will prove invaluable for model calibration, improvement in baseline understanding and for future energy supply options which could utilize wind and or solar power generation.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Clean and or renewable energy supply should be considered as a medium to long term target.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Appointment of a community representative and the establishment of a mandate to sensitize the local communities prior to any project activities.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Monitoring and auditing to commence at project preparation phase.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Compilation of Standard Operating Procedures for Environmental and Social aspects requiring direct management and intervention.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | It is recommended that actual activity data, (e.g. kilometres travelled, or litres of diesel consumed) for a financial year is used when a GHG Assessment is being calculated. Given that this project involves an estimation of a future GHG assessment for activities yet to begin, a series of assumptions have been made in order to obtain the activity data required to undertake this calculation.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


o | Community recruitment, skills development and training should begin at project preparation phase.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Green Giant Property, Southern Madagascar, Africa
 
During 2007, the Company acquired a 75% interest in the Green Giant Property. We paid $765,000, issued 2,500,000 common shares and 1,000,000 now expired common share purchase warrants to enter into a joint venture agreement for the Green Giant Property with Madagascar Minerals and Resources Sarl ("MMR"). On July 9, 2009, we acquired the remaining 25% interest for $100,000. MMR retains a 2% NSR. The NSR can be purchased at our option, for $500,000 in cash or common shares for the first 1% NSR and at a price of $1,000,000 in cash or common shares for the second 1% NSR.
 
The Green Giant Property comprises claims located in south‐central Madagascar located in the UTM zone 38S on the WGS 84 datum at coordinates 510,000 E 7,350,000 N, 145 km southeast of the city of Toliara, in the Tulear region/Fotadrevo, covering an area of 225 km2 situated in two separate blocks. The Green Giant Property is composed of two separate groups of four and two Research Permits respectively. 
 
The discovery of potentially economic vanadium mineralization on the Green Giant Property changed the focus of the 2008 diamond‐drilling program. Through a combination of prospecting, ground based scintillometer surveying, and analysis of a published airborne radiometric survey, five extensive vanadium‐bearing trends were identified during the 2008 exploration program. These vanadiferous trends are theorized to have formed in a black shale or paleo‐roll‐front environment before being subjected to regional granulite facies metamorphism. 
 
The Company selected the Jaky and Manga vanadium‐bearing trend as the most prospective targets on the property and focus the late 2009‐drill program at delineating mineralized material on these two deposits. Various metallurgical scoping test programs have been completed since Q4 2009, covering physical and chemical pre-concentration processes, acid and alkaline leaching (atmospheric and pressure), alkaline salt roasting and high definition mineralogical characterization. Mineralogical characterization of several silicate samples has revealed a unique deportment of vanadium at the Green Giant Property. Vanadium bearing minerals include clays, micas, oxides, and sulphides.
 
The mineral deposits on the Green Giant Property have been divided into three separate zones, which are referred to as the Jaky, Manga, and Mainty deposits. The vanadium deposits on the Green Giant Property are split into two separate categories: oxide and primary. The mineralization analysis utilized 18,832 m of diamond drill hole data from the 2008, 2009, and 2010 drill programs and was supplemented by approximately 5,928 m of trench data from the 2008 and 2009 exploration programs.
 
Since early 2012, the Company has focused its efforts on the Molo Graphite Project and as such only minimal work has been completed on the Green Giant property since that time. At such time, the Company does not consider the Green Giant Property to be a material asset of the Company.

Sagar Property, Labrador Trough Region, Quebec, Canada
 
In 2006, the Company purchased from Virginia Mines Inc. ("Virginia") a 100% interest in 382 claims located in northern Quebec, Canada. Virginia retains a 2% net smelter return royalty ("NSR") on certain claims within the property. Other unrelated parties also retain a 1% NSR and a 0.5% NSR on certain claims within the property, of which half of the 1% NSR can be acquired by the Company by paying $200,000 and half of the 0.5% NSR can be acquired by the Company by paying $100,000. 
 
On February 28, 2014, the Company signed an agreement to sell a 35% interest in the Sagar Property to Honey Badger Exploration Inc. (“Honey Badger”), a public company that is a related party through common management. The terms of the agreement were subsequently amended on July 31, 2014 and again on May 8, 2015. To earn the 35% interest, Honey Badger was required to complete a payment of $36,045 (CAD$50,000) by December 31, 2015, incur exploration expenditures of $360,450 (CAD$500,000) by December 31, 2016 and issue 20,000,000 common shares to the Company by December 31, 2015. Honey Badger did not complete the earn-in requirements by December 31, 2015 resulting in the termination of the option agreement.
 
Since early 2012, the Company has focused its efforts on the Molo Graphite Project and as such only minimal work has been completed on the Sagar Property since that time. At such time, the Company does not consider the Sagar Property to be a material asset of the Company.
