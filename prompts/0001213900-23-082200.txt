Item 1.Business.
Introduction



We are a blank check company formed as a Delaware corporation for the purpose of effecting a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses (the “business combination”). We have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenue to date. Based on our business activities, the Company is a “shell company” as defined under the Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) because we have no operations and nominal assets consisting almost entirely of cash.



On March 2, 2021, we consummated our initial public offering (the “initial public offering”) of 50,000,000 units (the “units”), including the issuance of 6,500,000 units as a result of the underwriters’ partial exercise of their over-allotment option. Each unit consists of one share of Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 (“Class A common stock”) and one-third of one redeemable warrant, with each whole warrant entitling the holder thereof to purchase one share of Class A common stock for $11.50 per share. The units were sold at a price of $10.00 per unit, generating gross proceeds of $500 million.



Simultaneously with the consummation of the initial public offering, we completed the private sale (the “private placement”) of an aggregate of 7,133,333 warrants (the “private placement warrants”) to the Sponsor at a purchase price of $1.50 per warrant, generating gross proceeds of $10,700,000.



Prior to the consummation of the initial public offering, on January 11, 2021, we issued an aggregate of 8,625,000 shares (the “founder shares”) of our Class B common stock, par value $0.0001 (“Class B common stock”) to the Sponsor for an aggregate purchase price of $25,000 in cash. On February 18, 2021, we effected a 1:1.2167 stock split of our Class B common stock, resulting in our Sponsor holding an aggregate of 10,493,750 founder shares. On February 25, 2021, we effected a 1:1.19178 stock split of the Company’s Class B common stock, resulting in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 12,506,250 founder shares. As a result of the underwriters’ partial exercise of their over-allotment option, the Sponsor forfeited 6,250 founder shares, which resulted in the Sponsor holding an aggregate of 12,500,000 founder shares.



A total of $500,000,000, comprised of $491,300,000 of the proceeds from the initial public offering (which amount includes $18,800,000 of the underwriters’ deferred discount) and $8,700,000 of the proceeds of the sale of the private placement warrants, was placed in a U.S.-based trust account (the “trust account”) at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.



The funds held in the trust account are invested in U.S. government securities, within the meaning set forth in Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the “Investment Company Act”), with a maturity of 185 days or less or in money market funds meeting the conditions of Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of an initial business combination or (ii) the distribution of the trust account, as described below.



As of December 31, 2022, there was $506,713,948 in investments and cash held in the trust account, which includes $6,713,948 of interest income, and approximately $3,773 of cash held outside the trust account. As of December 31, 2022, we had withdrawn $332,505 interest earned from the trust account.



Effecting Our Initial Business Combination



General



We are not presently engaged in, and we will not engage in, any operations until the consummation of our initial business combination. We intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash held in the trust account, the proceeds of the sale of our shares in connection with our initial business combination (including pursuant to forward purchase agreements or backstop agreements we may enter into), shares issued to the owners of the target, debt issued to bank or other lenders or the owners of the target, or a combination of the foregoing. We may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth, which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses.



If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial business combination or used for redemptions of our Class A common stock, we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

Selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination



While we may pursue an acquisition in any business industry or sector, we intend to concentrate our efforts identifying businesses in the financial services industry with an enterprise value of approximately $1.5 billion to $5.0 billion, with particular emphasis on businesses that are providing or changing technology for traditional financial services (“FinTech”), those in the wealth, investment and asset management sectors, or certain types of technology companies that lie adjacent to the FinTech sector. Such companies might include those providing artificial intelligence, information, data and analytics, tech-enabled services, risk, and compliance solutions, including those focused on financial, regulatory, fraud and cybersecurity risk, and/or enterprise software solutions, among others. In addition, we intend to capitalize on the ability of our management team to identify, acquire, and manage a business in the FinTech and financial services industries that can benefit from their experience and differentiated global network. Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (as amended on February 25, 2021 and March 1, 2023, our “second amended and restated certificate of incorporation”) prohibits us from effectuating a business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations.



The New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) rules require that we must consummate an initial business combination with one or more operating businesses or assets with a fair market value equal to at least 80% of the net assets held in the trust account (net of amounts disbursed to management for working capital purposes, if permitted, and excluding the amount of any deferred underwriting commissions). Our board of directors will make the determination as to the fair market value of our initial business combination. If our board of directors is not able to independently determine the fair market value of our initial business combination, we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm which is a member of FINRA or a valuation or appraisal firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria. While we consider it unlikely that our board of directors will not be able to make an independent determination of the fair market value of our initial business combination, it may be unable to do so if it is less familiar or experienced with the business of a particular target or if there is a significant amount of uncertainty as to the value of the target’s assets or prospects.



We anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the post-transaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire 100% of the equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses. We may, however, structure our initial business combination such that the post-transaction company owns or acquires less than 100% of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons, but we will only complete such business combination if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, or the Investment Company Act. Even if the post-transaction company owns or acquires 50% or more of the voting securities of the target, our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority interest in the post-transaction company, depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction. For example, we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target. In this case, we would acquire a 100% controlling interest in the target. However, as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares, our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination. If less than 100% of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the post-transaction company, the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be taken into account for purposes of the 80% of net assets test described above. If the business combination involves more than one target business, the 80% of net assets test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses.



In evaluating prospective business combinations, we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review process that will encompass, among other things, a review of historical and projected financial and operating data, meetings with management and their advisors (if applicable), on-site inspection of facilities and assets, discussion with customers and suppliers, legal reviews, and other reviews as we deem appropriate.



The time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination, and the costs associated with this process, are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty. Any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our initial business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination.





2







We are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with the Sponsor or our officers or directors. In the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with the Sponsor, our officers, or directors, we, or a committee of independent directors, will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm that is a member of FINRA or an independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view.



Redemption rights for holders of public shares upon consummation of the initial business combination



We will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of Class A common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.00 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial stockholders, Sponsor, officers, and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.



Conduct of redemptions pursuant to tender offer rules



If we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the SEC, we will, pursuant to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies.



Submission of our initial business combination to a stockholder vote



In the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the business combination.



If we seek stockholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock are voted in favor of the initial business combination. In such case, our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares purchased during or after the initial public offering, in favor of our initial business combination. Each public stockholder may elect to redeem its public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and any public shares they may hold in connection with the consummation of the initial business combination.



If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants or a combination thereof in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. There is no limit on the number of our securities our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors, or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and NYSE rules. Any such price per share may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial business combination. Additionally, at any time at or prior to our initial business combination, subject to applicable securities laws (including with respect to material non-public information), our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors, or their affiliates may enter into transactions with investors and others to provide them with incentives to acquire public shares, vote their public shares in favor of our initial business combination or not redeem their public shares. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. Such persons will be subject to restrictions in making any such purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will be required to comply with such rules. We expect any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting requirements.





3







The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.



Limitation on Redemption upon Completion of our Initial Business Combination if we Seek Stockholder Approval



Notwithstanding the foregoing redemption rights, if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that a public stockholder, together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined under Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from redeeming its shares with respect to more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering, without our prior consent. We believe the restriction described above will discourage stockholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to redeem their shares as a means to force us or our management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public stockholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights against a business combination if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our Sponsor, or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our stockholders’ ability to redeem to no more than 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of stockholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our stockholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including all shares held by those stockholders that hold more than 15% of the shares sold in the initial public offering) for or against our initial business combination.



Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation if no Initial Business Combination



Our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation provided that we have only 24 months from the closing of the initial public offering, or March 2, 2023 to complete our initial business combination.



On February 28, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the “February Special Meeting”), at which our stockholders approved the proposals presented to them to amend our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (i) extend the date in which we have to complete a business combination from March 2, 2023 to September 2, 2023, (ii) allow our board of directors, in its sole discretion, to elect to wind up the Company’s operations on a date earlier than the Extended Date and (iii) provide holders of our shares of Class B common stock the right to convert any and all of their shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis prior to the closing of our initial business combination.



On September 1, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the "September Special Meeting), pursuant to which, among other things, our stockholders approved an amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation to (i) extend the date in which we have to consummate an initial business combination from September 2, 2023 to March 2, 2024 (such date, the "Extended Date") and (ii) remove (A) the limitation that the Company shall not consummate an initial business combination if it would cause the Company's net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and (B) the limitation that the Company shall not redeem its shares of Class A common stock such that it would cause the Company's net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions.



If we are unable to complete our initial business combination within the Extended Date, we will: (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders’ rights as stockholders (including the right to receive further liquidating distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject, in each case, to our obligations under Delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our initial business combination by the Extended Date.



Competition



In identifying, evaluating, and selecting a target business for our initial business combination, we may encounter competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other special purpose acquisition companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, public companies and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human, and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.

Employees



We currently have two executive officers: John James and Erik Thoresen. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters, but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the initial business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full-time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
Recent Developments



On February 28, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the “February Special Meeting”), pursuant to which, among other things, our stockholders approved an amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “February Charter Amendment”) to (i) extend the time in which we have to complete an initial business combination from March 2, 2023 to September 2, 2023 and permit our board of directors in its sole discretion to wind up our operations on an earlier date as determined by them and included in a public announcement and (ii) provide holders of our shares of Class B common stock with the right to convert any and all of their shares of Class B common stock into shares of Class A common stock prior to the closing of an initial business combination on a one-for-one basis at the election of the holder. In connection with the February Special Meeting, stockholders holding 45,524,677 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Company’s trust account as of January 25, 2023, including any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable). As a result, approximately $463.4 million (approximately $10.18 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $45.6 million remained in the Trust Account. Following the aforementioned redemptions, the Company had 16,975,323 shares of common stock outstanding, which includes 4,475,323 shares of Class A common stock and 12,500,000 shares of Class B common stock. In connection with the February Special Meeting, on March 1, 2023, we filed the February Charter Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.



Between August 25, 2023 and August 31, 2023, we and the Sponsor entered into a non-redemption agreement (the “Non-Redemption Agreements”) with unaffiliated third party investors (the “NRA Investors”), pursuant to which the NRA Investors have agreed, in connection with the September Special Meeting (as defined below), to not redeem, or to reverse and revoke any prior redemption election, with respect to 2,105,697 shares of Class A common stock held by them and the Sponsor has agreed to transfer to the NRA Investors an aggregate of 471,424 founder shares. The foregoing description of the Non-Redemption Agreements does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the form of Non-Redemption Agreement, which is filed hereto as Exhibit 10.10.



On August 29, 2023, in accordance with our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, the Sponsor elected to convert 12,500,000 shares of Class B common stock held by it into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis for no consideration. As a result, as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are no shares of Class B common stock outstanding.



Also on August 29, 2023, the Company and Sponsor entered into a subscription agreement (the “Polar Subscription Agreement”) with Polar Multi-Strategy Master Fund (“Polar”), an unaffiliated third party of the Company, pursuant to which Polar agrees to make certain capital contributions (the “Polar Capital Contribution”) from time to time, at the request of the Sponsor, subject to the terms and conditions of the Polar Subscription Agreement, to the Sponsor to meet the Sponsor’s commitment to fund our working capital needs. In exchange for the commitment of Polar to provide the Polar Capital Contribution, (i) we will issue shares of Class A common stock to Polar at the closing of our initial business combination; and (ii) upon repayment of working capital loans by the Company, the Sponsor will return the Investor Capital Contribution at the closing of an initial business combination. In exchange for the forgoing commitment of Polar to make capital contributions to the Sponsor, we agreed to, or cause the surviving entity following the closing of our initial business combination to, issue one share of Class A common stock for each dollar of the Investor Capital Contribution funded by Polar at the time of the closing of our initial business combination. We granted certain registration rights, as described in the Polar Subscription Agreement, with respect to such shares. The foregoing description of the Polar Subscription Agreement does not purport to be complete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Polar Subscription Agreement, which is filed hereto as Exhibit 10.11.



On September 1, 2023, we held a special meeting of stockholders (the “September Special Meeting”), pursuant to which, among other things, our stockholders approved an amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the “September Charter Amendment”) to (i) extend the time in which we have to complete an initial business combination from September 2, 2023 to March 2, 2024 and (ii) remove (A) the limitation that the Company shall not consummate an initial business combination if it would cause the Company’s net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 and (B) the limitation that the Company shall not redeem its shares of Class A Common Stock such that it would cause the Company’s net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 following such redemptions. In connection with the September Special Meeting, stockholders holding 2,280,576 shares of Class A common stock exercised their right to redeem such shares for a pro rata portion of the funds held in the Company’s trust account as of August 14, 2023, including any interest earned on the funds held in the Trust Account (which interest shall be net of taxes payable). As a result, approximately $24.2 million (approximately $10.60 per share) was removed from the Trust Account to pay such holders and approximately $23.3 million remained in the Trust Account. Following the aforementioned redemptions, the Company had 14,694,747 shares of Class A common stock outstanding, which includes 2,194,747 public shares and 12,500,000 founder shares. In connection with the September Special Meeting, on September 1, 2023, we filed the September Charter Amendment with the Delaware Secretary of State.



In addition, on October 18, 2023, the NYSE notified us, and publicly announced, that the staff of NYSE Regulation determined to suspend trading immediately and commence proceedings to delist our units and shares of Class A common stock pursuant to Section 802.01B of the NYSE's Listed Company Manual because we had fallen below the NYSE's continued listing standard requiring a listed acquisition company to maintain an average aggregate global market capitalization attributable to its publicly-held shares over a consecutive thirty-trading day period of at least $40 million. We expect such securities to trade over-the-counter.
