ITEM 1. BUSINESS
Overview

1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. (“PIH”, the “Company”, “we”, or “us”) was incorporated on October 2, 2012 in the State of Delaware under the name Maison Insurance Holdings, Inc. On November 19, 2013 we changed our legal name to 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc. The Company has three wholly owned subsidiaries: Maison Insurance Company (“Maison”), Maison Managers, Inc. (“MMI”), and ClaimCor, LLC (“ClaimCor”).

Prior to March 31, 2014, the Company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingsway America Inc. (“KAI”). KAI, in turn is a wholly owned subsidiary of Kingsway Financial Services Inc. (“KFSI”), a publicly owned holding company based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. On March 31, 2014, the Company completed an initial public offering (“IPO”) of its common stock and then on June 13, 2014, the Company completed a follow-on offering. Through the combination of the Company’s IPO and follow-on offering, we issued approximately five million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2016 KAI and companies affiliated with KAI held approximately 975,000 shares of our common stock equivalent to approximately 16.4% of our outstanding shares.

Through Maison, we began providing property and casualty insurance to individuals in Louisiana in December 2012. In September 2015, Maison began writing manufactured home policies in the State of Texas on a direct basis. Our current insurance offerings in Louisiana and Texas include homeowners insurance, manufactured home insurance and dwelling fire insurance. We write both full peril property policies as well as wind/hail only exposures and we produce new policies through a network of independent insurance agents. We refer to the policies we write through independent agents as voluntary policies.

We also write commercial business in Texas through a quota share agreement with Brotherhood Mutual Insurance Company (“Brotherhood”). Through this agreement, we have assumed wind/hail only exposures on certain churches and related structures Brotherhood insures throughout the State of Texas.

We have also participated in depopulation programs implemented by Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Company (“Citizens”) as well as the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (“TWIA”). These programs were instituted by each respective state in order to reduce the number of properties each state insures. Under the programs, state-approved insurance companies such as Maison have the opportunity to assume insurance policies written by both Citizens and TWIA. We have voluntarily participated in the last five depopulation rounds from Citizens, occurring on December 1st of each year, while December 1, 2016 marked the inaugural depopulation for TWIA.

Maison Managers, Inc. serves as the Company’s management services subsidiary, known as a managing general agency. MMI earns commissions on a portion of the premiums Maison writes, as well as a per policy fee which ranges from $0-$75 for providing policy administration, marketing, reinsurance contract negotiation, and accounting and analytical services. Both Maison and MMI are licensed by and subject to the regulatory oversight of the Louisiana Department of Insurance (“LDI”) and Texas Department of Insurance (“TDI”).
 
On January 2, 2015, the Company completed its acquisition of 100% of the membership interest of ClaimCor, a claims and underwriting technical solutions company. Maison processes claims made by its policyholders through ClaimCor, and also through various third-party claims adjusting companies.
 
Florida Certificate of Authority
 
On March 1, 2017 Maison received a certificate of authority from the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation (“OIR”) which authorizes Maison to write personal lines insurance in the State of Florida. Pursuant to the Consent Order issued, Maison has agreed to comply with certain requirements as outlined by the OIR until Maison can demonstrate three consecutive years of net income following the Company’s admission into Florida as evidenced by its Annual Statement filed with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. Among other requirements, the OIR requires the following as conditions related to the issuance of Maison’s certificate of authority:

● | Although domiciled in the State of Louisiana, Maison agreed to comply with the Florida Insurance Code as if Maison were a domestic insurer within the State of Florida;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maison agreed to maintain capital and surplus as to policyholders of no less than $35 million;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maison agreed to receive prior approval from the OIR prior to the payment of any dividends and;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Maison agreed to receive written approval from the OIR regarding any form of policy issued, or rate charged to its policyholders prior to utilizing any such form or rate for policies written in the State of Florida.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 
To comply with the Consent Order, Maison will receive a capital contribution from its parent company, 1347 Property Insurance Holdings, Inc., in the approximate amount of $15 million. This contribution is expected to be in the form of one or more surplus notes as well as a direct contribution to paid in and contributed surplus and is expected to occur prior to March 31, 2017. As of March 16, 2017 Maison has not written any insurance policies covering risks in the State of Florida.
 
Business Strategy
 
Mission Statement: We will deploy internal expertise and leverage external partnerships to provide market solutions and in return generate the expected profits identified in our vision statement while taking prudent steps to limit exposure to downside. Our team will continuously evaluate existing markets to ensure they remain consistent with our expectations and identify potential new markets where expansion opportunities may emerge. If writing other property lines that compliment these specifically targeted segments allows us to reduce operating expenses, improve reinsurance purchasing or support distribution we will do so. We will reduce exposure to, or exit, any markets where attributes no longer support the expected amount of underwriting profit.
 
Our primary goal is to continue to expand our property and casualty writings through:
 

● | Increasing our number of voluntary policies. Ease of use enhancements for our web-based agent quoting portal as well as refining our product offerings has provided a marketable advantage in organic new policy growth for Maison. Our goal is to continue to grow through strategic relationships with agencies in the states where we currently provide insurance and also potentially in new coastal markets in the U.S. Our years of experience in the coastal markets make us uniquely qualified to manage agent expectations and provide superior support and service for policyholders.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Strategic acquisitions. We intend to explore growth opportunities through strategic acquisitions in coastal states, including Louisiana, Texas and Florida. We also plan to pursue complementary books of business provided they meet our underwriting criteria. We will evaluate each opportunity based on expected economic contribution to our results and support of our market expansion initiatives.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

● | Attracting and retaining high-quality agents. We intend to focus our marketing efforts on maintaining and improving our relationships with highly productive independent agents, as well as on attracting new high quality agents in areas with a substantial potential for profitable growth.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Reducing our ratio of expenses to net premiums earned and using technology to increase our operating efficiency. We are committed to improving our profitability by reducing expenses through enhanced technologies and by increasing the number of policies we write through the strategic deployment of our capital. We currently outsource our policy administration and a portion of our claims handling functions to third parties with dedicated Maison oversight and direction, which we believe results in increased service and lower expense and loss ratios.

Competition

We operate in a highly competitive market and face competition from national and regional insurance companies, many of whom are larger and have greater financial and other resources and offer more diversified insurance coverage. Our competitors include companies which market their products through independent agents, as well as companies with captive agents. Large national companies may have certain competitive advantages over regional companies such as ours, including increased name recognition, increased loyalty of their customer base and reduced policy acquisition costs.

We may also face competition from new entrants in our niche markets. In some cases, these companies may price their products below ours due to their interest in quickly growing their business in Louisiana or Texas. Although our pricing is inevitably influenced to some degree by that of our competitors, we believe that it is generally not in our best interest to compete solely on price. We also compete on the basis of underwriting criteria, our distribution network and superior policy, underwriting and claims service to our agents and insureds.

Some of the national and regional companies which compete with us in the Texas and Louisiana homeowners’ markets include ASI Lloyds, Lighthouse Property Insurance Corporation, United Property & Casualty, First Community Insurance Company, Southern Fidelity Insurance, Safepoint Insurance Company, Imperial F&C Insurance Company, Americas Insurance Company, Access Home Insurance Company, Family Security Insurance Company, Gulfstream Property and Casualty Insurance Company, Federated National Insurance Company, and Centauri Specialty Insurance Company.

Claims Administration

Claims administration and adjusting involves the handling of routine “non-catastrophic” as well as catastrophic claims. In the event of a hurricane or other catastrophic claim, our claims volume would increase significantly. Rather than increase the size of our staff in anticipation of such an event, we believe that outsourcing claims adjusting improves our operational efficiency because an appropriately selected third party will have the resources to adjust the catastrophe related claims cost effectively and with the level of service we endeavor to provide for our policyholders. Accordingly, we have outsourced our claims adjusting program to certain third party adjusters with experience in Texas and Louisiana. We expect to implement a similar model in Florida when appropriate.

Under the terms of the service contract between Maison and MMI, MMI handles the actual claims administration for both catastrophic and non-catastrophic insurable events. In handling the claims administration, the examiner for MMI reviews all claims and loss reports, and if warranted, investigates such claims and losses. 
Field adjusting is outsourced to our wholly-owned subsidiary, ClaimCor, as well as third-party service providers, who, subject to company guidance and oversight, either settle or contest the claims. Approval for payment of a claim is given by MMI after careful review of the field adjuster’s report. We maintain a claims fund for the disbursement of payments to our customers after insurable events, and make deposits into the claims fund as claims are incurred. We pay adjusters based on a pre-determined fee schedule. Although we are ultimately responsible for paying the claims made by our policyholders, we believe that outsourcing our claims handling program while maintaining an oversight function is an efficient mechanism for handling individual matters. Furthermore, by delivering responsive service in a challenging situation, we optimize the relationship between insured and insurer.

Reinsurance

Maison follows the industry practice of reinsuring a portion of its risk. When an insurance company purchases reinsurance, it transfers or “cedes” all or a portion of its exposure on insurance underwritten by it to another insurer-the “reinsurer.” Although reinsurance is intended to reduce an insurance company’s risk, the ceding of insurance does not legally discharge the insurance company from its primary liability for the full obligation of its policies. If the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the reinsurance agreement, the ceding company is still required to pay the insured for the loss. Maison and its reinsurance broker are selective in choosing reinsurers and they consider various factors, including, but not limited to, the financial stability of the reinsurers, the reinsurers’ history of responding to claims, as well as the reinsurer’s overall reputation in making such determinations.

From year-to-year, both the availability of reinsurance and the costs associated with the acquisition of reinsurance will vary. These fluctuations are not subject to our control and may limit our insurance subsidiary’s ability to purchase adequate coverage.

In order to limit the credit risk associated with amounts which may become due from our reinsurers, Maison predominantly uses several different reinsurers, which have an A.M. Best Rating of A- (Excellent) or better. Absent such rating, we have required the reinsurers to place collateral on deposit with an independent financial institution under a trust agreement for our benefit. A list of some of the reinsurance companies which we currently use includes Allianz Risk Transfer, AXIS Specialty Limited, Everest Re, DaVinci Re, Renaissance Re, Odyssey Re, Gen Re, as well as various Lloyd’s of London participating syndicates.

The Company’s excess of loss reinsurance treaties are based upon a treaty year beginning on June 1st of each year and expiring on May 31st of the following year. Thus, the financial statements for the years ending December 31, 2016 and 2015 contain premiums ceded under three separate excess of loss treaties. Under the Company’s 2015/2016 excess of loss treaty which expired on May 31, 2016, for each catastrophic event occurring within a 144-hour period, the Company received reinsurance recoveries of up to $121 million in excess of a retention of $4 million per event. The Company had also procured another layer of reinsurance protection that could have been used for any event above $125 million, up to a maximum recovery of $15 million. This $15 million second layer of coverage applied in total to all events occurring during the treaty year of June 1, 2015 through May 31, 2016. Thus, the aggregate loss which the Company retained for the two catastrophes which occurred during the 2015/2016 treaty year was $5 million.

On June 1, 2016 the Company entered into a new excess of loss treaty whereby for each catastrophic event occurring within a 144-hour period, the Company receives reinsurance recoveries of up to $170 million in excess of a $5 million retention per event. For any event above $175 million, the Company has purchased aggregate coverage, with an additional limit of $25 million and subject to a franchise deductible of $125,000 for each 144-hour occurrence. The $25 million aggregate coverage applies in total to all events occurring during the June 1, 2016 to May 31, 2017 treaty year. The aggregate loss the Company could retain for two catastrophes occurring during its current treaty year is $7 million.

Investments

We have historically tailored our investment policy in an effort to minimize risk in the current financial market. Although applicable laws and regulations permit investments (within specified limits and subject to certain qualifications) in federal, state and municipal obligations, corporate bonds, preferred and common equity securities and real estate mortgages, as of December 31, 2016, we invested primarily in high quality fixed income instruments rated “BBB” or higher by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services.

The cash balances of our subsidiaries may be invested in other types of securities subject to domiciliary state regulations, but those investments are subject to pre-approval by our investment committee and the performance of such investments must be reported to our board of directors quarterly. Our investment policy is approved by our investment committee and is reviewed on a regular basis in order to ensure that our investment policy evolves in response to changes in the financial market. Our investment policy is designed to maximize investment income within specified guidelines, with a strong emphasis on protection of principal.

As part of the Company’s strategic planning process which was concluded in the first quarter of 2017, it was determined that investments should evolve to include alternative opportunities, all of which will be overseen by the Company’s Investment Committee. This Committee will operate as a sub-committee of the Company’s Board of Directors, and with the Company’s expected return on equity target in mind, particularly at times where the Company’s capital exceeds the amount necessary to support insurance underwriting activities.

Technology

Our business depends upon the use, development and implementation of integrated technology systems. These systems enable us to provide a high level of service to agents and policyholders by: processing business in a timely and efficient manner; communicating and sharing data with agents; providing a variety of methods for the payment of premiums and; allowing for the accumulation and analysis of information for the management of our insurance subsidiary. We believe the availability and use of these technology systems has resulted in improved service to agents and customers and increased efficiencies in processing the business of Maison and resulted in lower operating costs.
Regulation

We are subject to the laws and regulations in Louisiana, Florida and Texas, and will be subject to the regulations of any other states in which we may seek to conduct business in the future. In these states, it is the duty of each respective department of insurance to administer the provisions of the insurance code in that state. The purpose of each state’s insurance code is to regulate the insurance industry in all of its phases, including, but not limited to the following: licensing of insurers and producers, regulation of investments and solvency, review and approval of forms and rates, and market conduct. Furthermore, as Maison is domiciled in the State of Louisiana, the LDI conducts periodic examinations of the financial condition and market conduct of Maison and requires Maison to file financial and other reports on a quarterly and annual basis.

Regulation of the Payment of Dividends

Dividends paid by Maison are restricted by the Louisiana Insurance Code. Dividends can only be paid if Maison’s paid-in capital and surplus exceed the minimum required by the Louisiana Insurance Code by one hundred percent or more, or as otherwise provided. Any dividend or distribution (that when aggregated with any other dividends or distributions made within the preceding twelve months) which exceeds the lesser of (a) ten percent of the insurer’s surplus as regards policyholders as of the thirty-first day of December next preceding; or (b) the net income of the insurer, not including realized capital gains, for the twelve month period ending the thirty-first day of December next preceding; is considered to be extra-ordinary and shall not be paid until thirty days after the LDI has received notice of the declaration thereof and has not within that period disapproved the payment, or until the LDI has approved the payment within the thirty-day period. In determining whether a dividend or distribution is extra-ordinary, an insurer may carry forward net income from the previous two calendar years that has not already been paid out in dividends. Furthermore, pursuant to the Consent Order issued to us, Maison is restricted from issuing any dividends to its shareholder without receiving prior approval from the OIR. As of December 31, 2016, Maison has not paid any dividends to its sole shareholder, PIH.

Regulation of Rates and Rules

Maison is subject to state laws and regulations regarding approval of rates and rules. The LDI and TDI have the exclusive authority to approve insurance rates or rate changes for all lines of property and casualty insurance in their respective states. Maison’s ability to change rates and the relative timing of the rate making process are dependent upon each state’s statutory and regulatory requirements.

Requirements for Exiting Geographic Markets and/or Canceling or Non-renewing Policies

Maison is subject to Louisiana and Texas state laws and regulations which may restrict Maison’s timing or ability to either discontinue or substantially reduce its writings in the states in which it operates. These laws and regulations limit the reasons for cancellation or non-renewal, typically require prior notice, and in some instances require prior approval from the respective regulatory agency. In Louisiana, no insurer may cancel or fail to renew a homeowner’s policy of insurance or increase the policy deductible that has been in effect and renewed for more than three years unless the change is based upon non-payment of premium, fraud of the insured, a material change in the risk being insured, two or more claims within a period of three years, or if continuance of such policy endangers the solvency of the insurer.

Risk of Assessment by Louisiana and Texas 

Maison is a member of the Louisiana Insurance Guaranty Association as a condition of its authority to transact insurance in Louisiana and is subject to assessment as set forth in the Louisiana Insurance Code.

Maison is also required to participate, as a condition of its authority to transact insurance in Louisiana, in the residual insurance market programs operated by Louisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation and designated as the Coastal Plan and the Fair Plan. Maison is subject to assessment as set forth in the Louisiana Insurance Code for its participation in the Coastal Plan and its participation in the Fair Plan.

As a property insurer licensed in Texas, Maison is a member of TWIA, which provides wind and hail coverage to coastal risks unable to procure coverage in the voluntary market. Maison may become subject to assessment from TWIA on or after the second anniversary from the date in which Maison was first admitted to write insurance in Texas (May 2017) should a major loss event deplete TWIA’s available loss reserves and reinsurance coverage. Maison is also a member insurer of the Texas Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association and the FAIR Plan and is subject to assessment by each as set forth in the Texas Insurance Code.
Insurance Regulatory Information System
 
The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) developed the Insurance Regulatory Information System (“IRIS”) to help state regulators identify companies that may require special attention. Using IRIS, financial examiners develop key financial ratios in order to assess the financial condition of insurance companies such as Maison. Each ratio has an established “usual range” of results. A ratio which falls outside the usual range however, is not considered a failing result, but instead may be viewed as part of the regulatory early monitoring system. In some cases, it may not be unusual for financially sound companies to have several ratios with results outside of the usual range.
 
For the year ended December 31, 2016, Maison had twelve of the thirteen IRIS ratio results within the usual range. The ratio which had results which fell outside of the usual range was due to the fact that Maison’s yield on investments was below the lower end of the usual range (3%) due to the general low investment yields currently realized on the highly rated fixed income securities we hold as part of our overall investment strategy.
 
Management does not anticipate regulatory action as a result of these IRIS ratio results.
 
Risk Based Capital Requirements
 
In the United States, a risk-based capital (“RBC”) formula is used by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) to identify property and casualty insurance companies that may not be adequately capitalized. Most states, including Louisiana and Texas, have adopted the NAIC RBC requirements. In general, insurers reporting surplus with respect to policyholders below 200% of the authorized control level, as defined by the NAIC, on December 31st of the previous year are subject to varying levels of regulatory action, which may include discontinuation of operations. As of December 31, 2016, Maison’s reported surplus was considered to be in the “no action” level as defined by the state regulators. Furthermore, pursuant to the consent order approving Maison’s admission into the State of Texas, Maison has agreed to maintain a RBC ratio of 300% or more, and provide calculation of such ratio to the TDI on a periodic basis. As of December 31, 2016, Maison’s RBC ratio was 346%.
State Deposits
 
States routinely require deposits of assets for the protection of policyholders either in those states or for all policyholders. As of December 31, 2016, Maison held investment securities with an estimated fair value of approximately $100,000 as a deposit with the LDI and cash and investment securities with an estimated fair value of approximately $1,992,000 as a deposit with the TDI.
Employees
 
As of December 31, 2016 we had twenty-seven employees, seventeen of whom work at our offices in Tampa, Florida, six of whom work at our offices in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and four of whom work from Texas. From time to time, we employ and supplement our staff with temporary employees and consultants. We are not a party to any collective bargaining agreement and believe that relations with our employees are satisfactory. Each of our employees has entered into confidentiality agreements with us.
