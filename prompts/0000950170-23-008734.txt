 Item 1. Business.
Overview
 Athenex, Inc., together with its subsidiaries (“Athenex,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”), is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company dedicated to becoming a leader in the discovery, development and commercialization of next-generation products for the treatment of cancer. Our mission is to become a leader in bringing innovative cancer treatments to the market and to improve patient health outcomes. In pursuit of this mission, Athenex leverages years of experience in research and development, clinical trials, regulatory standards, and manufacturing.
We are focused on our innovative cell therapy platform, based on natural killer T (“NKT”) cells. NKT cells have unique biology that has potential advantages over current T cell and NK cell-based technologies. The potential advantages of NKT cell therapy technology over other immune effector cell types are to:
 (1)Address a major unmet medical need in hematological malignancies and solid tumors in that even in those indications where autologous chimeric antigen receptor (“CAR”) T cells have been previously approved, up to 60% of patients receiving CAR-T therapy do not achieve long-term durable responses;
 (2)Overcome the challenges in the treatment of solid tumors by naturally homing to tumors, reversing immunosuppressive tumor microenvironments, and possessing long-term memory and persistence;
 (3)Reduce the frequency and severity of toxicity commonly caused by CAR-T cell therapies. such as cytokine release syndrome (“CRS”) and immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (“ICANS”);
 (4)Manufacture allogeneic CAR-NKT cells without high risk of graft-versus-host disease (“GvHD”) starting with the lymphocytes of healthy donors, rather than patients (who are the source of autologous cell therapy starting materials), resulting in a more robust and consistent product without exposure to previous cytotoxic cancer therapy; and
 (5)Provide allogeneic (“off-the-shelf”) CAR-NKT cell therapy products produced at larger scale than autologous cell therapy products, potentially at lower cost.
 In 2023, we plan to focus on developing our novel immune effector cell therapy platform and its product candidates. See “Our R&D Programs – Cell Therapy Platform” below for more information.
We are also continuing certain studies of oral paclitaxel and encequidar (“Oral Paclitaxel”), the currently active product candidate using our Orascovery technology, based on a P-glycoprotein (“P-gp”) pump inhibitor. Oral Paclitaxel received a Complete Response Letter (“CRL”) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) in February 2021. In October 2021, after careful consideration of the FDA’s feedback, we determined to redeploy our resources to focus on our cell therapy platform and ongoing studies of Oral Paclitaxel. We are continuing to (i) support a study being conducted in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor (dostarlimab) +/- carboplatin in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting for breast cancer and (ii) evaluate Oral Paclitaxel in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (“NSCLC”). See “Our R&D Programs – Orascovery Platform” below for more information.
In early 2022, we announced a new vision for the future of Athenex that is focused on the cell therapy platform. We redirected our research and development (“R&D”) resources to develop and advance our promising NKT cell therapy programs and execute on several financial initiatives, including cost savings measures, to right-size the company and support our transformation. We determined to discontinue the Orascovery platform apart from Oral Paclitaxel. We also planned to monetize non-core assets consistent with our new focus and strategy. During the year, we executed a number of actions and transactions as we worked to transform Athenex into a lean, cell therapy-focused company. See “Recent Strategic Actions and Transactions” below for more information. In 2023, we are pursuing a broader range of strategic alternatives while remaining focused on improving our balance sheet as we continue to advance what we believe are promising clinical development programs.
 As we continue to pursue these strategic priorities, we expect to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. We anticipate that our expenses will increase as we seek to:
 •advance the preclinical research and clinical development activities of our cell therapy platform;
 •identify additional research programs and product candidates within our cell therapy platform; 
 •continue selected activities related to our other R&D programs and businesses, including evaluating and pursuing a range of strategic alternatives; and
 •maintain, expand, and protect our intellectual property portfolio.


Our R&D Programs
 Cell Therapy Platform
 NKT cells are a core aspect of our immune effector cell therapy platform. NKT cells comprise a rare subset of lymphocytes that share properties of both innate and adaptive immune cells. NKT cells acquire effector memory functions immediately after exiting the thymus and, thus, behave similarly to innate immunity cells like natural killer (“NK”) cells. Within the immune system, NKT cells have an important function, acting among the first cells in response to either infection or stress in the tissues.
 The target recognition for both NKT and T cells is strictly restricted and antigen specific. Although both NKT and T -cells express T-cell receptors (“TCRs”), their models for recognition of antigen (target) are distinct. Both T cells and NKT cells recognize target antigens in association with other molecules, a phenomenon called “restriction.” T-cell TCRs are restricted by either human leukocyte antigen (“HLA”) class I or class II, whereas NKT cell TCRs are restricted by CD1d, which is related to class I HLA in structure. The CD1d molecule is identical in all people (monomorphic) while HLA class I and class II molecules are polymorphic (see following figure). T cells utilize a wide variety of different TCRs, whereas type 1 NKT cells (which we use) employ an invariant TCR (“iTCR”). As a result, without major genetic engineering, the majority of T-cell products must be limited to autologous use, given their potential for toxicity if they are infused into a genetically different recipient (e.g., GvHD). In contrast, because CD1d is the same in all individuals, and NKT cells express an iTCR restricted by CD1d, the potential for GvHD toxicity is minimal. We believe that this provides a promising basis to use NKT cells for an “off-the-shelf” product without the need for complex genetic engineering to prevent GvHD.
 
iTCR = invariant T-cell receptor
 HLA = human leukocyte antigen
 MHC = major histocompatibility complex
 NKT = natural killer T (cell)
 Product Candidates
 We are developing autologous and allogeneic, or “off-the-shelf”, NKT cell immunotherapies for the treatment of solid tumors and hematological malignancies. We acquired the foundation of this technology in 2021 through our acquisition of Kuur Therapeutics, Inc. (formerly known as Cell Medica, “Kuur”) and are pursuing the development of their legacy CAR-NKT cell therapy product candidates, KUR-501, KUR-502, and KUR-503, and are exploring new applications for this technology, such as TCR-NKT cell therapy. The following table summarizes the development status of our current pipeline of cell therapy product candidates as of March 20, 2023:


KUR-501 is an autologous product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting disialoganglioside (“GD2”). GD2 is expressed on almost all neuroblastoma tumors and certain other malignancies. Neuroblastoma is a rare pediatric cancer and patients with relapsed or refractory (“R/R”) high-risk neuroblastoma (“HRNB”) have very poor outcomes. Therefore, we believe there is a significant unmet medical need for better treatment options. KUR-501 is currently being evaluated in a Phase 1 dose-escalation clinical trial (“GINAKIT2”) treating children with R/R HRNB. Updated clinical data from this trial was presented at the American Society of Gene & Cell Therapy Annual Meeting in May 2022. The data demonstrated expansion of CAR-NKT cells post-transfer in all patients and objective responses in patients with R/R HRNB, including patients previously treated with anti-GD2 monoclonal antibody. Overall Response Rate (“ORR”) was 25%, or three responses out of 12 patients, and Disease Control Rate was 58% with four stable disease, two partial responses (“PR”), and one complete response (“CR”). Two of these responses occurred at the highest dose level tested so far of 100 million cells/m2, and the CR lasted for nearly 14 months. KUR-501 has been well-tolerated without dose limiting toxicity (“DLT”), as the majority of adverse events observed were cytopenias related to the preconditioning nonmyeloablative lymphodepletion chemotherapy regimen. There was no evidence of ICANS in any of the patients at the first four dose levels, and there was one case of Grade 2 CRS. The GINAKIT2 study is supported by Athenex and is being conducted by Athenex’s collaborator, the Baylor College of Medicine (“BCM”). BCM temporarily suspended patient enrollment on this study after a young heavily pretreated male patient with R/R HRNB treated at the fifth dose level of 300 million cells/m2 died within three weeks of CAR-NKT cell therapy product administration. He was found to have human metapneumovirus infection, then Grade 1 CRS that was treated with immunosuppressants, and he later developed polyclonal hyperleukocytosis complicated by multiorgan dysfunction without evidence of sepsis. This was followed by a recent FDA-imposed clinical hold on the KUR-501 Investigational New Drug ("IND") while BCM completes their investigation of the etiology and pathogenesis of this event and devises a safety risk mitigation plan to reopen the clinical trial, one that could include excluding patients with concomitant viral infections. No study patients are receiving or scheduled to receive additional treatment with KUR-501. While we intend to work with BCM to help address the FDA's questions and target to reopen the clinical trial during the year, BCM may not resume GINAKIT2 study patient enrollment unless and until the FDA lifts their clinical hold on the KUR-501 IND. There can be no assurance that BCM will be able to resume the Phase 1 clinical trial of KUR-501.
 KUR-502 is an allogeneic (“off-the-shelf”) product in which NKT cells isolated from healthy donors are engineered with a CAR targeting CD19, which is widely expressed on both normal and malignant B cells. In addition to the CAR, KUR-502 is genetically engineered to downregulate surface expression of HLA class I and class II proteins, resulting in reduced recognition and elimination by the host immune system following infusion. KUR-502 is currently being evaluated in a single-center, BCM-sponsored, Phase 1 clinical trial (ANCHOR) treating adults with R/R CD19-positive malignancies, including B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (“NHL”), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (“ALL”), and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. An interim data update on seven evaluable patients was presented at the Tandem Meetings of the American Society of Transplantation and Cellular Therapy and the Center for International Blood & Marrow Transplant Research in April 2022. Five patients were enrolled and treated at the first two dose levels in the NHL cohort, and there were two CRs and one PR for an ORR of 60%, including responses in two patients who were previously treated with CD19-directed CAR-T cell therapy. Both CRs were durable and persisted for more than six months. Two patients were enrolled at the first dose level of the ALL cohort, and there was one CR and one progressive disease (“PD”) for an ORR of 50%. KUR-502 has been well tolerated without DLT, as the majority of adverse events observed were cytopenias related to the preconditioning nonmyeloablative lymphodepletion chemotherapy regimen. There have been three cases of Grade 1 CRS, all observed in the ALL cohort, but there have not been any cases of ICANS or GvHD attributable to CAR-NKT cells. In March 2022, the Company’s IND application to expand the ANCHOR study to a multicenter, Athenex-sponsored Phase 1 study (ANCHOR2) was allowed to proceed by the FDA, which began enrolling patients in Q4 2022.
 KUR-503 is an allogeneic (“off-the-shelf”) product in which NKT cells are engineered with a CAR targeting glypican-3 (“GPC3”). GPC3 is a molecule that is highly expressed on most hepatocellular carcinomas but not on normal liver or other non-neoplastic tissue. KUR-503 is currently in preclinical development, and we are planning to submit an IND application to the FDA in 2024.

The cell therapy program also includes TCR-NKT cell therapy products, including ones targeting p53 and KRAS, which are the most commonly altered genes in epithelial cancers. These HLA class I- or class II-restricted cell therapy products are presently undergoing preclinical screening to identify those candidates with the best TCR-NKT cell isolation efficiency, transduction efficiency, and functional activity. We plan to engineer the TCRs into the NKT cell therapy platform to develop an allogeneic “off-the-shelf” approach for solid tumor treatment.
Cell Therapy Collaboration and License Agreements
 Baylor College of Medicine
 In October 2021, we simultaneously entered into the Second Amended and Restated Exclusive License and Option Agreement (the “Baylor License Agreement”) and the Second Amended and Restated Co-Development Agreement (the “Baylor Co-Development Agreement,” and together with the Baylor License Agreement, the “Baylor Agreements”) with BCM, which were first entered into in 2016 between BCM and Kuur. Under the Baylor Co-Development Agreement, BCM is responsible for developing the cell therapy products using an annual budget paid by us and under the supervision of a joint steering committee composed of five BCM appointees and five of our appointees. The Baylor License Agreement grants us, among other rights, worldwide rights to research, sell, and commercialize NKT, NKT-CAR, and NKT process technology in the prevention, treatment, or modulation of cancer in humans as well as exclusive future oncology and non-oncology and field expansion options. The Baylor Agreements include execution fees, annual fees, royalties, and milestones. Under the Baylor License Agreement, we have agreed to pay BCM up to $128.5 million in the event defined development and sales milestones are achieved, along with tiered royalties at single digit rates based on annual net sales of licensed products and tiered percentages of sublicensing revenue ranging from mid-single digits to royalty rates in the mid-teens. The Baylor Agreements will remain in effect on a country-by-country basis until the expiration of (i) the date of expiration of the last such patent rights issued in such country; or (ii) in the event that no patents issue in such country, the day immediately following the tenth anniversary of the first commercial sale in such country. The agreements contain customary termination rights such as for material default or failure, insolvency, or convenience on a product-by-product basis.
National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health
 In November 2021, we licensed a portfolio of TCRs that recognize “hotspot” mutations in p53, KRAS, and EGFR genes and methods of isolating T-cells that are reactive to p53-, KRAS-, and EGFR-specific mutated antigens from the National Cancer Institute (“NCI”), an institute of the National Institutes of Health (“NIH”). Under the terms of the agreement, we are granted worldwide rights to the development, manufacturing, and commercialization of allogeneic NKT cell therapy products engineered via viral and non-viral means, and autologous T cell therapy products engineered via retrovirus and lentivirus-mediated gene transfer, to express certain TCRs discovered in the laboratory of Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., Chief of the Surgery Branch at the NCI. The licensed TCRs recognize unique antigens derived from “hotspot” mutations in p53, KRAS, and EGFR genes shared among multiple patients and tumor types.
Orascovery Platform
 Our Orascovery platform is based on the novel P-gp pump inhibitor molecule, encequidar. Oral administration of encequidar in combination with established chemotherapy agents such as paclitaxel has been shown to improve the absorption of these agents by blocking the P-gp pump in the intestinal wall.
Oral Paclitaxel is our lead asset in our Orascovery platform. Intravenous ("IV") paclitaxel is used widely for the treatment of breast, ovarian, and lung cancers. Due to its poor solubility, paclitaxel is usually dissolved in ethanol and polyethoxylated castor oil, which is a major cause of IV hypersensitivity reactions. As a result, premedication with high dose steroids and antihistamines is required to minimize these adverse reactions. Additional common toxicities associated with IV administration of paclitaxel include neuropathy, neutropenia, and alopecia. These side effects limit dose intensification and often require reduction in dosing.
 As part of our strategic pivot to a cell therapy company, we are limiting the resources we devote to the development of the Orascovery platform and focusing only on ongoing studies of Oral Paclitaxel. For Oral Paclitaxel, we are continuing to (i) support a study being conducted in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor (dostarlimab) +/- carboplatin in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy setting for breast cancer and (ii) evaluate Oral Paclitaxel in combination with pembrolizumab for the treatment of NSCLC. The following table summarizes the development status of ongoing studies of Oral Paclitaxel as of March 20, 2023:
 
Oral Paclitaxel in Breast Cancer


I-SPY 2 TRIAL in the Neoadjuvant Treatment of Breast Cancer
 Oral Paclitaxel is being evaluated in combination with dostarlimab (a checkpoint inhibitor) +/- carboplatin in the neoadjuvant treatment of breast cancer, as part of the I-SPY 2 TRIAL (Investigation of Serial studies to Predict Your Therapeutic Response with Imaging And moLecular analysis 2). On December 20, 2022, we announced that collaborators at the Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative (“QLHC”) reported that Oral Paclitaxel in combination with a PD-1 inhibitor and carboplatin graduated in the triple-negative subgroup of high-risk early-stage breast cancer. Oral Paclitaxel, relative to IV paclitaxel, was associated with less neuropathy and was not associated with an increase in febrile neutropenia. The study has been completed and QLHC anticipates presenting these results at upcoming national meetings in the second quarter of 2023. We plan to discuss the I-SPY 2 TRIAL data with the FDA with respect to our metastatic breast cancer New Drug Application (“NDA”).
The I-SPY 2 TRIAL was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Oral Paclitaxel with dostarlimab +/- carboplatin in stage 2/3 HER2- breast cancer patients and plus trastuzumab in HER2+ patients, followed, if needed, by doxorubicin plus cyclophasamide chemotherapy and surgical resection of breast tissue. The trial was designed to rapidly screen promising experimental treatments and identify those most effective in specific patient subgroups based on molecular characteristics (biomarker signatures). The trial is a unique collaborative effort by a consortium that includes the FDA, industry, patient advocates, philanthropic sponsors, and clinicians from 16 major U.S. cancer research centers. Under the terms of the collaboration agreement, QLHC is the trial sponsor and manages all study operations, and Athenex provides Oral Paclitaxel.
KX-ORAX-001 Trial in Metastatic Breast Cancer
 The Phase 3 study of Oral Paclitaxel in metastatic breast cancer (“mBC”) (KX-ORAX-001) was a randomized, active-controlled clinical trial comparing Oral Paclitaxel monotherapy against IV paclitaxel monotherapy. The trial randomized subjects in a 2:1 ratio to Oral Paclitaxel, and was designed to compare the safety and efficacy of Oral Paclitaxel with IV paclitaxel. The primary endpoint was ORR (confirmed by scans at two consecutive timepoints) as assessed by RECIST v1.1 criteria, a generally accepted method for assessing tumor response. Blinded assessments of tumor response were made by independent radiologists. A total of 402 metastatic breast cancer patients were enrolled (Oral Paclitaxel=265 vs. IV paclitaxel=137), which represented the intent-to-treat (“ITT”) population.
In the final analysis of the primary endpoint of the study, Oral Paclitaxel (205 mg/m2 per day 3 days/week) showed a statistically significant improvement in ORR. Based on ITT analysis, Oral Paclitaxel showed a statistically significant improvement in ORR over IV paclitaxel, with 35.8% ORR, compared to 23.4% for IV paclitaxel, a difference of 12.4% (p=0.011).
 Secondary endpoints in the study included progression free survival (“PFS”) and overall survival (“OS”). In December 2020, we presented updated PFS and OS data from this clinical trial at the 2020 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium (“SABCS”). In the ITT population, the median PFS showed a benefit for Oral Paclitaxel versus IV paclitaxel (8.4 months vs. 7.4 months, respectively; hazard ratio (“HR”) = 0.768; 95% confidence interval (“CI”): 0.584, 1.01; p = 0.046). The median OS data demonstrated a trend favoring Oral Paclitaxel versus IV paclitaxel (22.7 months vs. 16.5 months, respectively; HR = 0.794; 95% CI: 0.607, 1.037; p = 0.082).
Based on data presented at the 2019 SABCS, 31.1% of IV paclitaxel patients experienced Grade ≥ 2 neuropathy versus 7.6% of Oral Paclitaxel patients. The results also showed lower incidence of alopecia compared to IV paclitaxel, with 28.8% of the Oral Paclitaxel group experiencing alopecia versus 48.2% of the IV paclitaxel group in treatment-emergent adverse events of interest. For other treatment-emergent adverse events of interest, there was a higher incidence of neutropenia with Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events ("CTCAE") Grade ≥ 3 (29.9% vs. 28.1%; with Grade 4 14.8% vs 8.9%) and gastro-intestinal side effects, such as diarrhea with CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 (5.3% vs. 1.5%) and vomiting or nausea with CTCAE Grade ≥ 3 (6.8% vs. 0.7%), in the Oral Paclitaxel group as compared to the IV paclitaxel group.
 Based on data presented at the 2020 SABCS: all grades of neuropathy were observed in 22% of Oral Paclitaxel patients versus 64% of IV paclitaxel patients, and Grade 3 neuropathy was observed in 2% of Oral Paclitaxel patients versus 15% of IV paclitaxel patients. Also presented were data on the effect of prophylactic treatments on the incidence and severity of gastrointestinal ("GI")-related adverse events. After approximately 30% of patients were enrolled, the Phase 3 trial protocol was amended to allow patients randomized to the Oral Paclitaxel arm to receive prophylactic pre-medications for GI side effects. Overall GI-related adverse events ("AE") were less frequent in the IV paclitaxel arm. GI-related adverse events improved in the Oral Paclitaxel arm following the amendment, as measured by lower incidences of Grade 2 vomiting before and after amendment (24% vs. 7%) and Grade 2 diarrhea before and after protocol amendment (27% vs. 16%).
 In December 2021, we presented a subgroup analysis from the Phase 3 study of Oral Paclitaxel in mBC patients, at the 2021 SABCS. Analysis of safety data demonstrated that patients with elevated liver function tests were at increased risk of neutropenia related toxicities. Post hoc analysis of this subgroup of patients with hepatic impairment was conducted and showed a median survival rate of 18.9 months in patients treated with Oral Paclitaxel vs 10.1 months in those treated with IV Paclitaxel, with an HR of 0.59.
Regulatory Status of Oral Paclitaxel in Metastatic Breast Cancer
 In the United States, we plan to discuss the I-SPY 2 TRIAL data with the FDA with respect to our NDA for Oral Paclitaxel for the treatment of mBC. We received a CRL from the FDA in February 2021 regarding our NDA for Oral Paclitaxel. We then held two Type A meetings with the FDA to discuss the deficiencies raised in the CRL, review a proposed design for a new clinical trial intended to address the deficiencies raised in the CRL, and discuss the potential regulatory path forward for Oral Paclitaxel in mBC in

the U.S. We believe the data from the I-SPY 2 TRIAL may address some of the deficiencies raised by the FDA in the CRL, but no assurance can be given that we will be successful in pursuing this path forward with the NDA.
 In the United Kingdom, we are pursuing approval of the Marketing Authorization Application for Oral Paclitaxel by the U.K. Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (“MHRA”) based on the Phase 3 study of Oral Paclitaxel in mBC (KX-ORAX-001) described above. On January 3, 2023, we announced that the Oral Paclitaxel formulation did not receive regulatory approval from the MHRA for mBC based on CMC issues. The MHRA application was not rejected based on any clinical efficacy or safety concerns expressed by the MHRA. MHRA regulations allow an applicant to request a re-examination of an opinion by an independent board which the Company plans to pursue. The Company views the identified Chemistry, Manufacturing, and Controls (“CMC") issues as addressable. The MHRA application was supplemented with safety data from the I-SPY 2 TRIAL and no major clinical efficacy or safety concerns were expressed.
 Oral Paclitaxel in Lung Cancer
 We are collaborating with Merck (known as MSD outside the U.S. and Canada) on the expansion phase of a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating Oral Paclitaxel in combination with Merck’s anti-PD-1 therapy KEYTRUDA® (pembrolizumab) for certain NSCLC patients. Recruitment for the expansion phase of this clinical trial is currently ongoing.
Orascovery Technology – Encequidar
 Encequidar is a P-gp pump inhibitor and an oral absorption enhancer that prevents the P-gp pump-mediated efflux of chemotherapy agents back into the GI tract. The P-gp plays an important physiologic role as a transporter protein at multiple barrier sites, including the GI tract and the blood brain barrier. The demonstrated role of P-gp in limiting intestinal absorption of multiple cancer chemotherapies highlighted the potential utility of a small molecule P-gp inhibitor for enabling oral administration of P-gp substrate drugs otherwise restricted to IV dosing. Encequidar was originally identified by Hanmi as a highly selective and potent P-gp inhibitor, capable of elevating the oral bioavailability of paclitaxel from less than 5% (in the absence of encequidar) to 41% in rats. Encequidar is distinct from previously developed small molecule P-gp inhibitors because it is designed to not be systemically absorbed in the GI tract following oral administration with only small amounts detectable in the plasma even after relatively high doses. This unique property makes encequidar a good candidate for co-administration with P-gp substrate drugs, such as paclitaxel, which normally exhibit poor oral bioavailability and are therefore limited to IV routes of dosing.
In three separate pharmacokinetics studies of encequidar conducted in healthy subjects, a total of 81 individuals received single oral doses of encequidar tablets in single doses of up to 900 mg, and 30 individuals were enrolled in multiple dose cohorts with treatment groups receiving encequidar tablets ranging from 60 to 360 mg per day for five days. Encequidar was well-tolerated, with mostly mild GI side effects. No serious adverse events were reported. At the current clinical dose of 15 mg given once daily for up to five days, the maximal concentration of the drug in plasma (Cmax) in systemic circulation is low. Drug-drug interaction studies of encequidar with digoxin and dabigatran have been conducted, and the metabolism and routes of excretion in humans has been determined.
Proprietary Dual (CYP/P-gp) Inhibitor
 We are developing a proprietary class of “dual” absorption enhancers that are intended to inhibit both the P-gp transporter and the cytochrome p450 3A (“CYP”) enzymes within the GI tract. These dual absorption enhancers may lead to better performing next-generation oral medicines in our pipeline of clinical products. The development of these dual absorption enhancers is at the preclinical stage. Proof of concept, providing increased oral bioavailability in preclinical species, has been obtained with several absorption enhancers and candidate drugs. Currently additional filters such as patentability/freedom to operate, physical-chemical characterization, pre-formulation studies, manufacturing analysis and preliminary toxicity testing are being applied to our first group of lead candidates to facilitate election of an IND candidate.
Orascovery License Agreements
 We entered into a series of license agreements with Hanmi Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (“Hanmi”) pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive, sublicensable license for development and commercialization activities utilizing Hanmi’s patents and know-how related to the Orascovery platform worldwide except in South Korea, and a non-exclusive license to utilize the same intellectual property in manufacturing worldwide for sales inside those territories (the “Hanmi Agreements”). Under the Hanmi Agreements, we are responsible for all clinical studies and development and commercialization activities, and the related expenses, resulting from the agreements.
Under the Hanmi Agreements, we are obligated to pay Hanmi tiered royalty payments in the teens based on aggregate net sales of any products using the licensed intellectual property in the territory. These royalties will be reduced if competing generic products gain market share in the applicable country. We also granted to Hanmi a one-time right of first negotiation to purchase all of our rights in Oral Paclitaxel under the Hanmi Agreements during development and prior that, at Hanmi’s discretion, requires us to negotiate in good faith the sale of our rights under such agreement to Hanmi at a purchase price determined by an internationally-recognized investment banking firm with an office in Hong Kong at any time prior to the earlier of (1) our first commercial sale of products using such technology or (2) receipt by Hanmi of written notice from our company of the sublicense of the rights in an applicable product to a third party.


The Hanmi Agreements expire on the earlier of (1) expiration of the last of Hanmi’s patent rights licensed under the agreement or (2) invalidation of Hanmi’s patent rights which are the subject of the agreement, provided that the term will automatically be extended for consecutive one-year periods unless either party gives notice to the other at least 90 days prior to expiration of the patent rights licensed under the agreement or before the then-current annual expiration date of the agreement. The patent rights licensed to us under the Hanmi Agreements have expiry dates ranging from in 2023 to 2033, unless the terms of such licensed patents are extended in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.
 We have out-licensed certain of the rights we obtained under the Hanmi Agreements to third parties to develop and commercialize products from the Orascovery platform in certain territories. Under these out-licenses, we are entitled to receive payments and royalties from the licensees (a portion of which we will be obligated to pay Hanmi under the Hanmi Agreements).
Recent Strategic Actions and Transactions
In 2022, we made significant progress on our strategy to monetize non-core assets as we pivoted to focusing on our cell therapy platform.
 Monetization of Klisyri (tirbanibulin)
 During 2022, we received an aggregate of $87.6 million by (i) monetizing certain of our rights to Klisyri® (tirbanibulin), an ointment approved in the United States, European Union and the United Kingdom for the treatment of actinic keratosis (“AK”) that we developed and out-licensed, through the revenue interest financing described below; and (ii) receiving upfront fees and milestone payments through the other license agreements we hold relating to tirbanibulin. Tirbanibulin, formerly known as KX2-391 or KX-01, is a novel small molecule that we discovered and developed, which demonstrates at least two mechanisms of action relevant to the potential control of cancer and hyper-proliferative disorders. Tirbanibulin is a compound that, as a free base, has advantageous physical properties for topical ointment formulations. We may pursue additional strategic licensing and partnership opportunities with tirbanibulin that will create potential value for stockholders.
Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement
 On June 21, 2022, the Company and ATNX SPV, LLC (the “SPV”), a subsidiary of the Company, entered into a revenue interest purchase agreement (“RIPA”) with the affiliates of Sagard Healthcare Partners (“Sagard”) and funds managed by Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (“Oaktree” and together with Sagard, the “Purchasers”) for the sale of revenues from U.S. and European royalty and milestone interests in Klisyri® (tirbanibulin) for an aggregate purchase price of $85.0 million (the “Purchase Price”). Of the total Purchase Price, $5.0 million was placed into escrow to be paid to the Company upon the satisfaction of certain manufacture and supply milestones for Klisyri prior to December 31, 2025, $5.0 million was used to pay for transaction expenses, $52.5 million was used to pay down the Company’s Senior Credit Agreement with Oaktree, and $7.5 million in Segregated Funds was deposited and held in a segregated account of the Company (the “Segregated Funds”). The Purchasers released the $7.5 million of Segregated Funds to the Company in August 2022, and $1.5 million of the amount placed in escrow was released to the Company upon completion of an escrow release trigger milestone in September 2022. The net proceeds after deducting transaction expenses and debt repayments were available for the Company’s operations.
 In connection with this transaction, the Company formed the SPV and contributed its interest in the license agreement with Almirall S.A. (“Almirall”) relating to Klisyri and certain related assets (the “Almirall License Agreement”) to the SPV. Oaktree and Sagard each own a 10% equity interest in the SPV. Pursuant to the RIPA, the SPV sold its right to the cash received in respect of certain royalties and certain milestone interests under the Almirall License Agreement to the Purchasers. The SPV retained the right to receive 50% of certain of the milestone interests under the Almirall License Agreement, equal to $155.0 million in the aggregate if those milestones are achieved, and 50% of the royalties paid under the Almirall License Agreement for sales of Klisyri once net sales of Klisyri exceed a certain dollar amount.
 License Agreements Related to Tirbanibulin
 We have entered into license agreements under which we licensed certain of our intellectual property related to tirbanibulin for a variety of indications in territories including the United States, European Union, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, and China. In exchange, we are entitled to upfront fees, milestone payments and/or royalties, depending on the agreement. The most significant of these agreements are described below.
 •United States and European countries: In December 2017, we entered into the Almirall License Agreement pursuant to which we granted to Almirall an exclusive, sublicensable license of certain of our intellectual property for the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical preparations containing tirbanibulin to treat and prevent skin disorders and diseases in humans in the U.S. and substantially all European countries (including Russia and Turkey). The first label indication is actinic keratosis (“AK”). In the licensed territory, Almirall also holds a right of first negotiation to license any compound that we may develop in the future with the same mechanism of action as tirbanibulin and for topical administration for the treatment of skin disorders and diseases if we decide to collaborate with a third party regarding that newly developed compound. Under the RIPA, we sold some of our rights to royalty and milestone payments under the Almirall License Agreement to the Purchasers. See “– Revenue Interest Purchase Agreement” above. Almirall may 


terminate the agreement in its entirety or with regard to a certain territory in its sole discretion by providing six months’ notice to us. The agreement also contains customary termination rights for both parties, such as in the event of a breach of the agreement or if the other party defaults in performance of its obligations under the agreement.
 •Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea: We granted PharmaEssentia Corp. (“PharmaEssentia”) an exclusive, sublicensable license to use any pharmaceutical preparation containing tirbanibulin for use in treating (i) AK in a territory that includes Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea, (ii) psoriasis and other nonmalignant skin conditions in a territory that includes Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, China, Hong Kong, Macau, Singapore, and Malaysia, and (iii) all other dermatology indications, including skin cancer, in a territory that includes Taiwan, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Malaysia. We may be entitled to an additional aggregate amount of up to $13.0 million in associated with the achievement of certain development and sales milestones. We will also be eligible to receive tiered royalties ranging from the high single-digits to low double digits on net sales of each product commercialized by PharmaEssentia, which may be reduced accordingly upon the entrance of competing generic products. Prior to the expiration of the term of each agreement, PharmaEssentia may terminate the agreement in its sole discretion, by providing six months’ notice to us. Subject to certain conditions, we may also terminate the agreement if PharmaEssentia fails to comply with certain development timelines set out in each of the agreements. The agreements also contain customary termination rights for either party, such as in the event of a breach of the agreement or the initiation of bankruptcy proceedings by the other party. 
 •China: We granted Guangzhou Xiangxue Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Xiangxue”) an exclusive license to develop and commercialize ointment preparations of tirbanibulin ointment in China for certain indications, including AK. We may be eligible to receive $40.0 million if the defined regulatory milestones are achieved, sales milestones up to $30.0 million when certain sales targets of tirbanibulin ointment among other products are met, and tiered royalties at rates starting from the low teens. The license may be terminated in its entirety upon the mutual agreement of the parties, by Xiangxue for convenience upon requisite notice, or by either party for material breach as set forth in the license. The license also will be terminated with respect to any licensed product for Xiangxue’s failure to meet agreed upon regulatory milestones with respect to such licensed product.
 Sale of Rights to Dunkirk Facility
 During 2022, we received $40.0 million upon the sale of our interest in the manufacturing facility in Dunkirk, New York (the “Dunkirk Facility”) to ImmunityBio, Inc. (“ImmunityBio”). The Dunkirk Facility had been constructed in connection with our agreement with Fort Schuyler Management Corporation (“FSMC”), a not-for-profit corporation affiliated with the State of New York, for a medical technology research, development, innovation and commercialization alliance (the “Alliance Agreement”). Under the Alliance Agreement, FSMC had been responsible for the costs of construction and equipment for the facility up to an aggregate of $200.0 million, plus any additional funds available from the previous $25.0 million grant, and FSMC would retain ownership of the facility and equipment.
In a series of agreements with ImmunityBio, we sold our leasehold interest, our interest in certain leased manufacturing equipment and personal property and owned personal property and inventory at the Dunkirk Facility, and our rights in and obligations under our agreements relating to the Dunkirk Facility with the Empire State Development Corporation, FSMC and County of Chautauqua Industrial Development Agency and other parties. We did not assign any of our rights to our corporate headquarters in Buffalo, New York, in connection with the sale of the leasehold interest in the Dunkirk Facility and we retained all of our rights and obligations with respect to our corporate headquarters. We are sub-leasing the space from FSMC for a 10-year term expiring in October 2025, with an option to extend the term for an additional 10 years.
Sale of Interest in API Business
 During 2022, we received an aggregate of approximately $11 million from the sale of our interests in our active pharmaceutical ingredient (“API”) manufacturing business in China, and expect to receive an additional $5.6 million in the first half of 2023. We completed the sale of our equity interests in our China subsidiaries, including Chongqing Taihao Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (“Taihao”) and Athenex Pharmaceuticals (Chongqing) Limited (together, the “Chongqing Companies”) to Chongqing Comfort Pharmaceutical Inc. as assignee of TiHe Capital (Beijing) Co. Ltd. (the “API Buyer”) in November 2022. The Chongqing Companies had operated a current Good Manufacturing Practices ("cGMP") high potency oncology API plant based in Chongqing, China, and completed construction of a new facility in Chongqing. The aggregate purchase price of this sale was RMB129.4 million, or approximately $18 million. At closing, we received 70% of the sale proceeds in cash (net of PRC withholding tax and stamp duty). We expect to receive the remainder of the proceeds in the first half of 2023. At closing, we entered into a supply agreement (“Supply Agreement”) with affiliates of the API Buyer (the “Supplier”). Under the Supply Agreement, we and the Supplier agreed to pricing and other supply terms for certain API (“API Products”), including those used in Klisyri® (tirbanibulin) and oral paclitaxel, to be manufactured at certain manufacturing sites by the Supplier. The Supplier also agreed to fill purchase orders from the Company before orders from other parties, if it was unable to fulfill orders for API Products. The Company also agreed to place orders for API Products, other than tirbanibulin, with the Supplier before placing orders with any other party. The pricing terms of the Supply Agreement will remain in effect for at least five years, and then may be adjusted on an annual basis upon agreement of the parties. The Supply Agreement will expire on the later of 10 years from the effective date or the expiration of the last of the Company’s license agreements for the API

Products. If the Supply Agreement is terminated prior to the end of this period, we have the right to request that the Supplier enter into a new supply agreement with us on substantially the same terms.
 Exit from 503B Sterile Compounding Business of Athenex Pharma Solutions
 In the fourth quarter of 2022 and during the first quarter of 2023, we received an aggregate of $0.1 million by exiting the 503B sterile compounding business of Athenex Pharma Solutions (“APS”). APS manufactured products under Section 503B of the Compounding Quality Act ("Section 503B") within the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act ("FDCA") and supplied sterile injectable drugs to hospital pharmacies across the U.S.
Other Business
 Athenex Pharmaceutical Division
 Our Athenex Pharmaceutical Division ("APD") business develops and sources products through licensing agreements with various partners, whom we collectively refer to as our Global Partner network. Our team has unique commercial expertise in multisource injectable products and has developed a number of Global Partners that develop and manufacture multisource products for the U.S. market. We primarily market products to acute hospital group purchasing organizations, which supply to integrated healthcare networks, clinics, and directly to physicians. As of December 31, 2022, APD markets 39 products with 74 SKUs.
We distribute APD products primarily through pharmaceutical wholesalers and, to a lesser extent, specialty distributors that focus on particular therapeutic product categories, for use by a wide variety of end-users, including hospitals, integrated delivery networks and alternative site facilities. For the year ended December 31, 2022, the products we sold through our 3 largest wholesalers in the U.S. accounted for 63% of our total revenue.
 We utilize an outside third-party logistics contractor, Eversana Life Science Services, LLC, to distribute our U.S. products. Since the inception of the launch of our specialty products, the third-party logistics provider has been handling all aspects of our product logistics efforts and related services for us, including warehousing and shipment services, order-to-cash services, contract administration services and chargeback processing. Our products are warehoused and distributed through a third-party logistics provider located in Memphis, Tennessee. Under our agreement with the third-party logistics provider, we maintain ownership of our finished products until sale to our customers. The initial term of the agreement is three years following the initial delivery date and will automatically renew for successive 12-month periods, unless either we or the other party give notice of intent to terminate at least 90 days in advance of such automatic renewal. We may also have the opportunity to terminate the agreement within 30 days of receiving notice of certain price increases by the third-party logistics provider. The agreement also contains customary termination rights for either party, such as in the event of a breach of the agreement.
We have also created a product portal, which allows APD customers to order from us online, and us to distribute directly from Eversana or our Clarence facility. This portal was created primarily due to prohibitions on wholesaling under Section 503B of the FDCA.
 When necessary, APD purchases or licenses the rights to sell these generic products from the product’s patent holder. The following are examples of the licenses held by APD:
 Gland Term Sheets
 From August 2016 to May 2017, we entered into four binding term sheets with Gland Pharma Ltd (“Gland”) to market twenty-seven of Gland’s products. Gland has obtained FDA approval for twenty-two of such products and has filed an abbreviated new drug application (“ANDA”) in the U.S. for the remaining five products. For each of the licensed products, we will pay a license fee to Gland. Additionally, during the terms of the term sheets we have a profit-sharing arrangement pursuant to which we will pay to Gland between 0% and 60% of the net profits from sales of each of the licensed products, depending on the product. The initial term of each of the Gland term sheets is five years from the launch of each product licensed pursuant to the term sheet, subject to automatic renewal for additional two-year terms, unless terminated by either party upon at least 90 days’ notice in advance of a renewal date. To date, none of the term sheets have been terminated.
 MAIA Agreement
 In December 2018, we entered into a distribution and supply agreement with MAIA Pharmaceuticals (“MAIA”) effective as of October 3, 2018 whereby we acquired the exclusive license to a generic version of an approved product, which we began selling in January 2019. In connection with the execution of this agreement, we agreed to pay an upfront milestone payment in addition to profit sharing of 50% of the net profits from the sales of the licensed product. We also agreed to pay an additional milestone payment to MAIA in the event the FDA approves the ANDA for the licensed product. The initial term of the agreement is for seven years from the launch of the product and is subject to an automatic two-year renewal term unless terminated by either party upon at least 180 days’ notice in advance of the renewal date.


In December 2019, the agreement with MAIA was amended to grant us the license to a branded product which MAIA holds the approved NDA. In connection with this amendment, we agreed to an upfront milestone payment and 56% of the net profits from sales of the licensed product.
Ingenus Agreements
 In September 2020, we entered into an asset purchase and sale agreement with Ingenus Pharmaceuticals, LLC (“Ingenus”) whereby we purchased from Ingenus all of their right, title and interest in and to Glycopyrrolate Injection (“Glycopyrrolate”) in the U.S. and pursuant to which Ingenus transferred to us the ANDA for Glycopyrrolate.
  In November 2020, we entered into a co-marketing, manufacturing and supply agreement with Ingenus pursuant to which Ingenus will be our exclusive supplier of the Cyclophosphamide Injection and granted us a license to market and sell the product to acute care group purchasing organizations (“GPOs”) and their entire memberships as provided by the GPOs, integrated delivery networks (“IDNs”) and to hospitals within the U.S. Under the agreement, we are entitled to 25% of the net profits from our sales of the product and we are entitled to a marketing allowance. The agreement has a 3-year term, which may be extended if we mutually agree.
 In January 2021, we entered into a manufacture and supply agreement with Ingenus for Arsenic Trioxide Injection pursuant to which Ingenus will be our exclusive supplier of the product and granted us a license to market and sell the product to acute care GPOs and their entire memberships as provided by the GPOs, IDNs and to hospitals within the U.S. Under the agreement, we are entitled to 45% of the net profits from our sales of the product and we are entitled to a marketing allowance. The agreement has a 5-year term, which may be extended if we mutually agree. We have subsequently expanded the products that we market for Ingenus under substantially similar terms and APD now markets 4 products for Ingenus.
 Maiva Agreements
 In March 2023, we entered into a supply agreement with Maiva Pharma Private Limited (“Maiva”) for the manufacture of Athenex-owned ANDA products and supply of certain of Maiva’s co-developed products. For certain of the products, we have a profit-sharing arrangement pursuant to which we will pay to Maiva between 20% and 50% of the amount by which the sales price of certain products exceeds established targets. Under this agreement, we are responsible for coordinating the FDA review of ANDAs for a majority of the products and Maiva is responsible for manufacturing, packaging, testing, and quality assurance of the products. The agreement has a seven-year term and will automatically renew for additional two-year periods unless earlier terminated by us or Maiva.
Research and Development
 We have research, product formulation, clinical development and regulatory affairs capabilities primarily in the U.S. Our research and development facilities are largely concentrated in Buffalo, New York. The range of capabilities at these facilities includes medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, cell biology, formulation, chemical manufacturing and control, quality control, pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamics (“PK/PD”) and data management, as well as pharmacovigilance, clinical development and regulatory affairs expertise functions. Animal efficacy, PK/PD and toxicology studies are carried out at various contract research organizations, or CROs, in order to facilitate the drug research and development process. We and our partners are currently conducting clinical trials at sites in the U.S., and we may add additional clinical trial study sites outside of the U.S. in the future.
Competition
The biopharmaceutical industry and the oncology subsector are characterized by rapid evolution of technologies, fierce competition, and strong defense of intellectual property. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our product candidates, technology platforms, and scientific expertise in the field of biotechnology and oncology provide us with competitive advantages, a wide variety of institutions, including large biopharmaceutical companies, specialty biotechnology companies, academic research departments and public and private research institutions, are actively developing potentially competitive products and technologies. We face substantial competition from biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies developing oncology products. In cell therapy, we face competition from these companies and/or their products: Adicet Bio, Allogene Therapeutics, Appia Bio, Arovella Therapeutics, Atara Bio, Autolus, BrightPath Biotherapeutics, Caribou Biosciences, Cellectis, Celyad, Century Therapeutics, Crispr Therapeutics, Cytovia Therapeutics, Editas Medicine, Fate Therapeutics, GammaDelta Therapeutics, Immatics, In8bio, Kiromic, Lava Therapeutics, MiNK Therapeutics, Nkarta, ONK Therapeutics, Precision Biosciences, Poseida Therapeutics, Senti Bio, Takeda, and TC Biopharm. In the oral administration of oncology products, we and our products compete with Taxol, Abraxane, Cynviloq, Camptosar, Onivyde, Taxotere, and Hycamtin.
 Many of the companies, either alone or with strategic partners, against which we are competing or against which we may compete in the future have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources, and clinical, regulatory, commercialization

and manufacturing capabilities than we do. Accordingly, our competitors may be more successful than us in obtaining approval for treatments and achieving widespread market acceptance, rendering our treatments obsolete or non-competitive. Accelerated merger and acquisition activity in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. These companies also compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical study sites and patient registration for clinical studies, acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. Our commercial opportunity could be substantially limited in the event that our competitors develop and commercialize products that are more effective, safer, less toxic, more convenient or less expensive than our comparable products. In geographies that are critical to our commercial success, competitors may also obtain regulatory approvals before us, resulting in our competitors building a strong market position in advance of our products’ entry. We believe the factors determining the success of our programs will be the efficacy, safety and convenience of our product candidates.
Intellectual Property
We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technologies, inventions, products and product candidates, methods of manufacture, methods of using our products and product candidates, and improvements thereof that are commercially important to our business. We protect our proprietary intellectual property position by, among others, filing patent applications in the U.S. and in jurisdictions outside of the U.S. covering our proprietary technologies, inventions, products and product candidates, methods, and improvements that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trade secrets, know-how, continuing innovation, and licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary intellectual property position.
Granted patents and pending patent applications related to our platforms and product candidates cover such aspects as composition-of-matter claims to our lead product candidates and their analogs, claims to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such candidates, and claims to methods of making and method of treatment using such candidates. As of January 20, 2023, we owned approximately 200 granted patents and over 70 pending patent applications, including five allowed patent applications worldwide, that relate to the platform technology from which tirbanibulin was developed. Not accounting for any patent term adjustment, patent term extension or terminal disclaimer, and, assuming that all annuity and/or maintenance fees are paid, the patents and, if granted, patent applications, will expire from 2025 to 2040.
In addition, we have in-licensed various patent, pending patent applications, and technologies. Pursuant to our collaboration with the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at BCM, which began in October 2021, we maintain a robust portfolio related to our CAR-NKT cell therapy. We also licensed a portfolio of TCRs that recognize “hotspot” mutations in p53, KRAS, and EGFR genes and methods of isolating T-cells that are reactive to p53 and KRAS specific mutated antigens from the NCI. We continue to maintain licenses for patents related to TCR T-cell therapy and the Orascovery platform, and their use as anti-cancer and anti-viral therapies.
The term of individual patents depends upon the laws of the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest date of filing of a non-provisional patent application. In the U.S., the term of a patent may be lengthened by patent term adjustment to compensate the patentee for administrative delays by the U.S. Patent and Trade Office ("USPTO") in examining and granting the patent or may be shortened if the patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. In addition, a patent term may be extended to restore a portion of the term effectively lost as a result of FDA regulatory review. However, the restoration period cannot be longer than five years and cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of fourteen years from the date of FDA approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar extensions as compensation for regulatory delays are available in Europe and other jurisdictions. We have sought patent term extensions in the U.S. and Supplementary Protection Certificates in Europe and intend to seek similar regulatory extensions in other jurisdictions when available. However, there is no guarantee that the applicable authorities will agree with our assessment of whether such extensions should be granted, and we cannot predict the length of the extensions even if they are granted. The actual protection afforded by a patent varies on a claim-by-claim basis, from country-to-country, and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory-related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patent. For a granted patent to remain in force most countries require the payment of annuities or maintenance fees, either yearly or at certain intervals during the term of a patent. If an annuity or maintenance fee is not paid, the patent may lapse irrevocably.
Government Regulation and Product Approval
Governmental authorities in the U.S., at the federal, state and local level, and in other countries extensively regulate, among other things, the research, development, testing, manufacture, approval, quality control, labeling, packaging, promotion, storage, advertising, distribution, post-approval monitoring, marketing and export and import of products such as those we are developing. In order to be lawfully marketed in the U.S., our therapeutic product candidates must comply with either Section 503B (outsourcing facility) or Section 505 (new drug approval) or Section 351 of the Public Health Service Act of 1944, as amended (“PHSA”) (new biological product approval) of the FDCA as applicable. They will be subject to similar premarket requirements in other countries. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and ensuring compliance with applicable federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources.
U.S. Government Regulation
In the U.S., the FDA regulates drugs and biologics under the FDCA and its implementing regulations, with the exception that biologics are approved for marketing under provisions of the PHSA, via a Biologics License Application (“BLA”). Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development or approval process, or after approval, may subject an applicant to administrative or judicial sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on us. These sanctions could include:
•refusal to approve pending applications; 
 •withdrawal of an approval; 
 •imposition of a clinical hold; 
 •warning or untitled letters; 
 •seizures or administrative detention of product; 
 •total or partial suspension of production or distribution; or 
 •injunctions, fines, restitution, disgorgement, refusal of government contracts, or civil or criminal penalties. 
 NDA and BLA approval processes
The process required by the FDA before a therapeutic drug product may be marketed in the U.S. generally involves the following:
•completion of extensive nonclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies conducted in accordance with GLPs and other applicable regulations; 
 •submission to the FDA of an IND application, which must be authorized before human clinical trials may begin; 
 •performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with federal regulations and Good Clinical Practices, or GCPs, an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators, and monitors, to establish the safety and efficacy of the product candidate for its intended use; 
 •submission to the FDA of an NDA or BLA; 
 •satisfactory completion of an FDA pre-approval inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product candidate is produced to assess readiness for commercial manufacturing and conformance to the manufacturing-related elements of the application, to conduct a data integrity audit, and to assess compliance with cGMP to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to assure the product candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity; 
 •potential FDA audit of the clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the NDA or BLA; and
 •FDA review and approval of the NDA or BLA. 
 Once a therapeutic candidate is identified for development, it enters the preclinical or nonclinical testing stage. Nonclinical tests include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies. Such studies must generally be conducted in accordance with the FDA’s GLPs. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the nonclinical tests, together with manufacturing information and analytical data, to the FDA as part of the IND application. Some nonclinical testing may continue even after the IND application is submitted. In addition to including the results of the nonclinical studies, the IND application will also include a protocol detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated if the first phase lends itself to an efficacy determination. The IND application automatically becomes effective thirty days after receipt by the FDA, unless the FDA, within the 30-day time period, places the IND on clinical

hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before clinical trials can begin. A clinical hold may occur at any time during the life of an IND and may affect one or more specific studies or all studies conducted under the IND application. If the FDA imposes a clinical hold, clinical trials cannot commence or recommence without FDA authorization and then only under terms authorized by the FDA.
 The manufacture of investigational drugs and biologics for the conduct of human clinical trials is subject to cGMP requirements. Investigational drugs and API imported into the U.S. are also subject to regulation by the FDA relating to their labeling and distribution. Further, the export of investigational products outside of the U.S. may be subject to regulatory requirements of the receiving country as well as U.S. export requirements under the FDCA.
All clinical trials must be conducted under the supervision of one or more qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include, among other things, the requirements that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Investigators must also provide certain information to the clinical trial sponsors to allow the sponsors to make certain financial disclosures to the FDA. Clinical trials must be conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, dosing procedures, research subject selection and exclusion criteria and the safety and effectiveness endpoints to be evaluated. Each protocol, and any subsequent material amendment to the protocol, must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND application, and progress reports detailing the status of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA annually. Sponsors also must report to the FDA serious and unexpected adverse reactions in a timely manner. Reporting requirements also apply to, among other things, any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator’s brochure and any findings from other studies or animal or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk in humans exposed to the product candidate. An institutional review board, or IRB, with jurisdiction at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the protocol before a clinical trial commences at that institution and must also approve the information regarding the trial and the consent form that must be provided to each research subject or the subject’s legal representative, monitor the study until completed and otherwise comply with IRB regulations.
Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap or be combined.
•Phase 1—The product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution and elimination. In the case of some therapeutic candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, such as cancer, especially when the product candidate may be inherently too toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients. 
 •Phase 2—Clinical trials are performed on a limited patient population intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage. 
 •Phase 3—Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical study sites. These studies are intended to establish the overall risk-benefit ratio of the product and provide an adequate basis for product labeling. 
 A pivotal study is a clinical study that adequately meets regulatory agency requirements for the evaluation of a product candidate’s efficacy and safety such that it can be used to justify the approval of the product. Generally, pivotal studies are also Phase 3 studies but may be Phase 2 studies, with the agreement of FDA, if the trial design provides a reliable assessment of clinical benefit, particularly in situations where there is an unmet medical need.
In the case of a 505(b)(2) NDA, which is a marketing application in which the sponsor may rely on investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted, some of the above-described studies and nonclinical studies may not be required or may be abbreviated. The applicant may rely upon the FDA’s prior findings of safety and efficacy for a previously approved product or on published scientific literature in support of its application. Bridging studies, including clinical studies, may be needed, however, to demonstrate that it is scientifically appropriate to rely on the findings of the studies that were previously conducted by other sponsors to the drug that is the subject of the marketing application.
In addition, the manufacturer of an investigational drug in a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial for a serious or life-threatening disease is required to make available, such as by posting on its website, its policy on evaluating and responding to requests for expanded access to such investigational product candidate.
The outcome of human clinical trials is inherently uncertain, and Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 testing may not be successfully completed or may not be completed at all. The FDA or the sponsor may suspend a clinical trial at any time for a variety of reasons, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients.

During the development of a new product candidate, sponsors are given opportunities to interact with the FDA at certain points; specifically, prior to the submission of an IND, at the end of Phase 2 and before an NDA or BLA application is submitted. Interactions at other times may be requested. These interactions may take the form of meetings, usually by teleconference, or by formal written exchange. These interactions can provide an opportunity for the sponsor to share information about the data gathered to date and for the FDA to provide advice on the next phase of development. Sponsors typically use the interaction at the end of Phase 2 to discuss their Phase 2 clinical results and present their plans for the pivotal Phase 3 clinical trials that they believe will support the approval of the new therapeutic. A sponsor may request a Special Protocol Assessment, or SPA, the purpose of which is to reach agreement with the FDA on the Phase 3 clinical trial protocol design and analysis that will form the primary basis of an efficacy claim. The agreement will be binding on the FDA and may not be changed by the sponsor or the FDA after the trial begins except with the written agreement of the sponsor and the FDA or if the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or efficacy of the product candidate was identified after the testing began.
Post-approval trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, may be required after initial marketing approval. These trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication.
Concurrent with clinical trials, sponsors usually complete additional animal safety studies, develop additional information about the chemistry and physical characteristics of the product candidate and finalize a process for manufacturing commercial quantities of the product candidate in accordance with cGMP requirements. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and the manufacturer must develop methods for testing the quality, purity and potency of the product candidate. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its proposed shelf-life.
The results of product development, nonclinical studies and clinical trials, along with descriptions of the manufacturing process, analytical tests and other control mechanisms, proposed labeling and other relevant information are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA or BLA requesting approval to market the product. An NDA or BLA must also contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the product for the claimed indication in all relevant pediatric populations. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of pediatric data or full or partial waivers. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each NDA or BLA must be accompanied by a significant user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. PDUFA also imposes an annual program fee for each prescription drug, including biologics. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, such as where a waiver is necessary to protect the public health, where the fee would present a significant barrier to innovation or where the applicant is a small business submitting its first human therapeutic application for review. Product candidates that are designated as orphan drugs are also not subject to user fees unless the application contains an indication other than an orphan indication.
Within sixty days following submission of an NDA or BLA, FDA reviews the application to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency files it. The FDA may refuse to file any NDA or BLA that it deems incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the NDA or BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA files it. Once the submission is filed, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the NDA or BLA. The FDA has agreed to certain performance goals in the review of NDAs and BLAs. FDA seeks to review applications for standard review products that are not new molecular entities, or NMEs, within ten months of the date the NDA or BLA is submitted, while FDA seeks to review applications for standard review NMEs within ten months of the date FDA files the NDA or BLA. FDA seeks to review applications for priority review products that are not NMEs within six months of the date the NDA or BLA is submitted, while FDA seeks to review applications for priority review NMEs within six months of the date FDA files the NDA or BLA. The review process for both standard and priority review may be extended by the FDA for three additional months to consider certain late-submitted information, or information intended to clarify information already provided in the submission. The FDA may refer applications for novel drug products or drug products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, typically a panel that includes clinicians and other experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and, if so, under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions.
 During the product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, plan is necessary to assure the safe use of the product. If the FDA concludes that a REMS plan is needed, the sponsor of the NDA or BLA must submit a proposed REMS plan prior to approval. The FDA has authority to require a REMS plan when necessary to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh the risks. In determining whether a REMS plan is necessary, the FDA must consider the size of the population likely to use the drug, the seriousness of the disease or condition to be treated, the expected benefit of the drug, the duration of treatment, the seriousness of known or potential adverse events, and whether the drug is a new molecular entity. A REMS plan may be required to include various elements, such as a medication guide or patient package insert, a communication plan to educate health care providers of the risks, limitations on who may prescribe or dispense the drug or other measures that the FDA

deems necessary to assure the safe use of the drug or biologic. In addition, the REMS plan must include a timetable to assess the strategy at eighteen months, three years and seven years after the strategy’s approval.
The FDA may also require a REMS plan for a product that is already on the market if it determines, based on new safety information, that a REMS plan is necessary to ensure that the product’s benefits outweigh its risks.
Before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will inspect the facilities at which the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are compliant with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA or BLA, the FDA will typically inspect one or more clinical sites to assure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. To assure cGMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, record keeping, production and quality control.
Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that an NDA or BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive, and the FDA may interpret data differently than the applicant. If the agency decides not to approve the NDA or BLA in its then present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that describes all of the specific deficiencies in the NDA identified by the FDA, with no implication regarding the ultimate approvability of the application or the timing of any such approval, if ever. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant must either resubmit the NDA or BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, withdraw the application, or appeal the decision.
Even if a product receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific indications and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing or dispensing in the form of a risk management plan, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post marketing clinical trials, sometimes referred to as “Phase 4” clinical trials, designed to further assess a product's safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized.
Expedited Review and Approval
The FDA has various programs, including Fast Track, priority review, accelerated approval and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for reviewing therapeutic candidates, or provide for the approval of a product candidate on the basis of a surrogate endpoint. Even if a product candidate qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or that the time period for FDA review or approval will be lengthened. Generally, therapeutic candidates that are eligible for these programs are those for serious or life-threatening conditions, those with the potential to address unmet medical needs and those that offer meaningful benefits over existing treatments. For example, Fast Track is a process designed to facilitate the development and expedite the review of therapeutic candidates to treat serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and fill unmet medical needs. Priority review is designed to give therapeutic candidates that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists an initial review within six months of the date that FDA files the NDA or BLA as compared to a standard review time of ten months of the date that FDA files the NDA or BLA.
Although Fast Track and priority review do not affect the standards for approval, the FDA will attempt to facilitate early and frequent communications with a sponsor of a Fast Track designated product candidate and expedite review of the application for a product candidate designated for priority review. Under the Fast Track program, the sponsor of a new drug candidate may request that FDA designate the drug candidate for a specific indication as a fast track product concurrent with, or after, the filing of the IND for the product candidate. FDA must determine if the candidate qualifies for fast track designation within 60 days of receipt of the sponsor’s request. The Fast Track program and FDA’s accelerated approval regulations, which are described in Subpart H of 21 CFR Part 314, provide for an earlier approval for a new product candidate that is (1) intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition; (2) generally provides a meaningful advantage over available therapies and (3) demonstrates an effect on either a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, or IMM, and is reasonably likely to predict an effect on IMM or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. A surrogate endpoint is a laboratory measurement or physical sign used as an indirect or substitute measurement representing a clinically meaningful outcome. As a condition of approval, the FDA will require that a sponsor of a product candidate receiving accelerated approval diligently perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on IMM or other clinical endpoint. The product may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures under certain circumstances. The Food and Drug Omnibus Reform Act of 2022 (“FDORA”) was recently enacted, which included provisions related to the accelerated approval pathway. Pursuant to FDORA, the FDA is authorized to require a post-approval study to be underway prior to approval or within a specified time period following approval. FDORA also

requires the FDA to specify conditions of any required post-approval study, which may include milestones such as a target date of study completion and requires sponsors to submit progress reports for required post-approval studies and any conditions required by the FDA not later than 180 days following approval and not less frequently than every 180 days thereafter until completion or termination of the study. FDORA enables the FDA to initiate enforcement action for the failure to conduct with due diligence a required post-approval study, including a failure to meet any required conditions specified by the FDA or to submit timely reports.
 In addition to the Fast Track, accelerated approval and priority review programs discussed above, a sponsor may seek a breakthrough therapy designation. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or conditions, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. A breakthrough therapy designation conveys all of the Fast Track program features, as well as more intensive FDA guidance on an efficient drug development program and a commitment from FDA to involve senior managers and experienced review staff in a proactive collaborative, cross-disciplinary review.
Abbreviated New Drug Applications for Generic Drugs and 505(b)(2)NDAs
 NDA applicants are required to list with the FDA each patent with claims covering the applicant’s product or method of using the product. Upon approval of a drug, each of the patents listed in the application for the drug is then published in the FDA’s Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations, commonly known as the Orange Book. Drugs listed in the Orange Book can, in turn, be cited by potential generic or 505(b)(2) applicants in support of approval of an ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) application. An ANDA provides for marketing of a drug product that has the same active ingredients in the same strengths and dosage form as the listed drug and has been shown to be bioequivalent to the listed drug. Other than the requirement for bioequivalence testing, ANDA applicants are not required to conduct, or submit results of, preclinical or clinical tests to prove the safety or effectiveness of their drug product. Drugs approved in this way can often be substituted by pharmacists under prescriptions written for the original listed drug. A 505(b)(2) NDA is an application that contains full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness but where some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference. A 505(b)(2) applicant may be able to rely on published literature or on FDA’s previous findings of safety and effectiveness for an approved drug. A 505(b)(2) NDA may be submitted for changes to a previously approved drug, including, for example, in the dosage form, route of administration, or indication.
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant is required to make a certification to the FDA concerning any patents listed for the approved NDA product in the FDA’s Orange Book. Specifically, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant must certify that: (1) the required patent information has not been filed; (2) the listed patent has expired (3) the listed patent has not expired, but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration; or (4) the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product. The ANDA applicant may also elect to submit a section viii statement certifying that its proposed ANDA labeling does not contain (or carves out) any language regarding the patented method-of-use rather than certify to a listed method-of-use patent. If the applicant does not challenge the listed patents, the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired.
A certification that the ANDA or 505(b)(2) product will not infringe the already approved product’s listed patents, or that such patents are invalid, is called a Paragraph IV certification. If the ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant has provided a Paragraph IV certification to the FDA, the applicant must also send notice of the Paragraph IV certification to the NDA and patent holders once the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application has been received by the FDA. The NDA and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the Paragraph IV certification. The filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within forty-five days of the receipt of a Paragraph IV certification automatically prevents the FDA from approving the ANDA or 505(b)(2) application until the earlier of thirty months, expiration of the patent, settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the ANDA applicant.
The ANDA or 505(b)(2) application will not be approved until any applicable non-patent exclusivity listed in the Orange Book for the referenced product has expired.
Patent Term Restoration and Marketing Exclusivity
Depending upon the timing, duration and specifics of FDA approval of the use of our drug candidates, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Act. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of fourteen years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND application and the submission date of an NDA or BLA plus the time between the submission date of an NDA or BLA and the approval of that application, except that this review period is reduced by any time during which the applicant failed to exercise due diligence. Only one patent applicable to an approved product is eligible for the extension, and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the

patent. The USPTO, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, if available, we intend to apply for restorations of patent term for some of our currently owned patents beyond their current expiration dates, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant NDA or BLA; however, there can be no assurance that any such extension will be granted to us.
Market exclusivity provisions under the FDCA can also delay the submission or the approval of certain applications. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of an NDA for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, new indications, dosages or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions of use associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent. Five-year and three-year exclusivity will not delay the submission or approval of a full NDA under 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. However, an applicant submitting a full NDA would be required to conduct or obtain a right of reference to all of the preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical trials necessary to demonstrate safety and effectiveness.
Orphan Drug Designation
Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant Orphan Drug Designation to therapeutic candidates intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects either (1) fewer than 200,000 individuals in the U.S., or (2) more than 200,000 individuals in the U.S. and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making available in the U.S. a product candidate for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales in the U.S. for that product candidate. Orphan Drug Designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. We have received Orphan Drug Designation for KX2-361 for the treatment of gliomas and Oral Paclitaxel for the treatment of angiosarcomas. After the FDA grants Orphan Drug Designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan Drug Designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process.
If a product candidate that has Orphan Drug Designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease for which it has such designation, the product candidate is entitled to orphan product exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication, except under limited circumstances, for seven years. Orphan drug exclusivity, however, could also block the approval of one of our therapeutic candidates for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of the same drug for the same disease or condition as defined by the FDA or if our product candidate is determined to be contained within the competitor’s product candidate for the same indication or disease. Orphan drug exclusivity does not prevent FDA from approving the same drug for a different disease or a different drug for the same disease.
 Pediatric Exclusivity and Pediatric Use
Under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA), certain therapeutic candidates may obtain an additional six months of exclusivity if the sponsor submits information requested in writing by the FDA, referred to as a Written Request, relating to the use of the active moiety of the product candidate in children. Although the FDA may issue a Written Request for studies on either approved or unapproved indications, it may only do so where it determines that information relating to that use of a product candidate in a pediatric population, or part of the pediatric population, may produce health benefits in that population. This six-month exclusivity may be granted if an NDA or BLA sponsor submits pediatric data that fairly responds to a written request from the FDA for such data. The data do not need to show the product to be effective in the pediatric population studied. If the FDA determines that the studies fairly respond to the FDA’s request and the studies are submitted to and accepted by the FDA within the statutory time limits, whatever statutory or regulatory periods of exclusivity covering the product are extended by six months and, in the case of drug products approved via NDA, patent protection is also extended. In addition, the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, requires a sponsor to conduct pediatric studies for most therapeutic candidates, for a new active ingredient, new indication, new dosage form, new dosing regimen or new route of administration. Under PREA, original NDAs and supplements thereto must contain a pediatric assessment unless the sponsor has received a deferral or waiver. The required assessment must assess the safety and effectiveness of the product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The FDA may grant a waiver or a deferral of pediatric studies for some or all of the pediatric subpopulations. A deferral may be granted for several reasons, including a finding that the product candidate is ready for approval for use in adults before pediatric studies are complete or that additional safety or effectiveness data needs to be collected before the pediatric studies begin. The law requires the FDA to send a PREA Non-Compliance letter to sponsors who have failed to submit their pediatric assessments required under PREA, have failed to seek or obtain a deferral

or deferral extension or have failed to request approval for a required pediatric formulation. It further requires the FDA to post the PREA Non-Compliance letter and sponsor’s response.
Additional Controls for Biologics
To help reduce the increased risk of the introduction of adventitious agents, the PHSA emphasizes the importance of manufacturing controls for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The PHSA also provides authority to the FDA to immediately suspend biologics licenses in situations where there exists a danger to public health, to prepare or procure products in the event of shortages and critical public health needs, and to authorize the creation and enforcement of regulations to prevent the introduction or spread of communicable diseases within the United States.
After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release as a condition of approval. As part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the lot manufacturing history and the results of all of the manufacturer's tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before allowing the manufacturer to release the lots for distribution. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. As with drugs, after approval of a BLA, biologics manufacturers must address any safety issues that arise, are subject to recalls or a halt in manufacturing, and are subject to periodic inspection after approval.
Post-Approval Requirements
Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product may result in restrictions on the product or even complete withdrawal of the product from the market. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes and additional labeling claims, are subject to further FDA review and approval in a supplemental NDA, or sNDA, or supplemental BLA, or sBLA. An sNDA must contain all of the information necessary to support the change. In the case of a new indication, that information usually consists of at least one clinical trial, and often more. Like an NDA or BLA, FDA determines whether the sNDA or sBLA is sufficiently complete to permit review before it files the sNDA or sBLA. FDA then reviews the sNDA or sBLA. Like an NDA or BLA, FDA can either approve the sNDA or sBLA or issue a complete response letter outlining the deficiencies in the sNDA or sBLA. In addition, the FDA may under some circumstances require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the effect of approved therapeutic products that have been commercialized, and the FDA under some circumstances has the power to prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of these post-marketing programs.
Any therapeutic products manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals for prescription drugs are subject to continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things:
•reporting and record-keeping requirements; 
 •reporting of adverse experiences; 
 •providing the FDA with updated safety and efficacy information; 
 •product sampling and distribution requirements; 
 •notifying the FDA and gaining its approval of specified manufacturing or labeling changes and 
 •complying with FDA promotion and advertising requirements, which include, among other things, standards for direct-to-consumer advertising, restrictions on promoting products for uses or in patient populations that are not described in or consistent with the product’s approved labeling, limitations on industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities and requirements for promotional activities involving the internet. 
 Therapeutic manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacturing of approved therapeutic products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and obtain licenses in certain states and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and some state agencies for compliance with cGMP and other laws. The FDA periodically inspects manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cGMP, which imposes extensive procedural, substantive and record-keeping requirements. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated, and, depending on the significance of the change, may require FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations would also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon us and any third-party manufacturers used. Accordingly, manufacturers

must continue to expend time, money and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain compliance with cGMP and other aspects of regulatory compliance.
Disclosure of Clinical Trial Information
Sponsors of clinical trials of FDA-regulated products, including drugs and biologics, are required to register and disclose certain clinical trial information, which is publicly available at www.clinicaltrials.gov. Information related to the product, patient population, phase of investigation, study sites and investigators and other aspects of the clinical trial is then made public as part of the registration. Sponsors are also obligated to disclose the results of their clinical trials after completion. Disclosure of the results of these trials can be delayed under certain limited circumstances for up to two years after the date of completion of the trial. Competitors may use this publicly available information to gain knowledge regarding the progress of development programs. The government recently released a regulation and policy to expand and enhance the requirements related to registering and reporting the results of which may result in greater enforcement of these requirements in the future.
Regulation of Outsourcing Facilities
Pharmaceutical drug compounding is a practice in which a licensed pharmacist, a licensed physician, or in the case of an outsourcing facility, a person under the direct supervision of a licensed pharmacist, combines, mixes, or alters ingredients of a drug to create a medication. We have historically been engaged in the compounding of sterile drugs as an outsourcing facility registered with FDA under FDCA Section 503B. Title I of the Drug Quality and Security Act, the Compounding Quality Act, or CQA, allows a facility that compounds sterile drugs to register with FDA as an outsourcing facility. Once registered (which includes payment of an annual fee, among other requirements), an outsourcing facility must meet certain conditions in order to be statutorily exempt from the FDCA’s new drug approval requirements, the requirement to label products with adequate directions for use, and certain product tracing and serialization requirements. Under the CQA, a drug must be lawfully compounded in compliance with the provisions set forth in Section 503B including FDA’s cGMP regulations and related cGMP guidance for outsourcing facilities in order to remain eligible for the statutory exemptions. The outsourcing facility must also bi-annually report specific information about the products that it compounds, including a list of all of the products it compounded during the previous six months pursuant to Section 503B(b)(2). The source of any bulk substance active ingredient used in compounding must be a Section 510-registered manufacturer, and the substances must be accompanied by a Certificate of Analysis. If the outsourcing facility compounds using bulk drug substances, the bulk drug substances must either appear on FDA’s “interim” Category 1 list of bulk substances that may be used in compounding under Section 503B, which are bulk drug substances for which FDA has determined there is a clinical need for use in compounding. Drugs may also be compounded if an FDA-approved drug product appears on FDA’s published drug shortage list.
FDA has not yet finalized its list of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need. Provided certain conditions are met, FDA will exercise enforcement discretion concerning interim Category 1 substances pending evaluation of the substances for inclusion on FDA’s final list of bulk drug substances for which there is a clinical need.
In addition, an outsourcing facility must meet other conditions described in the CQA, including reporting adverse events pursuant to Section 503B(b)(5) of the FDCA, and labeling its compounded products with certain information pursuant to Section 503B(a)(10). Outsourcing facilities are prohibited from transferring or otherwise selling compounded drugs through a wholesale distributor, or from compounding drugs that are essentially copies of commercially available, FDA-approved drugs. Outsourcing facilities are subject to FDA inspection, and FDA conducts inspections on a risk-based frequency under Section 503B(b)(4).
Pharmaceutical Coverage, Reimbursement and Pricing
Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval or compound. In the U.S., sales of any products for which we may compound or receive regulatory approval for commercial sale will depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Third-party payors include managed care providers, private health insurers and other organizations as well as government payors such as Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE and the Department of Veterans Affairs.
The process for determining whether a payor will provide coverage for a product is typically separate from the process for setting the reimbursement rate that the payor will pay for the product. Third-party payors may limit coverage to specific products on an approved list or formulary which might not include all of the FDA-approved products for a particular indication. Also, third-party payors may refuse to include a particular branded drug on their formularies or otherwise restrict patient access to a branded drug when a less costly generic equivalent or other alternative is available. However, under Medicare Part D—Medicare’s outpatient prescription drug benefit—there are protections in place to ensure coverage and reimbursement for oncology products and all Part D prescription drug plans are required to cover substantially all anti-cancer agents. However, a payor’s decision to provide coverage for a product does not imply that an adequate reimbursement rate will be available. Adequate third-party reimbursement may not be available to enable us to maintain price levels sufficient to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development.

Third-party payors are increasingly challenging the price and examining the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of medical products and services, in addition to their safety and efficacy. In order to obtain coverage and reimbursement for any product that might be approved for sale, we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate the medical necessity and cost-effectiveness of any products, in addition to the costs required to obtain regulatory approvals. Our drug candidates may not be considered medically necessary or cost-effective. If third-party payors do not consider a product to be cost-effective compared to other available therapies, they may not cover an approved product as a benefit under their plans or, if they do, the level of payment may not be sufficient to allow a company to sell its products at a profit.
Government Programs
 Medicaid, the 340B Drug Pricing Program, and Medicare
 Federal law requires that a pharmaceutical manufacturer, as a condition of having its products receive federal reimbursement under Medicaid and Medicare Part B, must pay rebates to state Medicaid programs for all units of its covered outpatient drugs dispensed to Medicaid beneficiaries and paid for by a state Medicaid program under either a fee-for-service arrangement or through a managed care organization. This federal requirement is effectuated through a Medicaid drug rebate agreement between the manufacturer and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (“CMS”) administers the Medicaid drug rebate agreements, which provide, among other things, that the manufacturer will pay rebates to each state Medicaid agency on a quarterly basis and report certain price information on a monthly and quarterly basis. The rebates are based on prices reported to CMS by manufacturers for their covered outpatient drugs. For innovator products, that is, drugs that are marketed under approved NDAs or BLAs, the basic rebate amount is the greater of 23.1% of the average manufacturer price (“AMP”) for the quarter or the difference between such AMP and the best price for that same quarter. The AMP is the weighted average of prices paid to the manufacturer (1) directly by retail community pharmacies and (2) by wholesalers for drugs distributed to retail community pharmacies. The best price is essentially the lowest price available to non-governmental entities. Innovator products are also subject to an additional rebate that is based on the amount, if any, by which the product’s current AMP has increased over the baseline AMP, which is the AMP for the first full quarter after launch, adjusted for inflation. For non-innovator products, generally generic drugs marketed under approved ANDAs, the basic rebate amount is 13% of the AMP for the quarter. Non-innovator products are also subject to an additional rebate. The additional rebate is similar to that discussed above for innovator products, except that the baseline AMP quarter is the fifth full quarter after launch (for non-innovator multiple source drugs launched on April 1, 2013 or later) or the third quarter of 2014 (for those launched before April 1, 2013). To date, the rebate amount for a drug has been capped at 100% of the AMP; however, effective January 1, 2024, this cap will be eliminated, which means that a manufacturer could pay a rebate amount on a unit of the product that is greater than the average price the manufacturer receives for the product.
 The terms of participation in the Medicaid drug rebate program impose an obligation to correct the prices reported in previous quarters, as may be necessary. Any such corrections could result in additional or lesser rebate liability, depending on the direction of the correction. In addition to retroactive rebates, if a manufacturer were found to have knowingly submitted false information to the government, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information.
 A manufacturer must also participate in a federal program known as the 340B drug pricing program in order for federal funds to be available to pay for the manufacturer’s products under Medicaid and Medicare Part B. Under this program, the participating manufacturer agrees to charge certain federally funded clinics and safety net hospitals no more than an established discounted price for its covered outpatient drugs, including biologics. The formula for determining the discounted price is defined by statute and is based on the AMP and the unit rebate amount as calculated under the Medicaid drug rebate program, discussed above. Manufacturers are required to report pricing information to the Health Resources and Services Administration (“HRSA”) on a quarterly basis. HRSA has also issued regulations relating to the calculation of the ceiling price as well as imposition of civil monetary penalties for each instance of knowingly and intentionally overcharging a 340B covered entity.
 Federal law also requires that manufacturers report data on a quarterly basis to CMS regarding the pricing of products that are separately reimbursable under Medicare Part B. These are generally drugs or biologics, such as injectable products, that are administered “incident to” a physician service and are not generally self-administered. The pricing information submitted by manufacturers is the basis for reimbursement to physicians and suppliers for drugs covered under Medicare Part B. As with the Medicaid drug rebate program, federal law provides for civil monetary penalties for failing to provide required information, late submission of required information, and false information.
 Medicare Part D provides prescription drug benefits for seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare Part D enrollees once had a gap in their coverage (between the initial coverage limit and the point at which catastrophic coverage begins) where Medicare did not cover their prescription drug costs, known as the coverage gap. However, beginning in by 2019, Medicare Part D beneficiaries paid 25% of brand drug costs after they reached the initial coverage limit - the same percentage they were responsible for before they reached that limit - thereby closing the coverage gap from the enrollee’s point of view. Most of the cost of closing the coverage gap is being borne by innovator companies and the government through subsidies. Each manufacturer of a drug approved under an NDA or BLA is required to enter into a Medicare Part D coverage gap discount agreement and provide a 70% discount on those drugs

dispensed to Medicare Part D enrollees in the coverage gap, in order for its drugs to be reimbursed by Medicare Part D. Beginning in 2025, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (“IRA”) eliminates the coverage gap under Medicare Part D by significantly lowering the enrollee maximum out-of-pocket cost and requiring manufacturers to subsidize, through a newly established manufacturer discount program, 10% of Part D enrollees’ prescription costs for brand drugs below the out-of-pocket maximum, and 20% once the out-of-pocket maximum has been reached. Although these discounts represent a lower percentage of enrollees’ costs than the current discounts required below the out-of-pocket maximum (that is, in the coverage gap phase of Part D coverage), the new manufacturer contribution required above the out-of-pocket maximum could be considerable for very high-cost patients and the total contributions by manufacturers to a Part D enrollee’s drug expenses may exceed those currently provided.
 The IRA will also allow the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) to negotiate the selling price of certain drugs and biologics that CMS reimburses under Medicare Part B and Part D, although only high-expenditure single-source drugs that have been approved for at least 7 years (11 years for biologics) can be selected by CMS for negotiation, with the negotiated price taking effect two years after the selection year. The negotiated prices, which will first become effective in 2026, will be capped at a statutory ceiling price. Beginning in October 2023, the IRA will also penalize drug manufacturers that increase prices of Medicare Part B and Part D drugs at a rate greater than the rate of inflation.
 Federal Contracting/Pricing Requirements
 Manufacturers are also required to make their covered drugs, which are generally drugs approved under NDAs and BLAs, available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule (“FSS”) of the General Services Administration. The law also requires manufacturers to offer deeply discounted FSS contract pricing for purchases of their covered drugs by the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Defense (“DoD”), the Coast Guard, and the Public Health Service (including the Indian Health Service) in order for federal funding to be available for reimbursement or purchase of the manufacturer’s drugs under certain federal programs. FSS pricing to those four federal agencies for covered drugs must be no more than the Federal Ceiling Price (“FCP”), which is at least 24% below the Non-Federal Average Manufacturer Price (“Non-FAMP”) for the prior year. The Non-FAMP is the average price for covered drugs sold to wholesalers or other middlemen, net of any price reductions.
 The accuracy of a manufacturer’s reported Non-FAMPs, FCPs, or FSS contract prices may be audited by the government. Among the remedies available to the government for inaccuracies is recoupment of any overcharges to the four specified federal agencies based on those inaccuracies. If a manufacturer were found to have knowingly reported false prices, in addition to other penalties available to the government, the law provides for civil monetary penalties of $100,000 per incorrect item. Finally, manufacturers are required to disclose in FSS contract proposals all commercial pricing that is equal to or less than the proposed FSS pricing, and subsequent to award of an FSS contract, manufacturers are required to monitor certain commercial price reductions and extend commensurate price reductions to the government, under the terms of the FSS contract Price Reductions Clause. Among the remedies available to the government for any failure to properly disclose commercial pricing and/or to extend FSS contract price reductions is recoupment of any FSS overcharges that may result from such omissions.
 Tricare Retail Pharmacy Network Program
 The DoD provides pharmacy benefits to current and retired military service members and their families through the Tricare healthcare program. When a Tricare beneficiary obtains a prescription drug through a retail pharmacy, the DoD reimburses the pharmacy at the retail price for the drug rather than procuring it from the manufacturer at the discounted FCP discussed above. In order for the DoD to realize discounted prices for covered drugs (generally drugs approved under NDAs or BLAs), federal law requires manufacturers to pay refunds on utilization of their covered drugs sold to Tricare beneficiaries through retail pharmacies in DoD’s Tricare network. These refunds are generally the difference between the Non-FAMP and the FCP and are due on a quarterly basis. Absent an agreement from the manufacturer to provide such refunds, DoD will designate the manufacturer’s products as Tier 3 (non-formulary) and require that beneficiaries obtain prior authorization in order for the products to be dispensed at a Tricare retail network pharmacy. However, refunds are due whether or not the manufacturer has entered into such an agreement.
Branded Pharmaceutical Fee
 A branded pharmaceutical fee is imposed on manufacturers and importers of branded prescription drugs, generally drugs approved under NDAs or BLAs. The fee is $2.8 billion in 2019 and subsequent years. This annual fee is apportioned among the participating companies based on each company’s sales of qualifying products to or utilization by certain U.S. government programs during the preceding calendar year. The fee is not deductible for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Utilization of generic drugs, generally drugs approved under ANDAs, is not included in a manufacturer’s sales used to calculate its portion of the fee.
 The ACA
 Effective in 2010, the Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) made several changes to the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, including increasing pharmaceutical manufacturers’ rebate liability by raising the minimum basic Medicaid rebate on most branded prescription drugs from 15.1% of average manufacturer price, or AMP, to 23.1% of AMP, and adding a new rebate calculation for “line

extensions” (i.e., new formulations, such as extended release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products, as well as potentially impacting their rebate liability by modifying the statutory definition of AMP. The ACA also expanded the universe of Medicaid utilization subject to drug rebates by requiring pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay rebates on Medicaid managed care utilization as of 2010 and by expanding the population potentially eligible for Medicaid drug benefits. CMS will expand Medicaid rebate liability to the territories of the U.S. as well, beginning in 2023, if the territories elect to enroll in the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program. In addition, the ACA provides for the public availability of retail survey prices and certain weighted average AMPs under the Medicaid program. The implementation of this requirement by CMS may also provide for the public availability of pharmacy acquisition cost data, which could influence our decisions related to setting product prices and offering related discounts.
With regard to the 340B program, effective in 2010, the ACA expanded the types of entities eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing; although, under the current state of the law, with the exception of children’s hospitals, these newly eligible entities will not be eligible to receive discounted 340B pricing on orphan drugs when used for the orphan indication.
The adoption of government controls and measures and tightening of restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could also limit payments for pharmaceuticals.
The marketability of any products for which we receive regulatory approval for commercial sale may suffer if the government and third-party payors fail to provide adequate coverage and reimbursement. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which we receive regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.
Generic Drugs
Given that we manufacture and market generic drug products, our business may be impacted by laws and policies governing the coverage, pricing and reimbursement of generic drugs. Generic drugs are the same API as initial innovator medicines and are typically more affordable in comparison to the innovator’s products. Sales of generic medicines have benefitted from policies encouraging generic substitution and a general increasing acceptance of generic drugs on the part of healthcare insurers, consumers, physicians and pharmacists. However, while the U.S. generics market is one of the largest in the world, the recent trend of rising generic drug prices has drawn scrutiny from the U.S. government. Specifically, generic drug pricing is the subject of Congressional inquiries and media attention, and many generic drug manufacturers are the targets of government investigations.
In addition, like branded drug manufacturers, generic drug manufacturers are now required to pay an inflation penalty if price increases on generic drugs exceed the rate of inflation.
Also, the ACA revised the methodology for setting Medicaid generic drug reimbursement in order to further limit the reimbursement of generic drugs under the Medicaid program. Specifically, the Federal Upper Limit (“FUL”), which establishes the government’s maximum payment amount for certain generic drugs, is no less than 175% of the weighted average of the most recently reported monthly AMPs for pharmaceutically and therapeutically equivalent multiple source drug products that are available for purchase by retail community pharmacies on a nationwide basis. Similarly, reimbursement for generic drugs is also limited in Medicare Part B, as the Average Sales Price (the metric upon which reimbursement is based or ASP) for multiple-source drugs included within the same multiple-source drug billing and payment code is the volume-weighted average of the various manufacturers’ ASPs for those drug products.
Reimbursement for Compounded Drugs
Given that we intend to compound and sell compounded products, some of which may include APIs that we manufacture, our business may be impacted by the downstream coverage and reimbursement of compounded products. Generally, federal reimbursement is available for compounded drugs but is typically dependent upon whether the individual ingredients or bulk drug substances that make up the compounded product are FDA-approved. Certain of our API products have not yet received FDA approval.
There is a national payment policy for compounded drugs under Medicare Part B, but the policy is unclear because it does not stipulate whether payment is available for ingredients that are bulk drug substances, which are generally not FDA-approved. Under Medicare Part B, claims for compounded drugs are typically submitted using a billing code for “not otherwise classified drugs,” and CMS contractors who process Part B claims may conduct further reviews of outpatient claims to determine whether the drug billed under a nonspecific billing code is a compounded drug and to identify its ingredients in order to make payment decisions. However, CMS contractors who process Part B claims do not always collect information on the FDA-approval status of drug ingredients, and, therefore, payment may be made for ingredients that are not FDA-approved products. Therefore, there is uncertainty as to whether Medicare payments for compounded drugs are consistent with the Medicare Part B policy.
Under Medicare Part D, federal payments are not available for non-FDA-approved products—including bulk drug substances—and inactive ingredients used to make a compounded drug. Insurers that offer Medicare Part D benefits and Part D-only sponsors, generally, pay pharmacies for each ingredient in the compounded drug that is an FDA-approved product and is otherwise eligible for reimbursement under Part D. However, with respect to non-FDA approved bulk drug substances, insurers that offer Medicare Part D

benefits and Part D-only sponsors may choose to pay for such bulk substances but may not submit these payments as part of the Part D transaction data CMS uses to determine federal payments to Part D plans.
Healthcare Fraud and Abuse Laws and Compliance Requirements
We are subject to various federal and state laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry. These laws may impact, among other things, our proposed sales and marketing programs. In addition, we may be subject to patient privacy regulation by both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:
•the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration (a term interpreted broadly to include anything of value, including, for example, gifts, discounts, chargebacks, and credits), directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs; 
 •federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, or making a false statement or record material to payment of a false claim or avoiding, decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money owed to the federal government; 
 •provisions of the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which created new federal criminal statutes, referred to as the “HIPAA All-Payor Fraud Prohibition,” that prohibit knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program and making false statements relating to healthcare matters; 
 •the federal transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which was part of the ACA, that require manufacturers of certain drugs and biologics to track and annually report payments and other transfers of value they make to U.S. physicians, physician assistants, certain types of advance care nurses, and teaching hospitals, as well as physician ownership and investment interests in the manufacturer, and that such information is subsequently made publicly available in a searchable format on a CMS website; 
 •provisions of HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act and its implementing regulations, which imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information and 
 •state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, state transparency reporting and compliance laws; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and which may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. 
 The ACA broadened the reach of the fraud and abuse laws by, among other things, amending the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the applicable criminal healthcare fraud statutes contained within 42 U.S.C. § 1320a-7b. Pursuant to the statutory amendment, a person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act or the civil monetary penalties statute. Many states have adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any source, not only the Medicare and Medicaid programs.

The federal False Claims Act prohibits anyone from, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, for payment to federal programs (including Medicare and Medicaid) claims for items or services that are false or fraudulent. Although we would not submit claims directly to payors, manufacturers can be held liable under these laws if they are deemed to “cause” the submission of false or fraudulent claims by, for example, providing inaccurate billing or coding information to customers or promoting a product off-label. In addition, our future activities relating to the reporting of wholesaler or estimated retail prices for our products, the reporting of prices used to calculate Medicaid rebate information and other information affecting federal, state and third-party reimbursement for our products, and the sale and marketing of our products, are subject to scrutiny under this law. For example, pharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under the federal False Claims Act in connection with their alleged off-label promotion of drugs, purportedly concealing price concessions in the pricing information submitted to the government for government price reporting purposes, and allegedly providing free product to customers with the expectation that the customers would bill federal health care programs for the product. Penalties for a False Claims Act violation include three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus mandatory civil penalties for each separate false claim, the potential for exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs, and, although the federal False Claims Act is a civil statute, conduct that results in a False Claims Act violation may also implicate various federal criminal statutes. In addition, private individuals have the ability to bring actions under the federal False Claims Act, and certain states have enacted laws modeled after the federal False Claims Act.
New Legislation and Regulations
From time to time, legislation is drafted, introduced and passed in Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the testing, approval, manufacturing, marketing, coverage and reimbursement of products regulated by the FDA or other government agencies. In addition to new legislation, FDA and healthcare fraud and abuse and coverage and reimbursement regulations and policies are often revised or interpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Most recently, the IRA made significant changes to reimbursement under Medicare Part B and Part D, among other things. Additional reforms could have an adverse effect on anticipated revenues from therapeutic candidates that we may successfully develop and for which we may obtain regulatory approval and may affect our overall financial condition and ability to develop therapeutic candidates. However, we cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any healthcare reform legislation or the impact of potential legislation on us.
Furthermore, in the U.S., the health care industry is subject to political, economic and regulatory influences. Initiatives to reduce the federal budget and debt and to reform health care coverage are increasing cost-containment efforts. We anticipate that federal agencies, Congress, state legislatures and the private sector will continue to review and assess alternative health care benefits, controls on health care spending, and other fundamental changes to the healthcare delivery system. Any proposed or actual changes could limit coverage or the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for health care products and services, which could also result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressures and limit or eliminate our spending on development projects and affect our ultimate profitability. We are not able to predict whether further legislative changes will be enacted or whether FDA or healthcare fraud and abuse or coverage and reimbursement regulations, guidance, policies or interpretations will be changed or what the effect of such changes, if any, may be.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act
The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 (“FCPA”) prohibits any U.S. individual or business from corruptly offering, paying, promising or authorizing the provision of anything of value, directly or indirectly, to any foreign official, foreign political party or official thereof, or candidate for foreign political office to obtain or retain business. The FCPA also obligates companies whose securities are listed in the U.S. to comply with accounting provisions requiring the issuer to maintain books and records that accurately and fairly reflect all transactions of the issuer and its controlled subsidiaries and to devise and maintain an adequate system of internal accounting controls.
Environment
We are subject to inspections by the FDA for compliance with cGMP and other U.S. regulatory requirements, including U.S. federal, state and local regulations regarding environmental protection and hazardous and controlled substance controls, among others. Environmental laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. We have incurred, and may continue to incur, significant expenditures to ensure that we are in compliance with these laws and regulations. We would be subject to significant penalties for failure to comply with these laws and regulations.
Rest of the World Regulation
For countries outside of the U.S., the requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, drug licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases the clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCP requirements and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles having their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
If we fail to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, we may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

Segment, Corporate and Financial Information
We manage our operations and allocate resources in line with our two distinct reportable segments: (1) our Oncology Innovation Platform, dedicated to the research and development of our proprietary drugs and (2) our Commercial Platform, focused on the sales and marketing of our specialty drugs and the market development of our proprietary drugs. We previously operated a third distinct reportable segment, our Global Supply Chain Platform, dedicated to providing a stable and efficient supply of active pharmaceutical ingredients (“API”) for our clinical and commercial efforts. The components within this reportable segment were sold or otherwise discontinued during 2022.
 Athenex has operations with offices and facilities in Buffalo and Clarence, New York; Cranford, New Jersey; Houston, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; Hong Kong; Guatemala City, Guatemala and Buenos Aires, Argentina. Under the Alliance Agreement with FSMC, we are obligated to spend $100.0 million in the Buffalo area over the initial 10-year term of the lease and an additional $100.0 million during the second 10-year term if we elect to extend the lease. We also committed to hiring 250 permanent employees in the Buffalo area within the first 5 years of completion of the project. As of December 31, 2022, we had hired 36 permanent employees in the Buffalo area. In the event we are unable to hire enough employees in the Buffalo area or meet our other obligations under this agreement, FSMC may terminate the agreement and we may have to renegotiate our lease or relocate our North American headquarters.
 Financial information regarding our operations, assets and liabilities, including our net loss for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021 and our total assets as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report.
