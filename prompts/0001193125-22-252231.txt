Item 1. | BUSINESS
--------+---------


We are a clinical-stage biotechnology company that uses our proprietary gene therapy platform technology to develop transformational genetic therapies for people suffering from rare and debilitating diseases. Our initial focus is in the field of ophthalmology, where we have wholly owned clinical-stage programs in X-linked retinitis pigmentosa (“XLRP”) and achromatopsia (“ACHM”), and an optogenetics program through our collaboration with Bionic Sight, Inc. (“Bionic Sight”). Our preclinical pipeline includes a program in dry age-related macular degeneration (“dAMD”), two programs targeting central nervous system (“CNS”) disorders, including frontotemporal dementia (“FTD”) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (“ALS”), and a program in otology through our collaboration with Otonomy, Inc. (“Otonomy”). In May 2022, we released interim, masked, clinical data from the Skyline trial (as defined below) in our XLRP program and we now have 24-month data from the XLRP Phase 1/2 trial (“Horizon”). In addition to our product pipeline, we have also developed broad technological and manufacturing capabilities, utilizing our internal scientific resources and collaborating with others. We had $46.4 million in cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2022 and we completed an underwritten public offering in July 2022. We believe our cash and cash equivalents at June 30, 2022 and the net proceeds from the July 2022 public offering will be sufficient to allow us to generate data from our research and development programs through calendar year 2022. However, we will require substantial additional funding to continue our operations and the development of our product candidates.

  Our Strategy 
 Our objective is to become a leader in developing and commercializing gene therapy treatments for patients with severe diseases. Our strategy to accomplish this goal is to: 

• | Advance our pipeline of gene therapies to treat inherited retinal diseases (“IRDs”) with an initial focus on ophthalmology. Our most advanced product candidates are treatments for the orphan eye diseases XLRP and Achromatopsia B3 (“ACHMB3”). Given the severity of these diseases and the current lack of treatment options, a one-time-treatment alternative that corrects the underlying genetic defect would provide long-term value for patients, their families and the healthcare system more broadly. Furthermore, we believe we can leverage our experience in these orphan diseases to larger ophthalmology indications such as dAMD.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Further develop our manufacturing capabilities. We believe that controlling manufacturing is a critical component of successful gene therapy drug development due to the complexity and uniqueness of the process of each gene therapy product candidate and an overall lack of capabilities and capacity at Contract Development and Manufacturing Organizations, or CDMOs, that focus on gene therapies. Furthermore, given the productivity and scalability of our production systems and the manageable number of patients in our target markets, we are able to utilize facilities that are more modest in size. For example, our late-stage, commercial manufacturing process has demonstrated (in multiple batches) it can produce thousands of ophthalmology doses from a 50L bioreactor. We use our process development and pilot manufacturing facility to manufacture early stage research materials, and we are currently preparing to begin operating a leased, build-to-suit 21,250 square foot current Good Manufacturing Practices (“cGMP”) manufacturing and quality control facility adjacent to our current Florida facility. This facility is intended to supply materials for clinical trials and potential commercial supply of our most advanced product candidates, if approved. We believe that our investment in this facility will facilitate the more rapid advancement of our product candidates through regulatory approval while reducing risk and enhancing the therapeutic and commercial potential of our gene therapy platform. However, COVID-19-related supply chain disruptions continue to challenge the biotechnology sector, including cell and gene therapy companies, and our ability to execute at our current and planned facilities will depend on our financial resources and ability to access raw materials and other necessary supplies.

• | Selectively invest in our platform and our clinical and preclinical product candidates. We believe that our deep understanding of our target indications and our robust internal expertise in viral vector design gives us a significant competitive advantage. This understanding includes the identification of novel capsids and the optimization of genes and promoters, physical vector delivery, vector manufacturing, clinical trial design and clinical trial conduct. We intend to continue to selectively advance our pre-clinical product candidates through collaborations and partnerships that provide financial support and funding for future development. In addition, we will continue to seek to identify novel next generation capsids, optimize promoters and identify opportunities to improve our manufacturing process.

Our Initial Focus in Ophthalmology and Other Areas 
 Sight is critical to the human experience. Many people fear blindness more than premature death. Consequently, we have designed our most advanced product candidates, including AGTC-501 for the treatment of XLRP and AGTC 401 for the treatment of ACHMB3, to treat orphan diseases in ophthalmology. These orphan indications have patient populations that are small enough to allow for clinical trials on a manageable scale but have a sufficient prevalence to provide substantial commercial opportunity. By focusing initially on orphan ophthalmology product candidates, we are also able to leverage our experience and develop strong relationships within the relevant scientific and medical communities. Our clinical trials are conducted mainly at academic test 
 
2 

  centers and by working with the principal investigators and surgeons at these test centers, we have realized a number of important synergies. 
 

• | XLRP: XLRP is an inherited retinal disease of the rod and cone photoreceptors caused by mutations in the Retinitis Pigmentosa GTPase Regulator (RPGR) gene that results in progressive loss of vision, meaning children are born with defective genes that cause poor visual function that significantly affects daily activities and worsens over time. XLRP is commonly observed in boys and young men who notice problems with vision under low light conditions, or night blindness, followed by a restriction of peripheral visual fields, or tunnel vision, leading to poor central vision and eventually to total blindness. According to a published study, the incidence rate for retinitis pigmentosa is about one in 4,000 people and we estimate that there are about 200,000 patients in the United States and Europe combined. It is estimated that about ten percent, or 20,000, of these people have XLRP.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | ACHM: ACHM is an inherited retinal disease caused by mutations in either the Cyclic Nucleotide Gated Channel Subunit Beta 3 (CNGB3) gene or the Cyclic Nucleotide Gated Channel Subunit Alpha 3 (CNGA3) gene. ACHM is characterized by the absence of cone photoreceptor function, resulting in extremely poor visual acuity, extreme light sensitivity, daytime blindness and complete loss of color discrimination. Best-corrected visual acuity in persons affected by ACHM, even under subdued light conditions, is usually about 20/200, a level at which people are considered legally blind. According to a published study, the incidence rate for ACHM is approximately one in 30,000 people, and we therefore estimate that there are about 27,000 patients in the United States and Europe combined. Of these patients, about 75% to 85% have the form of disease caused by mutations in the CNGB3 gene or the CNGA3 gene and we believe that there are approximately 14,000 patients with the CNGB3 mutation and ACHMB3. We believe that the AGTC-401 data generated to date in ACHMB3 support continued development. We are currently working through the details of our future plan for this product candidate but we have paused development activities due to funding constraints. We do not believe, however, that the data generated to date in ACHMA3 support continued development. We intend to follow both the ACHMB3 and ACHMA3 patients for long-term safety observations.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Optogenetics: In addition to our most advanced ophthalmology programs, we have a collaboration with Bionic Sight to develop an optogenetic product candidate for patients with advanced retinal disease. This clinical stage program leverages a unique optogenetic protein, administered by intravitreal injection in an adeno-associated virus (“AAV”) vector, that is activated with a neural coding device using Bionic Sight’s proprietary algorithm to convert what the patient is viewing into signals the brain can understand. We currently have no financial obligations to Bionic Sight under the related collaboration agreement.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Dry AMD: Individuals with mutations in the Complement Factor H (“CFH”) gene, which is a component of the dysregulated complement pathway, have an increased risk of developing AMD that is six times greater than those who do not have such mutation. Preclinical data in relevant animal models support the approach of CFH gene augmentation as a potential therapeutic strategy for AMD. Based on market research, we believe there may be up to one million patients in the United States that would benefit from a CFH gene therapy approach. The full length CFH gene is too large to fit into a single AAV and, therefore, we have re-engineered the gene and have determined that our construct retains functionality both in vitro and in vivo. The program is currently in investigational new drug-, or IND-, enabling safety and biodistribution studies. Future development of this product candidate is subject to the availability of additional funding.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


While our initial focus is in ophthalmology, we are also using our deep capabilities and knowledge of vector construct and design, clinical development, and manufacturing to extend our pipeline into other areas of unmet medical need where we believe an AAV gene therapy approach can potentially provide an advantage. 
 

• | Frontotemporal dementia (FTD): FTD is a degenerative brain disorder, second only to Alzheimer’s disease in terms of prevalence and incidence on the dementia spectrum. Similar to Alzheimer’s disease,
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



3 

  
the prevalence of FTD is on the rise due to the aging population, and there are currently no approved treatments for FTD. Mutations in the Progranulin (PGRN) gene are one of the three main genetic causes of FTD, representing approximately 20% of familial FTD, and accounting for 7,500 to 15,000 cases in the United States and European Union. We have identified a unique capsid, gene, and promoter construct that we believe, based on our preclinical data generated to date, will be more effective in patients than other approaches. Our product candidate for FTD is currently in IND-enabling safety and biodistribution studies. Future development of this product candidate is subject to the availability of additional funding.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS): ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease) is an autosomal dominant, fatal adult-onset disease with no truly effective therapy. It is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease, with approximately 75,000 cases in the United States and European Union, and is characterized by upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. Early symptoms are muscle weakness that progresses and ultimately results in respiratory failure, with death usually occurring within 3 to 5 years of diagnosis. There are both sporadic (approximately 90%) and familial (approximately 10%) forms of the disease, with the most common genetic cause linked to the C9orf72 gene, representing 30-40% of cases. C9orf72 mutations are also present in FTD. We are developing a novel trivalent approach that we believe can fully address all the cellular deficits associated with the mutation and are in the process of finalizing the optimal combination of components to create a therapeutic construct that can be advanced to later stage preclinical studies, subject to the availability of additional funding.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Otology: Mutations in the gap junction protein beta 2 (GJB2) gene account for approximately 30% of all genetic hearing loss cases, representing approximately 90,000 cases in the United States and European Union. In collaboration with Otonomy, Inc. (“Otonomy”), a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development of innovative therapeutics for neurotology, we are developing an AAV-based gene therapy to restore hearing in patients with sensorineural hearing loss caused by a mutation in GJB2. Based on an amendment to the collaboration agreement that was effective January 1, 2022, we increased Otonomy’s control of the program and reduced our share of future product development costs.

Our Gene Therapy Platform 
 Although the concept of gene therapy is relatively straightforward, the process of developing and manufacturing vectors capable of delivering genetic material safely into a patient’s own cells is highly technical and demands significant expertise, experience and know-how. Our approach to gene therapy product development is built on our core competencies in four key areas: vector selection, design, manufacturing and delivery, each of which is described in further detail below. One of our key capabilities is our depth of understanding of the complex interplay between the clinical disease, the cells in the patient’s body that need treatment, the selection of a capsid and a promoter, the design of the gene construct and the method of physical administration. We have spent a significant amount of time conducting research on the best combinations of these elements with the aim of developing safe and effective product candidates. 
Vector Selection 
 The success of a gene therapy platform is highly dependent on the vector selected. Our platform is based on the use of a non-replicating AAV vector to deliver the correct DNA directly to the nucleus of the cells affected by the disease. We believe that AAV vectors are particularly well suited for treating our target diseases and have advantages over other viral vectors, such as adenovirus, herpes virus and lentivirus including: 

• | AAV is a small, simple non-enveloped virus with only two native genes, making the virus easy to engineer as an effective vector;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AAV is inherently stable and resistant to degradation;
--+-------------------------------------------------------



4 

  
• | AAV vectors can deliver functional genes in a manner that supports long-term production of protein, leading to sustained therapeutic effect, without altering the patient’s native DNA;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AAV vectors have a demonstrated safety profile across multiple human clinical trials in several indications; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | AAV vectors are versatile, having the ability to carry therapeutic gene sequences of up to 4,000 base pairs in length into a patient’s cell. As more than 90% of human genes have coding sequences less than 3,000 base pairs in length, this allows AAV vectors to be used in a wide variety of indications.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vector Design 
 After selection of the vector type, there are other critical factors to be considered to maximize the safety and efficacy of the final gene therapy product: 

• | Gene of Interest: The first step in vector design is to identify either the therapeutic protein that the patient’s own cells need to produce (which is expressed from a DNA sequence that defines the gene of interest), or other cargo content, such as gene editing components or an RNA targeting sequence. In many cases the DNA sequence must be engineered to be stable during manufacturing and delivery.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Promoter: Production of the protein in the cell requires a promoter, which is a genetic element that drives expression. Certain promoters function well only in certain cell types, whereas other promoters function well in almost any cell type. We make our selection by comparing different promoters in the specific type of cells that are affected in each disease target, ideally in an animal whose physiology is close to that of humans, to find the promoter that best enables production of therapeutic levels of protein in that cell type. We have conducted internal and external research to design promoters that optimize therapeutic constructs for maximum expression with a smaller size, and increased cell specificity.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Capsid: After the promoter and gene of interest are selected, these elements must be packaged into an AAV capsid. There are 108 to 109 variations of AAV capsids with different abilities to bind to and enter varying cell types. We engineer these capsids in-house and seek to collaborate with third parties with a goal of developing novel capsids that efficiently enter the type of cells that are affected by each of our targeted diseases.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Vector Manufacturing 
 We have built an rAAV manufacturing platform agnostic to indication, dosing requirements or market size, with demonstrated ability to generate thousands of ocular doses in modest scale stirred tank bioreactors. This scalable, proprietary, high-yield vector manufacturing process can address the most demanding material needs with minimized scaling needs. The system is turnkey, employing robust cell lines that are well characterized and have been vetted by regulatory authorities in the United States, Canada and Europe. The upstream process consistently generates vectors characterized by greater than 50% of all capsids containing full-length, target gene sequences while the downstream process further enhances this resulting in excess of 90% full capsids. The companion analytical platform for process and material characterization is comprised of over 35 product-specific assays developed and transferred to vendors, consistent with regulatory requirements for clinical development. 
 Our manufacturing process has been reviewed by the United States Food and Drug Administration, or the FDA, Health Canada, the Irish Medicines Board and the Israeli Ministry of Health and has been authorized for production of clinical trial material for use in clinical trials in the United States, Canada, Europe and Israel. We have successfully manufactured clinical trial material for seven different indications using three different CDMOs. Our staff have utilized our state-of-the-art process development facility to adapt our process across multiple bioreactor platforms and scales, demonstrating a robust and flexible platform capable of integrating into diverse partner, manufacturing and commercial facility environments. 
 
5 

  As of July 31, 2022, we owned or licensed 37 patents and pending patent applications covering our manufacturing technology. We believe that our core competency and intellectual property estate in vector manufacturing provide a key differentiating element of our gene therapy platform. 
 The complexity of gene therapy manufacturing and lack of dedicated infrastructure to support it have historically resulted in poor reproducibility and lack of reliability in meeting material needs beyond early human clinical trials. rAAV vector manufacturing has been limited by inefficient constructs, poor scalability, inadequate yields and insufficient purity. Our focus is to develop an integrated production and testing platform capable of meeting both clinical and commercial needs and we are committing substantial resources in this area. Important features of our capabilities are set forth below. 
 

• | Our propriety platform for AAV production generates high quality rAAV vectors with high packaging fidelity, high infectivity and low empty particles across multiple serotypes.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our AAV production system generates high volumes of target material and has achieved more than 10-fold improvement in productivity compared to other manufacturing formats.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have adapted our herpes simplex virus, or HSV, helper manufacturing system to multiple vendors’ single use bioreactors, demonstrating robustness and flexibility while removing scale and format limitations attendant with adherent cell culture.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | We have optimized purification and formulation activities to yield multiple rAAV serotypes in a dose-ready form with exceptional purity at previously unattainable genomic concentrations.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Our ability to successfully transfer the technology to multiple contract manufacturing organizations as well as collaboration partners demonstrates the robustness of our manufacturing process.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Taken together, we believe that the efficiency, productivity, scalability, characterization and regulatory definition of our proprietary rAAV manufacturing platform uniquely position us to quickly transition from early phase human clinical trials to late phase, Biologics License Applications (BLA) enabling data in our clinical programs. 
 Vector Delivery 
 Our gene therapy platform allows for vector delivery by a variety of methods, and we select the method that is best suited for the disease and cell type that we are targeting. In ophthalmology, the product candidate can best be delivered to cells in the eye by either injecting the product candidate under the retina (a sub-retinal injection) or by injecting the product candidate into the vitreous of the eye (an intravitreal injection). We are using a sub-retinal injection as the method of delivery for our XLRP and ACHM product candidates in our clinical trials and have developed an extensive training program for surgeons in order to assure consistent delivery across patients. Bionic Sight is using an intravitreal injection as the method of delivery for the optogenetic product candidate. 
 For each product candidate identified in our CNS preclinical programs, we will determine the optimal delivery approach to safely administer the product candidate and ensure optimal therapeutic effect. 
 Our Product Candidate Pipeline 
 AGTC-501 for the treatment of XLRP 
 AGTC-501 (laruparetigene zosaparvovec), our lead gene therapy development program for the treatment of XLRP, is designed to use an engineered AAV vector to insert a stabilized and functional copy of the RPGR gene into the patient’s photoreceptor cells. AGTC-501 is comprised of a stabilized RPGR gene and a promoter that was specifically selected to drive efficient gene expression in primate rods and cones, maintain photoreceptor function and delay disease progression in preclinical models of disease. In addition, published non-human primate, or NHP, studies showed that our proprietary AAV capsid had as much as twice the transfection efficiency in photoreceptors when compared to capsids used in competing programs.

  Clinical development 
 We are currently conducting multiple clinical trials of AGTC-501 that are intended to support the potential submission of a Biologics License Application (“BLA”), including a Phase 1/2 trial, or Horizon, which incorporates an expansion portion that we refer to as the Skyline trial. 
 Horizon is a dose escalation trial at multiple clinical sites in the U.S. that specialize in treating patients with inherited retinal diseases. Horizon includes five dose levels, spanning a range of approximately 80-fold, that are intended to provide us with robust safety and biologic activity data with which to inform the next stages of clinical development. The primary endpoint of the trial is safety, and data released through 24 months after treatment have shown AGTC-501 continues to demonstrate a favorable safety profile and is well tolerated by patients dosed both centrally and peripherally. No serious adverse events related to AGTC-501 have been reported through month 24. In addition to safety, Horizon is evaluating biologic activity by assessing changes in several measures of visual function. There were clinically meaningful improvements in visual sensitivity, as measured by microperimetry, that continued through 24 months after treatment in centrally treated patients. Specifically, a clinically significant treatment effect in visual sensitivity was seen and sustained 24 months after treatment when comparing treated eyes to fellow untreated eyes in this trial, and improvements in visual sensitivity continue to correlate with improvements in retinal structure 24 months after treatment. In addition, improvements in best corrected visual acuity seen 12 months after treatment continue to show evidence of a biological response 24 months after treatment. Collectively, these clinical data are encouraging and continue to inform our clinical development in patients with XLRP. 
 XLRP Horizon Trial Design and Dosing Schedule 
 


Boxed/shaded groups are dose groups moving forward to Skyline and Vista trials. N=29 for all patients dosed and N=20 for centrally dosed patients. 
 
7 

  The Skyline trial (as shown in the figure below) is a 14 patient multi-site, Phase 2 trial in which patients are randomized to either a high dose of AGTC-501 (the dose received by patients in Group 5 of Horizon), or a low dose of AGTC-501 (the dose received by patients in Group 2 of Horizon). 
 


* Sub-retinal injection of AGTC-501 at up to 0.3 mL/eye in the study eye. Patient 14 did not reach Month 3 prior to data analysis. 
 The primary endpoint in the Skyline trial is the proportion of treated eyes with an improvement of 7 decibels (“dB”) or greater in visual sensitivity from baseline in at least 5 loci at 12 months as measured by microperimetry. Secondary endpoints include the proportion of treated eyes with improvements in best corrected visual acuity at twelve months, a patient’s ability to navigate a mobility navigation maze more successfully under varying light and challenge conditions at twelve months, and improvements in retinal structure at twelve months. The Skyline trial is masked in that we, the patients, and the sites do not know which patient is in which dose group or which dose group received the high or low dose. Accordingly, we refer to the two groups as Dose Group A and Dose Group B. We completed enrollment in the Skyline trial in the first quarter of calendar year 2022 and reported 3-month interim results for 13 of the 14 enrolled patients in May 2022. Safety, visual sensitivity, visual acuity, and the mobility maze were the only endpoints evaluated at 3 months. Retinal structure improvements, another important endpoint, was not evaluated as changes in retinal structure are not expected until between 9 and 12 months. 
 Similar to safety results reported for Horizon, safety results to date for the Skyline trial support that AGTC-501 is generally well tolerated and there are no clinically significant safety concerns. There were non-serious ocular adverse events (grade 2) related to the study agent that were similar between the two dose groups and two ocular serious adverse events including an increase in intraocular pressure determined to be related to corticosteroids which has resolved, and one of visual impairment deemed related to the surgical procedure which is resolving. 
 Demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the two dose groups in the Skyline trial. Notably, compared to Horizon, patients in the Skyline trial were younger, with better baseline visual sensitivity and visual acuity. 
 
8 

  Improvements in visual sensitivity, the primary efficacy endpoint in the Skyline trial, were observed in both dose groups at three months and were consistent with patients that were responders from Horizon as shown in the figure below. 
 

We define responders as patients who have at least 5 loci increase by at least 7 dB. The response rate in Dose Group A was 25% (1 of 4 patients, as one of the five patients in this group was unevaluable) and in Dose Group B was 62.5% (5 of 8 patients), representing a clear difference between the two groups. Notably, while we did not observe an increase in visual sensitivity of at least 7 dB in 5 pre-specified loci, as required based on FDA feedback, we did observe an increase in visual sensitivity of at least 7 dB in 9 to 17 loci in the treated area. These responders also had improvements in mean visual sensitivity across the treated region versus the untreated eye per the repeatability coefficient.. The figure below is an example of one patient from the Skyline trial with such improvements in visual sensitivity. 
 


The 13 patients for which data was reported in the Skyline trial had better baseline best corrected visual acuity, a mean of 66.9 ETDRS letters on an eye chart, which correlates to a Snellen visual acuity equivalent of approximately 20/40. We observed a positive trend in visual acuity three months after treatment. However, because patients in the Skyline trial started with better visual acuity than patients in the Horizon trial, we believe that there was less ability for them to improve relative to what we observed in the Horizon trial. 
 In addition, there was a correlation between visual sensitivity improvements and trends for patients able to complete the maze more rapidly and with fewer errors. We are working with the maze vendor on potential 
 
9 

  adjustments to account for the fact that only one eye was treated in this analysis, whereas previous use of the maze has been for patients treated in both eyes. It is possible that the better visual acuity of the patients in the Skyline trial at baseline also affected the interpretation of the maze results. 
 The Skyline trial has a similar design and endpoints to the Vista clinical trial, which is a multi-site, Phase 2/3 clinical trial expected to include approximately 60 patients randomized across three arms: a low-dose group (the 1.2E+11 vg/mL dose from the ongoing Horizon and Skyline trials), a high-dose group (the 1.1E+12 vg/mL dose from the ongoing Horizon and Skyline trials) and an untreated control group. We believe that if the Vista trial has similar outcomes as both the Horizon and the Skyline trials, the body of data will support a BLA submission for AGTC-501.



The primary endpoint will be improvement in visual sensitivity, defined as having at least a 7 dB increase in visual sensitivity in at least 5 pre-specified loci at Month 12. Together with a third-party vendor, we have developed a machine learning algorithm based on the available microperimetry data from Horizon and Skyline expansion trials that, on a patient-by-patient basis, predicts the loci most likely to improve through evaluation of baseline visual sensitivity. Secondary efficacy endpoints in the Vista trial include mean change in visual sensitivity, improvements in visual acuity and performance on the mobility maze as well as structural improvements in retinal health as measured by changes in the ellipsoid zone (the “EZ”), a defined region within the photoreceptor layer of the retina that degenerates over time and is eventually lost in patients with XLRP. Subject to the availability of additional funding, we plan to complete a masked interim analysis, with the interim data expected to be released in the first half of calendar year 2023. We believe that the interim analysis, together with data from the Horizon and Skyline trials, may provide us with the opportunity to discuss with the FDA potential amendments to the Vista trial, if necessary, that may support an earlier BLA submission than we would otherwise anticipate, or optimize the design of the trial. 
 To date, we have released a significant amount of preclinical and clinical data including improvements in visual sensitivity and visual acuity, as well as improvements in retinal health that we believe support both the potential safety and biological activity of AGTC-501. These data include the recent release of the interim data from the ongoing Horizon and Skyline trials. Data from the ongoing Horizon trial show improvements in visual sensitivity as measured by Macular Integrity Assessment (“MAIA”) and continue to correlate with improvements in retinal structure as measured by EZ up to 24 months after treatment. There was moderate correlation 12 months after treatment and substantial correlation 24 months after treatment. 
 Given the efficacy and safety data generated to date, we believe that AGTC-501 is a potential best-in-class product candidate that may provide significant benefits to patients with XLRP, if approved. Subject to the availability of additional funding and any continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect to achieve the following milestones in the XLRP development program: 
 

• | provide 12-month data from the Skyline expansion portion of the Phase 1/2 clinical trial in the first quarter of calendar year 2023; and
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | provide interim Vista trial data in the first half of calendar year 2023.

  AGTC-401 and AGTC-402 for the treatment of ACHM 
 We have been developing two gene therapy product candidates for the treatment of ACHM. The product candidates are designed to use the same engineered AAV vector to insert a stabilized and functional copy of the Cyclic Nucleotide Gated Channel Subunit Beta 3 (CNGB3) gene in the case of AGTC-401 and a stabilized and functional copy of the Cyclic Nucleotide Gated Channel Subunit Alpha 3 (CNGA3) gene in the case of AGTC-402. The product candidates are designed to use the same proprietary cone-specific promoter that was designed to maximize gene expression into a patient’s photoreceptor cells. We chose the promoter based on data from preclinical studies that showed the promoter drove efficient gene expression in all three types of primate cone photoreceptors and restored cone photoreceptor function in dog, mouse and sheep models of ACHM. 
 Clinical development 
 We are currently conducting a Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AGTC-401 in ACHM patients with mutations of the CNGB3 gene (ACHMB3) and a separate Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AGTC-402 in ACHM patients with mutations of the CNGA3 gene (ACHMA3). Each Phase 1/2 clinical trial is being conducted at multiple clinical sites that specialize in inherited retinal diseases. The primary objective of these trials is to identify a well-tolerated dose that provides clinical benefit to patients. To date, we have enrolled a total of 31 adult and pediatric patients into the ACHMB3 trial of AGTC-401 and 24 adult and pediatric patients in the ACHMA3 trial of AGTC-402 and do not plan to enroll any additional patients in either trial. We have data from a portion of the patients in these trials up to 24 months after treatment, including our most recent release in February 2022 of 3-month data for the two highest dose groups of ACHMB3 and ACHMA3 pediatric patients that also included updated adult safety data. These data are consistent with the data previously released in adult and pediatric ACHMB3 and ACHMA3 patients. 
 In the Phase 1/2 dose escalation study of AGTC-401 in ACHMB3 patients, a total of 21 adults were treated over an approximately 80-fold dose range in five groups and a total of 10 pediatric patients were treated at the three highest dose groups. Secondary outcome measures evaluating efficacy were assessed by standard visual function tests, such as perimetry. We defined two pediatric patients (17 and 7 years old) in the 1.1E+12 vg/mL dose group as responders based on improvements in visual sensitivity as measured by the Octopus static perimeter. Therefore, of the three adults and four children (total n=7) in the 1.1E+12 vg/mL dose group, four (>50%) were responders based on improvements in visual sensitivity. These patients also reported improvements in quality of life as measured by a patient reported outcome survey developed specifically for patients with ACHM. 
 The two other pediatric patients in the 1.1E+12 vg/mL dose group and three pediatric patients ages 7 years and younger in the 3.2E+12 vg/mL dose group (total n=5) could not sufficiently concentrate and consistently complete the visual sensitivity testing. Similar to other trials where endpoints are adapted for young children, we plan to work closely with clinicians and regulators to develop potential adaptations for younger patients for visual sensitivity testing. Despite their inability to complete the tests, we received anecdotal feedback from certain patients that indicate improvements in visual sensitivity. Based on the totality of data generated to date, we believe that the 1.1E+12 vg/mL dose has been well tolerated and has potential in both adult and pediatric patients. 
 We also reported updated interim 3-month pediatric data and adult and pediatric safety data for the 24 patients enrolled in the Phase 1/2 study of AGTC-402 targeting CNGA3 mutations in patients with ACHMA3. Data from the five pediatric patients in the two highest dose groups were consistent with previously reported results, indicating no evidence of clinical improvements, and do not support further clinical development. Most patients with CNGA3 mutations express a mutant protein that is not typically found in patients with CNGB3 mutations, which we believe may have impacted the results seen in patients that received AGTC-402. We intend to continue to follow the ACHMA3 patients for long-term safety observations. 
 As previously reported, in both the ACHMB3 and ACHMA3 trials, treatment with the highest dose (3.2 E+12vg/ml) of AGTC-401 and AGTC-402, respectively, led to three cases of severe ocular inflammation in pediatric 
 
11 

  patients, which were reported as Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions, or SUSARs. No new additional SUSARs in any adult or pediatric patients have been reported and the inflammation in all previously reported SUSARs improved with an adjusted steroid regimen. Two SUSARs (ACHMA3) have since fully resolved and one (ACHMB3) continues to improve, with all three patients’ best corrected visual acuity returning to baseline after initial declines in visual acuity were observed following the SUSARs. Importantly, we have not yet observed any comparable inflammation in any of our XLRP clinical trials. 
 We had a collaborative and productive End of Phase 2 (“EOP2”) meeting with the FDA to discuss the potential future development of AGTC-401 and received constructive feedback from the FDA on our proposed primary and secondary endpoints for a Phase 2/3 clinical trial. With respect to the primary endpoint of improvement in visual sensitivity relative to baseline, the FDA reiterated that a 7 dB change in at least 5 pre-specified loci is required. However, they indicated a willingness to review an alternative approach to perimetry from a model used in other trials, which would need to be adapted specifically for ACHMB3. The FDA also indicated that improvements in light discomfort may be an acceptable secondary endpoint in a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of AGTC-401. We are working through the details of our future plan for AGTC-401, but we have paused development activities due to funding constraints. 
 Product Candidate to Treat Advanced Retinal Disease 
 In partnership with Bionic Sight, we provided preclinical and IND application support in Bionic Sight’s development of an optogenetic candidate treatment for individuals with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) who have lost light sensitivity. RP is a large group of inherited retinal disorders in which progressive degeneration of photoreceptors or retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) leads to vision loss that is independent of a patients’ genetic mutation. In Europe and the United States, about 200,000 patients suffer from RP and every year between 15,000 and 20,000 patients with RP suffer vision loss. The clinical manifestations of affected individuals present first as defective dark adaptation or “night blindness,” followed by reduction of peripheral visual fields and, eventually, loss of central vision. While the photoreceptor cell layers of these patients degenerate, the ganglion cell layer remains intact and functional. 
 Optogenetics is a biological technique by which cells are modified to express light-sensitive proteins. When the cells expressing these proteins are activated by light, they produce neural signals, which they can pass on to other neurons. Bionic Sight expresses the optogenetic proteins in the retina’s ganglion cells, allowing them to send neural signals down the optic nerve to neurons in the visual areas of the brain. 
 The candidate treatment currently in clinical development by Bionic Sight is an AAV2 vector, injected intravitreally, that expresses a modified optogenetic gene, ChronosFP, in the retinal ganglion cells. The ChronosFP protein that is expressed is believed to have a more dynamic range of sensitivity and responsiveness than other optogenetic proteins being developed. In conjunction with the gene therapy treatment, Bionic Sight is developing a wearable prosthetic device that uses a novel algorithm to provide light signals to the retinal ganglion cells in a pattern similar to that produced by normal photoreceptor cells, which gives the treatment the potential to produce images the brain can recognize and may significantly enhance vision in patients receiving the optogenetic treatment. The IND for the program was successfully cleared by the FDA, and Bionic Sight initiated a Phase 1/2 clinical trial to test safety and potential efficacy of the treatment. In March 2021, Bionic Sight, which has responsibility for conducting the clinical trial, reported promising results in its first two cohorts of patients. Bionic Sight reported that the treated patients, all of whom have complete or near-complete blindness, can now see light and motion, and, in two cases, can detect the direction of motion. Based on this report the product appears to be safe and well tolerated and Bionic Sight is continuing to enroll patients at the highest dose levels. We currently have no financial obligations to Bionic Sight under the related collaboration agreement.

  Preclinical Pipeline Programs 
 We believe that our advanced gene therapy platform will enable us to develop and test new AAV vectors that carry gene sequences both for other inherited diseases in ophthalmology (it is estimated that approximately 290 genes causing inherited retinal disease have been identified), as well as larger ocular indications for which intervention at a specific target gene or pathway has been clearly identified. By leveraging the existing work on our lead programs and further deployment of technology advances, we believe we can reduce the need for early research work. In this way, we anticipate being able to move products efficiently through preclinical studies thereby enabling us to partner these programs or move them into clinical development on our own. Our preclinical programs are summarized below. 
 Dry AMD 
 An estimated 15 million people in North America have AMD, of which 85-90 percent are diagnosed with the non-exudative dry form. This medical condition may result in blurred or no vision in the center of the visual field, which can make it hard to recognize faces, read, drive and perform daily activities. Progression to geographic atrophy (or wet AMD) leads to serious risk of blindness. Dysregulated complement pathway is considered an important factor in the disease etiology, and a component of the alternative complement pathway CFH, is known to have a strong genetic risk association with AMD. Individuals with mutations in CFH have an increased risk of developing AMD that is six times greater than those who do not have such mutation. Preclinical data in relevant animal models support the approach of CFH gene augmentation as a potential therapeutic strategy for AMD. The full length CFH gene is too large to fit into a single AAV, and so in this case, we adopted a different approach and designed multiple engineered truncated forms, testing these in combination with different promoters to determine if they retain activity. From these studies, we identified a preferred construct that retains functionality both in vitro and in vivo. For example, we have shown that the construct targets the complement cascade in the retina of a cfh knockout mouse model and have performed expression studies in NHP retina models. This program is currently in IND-enabling safety and biodistribution studies and any future development is subject to the availability of additional funding. 
 Frontotemporal dementia (FTD) 
 FTD is a degenerative brain disorder, second only to Alzheimer’s disease in terms of prevalence and incidence on the dementia spectrum. Similar to Alzheimer’s Disease, the prevalence of FTD is on the rise due to the aging population, and there are currently no approved treatments for FTD. Mutations in the progranulin gene are one of the three main genetic causes of FTD, representing approximately 20% of familial FTD, and accounting for 7,500 to 15,000 cases in the US. Progranulin (PGRN) is a glycoprotein that undergoes protease enzyme-dependent cleavage into smaller subunits called granulins, and these granulins may play a key role in inflammation, wound repair, tumorigenesis and sexual differentiation. PGRN is critical in neurons for proper trafficking and function of lysosomal enzymes such as ß-glucocerebrosidase and cathepsin D. PGRN haploinsufficiency (the loss of gene expression from one allele, resulting in reduced levels) is causally connected to FTD, and PGRN-deficient neurons are prone to accumulation of the protein TDP-43, which is thought to then lead to neurodegeneration. We are seeking to the augment PGRN levels in order to restore its physiological balance, and this approach is supported by several studies in PGRN-deficient mouse models, where both the pathological and behavioral changes that occur as a result of PGRN loss have been rescued. Following extensive preclinical analysis exploring different capsid, promoter and transgene combinations, we have devised a novel AAV construct to enhance PGRN expression in the brain following direct vector administration into the cerebrospinal fluid. We measured in dosed NHPs the cerebrospinal fluid levels of PGRN and confirmed that projected therapeutic levels are achievable within a defined dose range without affecting PGRN levels in plasma. This program is currently in IND-enabling safety and biodistribution studies and any future development is subject to the availability of additional funding.

  Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) 
 ALS (Lou Gehrig’s disease) is an autosomal dominant, fatal, adult-onset disease with no truly effective therapy. It is the most common adult-onset motor neuron disease, with approximately 30,000 cases in the US, and is characterized by upper and lower motor neuron degeneration. Early symptoms are of muscle weakness that progresses and then ultimately results in respiratory failure, with death usually occurring within 3 to 5 years of first symptoms. There are both sporadic (approximately 90%) and familial (approximately 10%) forms of the disease, with the most common genetic cause linked to the C9orf72 gene, representing 30-40% of cases. C9orf72 mutations are also present in FTD. C9orf72 gene six nucleotide repeat expansions can result in both gain-of-toxicity and loss-of-function, both of which are believed to contribute to the pathogenesis in C9orf72-related disease. Targeting of such repeat sequences with antisense oligonucleotides or artificial microRNAs, for example, has been shown to reduce the accumulation of intra-nuclear transcripts. We are working on a novel integrated therapeutic approach that we believe has the potential to fully address all of the cellular deficits associated with the mutations. Currently we are identifying the optimal microRNAs (knockdown of gain-of-toxicity) and functional C9orf72 gene product (replace) combination to develop therapeutic AAV that addresses all aspects of the disease-causing mutation, which work will continue subject to the availability of additional funding. 
 Strategic collaborations 
 We have formed strategic alliances in which both parties contribute expertise to enable the discovery and development of potential gene therapy product candidates. To access the substantial funding and other resources required to develop and commercialize gene therapy products, we intend to seek additional opportunities to form strategic alliances with collaborators who can augment our industry-leading gene therapy expertise. 
 On October 1, 2019, we entered a strategic collaboration with Otonomy, a San Diego based biopharmaceutical company focused on neurotology. We plan to work with Otonomy to develop and commercialize gene therapy products for genetic forms of hearing loss with an initial focus on GJB2, which is the most common cause of congenital hearing loss. Under the collaboration agreement, the parties began equally sharing the program costs and any proceeds from potential licensing transactions in January 2020 and can include additional genetic hearing loss targets in the future. Effective January 1, 2022, we amended the Otonomy collaboration agreement to increase Otonomy’s responsibility for the overall development and commercialization of the program, which resulted in (i) a reduction in our share of future product development costs and (ii) our potential receipt of future payments, and royalties on any product sales in lieu of equal sharing of any potential profits or proceeds related to the program. 
 On February 2, 2017, we entered into a strategic research and development collaboration agreement with Bionic Sight to develop therapies for patients with visual deficits and blindness due to retinal disease. Through the AGTC-Bionic Sight collaboration, the companies are seeking to develop a new optogenetic therapy that leverages our deep experience in gene therapy and ophthalmology and Bionic Sight’s innovative neuro-prosthetic device and algorithm for retinal coding. 
 Under the terms of the agreement, we provided cash investment and in-kind support in the form of ongoing research and development efforts focused activities required to file an IND for the selected product candidate and to achieve successful clearance by a relevant Institutional Review Board (IRB). Our current equity ownership in Bionic Sight is approximately 15.2%. 
 Bionic Sight is responsible for conducting the Phase 1/2 clinical trial, which enrolled its first patient in March 2020, and we have no further obligations under the agreement. Upon completion of the trial or the achievement of certain pre-agreed definitions of potential efficacy, we have an exclusive option to negotiate to license or partner the program. If we and Bionic Sight are not able to reach agreement after a defined timeframe, Bionic Sight may negotiate with third parties but only on terms that are no more favorable to the third party than last offered by us without our consent.

  In April 2021, we announced a licensing agreement with TeamedOn International, Inc., a biotechnology company dedicated to advancing gene therapies for rare diseases, including ophthalmic indications, to advance gene therapy to treat X-linked retinoschisis, or XLRS, an inherited disease that causes loss of vision due to degeneration of the retina in males. Under the terms of the agreement, we will provide TeamedOn with the clinical trial material, preclinical and clinical data generated for the development of our investigational intravitreal gene therapy candidate, rAAV2tYF-CB-hRS1. We previously demonstrated a reasonable safety profile for our XLRS program but discontinued development in 2018 because defined efficacy endpoints were not met using intravitreal injection. The goal of the licensing agreement is to evaluate whether a sub-retinal approach to administering the therapy will have an increased likelihood for producing detectable biological activity in patients with XLRS. TeamedOn has prepared to reinitiate clinical development of the program and we will be eligible to receive milestones and royalties based on clinical progress. 
 In April 2021, we announced a licensing agreement to provide its proprietary cone specific promoter technology to SparingVision SAS, a genomic medicine company developing vision saving treatments for ocular diseases. Our proprietary PR1.7 cone specific promoter helps drive increased gene expression in cone photoreceptors only, thereby allowing enhanced targeting of gene therapies for indications in which the gene defect is cone specific and limiting expression of the gene in other cells that could be undesirable. Under the terms of the agreement, SparingVision SAS receives nonexclusive rights to our PR1.7 promoter for use in the development of two non-competing products with an opportunity to obtain rights to use the promoter for one additional product in the future. We received an upfront fee and are eligible to receive milestone payments for successful clinical development and royalties on future sales on a per product basis (if any products are approved). 
 Our relationship with the University of Florida 
 All of our scientific founders spent part of their careers at the University of Florida, or UF, and two are still UF faculty members. Since our inception we have licensed significant technology from and funded research at multiple labs at UF. As of July 31, 2022, we had four agreements wherein we licensed seven U.S. patents and multiple pending applications covering inventions made at UF. UF has multiple capabilities in genetic cloning, gene therapy manufacturing, novel capsid identification, animal model development and facilities for both small and large animal testing and, in certain instances, we have benefited from the ability to conduct important research at UF without having to expand in-house facilities and personnel. 
 In May 2013, we and UF were jointly awarded an $8.3 million grant from the National Eye Institute to support development of our ACHM CNGB3 product candidate, with Dr. William Hauswirth, one of our scientific founders, a Professor and holder of the Rybaczki-Bullard Chair in the Department of Ophthalmology at UF, as principal investigator. As of June 30, 2021, we have received payments in the aggregate amount of $3.4 million under this grant. 
 Our relationships with patient advocacy groups and academic centers 
 We have long believed that when developing product candidates to treat orphan indications it is important to form strong relationships with patient advocacy groups, and we have done this successfully with the Foundation Fighting Blindness, Fighting Blindness Canada and other organizations that are well known for their advocacy of patients’ interests in obtaining diagnosis, developing treatments and providing for reimbursement. More importantly, these organizations have been instrumental in assisting us in forming ties with disease experts, recruiting patients into clinical trials and helping us to understand the needs, wants and concerns of patients. We also have relationships with other advocacy organizations such as Achroma Corp., the BCM Family Foundation, MOMS For Sight, Curing Retinal Blindness Foundation, Hope In Focus, National Organization for Rare Disorders, Italian Achromatopsia Association (IAA), and the Alliance for Regenerative Medicine. 
 In order to gain further patient specific insights to support our later stage ophthalmology clinical development, we have formed a Patient Advisory Council comprised of individuals with inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) and 
 
15 

  members from the global community of organizations that represent them. AGTC’s Patient Advisory Council are initially focused on providing input on XLRP clinical trial patient experiences, processes, recruitment, and enrollment. In addition, the council will serve as consultants on ongoing and future clinical trial activities, including protocol design, patient registries, development of patient outreach and education materials, and will liaise with AGTC’s Scientific Advisory Board and the broader healthcare providing community. In addition, we have formed strong relationships with key academic centers across the United States that have core competencies in gene therapy, orphan ophthalmology AMD and other disease areas, such as CNS and otology. These centers conduct sponsored research, act as advisors and collaborate with us on grant proposals. Since our inception, we have been awarded a variety of grant funding, either independently or with our collaborators. This funding has provided peer-reviewed scientific validation of our programs and has facilitated critical early-stage research for our lead product candidates. 
 Intellectual property 
 We strive to protect and enhance the proprietary technology, inventions and improvements that are commercially important to the development of our business, including seeking, maintaining and defending patent rights, whether developed internally or in-licensed from third parties, and seeking patent term extensions where available. We also rely on trade secrets relating to our proprietary technology platform, know-how, continuing technological innovation and in-licensing opportunities to develop, strengthen and maintain our proprietary position in the gene therapy field that may be important for the development of our business. In addition to intellectual property and trade secrets, when possible, we also will rely on regulatory protection afforded through orphan drug designations, data exclusivity and market exclusivity for our product candidates. 
 Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and other proprietary protection for commercially important technology, inventions and know-how related to our business; defend and enforce our patents; preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets; and operate without infringing valid and enforceable patents and proprietary rights of third parties. Our ability to stop third parties from making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell or importing our product candidates may depend on the extent to which we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities. With respect to both in-licensed and company-owned intellectual property, we cannot be sure that patents will be granted with respect to any of our pending patent applications or with respect to any patent applications filed by us in the future, nor can we be sure that any of our existing patents or any patents that may be granted to us in the future will be commercially useful in protecting our commercial product candidates and methods of manufacturing the same. 
 We have developed or in-licensed numerous patents and patent applications and possess substantial know-how and trade secrets relating to the development, commercialization and manufacture of gene therapy product candidates. Our proprietary intellectual property, including patent and non-patent intellectual property, is generally directed to, for example, certain genes and promoters, methods of transferring genetic material into cells, processes to manufacture our AAV-based product candidates and other proprietary technologies and processes related to our lead product candidates. 
 As of July 31, 2022, our patent portfolio included 119 patents and patent applications that we owned and 69 patents and patent applications that we have exclusively licensed. More specifically, as of such date, we owned 3 U.S. patents, 12 pending U.S. patent applications, 49 foreign patents and 55 foreign patent applications. As of July 31, 2022, we in-licensed 7 U.S. patents, 2 pending U.S. patent applications, 58 foreign patents and 2 pending foreign patent applications. Of the patents and patent applications that we owned or in-licensed, 37 covered methods to manufacture AAV vectors, the longest lived and most significant of which is expected to expire in 2029. In October 2017, we were awarded U.S. Patent Number 9,783,826 directed to methods of producing recombinant AAV viral particles using suspension BHK cells. This patent extends the protection on our AAV manufacturing platform from 2025 to 2029. 
 Our objective is to continue to expand our portfolio of patents and patent applications in order to protect our gene therapy product candidates and AAV manufacturing process. Our owned and in-licensed patent portfolio 
 
16 

  includes, but is not limited to, patents and patent applications directed to our XLRP and ACHM programs, as well as our foundational AAV production platform. See also “License agreements.” 
 In addition to the above, we have established expertise and development capabilities focused in the areas of preclinical research and development, manufacturing and manufacturing process scale-up, quality control, quality assurance, regulatory affairs and clinical trial design and implementation. We believe that our focus and expertise will help us develop product candidates based on our proprietary intellectual property and to expand our intellectual property portfolio. 
 The term of individual patents depends on the legal term of the patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, the patent term is 20 years from the date of filing the non-provisional application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the United States Patent and Trademark Office in granting a patent or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier-filed patent. The issued patents that are material to our business are expected to expire on various dates from 2022 to 2029. 
 The term of a patent that covers an FDA-approved drug may also be eligible for patent term extension, which permits patent term restoration of a U.S. patent as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review. A patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval and only one patent per approved drug may be extended. Moreover, a patent can only be extended once, and thus, if a single patent is applicable to multiple product candidates, it can only be extended based on one product candidate. Similar provisions are available in Europe and other foreign jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. When possible, depending upon the length of clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of a BLA, we expect to apply for patent term extensions for patents covering our product candidates and their methods of use. 
 We may rely, in some circumstances, on trade secrets to protect our technology. However, trade secrets can be difficult to protect. We seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, scientific advisors and contractors. We also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and physical and electronic security of our information technology systems. While we have confidence in these individuals, organizations and systems, agreements or security measures may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our consultants, contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 License agreements 
 We have rights to use and exploit multiple technologies disclosed in issued and pending patents under licenses from other entities. We consider the commercial terms of these licenses, which provide for modest milestone and royalty payments, and their provisions regarding diligence, insurance, indemnification and other similar matters, to be reasonable and customary for our industry. 
 Information about our principal licenses is set forth below. 
 
17 

  The University of Florida 
 As of July 31, 2022, we had four agreements with the University of Florida Research Foundation, or UFRF, an affiliate of the University of Florida, or UF, of which the principal licenses are as follows: 

• | A joint license from UFRF and Johns Hopkins University, or JHU, signed in October 2003 related to a particular HSV construct and various compositions thereof. We had an exclusive license in all fields of use. The longest-lived patent covered by this license expired on September 23, 2022, and this license is now terminated.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Under the terms of this license, we made cash and stock-based up-front payments to UFRF and JHU, and were required to make payments ranging from the mid-five figures to the low-six figures based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any product candidates covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. We were also required to pay a royalty on net sales of product candidates covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low-single digits. We made annual maintenance payments in the low four figures under this license agreement, which payments would have been credited against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis. 
 

• | Two licenses from UFRF, signed in September and November 2012, respectively, relate to the use of engineered AAV capsids. We have an exclusive license to the patents covered by the November 2012 license in the fields of ACHM, XLRS and XLRP and a semi-exclusive license in all other fields of orphan ophthalmology. We have a non-exclusive license in all fields of use with respect to the patents covered by the September 2012 license. Currently, these patents are most useful for our ACHM and XLRP programs, but could be important for treating a wide variety of diseases as the engineered capsids have been shown to be able to enter cells more effectively than standard AAV capsids.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Under the terms of these licenses, we made cash up-front payments to UFRF and are required to make payments ranging from the mid-five figures to the low-six figures based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any product candidates covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. Assuming that we meet each of the specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones not more than once for each product candidate, the maximum aggregate milestone payments payable under these licenses with respect to any individual product that we commercialize will be $0.6 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low-single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under these agreements, and we will be required to pay a percentage of such license income in the mid-single digits. We are required to make annual maintenance payments in the mid four figures under these licenses, which payments are creditable against royalty payments on a year-by-year basis. 
 On April 20, 2020, we amended the capsid license to add further rights to these licenses in exchange for a non-exclusive grant-back of the intellectual property for use by UF investigators to enable research on four gene targets that are not of strategic interest to us. In exchange, we will receive pre-defined portion of any proceeds received any UFRF if they enter into a license agreement for these gene targets with a third party. Further, UFRF agrees that it will notify us of potential license opportunities any of the four gene targets, so long as not otherwise restricted by confidentiality agreements with third parties. 
 These licenses will continue until the expiration of all of the patents subject to the licenses, provided or, if later, a date specified in the license. Additionally, UFRF may terminate this license upon certain breaches by us of the terms of the licenses and we may terminate the licenses at any time by submitting written notice to UFRF. 
 The longest-lived patent covered by these licenses is expected to expire in 2029. There are also patent applications pending under these licenses. 
 

• | An Evaluation and License Agreement from UFRF, signed in May 2019, relates to the use of engineered AAV capsids in the field of otology. Under the terms of the agreement, we undertook the evaluation of
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



18 

  
multiple promising capsid candidates for potential application in otology. In December 2019, we entered into a non-exclusive license agreement for three capsids that showed the most potential to support therapeutic development. Under the terms of the license agreement, we made a cash up-front payments to UFRF and will be required to make payments ranging from the mid-five figures to the low-six figures based upon development, regulatory and commercial milestones for any product candidates covered by the in-licensed intellectual property. Assuming that we meet each of the specified development, regulatory and commercial milestones not more than once for each product candidate, the maximum aggregate milestone payments payable under these licenses with respect to any individual product that we commercialize will be $0.25 million. We will also be required to pay a royalty on net sales of products covered by the in-licensed intellectual property in the low-single digits. We have the right to sublicense our rights under these agreements, and we will be required to pay a percentage of such license income in the mid-single digits. We are required to make annual maintenance payments in the low four figures under these licenses until such time as royalties on commercial sales exceeds these amounts.

Competition 
 Specific Competition for Our Lead Programs 
 For XLRP, 4D Molecular Therapeutics, MeiraGTx and Biogen are developing AAV-based gene therapies and MeiraGTx also has competing programs in ACHMB3 and ACHMA3. We believe that these companies and others could be planning to initiate clinical trials in the future that have the potential to be competitive with our programs. We further believe that the key competitive factors that will affect the success of our product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience of administration and delivery, price, the level of generic competition, market exclusivity and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. 
General Competition in the Gene Therapy Space 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including the gene therapy field, are characterized by intense and rapidly changing competition to develop new technologies and proprietary products, and any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will have to compete with existing therapies and new therapies that may become available in the future. While we believe that our proprietary technology estate and scientific expertise in the gene therapy field provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including larger and better-funded pharmaceutical, specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions that may develop potentially competitive products or technologies. 
 Currently there are no approved products for any of our lead orphan ophthalmology indications of ACHM and XLRP. We are aware of a number of companies focused on developing gene therapies in various indications, including Adverum Biotechnologies Inc., Akous, Apic Bio, Inc., Axovant-now Sio Gene Therapies, bluebird bio, Inc., Decibel Therapeutics, 4D Molecular Therapeutics, GenSight Biologics S.A., MeiraGTx Limited (partnered with Janssen Pharmaceuticals), ProQR Therapeutics N.V., REGENXBIO Inc., the Roche Group (Spark Therapeutics), Ultragenyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and uniQure N.V., as well as several companies addressing other methods for modifying genes and regulating gene expression. Any advances in gene therapy technology made by a competitor may be used to develop therapies that could compete against any of our product candidates. 
Government Regulation 
 Biological products, including gene therapy products, are subject to regulation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FD&C Act, and the Public Health Service Act, or PHS Act, and other federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations. Both the FD&C Act and the PHS Act and their corresponding regulations 
 
19 

  govern, among other things, the testing, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, labeling, packaging, storage, recordkeeping, distribution, reporting, advertising and other promotional practices involving biological products. Before clinical testing of biological products may begin, we must submit an IND which must go into effect, and each clinical trial protocol for a gene therapy product candidate is reviewed by the FDA. FDA approval of a BLA also must be obtained before marketing of biological products in the United States. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources and we may not be able to obtain the required regulatory approvals. 
 Within the FDA, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, or CBER, regulates gene therapy products, and our communication is specifically with the Office of Tissues and Advanced Therapeutics within CBER. CBER works closely with the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, both of which may engage in a public discussion of scientific, safety, ethical and societal issues related to proposed and ongoing gene therapy protocols. The FDA and the NIH have published guidance documents with respect to the development and submission of gene therapy protocols. The NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, or the RAC, has long played an active role in advising the NIH director on gene therapy and required initial registration of gene therapy protocols in addition to FDA IND requirements; however, in August 2018 the NIH revised the role of the RAC and amended its gene therapy research guidelines to delete the NIH protocol registration submission and reporting requirements, which were duplicative of the existing FDA regulatory requirements. The FDA has also published guidance documents related to, among other things, gene therapy products in general, their preclinical assessment, observing subjects involved in gene therapy studies for delayed adverse events, potency testing, and chemistry, manufacturing and control information in gene therapy INDs, and gene therapy products for rare diseases and retinal disorders. The FDA’s guidance for Human Gene Therapy for Retinal Disorders, which was finalized in January 2020, provides recommendations for product development, preclinical testing and clinical trial design for these products. The FDA also issued draft guidance in January 2021 for sponsors developing human gene therapy for neurodegenerative diseases. 
 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA issued guidance in January 2021 to sponsors of gene therapy products (licensed and investigational) which provides risk-based recommendations to minimize potential transmission of the novel coronavirus during manufacturing. This guidance will remain in effect for as long as the Department of Health and Human Services keeps the COVID-19 Public Health Emergency in effect. The Public Health Emergency went into effect January 27, 2020 and has been renewed approximately every ninety (90) days since that date. The Public Health Emergency was again renewed July 15, 2022 for ninety (90) days. 
 Ethical, social and legal concerns about gene therapy, genetic testing and genetic research have led to the enactment of legislation such as the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act of 2008 and could result in additional regulations restricting or prohibiting the processes we may use. Federal and state agencies, congressional committees and foreign governments have expressed interest in further regulating biotechnology. More restrictive regulations or claims that our product candidates are unsafe or pose a hazard could prevent us from commercializing any product candidates. New government requirements may be established that could delay or prevent regulatory approval of our product candidates under development. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, regulations, policies or guidance changed, or interpretations by agencies or courts changed, or what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. 
 Recent developments in regulation of gene therapy 
 In August 2017, Kymriah (tisagenlecleucel) became the first gene therapy product approved by the FDA. It was followed by additional gene therapy product approvals, including Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) in December 2017. The Luxturna approval is of relevance to us because it is a subretinally administered AAV vector that treats patients with a rare form of inherited vision loss. It is also the first FDA-approved gene therapy that targets a disease caused by mutations in a specific gene. In 2021, the FDA approved Abecma (idecabtagene 
 
20 

  vicleucel), a cell-based gene therapy, for the treatment of multiple myeloma in March and BREYANZI (lisocabtagene maraleucel), another cell-based gene therapy, for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma in February. In April 2022, Yescarta (axicabtagene ciloleucel) was approved for the treatment of adult patients with large B-cell lymphoma. In August 2022, the FDA approved bluebird bio Inc’s cell-based gene therapy Zynteglo for the treatment of adult and pediatric patients with beta-thalassemia who require regular red blood transfusions. 
 The FDA’s acknowledged recognition of the promise of gene therapy and their expectation that the field will continue to expand has led it to take additional steps to support the advancement of gene therapy products. In January 2020, the FDA finalized six gene therapy guidance documents, which address manufacturing and clinical development. One guidance document provides the FDA’s recommendations for gene therapy product development and clinical trial design specifically for retinal disorders. Our review of the FDA’s recommendations found that we are aligned with the agency’s approach to product development, and we see opportunities to advance our programs as anticipated following the collection of appropriate safety and efficacy data. 
 In Europe, eleven gene therapy products have been approved by the European Medicines Agency, or the EMA. In 2012, the EMA approved a gene therapy product called Glybera, which was the first gene therapy product approved by regulatory authorities anywhere in the Western world. The marketing authorization for Glybera has since expired following the marketing authorization holder’s decision not to apply for renewal. Most recently, Abecma became the eleventh gene therapy product approved by the EMA. 
 United States biological products development process 
 The process required by the FDA before a biological product candidate may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
 

• | completion of nonclinical laboratory tests and animal studies according to applicable good laboratory practices, or GLP, requirements and applicable requirements for the humane use of laboratory animals or other applicable regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials according to good clinical practice, or GCP, standards and IND and human subject protection regulations, and requirements to ensure the privacy and confidentiality of human research subjects and their health information, to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed biological product candidate for its intended use;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | validation of the biological product candidate manufacturing and control processes;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of a Biologics License Application, or BLA, for marketing approval that includes substantial evidence of safety, purity and potency from results of nonclinical testing and clinical trials;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities where the biological product candidate is produced to assess compliance with GMP requirements, to ensure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the biological product candidate’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | potential FDA audit of the nonclinical and clinical trial sites that generated the data in support of the BLA; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval, or licensure, of the BLA prior to any commercial marketing or sale of the product candidate in the United States.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



21 

  Before testing any biological product candidate, including a gene therapy product candidate, in humans, the product candidate enters the preclinical testing stage. Preclinical tests, also referred to as nonclinical studies, include laboratory evaluations of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess the potential safety and activity of the product candidate. The conduct of the preclinical tests must comply with federal regulations and requirements including applicable GLP requirements. 
 Sponsors or institutions receiving NIH funding are responsible for compliance with the NIH Guidelines for Research Involving Recombinant or Synthetic Nucleic Acid Molecules, or the NIH Guidelines. However, many companies and other institutions not otherwise subject to the NIH Guidelines voluntarily follow them. The oversight bodies at the clinical site(s) (Institutional Review Board (IRB) and Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC)) are responsible for determining whether or not the clinical study may be conducted there. 
 The clinical trial sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical tests, together with manufacturing information, analytical data, any available clinical data or literature and a proposed clinical protocol, to the FDA as part of the IND. Some preclinical testing may continue even after the IND is submitted. The IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, although IND sponsors generally wait until the FDA affirmatively provides notice that the agency has no issues with the IND. Under the FD&C Act, the FDA has the authority to prohibit a sponsor from conducting a clinical trial, referred to as a clinical hold (or a partial clinical hold), if the investigational product poses an unreasonable risk to the safety of trial subjects, taking into account the qualifications of the clinical investigators, information about the drug, the design of the clinical investigation, the condition for which the drug is to be investigated, and the health status of the subjects involved, or for any other reason the FDA has established by regulation, which are numerous and include, for example, deficiencies in study design or insufficient information to assess the risks to the subjects of a proposed study. If the FDA places the clinical trial on clinical hold within the 30-day time period after submission of an IND, the IND sponsor must address the FDA’s concerns and the FDA must lift the clinical hold before the clinical trial can begin. With gene therapy protocols, the FDA may seek advice from the FDA’s Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee at any time on data, including preclinical data, related to the safety, effectiveness, and appropriate use of gene transfer therapies. This Advisory Committee consists of members selected by the FDA Commissioner considered to be authorities knowledgeable in the fields of gene therapies and related specialties. If the FDA recommends public review of the protocol or seeks comments from the Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapies Advisory Committee, initiation of the clinical trial could be delayed. The FDA may also impose a clinical hold at any time during the conduct of a clinical trial due to, for example, new safety concerns, another drug under investigation or approved for the same indication and available to the same patient population has demonstrated a better potential benefit/risk balance, or one or more adequate and well-controlled studies strongly suggest the lack of effectiveness. A trial on clinical hold may be initiated or continued when the FDA lifts the hold in writing and then only under terms specified by the FDA. Accordingly, we cannot be sure that submission of an IND will result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to begin, or that, once begun, issues will not arise that would lead to the suspension or termination of such trials. 
 Clinical trials in general involve the administration of the biological product candidate to healthy volunteers or patients under the supervision of qualified investigators, generally physicians not employed by or under the trial sponsor’s control. Gene therapy clinical trials are not administered to healthy volunteers. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the clinical trial, dosing procedures, subject selection and exclusion criteria, and the parameters to be used to monitor subject safety, including rules that ensure a clinical trial will be stopped if certain adverse events occur. Each protocol and any amendments to the protocol must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. Clinical trials must be conducted and monitored in accordance with the GCP regulations and standards, human subject protection requirements, and the FDA’s investigational new drug requirements, including the requirement that all research subjects provide informed consent. Further, each clinical trial must be reviewed and approved by an independent institutional review board, or IRB, at or servicing each institution at which the clinical trial will be conducted. An IRB is charged with protecting the welfare and rights of trial participants and considers such items as whether the risks to individuals participating in the clinical trials are minimized and are reasonable in relation to anticipated benefits. The IRB 
 
22 

  also approves the form and content of the informed consent that must be signed by each clinical trial subject or his or her legal representative and must monitor the clinical trial until completed. Clinical trials also must be reviewed by an institutional biosafety committee, or IBC, a local institutional committee that reviews and oversees basic and clinical research conducted at that institution. The IBC assesses the safety of the research and identifies any potential risk to public health or the environment. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases that may overlap, be combined, or be bifurcated into two parts: 
 

• | Phase 1. The biological product candidate is initially introduced into healthy human subjects (in non-gene therapy trials) and tested for safety. In the case of some product candidates for severe or life-threatening diseases, especially when the product candidate may be too inherently toxic to ethically administer to healthy volunteers, the initial human testing is often conducted in patients.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2. The biological product candidate is evaluated in a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product candidate for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance, optimal dosage and dosing schedule.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 3. Clinical trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage, clinical efficacy, potency and safety in an expanded patient population at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites. These clinical trials are intended to establish the overall risk/benefit ratio of the product candidate and provide an adequate basis for product approval and labeling.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Post-approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, may be required as a condition of approval or may be recommended after initial marketing approval. These clinical trials are used to gain additional experience from the treatment of patients in the intended therapeutic indication, particularly for long-term safety follow-up. Depending on the type of product and mechanism of action, the FDA may recommend that sponsors observe subjects for potential gene therapy-related delayed adverse events as part of a long-term follow up before licensure, which may include annual examinations and/or annual queries, either in person or by questionnaire, of trial subjects. The FDA may recommend the establishment of a patient registry after licensure specifically to collect adverse event data from gene therapy patients. 
 During all phases of clinical development, regulatory agencies require extensive monitoring and auditing of all clinical activities, clinical data, and clinical trial investigators. Annual progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted to the FDA. Written IND safety reports must be promptly submitted to the FDA, which must include information about any serious and unexpected suspected adverse reactions, any findings from other trials, tests in laboratory animals or in vitro testing that suggest a significant risk for human subjects, and any clinically important increase in the rate of a serious suspected adverse reaction over that listed in the protocol or investigator brochure. The sponsor must submit an IND safety report within 15 calendar days after the sponsor determines that the information qualifies for reporting. The sponsor also must notify the FDA of any unexpected fatal or life-threatening suspected adverse reaction within seven calendar days after the sponsor’s initial receipt of the information. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, if at all. The FDA or the sponsor, or its data safety monitoring board may suspend a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the biological product candidate has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Human gene therapy products are a new category of therapeutics. Although the FDA has approved five gene therapy products and two cell-based gene therapy products in the United States, gene therapy remains a relatively new and expanding area of novel therapeutic interventions. Consequently, there can be no certainty as to the length of the trial period, the number of patients the FDA will require to be enrolled in the trials in order to establish the safety, efficacy, purity and potency of human gene therapy products, or that the data generated in 
 
23 

  these trials will be acceptable to the FDA to support marketing approval. Over the last several years the FDA has issued helpful guidance on development of gene therapy products and in January 2020 finalized a guidance for gene therapy products for rare diseases in which the FDA encourages sponsors to communicate with the FDA in the early stages of development as well as throughout the development and clinical study process. This guidance provides the FDA’s recommendations for manufacturing, preclinical and clinical trial design issues for all phases of the clinical development program. 
 Concurrent with clinical trials, companies usually complete additional animal studies and must also develop additional information about the physical characteristics of the biological product candidate as well as finalize a process for manufacturing the product candidate in commercial quantities in accordance with GMP requirements. To help reduce the risk of the introduction of adventitious agents with the use of biological products, the PHS Act emphasizes the importance of manufacturing control for products whose attributes cannot be precisely defined. The manufacturing process must be capable of consistently producing quality batches of the product candidate and, among other things, the sponsor must develop methods for testing the identity, strength, quality, potency and purity of the final biological product. Additionally, appropriate packaging must be selected and tested, and stability studies must be conducted to demonstrate that the biological product candidate does not undergo unacceptable deterioration over its shelf life. 
 In January 2021, the FDA issued final guidance with recommendations regarding the design of long-term follow-up studies for the collection of data on delayed adverse events following the administration of an investigational gene therapy products. The FDA expects these long-term studies to extend beyond the scheduled observations and active follow-up period of a clinical trial and be in place after approval of a BLA. This guidance finalized the draft guidance of the same title issued in July 2018 and supersedes the FDA guidance titled “Gene Therapy Clinical Trials – Observing Subjects for Delayed Adverse Events” dated November 2006. The final guidance is also intended to supplement the guidance titled “Testing of Retroviral Vector-Based Human Gene Therapy Products for Replication Competent Retrovirus during Product Manufacture and Patient Follow-Up,” which was issued in January 2020. 
 United States review and approval processes 
 After the completion of clinical trials of a biological product candidate, FDA approval of a BLA must be obtained before commercial marketing of the biological product candidate. The BLA must include results of laboratory, animal and human studies, information on the manufacture and composition of the product candidate, proposed labeling and other relevant information. In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act, or PREA, a BLA or supplement to a BLA must contain data to assess the safety and effectiveness of the biological product candidate for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product candidate is safe and effective. The FDA may grant deferrals for submission of data or full or partial waivers. Unless otherwise required by regulation, PREA does not apply to any biological product candidate for an indication for which orphan designation has been granted. The testing and approval processes require substantial time and effort and there can be no assurance that the FDA will accept the BLA for filing and, even if filed, that any approval will be granted on a timely basis, if at all. 
 Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, as amended, each BLA submitted to the FDA must be accompanied by a user fee. The FDA adjusts the PDUFA user fees on an annual basis. According to the FDA’s fee schedule, effective October 1, 2021 and through September 30, 2022, the user fee for an application requiring clinical data, such as a BLA, will be $3,117,218. PDUFA also imposes an annual prescription drug program fee ($369,413 effective on October 1, 2021) for certain approved products. Fee waivers or reductions are available in certain circumstances, including a waiver of the application fee for the first application filed by a small business. Importantly for us, no user fees are assessed on BLAs for product candidates designated as orphan drugs, unless the product candidate also includes a non-orphan indication. 
 
24 

  Within 60 days following submission of a BLA, the FDA conducts a review to determine if it is substantially complete before the agency accepts it for filing. The FDA may refuse to file any BLA that it determines is incomplete or not properly reviewable at the time of submission and may request additional information. In this event, the BLA must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application also is subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the application is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review of the BLA. The FDA reviews the BLA to determine, among other things, whether the proposed product candidate is safe and potent, or effective, for its intended use, and has an acceptable purity profile, and whether the product candidate is being manufactured in accordance with GMP regulations to ensure and preserve the product candidate’s identity, safety, strength, quality, potency and purity. The FDA may refer applications for novel biological products or biological products that present difficult questions of safety or efficacy to an advisory committee, such as the Cellular, Tissue, and Gene Therapy Advisory Committee, a panel that typically includes clinicians and other subject-matter experts, for review, evaluation and a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. During the biological product approval process, the FDA also will determine whether a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, is necessary to ensure the safe use of the biological product candidate. A REMS may be imposed to ensure safe use of the drug, and could include medication guides, physician communication plans, or elements to ensure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries and other risk minimization tools. If the FDA concludes a REMS is needed, the sponsor of the BLA must submit a proposed REMS; the FDA will not approve the BLA without a REMS, if required. 
 Before approving a BLA, the FDA must inspect the facilities at which the product candidate is manufactured. The FDA will not approve the product candidate unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with GMP requirements and adequate to ensure consistent production of the product candidate within required specifications. Additionally, before approving a BLA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical sites to ensure that the clinical trials were conducted in compliance with IND trial requirements and GCP requirements. If information from such an inspection, or from any other source, raises a significant question about the integrity of the clinical data, the FDA may suspend review of the BLA under its Application Integrity Policy, or AIP. After AIP has been invoked, the FDA will not resume substantive review of any pending application unless and until the data have been validated. To ensure data integrity and GMP and GCP compliance, an applicant must incur significant expenditure of time, money and effort in the areas of training, recordkeeping, production, and quality control. 
 Notwithstanding the submission of relevant data and information, the FDA may ultimately decide that the BLA does not satisfy its regulatory criteria for approval and deny approval. Data obtained from clinical trials are not always conclusive and the FDA may interpret data differently than we interpret the same data. If the agency decides not to approve the BLA in its present form, the FDA will issue a complete response letter that usually describes all of the specific deficiencies in the BLA identified by the FDA. The deficiencies identified may be minor, for example, requiring labeling changes, or major, for example, requiring additional clinical trials. Additionally, the complete response letter may include recommended actions that the applicant might take to place the application in a condition for approval. If a complete response letter is issued, the applicant may either resubmit the BLA, addressing all of the deficiencies identified in the letter, or withdraw the application. 
 If a product candidate receives regulatory approval, the approval may be significantly limited to specific diseases and dosages or the indications for use may otherwise be limited, which could restrict the commercial value of the product candidate. Further, the FDA may require that certain contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling. The FDA may impose restrictions and conditions on product distribution, prescribing, or dispensing in the form of a REMS, or otherwise limit the scope of any approval. In addition, the FDA may require post approval clinical trials, sometimes referred to as Phase 4 clinical trials, designed to further assess a biological product’s safety and effectiveness, and testing and surveillance programs to monitor the safety of approved products that have been commercialized. 
 
25 

  One of the performance goals agreed to by the FDA under the PDUFA is to review 90% of standard BLAs in 10 months and 90% of priority BLAs in six months, whereupon a review decision is to be made. The FDA does not always meet its PDUFA goal dates for standard and priority BLAs and its review goals are subject to change from time to time. The review process and the PDUFA goal date may be extended by three months if the FDA requests or the BLA sponsor otherwise provides additional information or clarification regarding information already provided in the submission within the last three months before the PDUFA goal date. If the FDA issues a complete response letter at the end of the initial review cycle and the sponsor resubmits its BLA addressing all deficiencies, a new two or six-month review cycle will begin, depending on the extent of the deficiencies to be addressed. 
 Orphan-drug designation 
 Under the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan-drug designation to a drug or biological product candidate intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is defined as a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States, or 200,000 or more individuals in the United States if there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug or biological product available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product candidate. Orphan-drug designation must be requested before submitting a New Drug Application, or NDA, or BLA. After the FDA grants orphan-drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan-drug designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of the regulatory review and approval process. Orphan-drug designation may also be rescinded if the product candidate no longer meets the criteria for designation. 
 If a product candidate that has orphan-drug designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means that the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the “same” drug or biological product for the same indication for seven years; however, the FDA has not yet established what characteristics of a gene therapy product are relevant to determining whether two gene therapy products would be considered the same for purposes of orphan drug market exclusivity. In January 2020, the FDA issued a draft guidance in which the FDA proposed its interpretation of the “sameness” criterion for determining whether a gene therapy product will be eligible for orphan drug market exclusivity. The FDA proposed to consider two gene therapy products for the same indication to be different, thus each eligible for market exclusivity, if they have different transgenes and different vectors, different transgenes regardless of whether they have the same vectors, or different vectors from a different viral class. The public docket to submit comments on the draft guidance closed on July 28, 2020. The FDA revised and finalized this guidance document in September 2021, stating that it intends to consider two gene therapy products for the same indication to be different, thus each eligible for market exclusivity, if they express different transgenes regardless of whether they have same vectors, or if they use different vectors, regardless of whether they express the same transgene. Generally, the FDA intends to consider vectors from a different viral group (e.g., gammaretrovirus vs. adeno-associated virus) to be different vectors. In addition, generally, the FDA intends to consider vectors from the same viral group to be different when the differences between the vectors impact factors such as tropism, immune response avoidance, or potential mutagenesis. The FDA noted that it will determine whether variants from the same viral group are the same or different on a case-by-case basis. Minor differences, such as polymorphism, in transgenes and/or vectors will not generally render the gene therapy products to be different for purposes of determining “sameness.” Finally, the FDA stated that two gene therapy products with the same vector and same transgene may still be considered different depending on additional features of the final product that can contribute to the therapeutic effect, such as promotors, enhancers, and splicing elements. The FDA will make such determinations on a case-by-case basis. If the first gene therapy product has orphan drug exclusivity, a second gene therapy product that the FDA considers to be the same will not be approved until after the exclusivity period expires. 
 In limited circumstances, the FDA may approve a second drug or biological product that is the same as the reference drug or biological product during an exclusivity period, such as when the second product shows clinical 
 
26 

  superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity. In addition, during the exclusivity period of the first product, the second same product may still be able to obtain approval for a different indication for which the orphan product does not have exclusivity. Competitors also may be able to obtain approval of different products for the same indication for which the orphan product has exclusivity. Orphan product exclusivity also could block the approval of one of our products for seven years if a competitor obtains approval of a biological product that the FDA determines is the same as our product or if the FDA determines that our product candidate’s indication or disease is within or the same as the competitor product’s indication or disease. If a drug or biological product designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan product exclusivity. Orphan drug status in the European Union has similar, but not identical, benefits. 
 Expedited development and review programs 
 The FDA has a Fast Track program that is intended to expedite and facilitate the process for reviewing new drugs and biological products that meet certain criteria. Specifically, new drugs and biological products are eligible for Fast Track designation if they are intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and shown to have the potential to address unmet medical needs for the disease or condition. The sponsor of a new drug or biologic may request the FDA to designate the drug or biologic as a Fast Track product candidate at any time during the clinical development of the product candidate. Unique to a Fast Track designated product candidate, the FDA may consider for review sections of the marketing application on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted if: the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the application; the FDA agrees to accept sections of the application and determines that the schedule is acceptable; and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the application. 
 In addition to the Fast Track program, the FDA provides other expedited programs for qualifying product candidates, such as priority review and accelerated approval. Any product candidate is eligible for priority review if it has the potential to provide safe and effective therapy where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists or a significant improvement in the treatment, diagnosis or prevention of a disease compared to marketed products. The FDA will attempt to direct additional resources to the evaluation of an application for a new drug or biological product candidate designated for priority review in an effort to facilitate the review, and aims to review such applications within six months as opposed to ten months for standard review. Additionally, a product candidate may be eligible for accelerated approval. A drug or biological product will qualify for accelerated approval if the product treats a serious or life-threatening illness and, based on adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, is shown generally to provide a meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments, and demonstrates an effect on a surrogate endpoint, or an intermediate clinical endpoint (i.e., an endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality) that is reasonably likely to predict a clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of accelerated approval, the FDA may require that a sponsor of a drug or biological product candidate perform adequate and well-controlled post-marketing clinical trials. In addition, the FDA currently requires, as a condition for accelerated approval, the pre-approval of promotional materials, which could adversely impact the timing of the commercial launch of the product. 
 Under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, or FDASIA, enacted in 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval and receive the same benefits as drugs with Fast Track designation. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 
 
27 

  Following the establishment of the breakthrough therapy designation, the FDA established the regenerative medicine advanced therapy (RMAT) designation in conjunction with the 2016 21st Century Cures Act. Like the breakthrough designation, the RMAT designation requires preliminary clinical evidence indicating that the therapy has the potential to address unmet medical needs. However, the RMAT designation does not require evidence to indicate that the drug may offer a substantial improvement over the available therapies, which the breakthrough therapy designation does. Fast Track, breakthrough therapy, and RMAT designations may also be rescinded if the product candidate does not continue to meet the designation criteria. 
 Fast Track designation, priority review, accelerated approval, breakthrough therapy designation and RMAT designation do not change the standards for approval but may expedite the development or approval process. 
 Post-approval requirements 
 Maintaining compliance with applicable federal, state, and local statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Rigorous and extensive FDA regulation of biological products continues after approval, particularly with respect to GMP requirements. We will rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties for the production of clinical and commercial quantities of any products that we may commercialize. Manufacturers of our products are required to comply with applicable requirements in the GMP regulations, including quality control and quality assurance and maintenance of records and documentation. Other post-approval requirements applicable to biological products include reporting of GMP deviations that may affect the identity, potency, purity and overall safety of a distributed product, record-keeping requirements, reporting of adverse effects, reporting updated safety and efficacy information, and complying with electronic record and signature requirements. After a BLA is approved, the product may also be subject to official lot release. In this case, as part of the manufacturing process, the manufacturer is required to perform certain tests on each lot of the product before it is released for distribution. If the product is subject to official release by the FDA, the manufacturer submits samples of each lot of product to the FDA together with a release protocol showing a summary of the history of manufacture of the lot and the results of all of the manufacturer’s tests performed on the lot. The FDA may also perform certain confirmatory tests on lots of some products, such as viral vaccines, before releasing the lots for distribution by the manufacturer. In addition, the FDA conducts laboratory research related to the regulatory standards on the safety, purity, potency, and effectiveness of biological products. 
 FDA regulations prohibit the promotion of an investigational product for an unapproved use, which may include certain company-sponsored scientific and educational activities if the content of those activities is not independent of a company’s influence or control. The FDA distinguishes impermissible promotion of an investigational product from the permissible exchange of scientific and medical information among healthcare professionals, which may include company-sponsored scientific and educational activities if the content of those activities is free of company influence or control. The FDA has issued Warning Letters and untitled letters to sponsors and clinical investigators who have claimed, directly or indirectly, that an investigational product is safe and effective for its intended use. 
 FDA regulations also impose requirements and limitations on advertising and promotional activities specifically for approved biological products. While a BLA is still under review, the BLA applicant must submit to the FDA copies of all promotional materials intended for use within 120 days following BLA approval, after which time the applicant must submit promotional materials at least 30 days prior to the intended time of use, unless otherwise directed by the FDA. For all drug and biological products, the FD&C Act prohibits false or misleading labeling, which includes statements in promotional materials about the product’s safety, effectiveness, and indications for use. The FDA’s regulations require advertising and promotional materials and activities to provide, among other things, adequate safety and risk information and fair balance, and prohibit the promotion of products for uses or in-patient populations that are not described in the product’s approved labeling (known as “off-label use”). In addition, the FDA has published guidelines, which include limitations on direct-to-consumer advertising and promotional activities via the Internet and social media. The failure to comply with the applicable 
 
28 

  regulatory requirements may result in Warning Letters to come into compliance and the FDA further requesting the cessation or revision of marketing materials and activities or the dissemination of corrective marketing materials. The FDA has the authority to seek an injunction to stop the dissemination of violative marketing materials and activities if adequate corrective actions are not taken voluntarily. 
 Biological product manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved biological products are required to register their establishments with the FDA and certain state agencies and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and certain state agencies for compliance with GMPs and other laws. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain GMP compliance. In addition, changes to the manufacturing process or facility generally require prior FDA approval before being implemented and other types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications and additional labeling claims, are also subject to further FDA review and approval. 
 The FDA has the authority to take a variety of actions to address violations, including invoking the AIP and suspending the review of a pending application; refusing to approve or withdrawing approval of a marketing application; placing a study on clinical hold; issuing warning or untitled letters; ordering a biological product recall; seizing product in distribution; seeking an injunction to stop manufacture and distribution of a product; seeking restitution, disgorgement of profits, and fines; and debarring a company and its executives individually from participation in any capacity in the drug approval process. The U.S. Department of Justice has the authority to criminally prosecute companies and company executives for violations of the FD&C Act and the PHS Act. 
 United States patent term restoration and marketing exclusivity 
 Depending on the timing, duration and specifics of product development and the FDA review of a BLA, some of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, commonly referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent restoration term of up to five years as compensation for patent term lost during product development and the FDA’s regulatory review process. However, patent term restoration cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the product’s approval date. The patent term restoration period is generally one-half the time between the effective date of an IND and the submission date of a BLA plus the time between the submission date of a BLA and the approval of that application. Only one patent applicable to an approved biological product is eligible for the extension and the application for the extension must be submitted prior to the expiration of the patent. The United States Patent and Trademark Office, in consultation with the FDA, reviews and approves the application for any patent term extension or restoration. In the future, we may apply for restoration of patent term for one or more of our currently owned or licensed patents to add patent life beyond its current expiration date, depending on the expected length of the clinical trials and other factors involved in the filing of the relevant BLA. 
 A biological product can obtain pediatric market exclusivity in the United States. Pediatric exclusivity, if granted, adds six months to existing exclusivity periods and patent terms. This six-month exclusivity, which runs from the end of other exclusivity protection or patent term, may be granted based on the voluntary completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an FDA-issued “Written Request” for such a study. 
 The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or Affordable Care Act, signed into law on March 23, 2010, includes a subtitle called the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCI Act, which created an abbreviated approval pathway for biological products shown to be similar to, or interchangeable with, an FDA-licensed reference biological product. This amendment to the PHS Act attempts to minimize duplicative testing. Biosimilarity, which requires that there be no clinically meaningful differences between the biological product and the reference product in terms of safety, purity, and potency, can be shown through analytical studies, animal studies, and a clinical trial or trials. Interchangeability requires that a product is biosimilar to the reference product and the product must 
 
29 

  demonstrate that it can be expected to produce the same clinical results as the reference product and, for products administered multiple times, the biologic and the reference biologic may be switched after one has been previously administered without increasing safety risks or risks of diminished efficacy relative to exclusive use of the reference biologic. However, complexities associated with the larger, and often more complex, structure of biological products, as well as the process by which such products are manufactured, pose significant hurdles to implementation that are still being worked out by the FDA. 
 The BPCI Act provides a reference biological product 12 years of exclusivity from the time of first licensure of the reference product. On June 23, 2016, the Price Relief, Innovation, and Competition for Essential Drugs (PRICED) Act (H.R. 5573) was introduced, which would have reduced exclusivity for reference biological drugs from 12 to seven years. The PRICED Act was reintroduced on June 20, 2019 (H.R. 3379) and, if passed into law, would reduce exclusivity for reference biological products from 12 to five years. The Emergency Access to Insulin Act of 2019 (H.R. 4010 introduced July 25, 2019 and S. 2004 introduced June 27, 2019), in addition to a number of provisions designed to decrease cost and increase access to insulin, included provisions that would shorten the new biological product exclusivity from 12 years to seven years. 
 The BPCI Act also provides that the first biological product submitted under the biosimilar abbreviated approval pathway that is determined to be interchangeable with the reference product has exclusivity against other biologics submitting under the abbreviated approval pathway for the lesser of (i) one year after the first commercial marketing, (ii) 18 months after approval if there is no legal challenge, (iii) 18 months after the resolution in the applicant’s favor of a lawsuit challenging the biologics’ patents if an application has been submitted, or (iv) 42 months after the application has been approved if a lawsuit is ongoing within the 42-month period. 
 Pharmaceutical coverage, pricing and reimbursement 
 Sales of our products, when and if approved for marketing, will depend, in part, on the extent to which our products will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state, and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations. These third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for medical products, drugs and services, and increasing oversight and transparency on how products are priced and reimbursed. In addition, the U.S. government, state legislatures and foreign governments have continued implementing cost containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit our net revenue and results. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for our product candidates or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover our product candidates could reduce physician usage of our products once approved and have a material adverse effect on our sales, results of operations and financial condition. Given the potential for long term durable therapeutic benefit from the single administration of a gene therapy product, the question of appropriate pricing and method of payment, including annuity payments and “pay for performance” schemes, is currently an active discussion and, depending on outcome, could affect the use of our products and our financial performance. 
 Other healthcare laws 
 Although we currently do not have any products on the market, we may be subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which we conduct our business. Such laws include, without limitation, state and federal anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, privacy and security and physician sunshine laws and regulations, many of which may become more applicable to us if our product candidates are approved and we begin commercialization. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of such laws or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare 
 
30 

  programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. 
 Research and Development 
 Our research and development expenses were $49.5 million and $44.4 million for the years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
 Employees 
 As of June 30, 2022, we had 102 full-time employees, 53 of whom have Ph.D., M.D. or other post-graduate degrees. Of these full-time employees, 71 were engaged in research and development activities and 31 were engaged in finance, human resources, facilities, and general management. 
 During the years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021, all of our personnel were co-employees of AGTC and a professional human resource service organization, Insperity PEO Services, L.P., or Insperity. Insperity is a co-employer of our personnel and is responsible for administering all payroll functions, including tax withholdings, and providing health insurance and other benefits to those individuals. We reimburse Insperity for its costs and pay Insperity an administrative fee for its services. We are responsible for, and control, all aspects of the hiring, retention, compensation, management and supervision of our personnel. We consider the terms of our contract with Insperity to be reasonable and customary and believe that this arrangement provides substantial benefit to us in the form of lower costs for employee benefits and a reduced administrative burden on us. 
 We believe that our future success will depend, in part, on our continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel. Our human capital resources objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, retaining, incentivizing and integrating our existing and new employees, advisors and consultants. The principal purposes of our incentive plans are to attract, retain and reward personnel through the granting of share-based compensation and cash-based performance bonus awards, to increase stockholder value and the success of our company by motivating such individuals to perform to the best of their abilities and achieve our objectives. 
 We have no collective bargaining agreements with our employees, and we have not experienced any work stoppages. We consider our relations with our employees to be good.
