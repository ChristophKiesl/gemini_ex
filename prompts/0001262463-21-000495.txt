Item 1. Business
Background

Global WholeHealth Partners Corporation (the “Company”) was incorporated on March 7, 2013 in the State of Nevada. On May 9, 2019, the Company amended its Articles of Incorporation to effect a change of name to Global WholeHealth Partners Corporation and changed our ticker symbol to GWHP.
Our Business

Global WholeHealth Partners Corporation develops and markets in-vitro diagnostic (“IVD”) tests for over-the-counter (“OTC” or consumer), or consumer-use and point-of-care (“POC” or professional) which includes hospitals, physicians’ offices and medical clinics, including those within penal systems throughout the US and abroad. The Company currently markets a range of diagnostic test kits for consumer use through OTC sales, and for use by health care professionals, generally located at medical clinics, physician offices and hospitals known POC, in the United States. These test kits are known as in-vitro diagnostic test kits or IVD products.

All of the products we sell are manufactured in a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) Approved Facility in the USA. An FDA Approved facility is a facility that meets Good Manufacturing Practices (“GMP”) with the FDA.

We sell products internationally which are not FDA approved to sell in the US. These products include an FDA Certificate of Exportability and include tests such as Ebola, ZIKA, Dengue, Malaria, Influenza, Tuberculosis, Corona Viruses, and other vector borne diseases.

CoVid-19 Activities

In response to the novel strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) pandemic, in early January 2020, the Company set out to test and perform the studies necessary to develop a Rapid Diagnostic IgG/IgM 10-minute Rapid Test (“RDT”) and Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Test (“RT-PCR”). On March 15, 2020, the Company received an Acknowledgment Letter from the FDA for the RT-PCR and the Company’s submission had been assigned document control number PEUA200084. On April 6, 2020, the Company received an Acknowledgment Letter from the FDA for the RDT and the Company’s submission had been assigned document control number EUA200181. Concurrently, with the efforts to get FDA approval of the RDT and RT-PCR, on May 22, 2020, the Company, received a Letter of Authorization from 1drop Inc. authorizing the Company to sell 1drop Inc.’s 1copy TM COVID-19 qPCR Multi Kit, which had received Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA. On August 3, 2020, the Company received a Letter of Authorization from Healgen Scientific Limited authorizing the Company to sell Healgen Scientific Limited’s SARS-COV-2 IgG/IgM Antibody Whole Blood, Serum and Plasma. On September 14, 2020, the Company received an Acknowledgment Letter the FDA had received the Company’s Global Rapid Antigen Test application, a new test developed by the Company. The Company’s submission was assigned document control number PEUA201789.

To date, the Company has been unable to gain FDA approval of its EUA applications primarily due to financial constraints and the high cost of required testing to gain FDA approval. Early in the pandemic, the sale of unapproved tests was common place, and provided the Company with the expectation that it would be able to subsidize the FDA approval process. However, due to unprecedented efforts by larger diagnostics companies, FDA approval of various tests arrived quickly causing marketplace demand to shift away from unapproved COVID-19 tests thereby rendering the Company’s unapproved products uncompetitive. The Company was also unable to sell a material quantity of the 1drop Inc. and Healgen FDA approved tests due to insufficient funds for marketing, their high relative cost and the rapid commoditization of COVID-19 tests in general. 

Plan of Operation

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company became laser focused on developing and selling COVID tests beginning in the second half of fiscal 2020. Over the course of 2021, the Company continued its efforts to develop an RDT, RT-PCR and antigen test and will continue to do so if economics and the Company’s ability to finance FDA approval makes sense. Due to the commoditization of COVID-19 tests, the Company expects that it will no longer offer for resale the tests it purchases from other companies and any future COVID-19 tests offered by the Company will be its own. With the assistance of other diagnostic manufactures, we are currently developing an improved COVID antigen test with promising results and hope to gain FDA approval by the end of our second fiscal quarter. 

The Company is currently in the process of refocusing its attention on marketing its core FDA OTC approved products which includes tests for pregnancy, ovulation, colorectal, drugs of abuse, glucose strips and glucose monitors through various platforms, including Walmart, Amazon and eBay. The Company estimates sales of non COVIT-19 tests to begin in fiscal Q2. 

Industry

The In-vitro Diagnostic (“IVD”) testing industry encompasses the following two primary categories: the over-the-counter market (“OTC”), or consumer-use, and the point-of-care market (“POC”), which includes hospitals, physicians’ offices, and medical clinics, including those within penal systems throughout the US and abroad. The concepts that distinguish POC technology—operation simple enough for non-laboratory users; little or no maintenance requirement; and rapid, reliable results—mean that it can be applied equally well in many non-clinical settings, such as the OTC market. As advances in medical technology increasingly make it possible to diagnose diseases and physiological conditions from ever-smaller amounts of body fluids, certain diseases and conditions that once required diagnosis by physicians and/or medical technicians inside hospital emergency rooms, exam rooms/bedside studies, or private clinics, can now also be done by inexpensive, easy-to-use diagnostic devices that consumers can use in the comfort and anonymity of their home. Today, the average pharmacy, whether a privately owned neighborhood store, or chain owned, has become an outlet for selling IVD test kits for in-home use.

The Company believes, according to publicly available sources, that the IVD industry is a multi-billion-dollar industry that is increasing each year. This assessment includes all laboratory hospital-based products, over-the-counter devices, and rapid tests performed at the point-of-care. The Company believes that the following factors can be attributed to the increase in overall need and use of IVD test kits: an aging baby-boomer population; increasing healthcare costs; the ever-growing number of uninsured and under-insured in the U.S. and abroad; and a general increase in consumer awareness, in part due to the wealth of information available on the Internet.

Competition

Diagnostic products are subject to competition in technological innovation, price, convenience of use, service, instrument warranty provisions, product performance, laboratory efficiency, long-term supply contracts, and product potential for overall cost-effectiveness and productivity gains. Some products in this segment can be subject to rapid product obsolescence or regulatory changes. We compete with several companies around the world who possess significantly greater technical and financial resources and professional and consumer reach and recognition, including Accon Labs,  Johnson & Johnson, DB, Abbott, and Roche all of whom carry similar products. 
Marketing and Sales

The Company is focused on generating increased sales through online retail, large and small distributors and directly to doctors, hospitals, clinics and governments. The Company is taking steps and developing the materials needed to effect its marketing strategy.Research and Development

We are continuing to look for needs in the world to create and work with our scientific team and science partners to make a rapid test for the newest diseases, such as COVID 19, Dengue Fever, ZIKA, EBOLA, TB, and Malaria.
Employees

As of June 30, 2021, we have no full-time employees. Charles Strongo our CEO, Treasurer and Chairman, F. Rene Alvarez, our COO, President and Director and Dr. Shuijie Cui, our Chief Science Officer and Director devote as much time as the Board of Directors determine is necessary to carry out the affairs of the Company.
