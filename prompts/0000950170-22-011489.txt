Item 1. BUSINESS
Our Company
 
PGT Innovations, Inc. (“we,” “us,” “our,” “PGTI” or the “Company”) manufactures and supplies premium windows and doors. Our impact-resistant products can withstand some of the toughest weather conditions on earth and, with its Western Window Systems (“WWS”) product lines, unify indoor/outdoor living spaces. We strive to create value through deep customer relationships, understanding the needs of the markets we serve, and a drive to develop category-defining products. We believe we are one of the nation’s largest manufacturers of impact-resistant windows and doors and hold leadership positions in our primary markets. We manufacture diverse lines of products, intended to appeal to different segments of the market, at different price-points, including high-end, luxury, premium and mass-custom fully customizable aluminum and vinyl windows and doors and porch enclosure products, targeting both the residential repair and remodeling and new construction end markets. We market our impact-resistant products under five recognized brands: PGT® Custom Windows & Doors, CGI® Windows and Doors, WinDoor®, NewSouth Window Solutions®, and Eco Enterprises, Inc., following the completion of our acquisition of a 75% ownership stake in Eco effective February 1, 2021. We believe all of these brands are positively associated with service, performance, quality, durability and energy efficiency. We also market a line of window and door products designed to unify indoor/outdoor living spaces under the two recognized brands of Western Window Systems® and Anlin®, following the acquisition of Anlin Windows and Doors effective October 25, 2021 brands, which we believe are associated with innovation, quality, durability and energy efficiency in the indoor/outdoor living space markets. Many of these brands have been added to our portfolio through the acquisitions described below.
 
● On September 22, 2014, we acquired CGI, an innovator in impact-resistant product craftsmanship, strength and style that is recognized and respected in the architect community.
 
● On February 16, 2016, we completed the acquisition of WinDoor, a provider of high-performance, impact-resistant windows and doors to five-star resorts, luxury condominiums, high-rise multi-family buildings, hotels and custom high-end single-family homes.
 
● On September 6, 2016, we acquired an established fabricator of impact-resistant storefront window and door products, US Impact Systems, Inc. (“USI”), and announced the formation of CGI Commercial, Inc. (“CGIC”), the brand and company through which we sell the former USI products.
 
● On August 13, 2018, we completed the acquisition of Western Window Systems (the “WWS Acquisition”), an award-winning designer and manufacturer of premium contemporary doors and window systems with a focus on unifying indoor/outdoor living spaces. The WWS Acquisition has increased and diversified our product offerings and enabled us to expand beyond our previous geographically focused portfolio of primarily impact-resistant products.
 
● On February 1, 2020, we completed the acquisition of NewSouth (the “NewSouth Acquisition”). NewSouth is a manufacturer and installer of factory-direct, energy-efficient windows and doors, including both impact-resistant and non-impact residential products. NewSouth has nine retail showrooms in several locations throughout Florida, with additional showrooms in North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas and Louisiana.
 
● On February 1, 2021, we completed our previously announced acquisition of 75% of the outstanding equity interests of New Eco Windows Holding, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company newly formed for the purposes of facilitating the acquisition of 100% of the equity interests of Eco Window Systems, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, Eco Glass Production Inc., a Florida corporation and Unity Windows Inc., a Florida corporation, which now operate as EcoEnterprises, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Eco Window Systems, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, Eco Glass Production, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, and Unity Windows, LLC, a Florida limited liability company, respectively (collectively, “Eco”). Eco is a manufacturer and installer of aluminum, impact-resistant windows and doors, serving the South Florida region since 2009. Eco is headquartered in Medley, Florida, near Miami, and has three manufacturing locations in the region.
 
● On October 25, 2021, we completed the acquisition of Anlin Windows & Doors. Anlin is a top regional brand for vinyl replacement windows and doors and is a great fit with our existing Western Window Systems brand, which is a leading provider of aluminum products for the new home construction market and expands our market presence in the West Coast region, which we believe is a high-growth area. We believe this acquisition allows us to better serve markets in the west with a broad product portfolio and expanded sales network. The acquisition was done by Western Window Holding LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, indirectly wholly-owned by PGT Innovations, Inc., which acquired
-  -


substantially all of the assets, properties and rights owned, used or held for use in the business, as operated by Anlin Industries, a California corporation, of manufacturing vinyl windows and doors for the replacement market and the new construction market, and all activities conducted in connection therewith, other than certain expressly excluded assets and liabilities (the "Anlin Acquisition").
 Our impact-resistant products combine heavy-duty aluminum or vinyl frames with laminated glass to ensure structural integrity, which provides protection from wind-driven projectiles of all sizes and other debris during a storm. Our impact-resistant products substantially reduce the likelihood of penetration by impacting projectiles, protecting people and property, while providing expansive, unblocked exterior views that other forms of protection, such as shutters or wood coverings, do not provide. Our impact-resistant products also offer many other benefits, including: (1) abatement of sound to substantially decrease outside noise, including during hurricanes; (2) protection against the damaging effects of ultra-violet light; (3) reduction of energy loss due to changing external temperatures; and (4) energy efficiency that can significantly reduce cooling and heating costs, as evidenced by the energy ratings our products have received. These impact-resistant products satisfy the nation’s most stringent building codes in hurricane-prone coastal states and provide an attractive alternative to shutters and other “active” forms of hurricane protection that require installation and removal before and after each storm. We also manufacture vinyl porch and patio enclosure products that are designed to allow air flow while protecting against inclement weather, making outdoor spaces more inviting.
 The acquisition of NewSouth has supported our diversification into growing segments in the window and door industry, by enabling us to enter the direct-to-consumer channel, where NewSouth is a market leader in Florida. NewSouth's direct-to-consumer model is supported by its showrooms and in-home sales. With the addition of NewSouth, we continued our strategy of growing in geographic areas outside of our core markets, with showroom openings planned for Southern states, including Texas and Georgia. NewSouth has recently opened new showrooms in Pensacola, Florida, Charlotte and Raleigh, North Carolina, Charleston, South Carolina, Houston, Texas, and New Orleans, Louisiana.
 
The acquisition of Eco is expected to extend our residential market footprint with what we believe will be minimal overlap with our existing network of dealers, as most of Eco’s dealer-customers have not historically been our customers. Eco’s product offerings in the commercial market are expected to provide us with added product and customer diversification in that space, which we believe will be a high-growth market in future periods. By adding Eco’s glass manufacturing capabilities to our operations, we will expand our glass production capabilities and capacity and expect to strengthen and gain more control of our supply chain for glass.
 The additions of Anlin and Western Window Systems (“WWS”) to our family of brands expanded our portfolio of offerings and our geographical footprint and added award-winning and innovative products that combine performance and quality with clean, functional designs. Its products are designed for strength, easy integration into a variety of spaces, smooth operation and are tested for durability.
 With approximately 5,300 employees (as of January 1, 2022) at our various manufacturing facilities located in North Venice, Tampa, and Fort Myers, on the west coast of Florida, and Hialeah and Medley, on the east coast of Florida, as well as Phoenix, Arizona, and Irvine and Clovis, California, in the western U.S., our vertically integrated manufacturing capabilities include in-house glass cutting, tempering, laminating and insulating capabilities, which provide us with a consistent source of specialized glass, shorter lead times, lower costs relative to third-party sourcing and an overall more efficient production process. Additionally, our manufacturing process relies on just-in-time delivery of raw materials and components as well as synchronous flow to promote labor efficiency and throughput, allowing us to more consistently fulfill orders on-time for our valued customers.
The geographic regions in which we currently conduct business include the Southeastern U.S., Western U.S., Gulf Coast, and the Coastal mid-Atlantic. We also ship to the Caribbean, Central America and Canada. We distribute our products through multiple channels, including approximately 2,300 independently-owned dealers and distributors, national building supply distributors, the in-home sales/custom order divisions of major U.S. home building and improvement supply retailers and, with our acquisition of NewSouth, the direct-to-consumer channel. We believe this broad distribution network provides us with the flexibility to meet demand as it shifts between the repair and remodel, and residential and commercial new construction end markets.

WinDoor’s thermally broken products provide the strength of aluminum with the energy ratings usually seen in only vinyl products. All of WinDoor’s thermally broken products are available in multiple shapes and sizes, have earned high performance ratings on impact and non-impact certifications, and meet or exceed ENERGY STAR® standards in all climate zones.
 Estate by WinDoor. Formerly part of CGI, our Estate Collection of windows and doors is one of WinDoor’s premium aluminum impact-resistant product line. These windows and doors can be found in high-end homes, resorts and hotels, and in schools and office buildings. Our Estate Collection combines protection against hurricane force damage with architectural-grade quality, handcrafted details and modern engineering. These windows and doors protect and insulate against hurricane winds and wind-driven debris, outside noise, and offer UV protection. Estate’s aluminum frames are thicker than many of our competitors’ frames, making it a preferable choice for consumers in coastal areas prone to hurricanes.
 Western Window Systems
 WWS’s products are non-impact products, and include both customized products for its custom sales channel, and standard products for its volume, production builder, sales channel, and carry the Western Windows Systems® brand under three product categories of the Classic Line, Performance Line, and the Simulated Steel Line.
 Classic Line. WWS’s Classic Line is a portfolio of high-quality, disappearing glass walls and windows that combine exceptional performance with clean design. The products of the Classic Line include fixed and operating windows, as well as sliding, folding and hinged doors. Sales of the Classic Line products are focused on the volume/production builder market in relatively temperate areas in the Western United States.
 Performance Line. The Performance Line by WWS is a family of moving glass walls and windows engineered to satisfy its customers’ energy and structural requirements, while promoting a contemporary, modern architectural design. The Performance Line has broad thermal capabilities that allow this luxury line of products to satisfy all energy codes throughout the United States.
 Simulated Steel Line. The Simulated Steel Line by WWS is a portfolio of thermally-broken, aluminum moving glass walls and windows that look like steel but are far more affordable. This portfolio of products embodies WWS’s nearly 60 years of advancements in door and window design, and we believe exhibits luxury and refinement. The Simulated Steel Line has clean, narrow profiles which gives the glass components of the products a prominent positioning, while maximizing natural light.
 NewSouth
 Windows and Doors. NewSouth manufactures a wide array of single-hung, double-hung, sliding, picture and visually appealing shaped vinyl windows which are durable and energy-efficient. NewSouth also manufactures durable and attractive patio and entry doors which we believe enhance safety and improve the appearance of entry spaces.
 Installation. NewSouth provides quality installation of its windows and doors through an experienced group of installation services companies who are subcontracted to install its products.
 Eco Window Systems
 Eco manufactures impact resistant windows and doors which are engineered to meet the toughest standards in the industry at the best price while ensuring the durability, elegance, and safety of all products for both the commercial and residential markets.
 Windows and Doors. Eco manufactures a wide array of aluminum single-hung, horizontal rolling, fixed, and casement windows which are all impact resistant. Eco also manufactures several varieties of aluminum, impact-resistant patio and entry doors such as French, sliding, garage, bi-fold, and pivot which we believe complement the existing product lines offered by PGT Custom Windows & Doors and CGI Windows and Doors.
 Glass production. Eco produces its own processed glass products, which supplies all of its window and door manufacturing operations’ requirements for glass. Eco’s glass production capacity also allows incremental vertical integration of glass for the production of certain of our other product lines, enabling us to strengthen and gain more control of our supply chain for glass. Eco also sells a small amount of glass other to third-party customers.
Anlin Windows and Doors
 Anlin is a California-based recognized brand for vinyl windows and doors in the remodel and replacement market. Anlin produces energy-efficient windows and doors with modern, energy saving technology, with a focus on noise reduction, delivering a high-quality product with appealing design and beauty. Anlin also provides consumer driven specialty products such as hinged patio doors with flexible options like in glass pet doors.
 -  -


Anlin windows and patio doors are tested and certified by the National Fenestration Rating Council (NFRC), the American Architectural Manufactures Association (AAMA), and Energy Star. Each certification assures homeowners that our windows and patio doors are manufactured to the highest quality and energy standards. 
Sales and Marketing

Our sales strategy primarily focuses on strengthening partnerships with our loyal distributors and dealers in the repair and remodel, and new construction markets by consistently providing exceptional customer service, industry-leading product designs and quality, valuable insight on building code requirements and industry trends, and technical expertise. We also market our products directly to national and regional homebuilders, who then purchase our products from our long-standing network of dealers and distributors. With our acquisition of NewSouth Window Solutions in February 2020, our sales strategy expanded to include a focus on direct-to-consumer sales to meet the growing demand from consumers looking for a manufacturer-to-home selling experience. More recently, our 2021 acquisition of a controlling ownership stake in ECO has provided us with more product offerings and customer relationships in the commercial market, which we believe will be a high growth market in future periods.
 Our marketing strategy is designed to promote the quality and benefits of our products and targets both coastal and inland markets across the U.S. We reach our customers through traditional and web-based advertising; consumer promotions; and showrooms and selling materials. We also work with our dealers and distributors to educate architects, building officials, consumers, and homebuilders on the advantages of using impact-resistant and energy-efficient products. We market products from our house of brands to consumers based on performance and life-style benefits they value, as well as through the purchase channels they desire.
 Our Customers
We have a highly diversified base of approximately 2,300 window distributors, building supply distributors, window replacement dealers and enclosure contractors. This number includes the distributor networks of Eco and Anlin, both of which we acquired during 2021. We believe there is minimal overlap with our existing dealer network from the acquisitions of Eco and Anlin.
In 2021, our largest customer accounted for approximately 4% of net sales and our top ten customers accounted for approximately 20% of net sales. Our sales are driven by residential new construction and home repair and remodel end markets, which represented approximately 42% and 58% of our sales, respectively, during 2021. This compares to 46% and 54%, respectively, in 2020. The increase in the percentage of our sales made to the repair and remodel market in 2021 is driven by the additions of the sales of Eco and Anlin in 2021, and NewSouth in 2020, the substantial majority of whose sales are into the home repair and remodel channel.
 Prior to certain recent acquisitions, we did not supply our products directly to homebuilders but believe demand for our products is also a function of our strong relationships with certain national homebuilders for both our impact resistant products, and also for our products sold in the west, which are designed to unify indoor-outdoor living spaces. With the acquisition of NewSouth, we sell direct to the end customer.
 Materials, Inventory and Supplier Relationships
Our primary manufacturing materials include aluminum and vinyl extrusions, glass, ionoplast, and polyvinyl butyral. Although in many instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. While most of our materials are typically available from other sources, transitioning to alternative sources would require us to complete testing and certifications related to impact-resistance and for the alternative source of supply to create the customized equipment and tooling necessary to provide the materials and components to us. Therefore, our goal is to develop and maintain lasting relationships with our material suppliers.
 Glass, which includes sheet glass and finished glass, which we sourced from three major national suppliers in 2021, represented approximately 40% of our material purchases during 2021. Aluminum and vinyl extrusions accounted for approximately 36% of our material purchases during 2021. Polyvinyl butyral and ionoplast, which are both used as inner layer in laminated glass, typically accounts for approximately 5% of our material purchases. The remainder of our material purchases in 2021 are primarily composed of hardware and indirect materials used in the manufacturing process.
 Our inventory consists principally of raw materials purchased for the manufacture of our products and limited finished goods inventory as the majority of our products are custom, made-to-order products. Our inventory levels are more closely aligned with our number of product offerings rather than our level of sales. We have maintained our inventory level to have (i) raw materials required to support new product launches; (ii) a sufficient level of safety stock on certain items to ensure an adequate supply of material in the event of a sudden increase in demand and given our short lead-times; and (iii) adequate lead times for raw materials purchased from overseas suppliers in bulk supply.

As discussed below in the section titled ‘Backlog”, at the end of 2021, as compared to the end of 2020, our backlog of sales orders has increased significantly. We define backlog as orders that we have received and have accepted from customers, but that have not yet shipped. The majority of this increase is a result of an increased level of order entry during 2021, but also includes increases relating to the acquisitions. However, during 2021, our backlog increased as a result of growth in orders above our capacity to keep pace with the increased demand. As a result, during 2021, we opened an additional approximately 130,000 square foot manufacturing facility in Fort Myers, Florida to provide additional manufacturing capacity. During the first half of 2020, we also experienced some disruption in our ability to obtain adequate supplies of glass for our manufacturing processes by what we think were the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our glass supply chain partners, which ultimately resulted in an increase in our lead times to our customers. This factor lessened during the second half of 2020 and into 2021, and obtaining adequate supplies of glass has become less of a challenge to our supply chain. We continue to have good relations with our glass supply chain partners, and we have gained additional control over our supply chain for glass with our acquisition of a 75% stake in Eco, whose vertically integrated operations includes a glass manufacturing division which supplies all of the impact-resistant glass used in Eco’s window and door products. We believe that our investment in Eco has provided us with a secure, high-quality, dependable supply of glass for our operations. Prior to our acquisition of Eco, it was historically a significant source of our glass needs and continues to be such today.
 Backlog
Our backlog was $355.9 million as of January 1, 2022, and $199.5 million as of January 2, 2021. Our backlog consists of orders that we have received from customers that have not yet shipped. The majority of this increase in backlog resulted from an increased level of order entries during 2021, as well as our acquisitions of Eco and Anlin. For additional discussion of factors affecting our backlog of orders, see the section titled "Materials, Inventory and Supplier Relationships" above.
 We expect that a significant portion of our current backlog will be recognized as sales in the first quarter of 2022, due in part to our lead times, which typically range from one to five weeks, but which have increased as a result of heightened demand, especially in our Southeast markets, but also due to the previously discussed supply chain disruptions.
 Intellectual Property
We own and have registered trademarks in the U.S. In addition, we own several patents and patent applications concerning various aspects of window assembly and related processes. We are not aware of any circumstances that would have a material adverse effect on our ability to use our trademarks and patents. If we continue to renew our trademarks when necessary, the trademark protection provided by them is perpetual.
Manufacturing
Our manufacturing facilities are in Florida, Arizona and California. In Florida, we produce customized impact-resistant and non-impact products. In Arizona, we produce a combination of aluminum and vinyl , customized non-impact products for the custom channel of our WWS brand, and standard products for its volume channel. In California, we produce vinyl custom non-impact products which, combined with our products manufactured in Arizona, we believe gives us a complete array of aluminum and vinyl, custom and standard window and door products for what we believe is a high-growth western market.
 The manufacturing process for our PGT Custom Windows & Doors products typically begins in our glass plant in North Venice, Florida, where we cut, temper, laminate, and insulate sheet glass to meet specific requirements of our customers, and then windows and doors are manufactured in our plants in North Venice, Florida, and our newly opened manufacturing facility in Fort Myers, Florida. Our Hialeah (CGI), and Tampa (NewSouth), Florida facilities and our Phoenix, Arizona (WWS) and Clovis, California (Anlin) facilities primarily source their glass needs from external suppliers. As discussed in the section titled “Materials, Inventory and Supplier Relationships” above, our acquisition of a controlling ownership interest in Eco, which has been one of our glass suppliers before the acquisition, provides us with a high-quality, dependable supply of glass for a portion of our operations in Florida.
 Glass is transported to our window and door assembly lines in a make-to-order sequence where it is combined with an aluminum or vinyl frame. These frames are also fabricated to order. We start with a piece of extruded material which is cut and shaped into a frame that fits the customers’ specifications. Once complete, product is immediately staged for delivery and generally shipped on our trucking fleet or with contracted carriers within 48 hours of completion.
Competition
The window and door industry is highly fragmented, and the competitive landscape is based on geography. The competition falls into the following categories.
 Local and Regional Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors consists of numerous local job shops and small manufacturing facilities that tend to focus on selling products to local or regional dealers and wholesalers. Competitors in this group typically lack marketing support and the service levels and quality controls demanded by larger customers, as well as the ability to offer a full complement of products.
-  -


National Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors tends to focus on selling branded products nationally to dealers and wholesalers and has multiple locations.
 International Window and Door Manufacturers: This group of competitors consists of non-U.S. companies that have created entities and established manufacturing operations within Florida and have an increasing presence in the South Florida region as suppliers of windows and doors, primarily for high-rise buildings.
Active Protection: This group of competitors consists of manufacturers that produce shutters and plywood, both of which are used to actively protect openings. Our impact-resistant windows and doors represent passive protection, meaning, once installed, no activity is required to protect a home from storm related hazards.
 The principal methods of competition in the window and door industry are the development of long-term relationships with window and door dealers and distributors, and the retention of customers by delivering a full range of high-quality products in a timely manner, while offering competitive pricing and flexibility in transaction processing. Trade professionals such as contractors, homebuilders, architects and engineers also engage in direct interaction with manufacturers and look to the manufacturer for training and education related to products and codes. We believe our position as one of the leaders in the U.S. impact-resistant window and door market, and the innovative designs and quality of our products, position us well to meet the needs of our customers.
Environmental Considerations
Although our business and facilities are subject to federal, state, and local environmental regulation, environmental regulation does not have a material impact on our operations, and we believe that our facilities are in material compliance with such laws and regulations.
Human Capital Management
Employees. As of the end of 2021, we employed approximately 5,300 people, none of whom were represented by a collective bargaining unit. We believe we have good relations with our employees.
 Employee Safety. The safety of our team members is our top priority, and we have taken significant steps in recent years to drive improvements in this area. Some of these safety initiatives we have taken, include:
 ● Increasing the size, experience and other qualifications of our environment, health and safety, or “E&HS”, staff;
 ● Adopting an incident management system that records workplace injuries based on type and other classifications to provide the data to drive targeted corrective and preventative actions to address and mitigate actual and potential causes of injuries;
 ● Implementing a “Serious Six” OSHA compliance training program;
 ● Implementing ergonomics-related safety improvements, using an experience and risk-based approach to prioritize those improvements;
 ● Partnering with vendors to obtain high quality personal protective equipment and related training on how to appropriately utilize that equipment;
 ● Increasing virtual workplace safety training, in addition to in-person training, when feasible, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, designed to drive workplace safety awareness through all levels of the organization, and taking other actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic as described in more detail below in “Item 7 Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” under the subsection titled “Impact of COVID-19 on ourBusiness”;
 ● Training team members to identify and quickly address potentially unsafe activities and practices;
 ● Implementing a team member EH&S recognition and rewards program; and
 ● Increasing the frequency, number and types of internal workplace safety audits, inspections and walk-throughs conducted by the Company’s EH&S staff.

Labor Practices and Human Rights. All of our employees earn more than the federal minimum wage and we believe our hourly wages are competitive with the local communities in which our facilities operate. The average hourly wage, excluding incentive compensation, of a full-time hourly employee of the Company was approximately $17.74 as of January 1, 2022, as compared to $16.26 as of January 2, 2021, with approximately one-half of those hourly employees earning an average hourly wage of $16.50 or more. The average total compensation, including incentive compensation and benefits, for a full-time hourly employee of our Company in 2021 was $43,500.
 We strive to help our employees maintain job stability, so they are encouraged to stay with the Company and positioned to grow their skills and knowledge on the job. The 2021 annualized voluntary turnover rate in our workforce generally was flat as compared to 2020. In an effort to reduce employee turnover, we engage in annual surveys with employees, we maintain an open-door policy that enables us to help identify any issues before they cause an employee to leave the Company, and we review exit interview data, hotline calls and root cause analysis to help deter turnover. We also assign dedicated Company human resources representatives to each department so that we can better monitor employee morale within each department.
Workforce Diversity and Inclusion. We believe in being an inclusive workplace for all of our employees and are committed to having a diverse workforce that is representative of the communities in which we operate and sell our products. A variety of perspectives enriches our culture, leads to innovative solutions for our business and enables us to better meet the needs of a diverse customer base and reflects the communities we serve. Our aim is to develop inclusive leaders and an inclusive culture, while also recruiting, developing, mentoring, training, and retaining a diverse workforce, including a diverse group of management-level employees.
 ● PGT Innovations Leading Ladies, a program designed to identify, develop and mentor female employees who have demonstrated potential for serving as leaders within our organization;
 ● Annual Diversity & Inclusion Training; and
● Dale Carnegie, a program that helps our managers understand how to appreciate, respect and value individual differences and behaviors.
 Additionally, we have a gender- and ethnically-diverse Board of Directors.
 Benefits and Well-Being. We believe in offering career opportunities, resources, programs, and tools to help employees grow and develop, as well as competitive wages and benefits to retain them. Our efforts in these areas include:
 ● Offering platforms, including on-line and in-person professional growth and development training, to help employees develop their skills and grow their careers at the Company;
 ● Providing management development training to all of our management-level employees, including compliance, ethics and leadership training;
 ● Providing employees with recurring training on critical issues such as safety and security, compliance, ethics and integrity and information security;
 ● Gathering engagement feedback from our employees on a regular basis and responding to that feedback in a variety of ways including personal, one-on-one interactions, team meetings, leadership communications, and town hall meetings with employees, led by senior executives;
 ● Offering a tuition reimbursement program that provides eligible employees up to $50,000 lifetime for courses related to current or future roles at the Company;
 ● Offering health benefits for all eligible employees, including our eligible hourly employees;
 ● Providing confidential counseling for employees through our Employee Assistance Program;
 ● Providing paid time off to eligible employees;
 ● Matching employees’ 401(k) plan contributions of up to 3% of eligible pay after 3 months of service;
 ● Offering an employee stock purchase program for eligible employees; and
 -  -


● Providing a Company-subsidized childcare center for the employees of our Venice, Florida facility, which is our largest location.
