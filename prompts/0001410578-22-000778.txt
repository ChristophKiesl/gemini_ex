Item 1. Business.
General
We are a newly incorporated blank check company, incorporated as a Cayman Islands exempted company, incorporated for the purpose of effecting a merger, stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization, or similar business combination with one or more businesses.
On December 13, 2021, as disclosed in our Form 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on December 13, 2021, Aries I Acquisition Corporation (“Aries”) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “Merger Agreement”), by and among Aries, Aries I Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a direct wholly-owned subsidiary of Aries, and Infinite Assets, Inc., a Delaware corporation (“Infinite”). In accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the Merger Agreement, at the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the “Closing”), each issued and outstanding share of common stock of Infinite will automatically be converted into a number of shares of Class A common stock of New Infinite (as defined below) equal to an exchange ratio determined by dividing (A) the quotient of (x) $525,000,000 divided by (y) the number of shares of Class A common stock of Infinite outstanding immediately prior to the Closing (after giving effect to the conversion of certain outstanding promissory notes) by (B) $10.00 per share (the “Merger Consideration”).
The Merger Agreement provides that, among other things and upon the terms and subject to the conditions thereof, the following transactions will occur (together with the other agreements and transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, the “Business Combination”): (i) immediately prior to the Closing, Aries will change its jurisdiction of incorporation by deregistering as an exempted company in the Cayman Islands and continuing and domesticating as a corporation under the laws of the State of Delaware, upon which Aries will change its name to “InfiniteWorld, Inc.” (“New Infinite”), and (ii) at the Closing, in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law, as amended (the “DGCL”), Merger Sub will merge with and into Infinite with Infinite surviving the merger as a direct, wholly-owned subsidiary of New Infinite.
The obligation of Aries and Infinite to consummate the Business Combination pursuant to the Merger Agreement is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain closing conditions, including, among others: (i) expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (the “HSR Act”); (ii) approval of the Business Combination and related agreements and transactions (as more particularly set forth in the Merger Agreement) by the respective shareholders of Aries and Infinite; (iii) the listing or receipt of approval for listing of New Infinite’s shares of Class A common stock on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange; and (iv) the conversion of Infinite’s outstanding convertible notes into Infinite common stock.
The Merger Agreement contains certain covenants, including, among others, providing for: (i) the parties to conduct their respective businesses in the ordinary course through the Closing; (ii) Infinite to provide to Aries and its representatives reasonable access through the Closing to Infinite’s properties, books, records and personnel; (iii) Infinite to prepare and deliver certain of its audited financial statements; (iv) the parties to use commercially reasonable best efforts to make all required filings pursuant to the HSR Act and to request early termination of all waiting periods applicable under the HSR Act.; (v) Aries and Infinite to prepare, and Aries to file, a registration statement on Form S-4 and the proxy statement in connection with the Business Combination and Aries to take certain other actions to obtain the requisite approval of Aries shareholders of certain proposals regarding the Business Combination; (vi) Aries to adopt, subject to the approval of its shareholders, the New Infinite Incentive Plan and an employee stock purchase plan; (vii) Aries to use all reasonable best efforts to cause the extensions to be effected, including causing the Sponsor to fund the extensions pursuant to the terms of Aries’ Amended and Restated Memorandum and Articles of Association (the “A&R Memorandum”) to extend the period of time for Aries to consummate a business combination; and (viii) the parties to not initiate any negotiations or enter into any agreements for certain alternative transactions. The Merger Agreement contains customary representations and warranties by Aries, Merger Sub, and Infinite. The representations and warranties of the respective parties to the Merger Agreement will not survive the Closing.
The Merger Agreement may be terminated under certain limited circumstances prior to the Closing, including, among others, (i) by mutual written consent of Aries and Infinite, (ii) by either Aries or Infinite if there is in effect any law or final, non-appealable order, judgment, injunction, decree, writ, ruling, stipulation, determination or award issued, promulgated, made, rendered or entered into by any court or other tribunal of competent jurisdiction that permanently restrains, enjoins, makes illegal or otherwise prohibits the consummation of the Business Combination, (iii) by either Aries or Infinite if the Closing has not occurred on or before November 21, 2022, (iv) by either Aries or Infinite if certain approvals of Aries’s shareholders are not obtained, (v) by Aries if the amendment to Infinite’s convertible notes and the related note purchase agreement is not executed and delivered by January 13, 2022 and (vi) by

Infinite if the date for Aries to complete its business combination is not extended pursuant to the terms of the A&R Memorandum. The foregoing description of the merger agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Agreement and Plan of Merger.
Redemption Rights for Holders of Public Shares Upon Consummation of Our Initial Business Combination
We will provide our public shareholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their Class A ordinary shares upon the completion of our initial business combination at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account calculated as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination, including interest earned on the funds held in the trust account and not previously released to us to pay our taxes, divided by the number of then outstanding public shares, subject to the limitations and on the conditions described herein. The amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be $10.10 per public share. The per share amount we will distribute to investors who properly redeem their shares will not be reduced by the deferred underwriting commissions we will pay to the underwriters. Our initial shareholders, sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and public shares they may hold in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Conduct of Redemptions Pursuant to Tender Offer Rules
If a shareholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a shareholder vote for business or other legal reasons, we will, pursuant to our amended and restated articles of incorporation: (a) conduct the redemptions pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E under the Exchange Act, which regulate issuer tender offers; and (b) file tender offer documents with the SEC prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, which regulates the solicitation of proxies. 
Submission of Our Initial Business Combination to a Shareholder Vote
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination, we will distribute proxy materials and, in connection therewith, provide our public shareholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination.
If we seek shareholder approval, we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares voted are voted in favor of the business combination. Our Sponsor has agreed to vote their Class B ordinary shares (“Founder Shares”) and any public shares purchased during or after the Public Offering in favor of our initial business combination. Each public shareholder may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction. In addition, our initial shareholders, Sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their Founder Shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination, although they are under no obligation to do so. There is no limit on the number of shares our initial shareholders, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with applicable law and the Nasdaq rules. However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of the funds in the Trust Account will be used to purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions. Such purchases may include a contractual acknowledgment that such shareholder, although still the record holder of our shares, is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights. If our Sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public shareholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights, such selling shareholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to (i) vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or (ii) satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters submitted to the warrant holders for approval in connection with our initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our Class A ordinary shares or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange.
Limitation on Redemption Rights Upon Completion of Our Initial Business Combination If We Seek Shareholder Approval
If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that a public shareholder, together with any affiliate of such shareholder or any other person with whom such shareholder is acting in concert or as a “group” (as defined in Section 13 of the Exchange Act), will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to excess shares without our prior consent. We believe this restriction will discourage shareholders from accumulating large blocks of shares, and subsequent attempts by such holders to use their ability to exercise their redemption rights against a proposed business combination as a means to force the Company or management to purchase their shares at a significant premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. Absent this provision, a public shareholder holding more than an aggregate of 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering could threaten to exercise its redemption rights if such holder’s shares are not purchased by us, our sponsor or our management at a premium to the then-current market price or on other undesirable terms. By limiting our shareholders’ ability to redeem no more than 15% of the shares sold in the Public Offering, we believe we will limit the ability of a small group of shareholders to unreasonably attempt to block our ability to complete our initial business combination, particularly in connection with a business combination with a target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. However, we would not be restricting our shareholders’ ability to vote all of their shares (including excess shares) for or against the Company’s initial business combination.
Redemption of Public Shares and Liquidation If No Initial Business Combination
Our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association provides that we will have only 12 months (or up to 18 months if we extend the period of time to consummate a business combination) from the closing of the Public Offering to consummate our initial business combination. If we are unable to consummate our initial business combination within such 12 (or 18)-month period, we will (i) cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up, (ii) as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter, redeem the public shares, at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest shall be net of taxes payable and up to $100,000 of interest to pay dissolution expenses), divided by the number of then issued and outstanding public shares, which redemption will completely extinguish public shareholders’ rights as shareholders (including the right to receive further liquidation distributions, if any), and (iii) as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption, subject to the approval of our remaining shareholders and our board of directors, liquidate and dissolve, subject in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) to our obligations under Cayman Islands law to provide for claims of creditors and in all cases subject to the other requirements of applicable law. There will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants, which will expire worthless if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the 12 (or 18)-month time period.
Competition
In identifying, evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination, we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours, including other blank check companies, private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds, and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions. Many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates. Moreover, many of these competitors possess greater financial, technical, human and other resources than us. Our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources. This inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business. Furthermore, our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants, and the future dilution they potentially

represent, may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses. Either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination.
Human Capital Disclosure
We currently have six executive officers: Randy Brinkley, Nathan Smith, Paul Wolfe, Andrew Lester, Josh Lewis and Ken Rosenblum. These individuals are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination. The amount of time they will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the stage of the business combination process we are in. We do not intend to have any full time employees prior to the completion of our initial business combination.
We endeavor to maintain workplaces that are free from discrimination or harassment on the basis of color, race, sex, national origin, ethnicity, religion, age, disability, sexual orientation, gender identification or expression or any other status protected by applicable law. The basis for recruitment, hiring, development, training, compensation and advancement is qualifications, performance, skills and experience. Our employees are fairly compensated, without regard to gender, race and ethnicity, and routinely recognized for outstanding performance.
