Item 1.Business
Overview
We are a publicly-traded limited partnership formed in 2005 focused on the acquisition, development, and ownership of infrastructure critical to the transition of energy supply to lower carbon sources. We own natural gas gathering systems, pipelines, and processing facilities in South Texas and continue to pursue energy transition infrastructure opportunities. Our common units are currently listed on the NYSE American under the symbol “SNMP.”
On February 26, 2021, in connection with our management team’s focus on expanding our business strategy to focus on the ongoing energy transition in the industries in which we operate, we changed our name to Evolve Transition Infrastructure LP and our general partner changed its name to Evolve Transition Infrastructure GP LLC.
COVID-19
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic caused incredible disruption to global economic and commercial activity and negatively impacted the global demand for oil and natural gas. COVID-19 was first reported in December 2019 and has since spread to nearly every country and territory around the globe, including every state in the United States. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide and the United States declared a national emergency with respect to COVID-19. As a result, extraordinary and wide-ranging actions were taken by international, federal, state and local public health and governmental authorities to reduce the spread of COVID-19, including quarantines, government restrictions on movement, business closures and suspensions, canceled events and activities, self-isolation, and other voluntary or mandated changes in behavior. Such actions have also resulted in significant business and operational disruptions, including supply chain disruptions, travel restrictions, stay-at-home orders and limitations on the availability of workforces. The continuance of the COVID-19 pandemic, including resurgences and variants of the virus, have continued to result in significant business and operational disruptions during 2021. While demand for oil and natural gas improved in 2021, it remains lower than pre-pandemic levels. We continue to evaluate remote work protocols in light of resurgences and variants of the virus and the advisability of continuing in-person operations based on federal, state, and local guidance, and the best interests of our employees, their families, customers and our unitholders.
Our Relationship with Mesquite
On June 6, 2020, the Partnership, our general partner and certain of our subsidiaries entered into the Settlement Agreement. On June 30, 2020, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Settlement Agreement.
On June 23, 2020, certain affiliates of Occidental Petroleum Corp., The Blackstone Group and GSO Capital Partners each filed a complaint (collectively, the “Rejection Lawsuits”) against Mesquite and certain of its subsidiaries requesting, among other things, that the Bankruptcy Court not approve the rejection of certain commercial agreements, as set forth in the Settlement Agreement, in connection with Mesquite’s Comanche Asset (as defined herein). As of December 2021 all of the Rejection Lawsuits were resolved.
On June 30, 2020, the SN Debtors emerged from bankruptcy, with Mesquite becoming a privately held corporation.
On June 24, 2021, the Partnership, our general partner, Catarina Midstream, LLC (“Catarina Midstream”) and Seco Pipeline LLC received written notice from Mesquite, of Mesquite’s intention to terminate the Settlement Agreement (the “Settlement Agreement Termination Notice”). The Settlement Agreement Termination Notice was delivered pursuant to Section 5.1.2 and/or 5.1.3 of the Settlement Agreement and the termination was effective as of the date of the notice.
On October 15, 2021, Mesquite and SN Catarina, LLC (“SN Catarina” and collectively, the “Mesquite Plaintiffs”) initiated adversary proceeding 21-03931 (MI) against the Partnership and Catarina Midstream in the Bankruptcy Court (the “Mesquite Adversary”). In the Mesquite Adversary, the Mesquite Plaintiffs seek recharacterization of the Catarina Transaction (as defined below under “—Midstream Business—Western Catarina Midstream”) as a disguised financing. 

7



The Mesquite Plaintiffs claim that SN Catarina is the legal owner of Western Catarina Midstream (as defined below under “—Midstream Business—Western Catarina Midstream”) and demand its return.
The Mesquite Plaintiffs also assert various claims for constructive and actual fraudulent transfer arising from (1) the Catarina Transaction; (2) payments made by SN Catarina to Catarina Midstream under the Gathering Agreement after Catarina Midstream increased tariff rates for interruptible throughput volumes from the eastern portion (“Eastern Catarina”) of Mesquite’s acreage position in Dimmit, La Salle and Webb counties in Texas; and (3) payments made by SN Catarina to Catarina Midstream for the incremental infrastructure fee under the Gathering Agreement amendment and on a month-to-month basis by mutual agreement of the parties after the amendment’s expiration. The Mesquite Plaintiffs seek declaratory relief related to the recharacterization claim as well as avoidance of the alleged constructive and actual fraudulent transfers and recovery of the amounts transferred to Catarina Midstream.
On August 30, 2021, Catarina Midstream, LLC, our wholly owned subsidiary (“Catarina Midstream”), initiated a non-administered arbitration against SN Catarina pursuant to the International Institute for Conflict Prevention & Resolution Non-Administered Arbitration Rules (the “Catarina Arbitration”). In the Catarina Arbitration, Catarina Midstream asserts claims for declaratory judgment and breach of contract arising from SN Catarina’s failure to pay increased tariff rates for interruptible throughput volumes from Eastern Catarina and its refusal to pay the incremental infrastructure fee since July 2021. Catarina Midstream also seeks its attorneys’ fees, costs, and pre- and post-judgment interest from SN Catarina. SN Catarina filed a counterclaim against Catarina Midstream alleging Catarina Midstream’s June 24, 2021 tariff rate increase, and its two prior tariff rate increases under the Gathering Agreement, constitute breaches of contract. SN Catarina also alleges that Catarina Midstream’s continued addition of the incremental infrastructure fee on a month-to-month basis after March 31, 2018 constitutes an additional breach of the Gathering Agreement. SN Catarina seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, monetary damages, and attorneys’ fees and costs.
Execution of Energy Transition Strategy
Levo JV Transaction
On May 17, 2021, we entered into a letter agreement (the “Levo Letter Agreement”) with Nuvve Holding Corp. (“Nuvve Holding”) and Stonepeak Rocket Holdings LP (“Stonepeak Rocket”), relating to the proposed formation of a joint venture, Levo Mobility LLC (“Levo” and such proposed joint venture, the “Levo JV”). In connection with the Levo Letter Agreement, on May 17, 2021, Nuvve Holding issued ten-year warrants to us as follows: (i) Series B Warrants to purchase 200,000 shares of Nuvve Holding’s common stock, at an exercise price of $10.00 per share, which are fully vested upon issuance, (ii) Series C warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of Nuvve Holding’s common stock, at an exercise price of $15.00 per share, which are vested as to 50% of the shares upon issuance and vest as to the remaining 50% when Levo has entered into contracts with third parties for $125 million in aggregate capital expenditures; (iii) Series D warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of Nuvve Holding’s common stock, at an exercise price of $20.00 per share, which are vested as to 50% of the shares upon issuance and vest as to the remaining 50% when Levo has entered into contracts with third parties for $250 million in aggregate capital expenditures; (iv) Series E warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of Nuvve Holding’s common stock, at an exercise price of $30.00 per share, which are vested as to 50% of the shares upon issuance and vest as to the remaining 50% when Levo has entered into contracts with third parties for $375 million in aggregate capital expenditures; and (v) Series F warrants to purchase 100,000 shares of Nuvve Holding’s common stock, at an exercise price of $40.00 per share, which are vested as to 50% of the shares upon issuance and vest as to the remaining 50% when Levo has entered into contracts with third parties for $500 million in aggregate capital expenditures (collectively the “Nuvve Holding Warrants”).
On August 4, 2021, we, Stonepeak Rocket and Nuvve Holding completed the formation of Levo and in connection therewith, we entered into an Amended and Restated Limited Liability Company Agreement for Levo (the “Levo LLC Agreement”). Pursuant to the Levo LLC Agreement, we and Stonepeak Rocket plan to make capital contributions to Levo in an aggregate amount of up to $750 million to finance Levo’s business, with a maximum of $75 million of such capital contributions being funded by us. The membership interests authorized by the Levo LLC Agreement consist of Class A Common Units, Class B Preferred Units, Class C Common Units and Class D Incentive Units. On August 4, 2021 in connection with the signing of the Levo LLC Agreement, Levo issued 2,800 Class B Preferred Units to Stonepeak Rocket, 1 Class B Preferred Unit to us, 441,000 Class C Common Units to Stonepeak Rocket, 49,000 Class C Common Units to us and 510,000 Class A Common Units to Nuvve Holding. Stonepeak Rocket agreed to pay to Levo an aggregate purchase

price of $2,800,044.10 for its Class B Preferred Units and Class C Common Units. We agreed to pay to Levo an aggregate purchase price of $1,004.90 for our Class B Preferred Unit and Class C Common Units. Each of us and Stonepeak Rocket are able to receive additional Class B Preferred Units in consideration for each $1,000 in additional capital contributions we make.
HOBO Transaction
On November 3, 2021, we entered into a Framework Agreement (the “Framework Agreement”) with HOBO Renewable Diesel LLC (“HOBO”). The Framework Agreement provides that, subject to the satisfaction of applicable conditions precedent, we will fund certain development expenses of HOBO as HOBO seeks to develop, construct, own and operate renewable fuels facilities. HOBO’s initial project is a 9,000 barrel per day (120 million gallons per year) renewable diesel production facility (the “Initial Project”).
Subject to the satisfaction of certain conditions, including HOBO securing a long-term strategic offtake agreement for the Initial Project, we will exclusively fund the development and construction of the Initial Project and future renewable fuels projects that can produce renewable diesel and sustainable aviation fuel (“SAF”) and contribute to the advancement of the transition to a low-carbon world. Renewable diesel and SAF are unique drop-in fuels that are immediately consumable by existing automotive and airplane engines and reduce carbon emissions relative to petroleum based products. These drop-in fuels are in increasingly high demand by customers, including the US federal government, as more organizations embrace de-carbonization. We and HOBO are also considering incorporation of additional carbon reduction opportunities into the Initial Project and future projects which the management teams believe could result in the production of some of the lowest carbon intensity fuels in the US. We refer to the transactions described above or otherwise contemplated by the Framework Agreement as the “HOBO Transaction.” As of March 29, 2022, we have not funded any development expenses related to the HOBO Transaction.
In furtherance of the Initial Project and to support our energy transition focus, key members of the HOBO leadership team joined the Partnership’s management team effective December 1, 2021. HOBO Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer Randy Gibbs was appointed as the new Chief Executive Officer of our general partner, and as a member of the Board, HOBO Co-Founder and President Mike Keuss was appointed as the new President and Chief Operating Officer of our general partner, and HOBO’s Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Hartigan was appointed as the new President and Chief Investment Officer of our general partner (collectively, the “New Executives”). Each of the New Executives accepted employment with our general partner effective November 3, 2021, and transitioned to their respective director and executive roles effective December 1, 2021. For additional information about the New Executives please read “Part III, Item 10. Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance.”
2021 Upstream Divestitures
In connection with our focus on the acquisition and development of infrastructure critical to the transition of energy supply to lower carbon sources, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold all of our remaining upstream oil and gas production assets in Texas and Louisiana. Each of the purchase agreements we entered into with respect to our Texas production assets (i) had an effective date of March 1, 2021, (ii) contained customary representations, warranties, covenants and indemnities, and (iii) provided that, other than a limited amount of retained obligations, the buyer assumed all obligations relating to the assets purchased. In September 2021 we sold our remaining de minimis Louisiana assets to the majority owner of such assets for an immaterial amount (the “Louisiana Divestiture”). The Louisiana Divestiture, together with the Palmetto Divestiture, the Maverick 1 Divestiture, the Maverick 2 Divestiture and the Maverick 3 Divestiture (as each is defined below), are collectively referred to in this Form 10-K as the “2021 Upstream Divestitures.”
Palmetto Divestiture
On April 30, 2021, but effective March 1, 2021, SEP Holdings IV, LLC (“SEP IV”), a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Partnership entered into a purchase agreement (the “Palmetto PSA”) with Westhoff Palmetto LP (“Palmetto Buyer”), pursuant to which SEP IV sold to Palmetto Buyer specified wellbores and other associated assets located in Gonzales and Dewitt Counties, Texas for a base purchase price of approximately $11.5 million, prior to applicable post-closing adjustments (the “Palmetto Divestiture”). The Palmetto Divestiture closed simultaneously with the execution of the Palmetto PSA.

Maverick Divestiture
On April 30, 2021, but effective March 1, 2021, SEP IV entered into a purchase agreement (the “Maverick PSA”) with Bayshore Energy TX LLC (“Maverick Buyer”), pursuant to which SEP IV sold to Maverick Buyer specified wellbores and other associated assets located in Zavala County, Texas for a base purchase price of approximately $2.8 million, prior to post-closing adjustments (the “Maverick 1 Divestiture”). The Maverick 1 Divestiture closed simultaneously with the execution of the Maverick PSA.
On April 30, 2021, SEP IV entered into a letter agreement with Maverick Buyer (the “Maverick Letter Agreement”) pursuant to which SEP IV agreed to sell additional other specified wellbores and other associated assets located in Zavala and Dimmit Counties, Texas (the “Maverick 2 Assets”) for a base purchase price of approximately $1.4 million (the “Maverick 2 Divestiture”). The closing of the Maverick 2 Divestiture was conditioned upon SEP IV obtaining certain consents and complying with other preferential rights related to the Maverick 2 Assets. Following the entrance into the Maverick Letter Agreement, SEP IV complied with the preferential rights and obtained multiple consents related to the Maverick 2 Assets. SEP IV did not obtain one of the required consents and, as a result, the Maverick 2 Assets subject to such consent were removed from the Maverick 2 Assets included in the Maverick 2 Disposition (the “Updated Maverick 2 Assets”) and the base purchase price was adjusted downward by approximately $31,000.
On May 14, 2021, but effective as of March 1, 2021, SEP IV and Maverick Buyer entered into a purchase agreement (the “Maverick 2 PSA”) pursuant to which SEP IV sold to Maverick Buyer the Updated Maverick 2 Assets. The Maverick 2 Divestiture closed simultaneously with the execution of the Maverick 2 PSA.
On August 13, 2021, but effect as of March 1, 2021, SEP IV and Maverick Buyer entered into a Purchase Agreement (the “Maverick 3 PSA”) pursuant to which SEP IV sold to Maverick Buyer specified wellbores and other associated assets located in Zavala County, Texas, including the Maverick 2 Assets excluded from the original closing of the Maverick 2 Divestiture (the “Maverick 3 Assets”) for a base purchase price of approximately $31,000, prior to post-closing adjustments (the “Maverick 3 Divestiture”). The Maverick 3 Divestiture closed simultaneously with the execution of the Maverick 3 PSA.
Our Relationship with Stonepeak 
Since October 14, 2015, Stonepeak Catarina has owned all of our issued and outstanding preferred units. As of March 29, 2022, Stonepeak owned (i) 96,734,084 common units, representing approximately 65% of our outstanding common units, (ii) all of our issued and outstanding Class C Preferred Units, (iii) the Stonepeak Warrant, which entitles Stonepeak Catarina to receive junior securities of the Partnership (including common units) representing 10% of all junior securities deemed outstanding when exercised, (iv) the non-economic general partner interest in the Partnership and (v) all of our incentive distribution rights. Stonepeak also owns 100% of the issued and outstanding equity interests in SP Holdings, which is the sole member of our general partner. SP Holdings has the right to appoint all of the members of the Board of directors other than two directors which Stonepeak Catarina is entitled to designate pursuant to that certain Amended and Restated Board Representation and Standstill Agreement, dated as of August 2, 2019. As a result of the foregoing, Stonepeak controls us and our general partner and has the ability to appoint all of the members of the Board. 
Stonepeak Catarina is indirectly managed by Stonepeak Partners LP, a leading North American infrastructure private equity firm (“Stonepeak Partners”). Stonepeak Partners’ significant infrastructure and midstream energy expertise and deep financial resources are reflected in over $46 billion of assets under management, with investments to date including, among others, preferred and common interests in the Partnership, MPLX LP, Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. and Targa Resources Corp. We believe that, as a result of Stonepeak’s significant ownership interest in us, Stonepeak is incentivized to support and promote our business plan and to encourage us to pursue projects that enhance the overall value of our business. While our relationship with Stonepeak is a significant strength, it is also a source of potential risks and conflicts. Please read “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Inherent in an Investment in Our Common Units” and “Part III, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”

--+---------------------------------------------------------------

Midstream Business
Western Catarina Midstream
In October 2015, we acquired (the “Catarina Transaction”) a gathering system from Mesquite (“Western Catarina Midstream”), which is located on the western portion of Mesquite’s acreage position in Dimmit, La Salle and Webb counties in Texas (such net acreage is collectively referred to herein as “Mesquite’s Catarina Asset,” and the western portion of such net acreage is individually referred to herein as “Western Catarina”). Western Catarina Midstream consists of approximately 160 miles of gathering pipelines, four main processing and gathering facilities, including stabilizers, storage tanks, compressors and dehydration units, and other related assets in Western Catarina, which are located in Dimmit and Webb counties in Texas, and services upstream production from assets located in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. The gathering lines range in diameter from four to 12 inches, with a capacity of 200 MMcf/d for natural gas, and 40 MBbl/d for crude oil and NGLs. There are four main gathering and processing facilities, which includes eight stabilizers of 5,000 Bbls/d, approximately 25,000 Bbls of storage capacity, pressurized storage for NGLs, approximately 23,000 horsepower of compression and approximately 300 MMcf/d of dehydration capacity. The gathering system is currently used solely to support the gathering, processing and transportation of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil produced by Mesquite at Mesquite’s Catarina Asset. The gathering system has oil interconnects with the Plains All American Pipeline, L.P. header system delivered to the Gardendale terminal, and to all four takeaway pipelines to Corpus Christi, and natural gas interconnects with Southcross Energy Partners, L.P., Kinder Morgan Inc., Energy Transfer Operating, L.P. and Targa Resources Corp.
In conjunction with the Catarina Transaction, we entered into the Gathering Agreement with Mesquite, pursuant to which Mesquite agreed to tender all of its crude oil, natural gas and other hydrocarbon-based product volumes on approximately 35,000 dedicated acres in Western Catarina for processing and transportation through Western Catarina Midstream, with the potential to tender additional volumes outside of the dedicated acreage.
All of the revenues from Western Catarina Midstream are currently earned from Mesquite. Mesquite is required to pay contractually agreed upon gathering and processing fees for oil and natural gas volumes tendered through Western Catarina Midstream. In June 2017, the Gathering Agreement was amended to add an incremental infrastructure fee to be paid by Mesquite based on water that was delivered to Western Catarina Midstream through March 31, 2018. The incremental infrastructure fee has not been paid since July 2021.
During the year ended December 31, 2021, Mesquite transported average daily production through Western Catarina Midstream of approximately 5.7 MBbls/d of oil, 75.1 MMcf/d of natural gas and 1.9 MBbls/d of water. The average age of the Western Catarina Midstream assets is approximately ten years, and such assets have an average expected life of approximately 19 additional years.

Carnero JV
In May 2018, we executed a series of agreements with Targa Resources Corp. (NYSE: TRGP) (“Targa”) and other parties pursuant to which, among other things: (1) the parties merged their respective 50% interests in Carnero Gathering, LLC (“Carnero Gathering”) and Carnero Processing, LLC (“Carnero Processing”) (the “Carnero JV Transaction”) to form an expanded 50 / 50 joint venture in South Texas, Carnero G&P, LLC (“Carnero JV”), (2) Targa contributed 100% of the equity interest in the Silver Oak II Gas Processing Plant located in Bee County, Texas (“Silver Oak II”), to Carnero JV, which expanded the processing capacity of the joint venture from 260 MMcf/d to 460 MMcf/d, (3) Targa contributed certain capacity in the 45 miles of high pressure natural gas gathering pipelines owned by Carnero Gathering that connect Western Catarina Midstream to nearby pipelines and the Raptor Gas Processing Facility (the “Carnero Gathering Line”) to Carnero JV resulting in the joint venture owning all of the capacity in the Carnero Gathering Line, which has a design limit (without compression) of 400 MMcf/d, (4) Carnero JV received a new dedication from Mesquite and its working interest partners of over 315,000 acres located in the Western Eagle Ford on Mesquite’s acreage in Dimmit, Webb, La Salle, Zavala and Maverick counties in Texas (such acreage is collectively referred to herein as “Mesquite’s Comanche Asset”) pursuant to a new long-term firm gas gathering and processing agreement. The agreement with Mesquite, which was approved by all of the unaffiliated Comanche non-operated working interest owners, establishes commercial terms for the gathering of gas on the Carnero Gathering Line and processing at the Raptor Gas Processing Facility and Silver Oak II. Prior to the Carnero JV Transaction, Comanche volumes were gathered and processed on an interruptible basis, with the processing capabilities limited by the capacity of the 260 MMcf/d cryogenic natural gas processing plant in La Salle County, Texas (the “Raptor Gas Processing Facility”). During the year ended December 31, 2021, certain assets within the Carneno JV were impaired. 
Seco Pipeline
In August 2017, we completed construction of a 100% owned and operated 30-mile natural gas pipeline with 400 MMcf/d capacity that is designed and used to transport dry gas from the Raptor Gas Processing Facility to multiple markets in South Texas (the “Seco Pipeline”). The Seco Pipeline has an expected life of approximately 40 years and provides upstream producers with optionality to southern gas markets and creates the potential to export natural gas to premium priced markets in Mexico. On September 1, 2017, we entered into a firm transportation service agreement with Mesquite to transport certain quantities of Mesquite’s natural gas on a firm basis through the Seco Pipeline for $0.22 per MMBtu delivered on or after September 1, 2017 (the “Seco Pipeline Transportation Agreement”). Mesquite terminated the Seco Pipeline Transportation Agreement on February 12, 2020 and, since such termination, we have not contracted with a customer for transportation on the Seco Pipeline or utilized the pipeline other than transportation of de minimis volumes required to comply with requirements under certain of our rights-of-way.
Title to Properties
Title to Western Catarina Midstream and the Seco Pipeline assets are either owned in fee or derived from leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits or licenses from landowners or governmental authorities, permitting the use of such land for our operations. We have no knowledge of any challenge to the underlying fee title of any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or license that is held by us or to the title to any material lease, easement, right-of-way, permit or lease we own, and we believe that we have satisfactory title to all of the material leases, easements, rights-of-way, permits and licenses with respect to all Western Catarina Midstream and Seco Pipeline assets.
Marketing and Major Customers
Prior to the completion of the 2021 Upstream Divestitures, our oil and natural gas production in Texas and Louisiana was marketed by the operators of our properties.
Mesquite accounted for 93% and 80% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We are highly dependent upon Mesquite as our most significant customer, and we expect to derive a substantial portion of our revenue from Mesquite in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the business risks of Mesquite. Any development that materially and adversely affects Mesquite’s operations or financial condition could have a material adverse impact on us. For additional information on the risks associated with our relationship with Mesquite, please read “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors.”

12



Markets and Competition
We operate in a competitive environment for acquiring, funding and developing infrastructure assets and properties and retaining trained personnel. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, technical and personnel resources than us. As a result, our competitors may be able to outbid us for assets or properties, more competitively price their gathering and transportation services, or utilize superior technical resources than our financial or personnel resources permit. Our ability to acquire additional assets will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable assets and to consummate transactions in a competitive environment.
The natural gas gathering, compression, treating and transportation business is very competitive. Upon such time that we seek to obtain customers in addition to Mesquite for Western Catarina Midstream, our competitors will include other midstream companies, producers and intrastate and interstate pipelines. Competition for volumes is primarily based on reputation, commercial terms, reliability, service levels, location, available capacity, capital expenditures and fuel efficiencies.
Stonepeak is not restricted from competing with us. Please read “Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Stonepeak Catarina and its affiliates, including our general partner, will have conflicts of interest with us. They will not owe any fiduciary duties to us or our common unitholders, but instead will owe us and our common unitholders limited contractual duties, and they may favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our other common unitholders.” Additional information regarding our relationship with Stonepeak is provided in “Part III, Item 13. Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence.”
Governmental Regulation
Environmental Laws
Our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations governing environmental protection as well as the discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations may, among other things:
​

● | require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------


● | restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances, including water and waste, that can be released into the environment;
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | limit or prohibit activities on lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas; and
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations, such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These laws, rules and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible in the absence of such regulations. The regulatory burden on the oil and natural gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability. In addition, federal, state and local authorities frequently revise environmental laws and regulations, and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal and cleanup requirements for the oil and natural gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs.
Environmental laws and regulations that could have a material impact on the oil and natural gas industry and our operations include the following:
Waste Handling
The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (“RCRA”) and comparable state laws regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and cleanup of hazardous wastes and non-hazardous wastes. With the approval of the federal Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”), the individual states can administer some or all of the provisions of RCRA, and some states have adopted their own, more stringent requirements. Drilling fluid, produced water and most 

13



other wastes associated with the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas are currently regulated under RCRA’s non-hazardous waste provisions. Although we do not believe that the current costs of managing any of our wastes are material under presently applicable laws, any future reclassification of oil and natural gas exploration, development and production wastes as hazardous wastes, could increase our costs to manage and dispose of wastes.
Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act
The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (“CERCLA”), also known as the Superfund law, can impose joint and several liability, without regard to fault or legality of conduct, on classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons can include the owners or operators of the site where the release occurred, and anyone who disposed of, or arranged for the disposal of, a hazardous substance released at the site. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, including response costs, alternative water supplies, damages to natural resources and the costs of certain health studies. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the hazardous substances released into the environment. Each state also has environmental cleanup laws analogous to CERCLA.
We currently own, lease or operate numerous properties that have been used for oil and natural gas production for a number of years. Although we believe that operating and waste disposal practices utilized in the past with respect to these properties were typical for the industry at the time, hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons may have been released on or under the properties owned or leased by us, or on or under other locations, including off-site locations, where such substances have been taken for disposal. In addition, these properties have been operated by third parties or by previous owners or operators whose practices, including the treatment and disposal or release of hazardous substances, wastes or hydrocarbons were not under our control. These properties and the substances disposed or released on them may be subject to CERCLA, RCRA and analogous state laws. Under such laws, we could be required to remove previously disposed substances and wastes, remediate contaminated property or perform remedial plugging or pit closure operations to prevent future environmental harm.
Water Discharges
The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (the “Clean Water Act”), and comparable state laws, impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants, including spills and leaks of produced water and other oil and natural gas wastes, into waters of the United States. The discharge of pollutants into regulated waters is prohibited, except in accordance with the terms of a permit issued by the EPA or an analogous state agency. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties, impose investigatory or remedial obligations and issue injunctions limiting or preventing our operations for non-compliance with discharge permits or other requirements of the Clean Water Act and analogous state laws and regulations.
Oil Pollution Act
The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 amended the Clean Water Act in large part due to the Exxon Valdez incident. Under the Oil Pollution Act, the EPA was directed to promulgate regulations which would create a comprehensive prevention, response, liability and compensation program to deal with oil discharged into United States navigable waters. The Oil Pollution Act imposes ongoing requirements on owners and operators of facilities that handle certain quantities of crude oil, including the preparation of oil spill response plans and proof of financial responsibility to cover environmental cleanup and restoration costs that could be incurred in connection with a spill. The Oil Pollution Act imposes liability for removal costs and damages resulting from an incident in which oil is discharged into navigable waters and establishes liability for damages for injuries to, or loss of, natural resources.
Air Emissions
The Clean Air Act, and comparable state laws, regulate emissions of various air pollutants through air emissions permitting programs and the imposition of other requirements. In addition, the EPA has developed, and continues to develop, stringent regulations governing emissions of toxic air pollutants at specified sources. States can also impose air 

14



emissions limitations that are more stringent than the federal standards imposed by the EPA. Federal and state regulatory agencies can impose administrative, civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance with air permits or other requirements of the Clean Air Act and associated state laws and regulations. Rules restricting air emissions may require a number of modifications to our operations, including the installation of new equipment. Compliance with such rules could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our operating results. However, we believe that our operations will not be materially adversely affected by any such requirements, and the requirements are not expected to be any more burdensome to us than to other similarly situated companies. We believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with federal and state air emission standards.
Climate Change 
The U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. The EPA is considering rulemaking proposals in accordance with Executive Order 13990 Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis (“E.O. 13990”) which was signed by President Biden in January 2021 seeking to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and suspend, revise or rescind prior agency actions that are identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration’s climate policies. In November 2021, EPA proposed rules to reduce methane and other air pollutants from both new and existing sources in the oil and gas industry. A number of state and regional efforts have also emerged that are aimed at tracking and/or reducing GHG emissions by means of cap and trade programs that typically require major sources of GHG emissions, such as electric power plants, to possess and acquire emission allowances which permit corresponding GHG emissions. Furthermore, the U.S. is currently a party to the Paris Agreement adopted in December 2015 to reduce global GHG emissions. 
Hydraulic Fracturing
Hydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The process is typically regulated by state oil and natural gas commissions. However, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing practices and has finalized a study of the potential environmental impacts of hydraulic fracturing activities, finding that under certain circumstances, the “water cycle” activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources. In 2014, the EPA released an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rulemaking seeking public comment on its plans to issue regulations under the Toxic Substances Control Act of 1976 to require companies to disclose information regarding chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing. The states in which we operate have also adopted disclosure requirements related to fracturing fluids. Legislation has been introduced, but not adopted, in Congress to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. In addition, some states have adopted, and other states are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. Currently, no states in which we utilize hydraulic fracturing have adopted these regulations. In addition, President Biden has declared that he would support federal government efforts to limit or prohibit hydraulic fracturing. These declarations include threats to take actions banning hydraulic fracturing of crude oil and natural gas wells and banning new leases for production of minerals on federal properties, including onshore lands and offshore waters. On January 20, 2021, the Acting Secretary for the Department of the Interior signed an order suspending new fossil fuel leasing and permitting on federal lands for 60 days. In addition, E.O. 13990 includes provisions seeking to adopt new regulations and policies to address climate change and suspend, revise, or rescind, prior agency actions that are identified as conflicting with the Biden Administration’s climate policies. Among the areas that could be affected by the review are regulations addressing hydraulic fracturing. At this time, it is not possible to accurately estimate how these recent actions and future rules and rulemaking initiatives under the Biden administration will impact our business.
Endangered Species
The federal Endangered Species Act (“ESA”) was established to protect endangered and threatened species. Pursuant to the ESA, if a species is listed as threatened or endangered, restrictions may be imposed on activities adversely affecting that species’ habitat. Similar protections are offered to migratory birds under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (“FWS”) may designate critical habitat and suitable habitat areas that it believes are necessary for the survival of a threatened or endangered species. A critical habitat or suitable habitat designation could result in further material restrictions and may materially delay or prohibit land access for development. Moreover, as a result of a settlement 

15



approved by the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in September 2011, the FWS was required to make a determination on the listing of more than 250 species as endangered or threatened under the ESA by the end of the agency’s 2017 fiscal year. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where we operate could cause us to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or could result in limitations on our activities.
Gathering System Regulation
Regulation of gathering facilities may affect certain aspects of our business and the market for our services. Historically, the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the U.S. federal government, primarily the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”). The FERC regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates, terms and conditions of service, which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce, as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas.
The transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce are regulated primarily under the Natural Gas Act (“NGA”), and by regulations and orders promulgated under the NGA by the FERC. In certain limited circumstances, intrastate transportation, gathering, and wholesale sales of natural gas may also be affected directly or indirectly by laws enacted by the U.S. Congress and by FERC regulations. 
Section 1(b) of the NGA exempts natural gas gathering facilities from regulation by the FERC under the NGA. We believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests that the FERC has used to establish whether a pipeline is a gathering pipeline not subject to FERC jurisdiction. However, the distinction between FERC-regulated transmission services and federally unregulated gathering services has been the subject of substantial litigation and varying interpretations. In addition, the FERC determines whether facilities are gathering facilities on a case-by-case basis, so the classification and regulation of our natural gas gathering facilities are subject to change based on future determinations by the FERC, the courts, or the U.S. Congress. If the FERC were to determine that an individual gathering system is not exempt from FERC regulation and the pipelines associated with such gathering system provide interstate transportation, the rates for, and terms and conditions of, services provided by such gathering system would be subject to regulation by the FERC. Such regulation could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, could adversely affect results of operations and cash flows. If any of our facilities were found to have provided services or otherwise operated in violation of the NGA or the NGPA, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties as well as a requirement to disgorge charges collected for such service in excess of the cost-based rate established by the FERC. 
Gathering services, which may occur upstream of transmission service subject to FERC jurisdiction, is regulated by the states. State regulation of gathering facilities generally includes various safety, environmental and, in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take requirements and complaint-based rate regulation. Our purchasing and gathering operations are subject to ratable take and common purchaser statutes in the State of Texas. The ratable take statute generally requires gatherers to take, without undue discrimination, natural gas production that may be tendered to the gatherer for handling. Similarly, the common purchaser statute generally requires gatherers to purchase without undue discrimination as to source of supply or producer. These statutes are designed to prohibit discrimination in favor of one producer over another producer or one source of supply over another source of supply. These statutes have the effect of restricting our right as an owner of gathering facilities to decide with whom we contract to purchase or transport gas.
The Railroad Commission of Texas (“TRRC”) requires gatherers to file reports, obtain permits, make books and records available for audit and provide service on a nondiscriminatory basis. Shippers and producers may file complaints with the TRRC to resolve grievances relating to natural gas gathering access and rate discrimination.
While our gathering systems have not been regulated by the FERC under the NGA, the U.S. Congress may enact legislation or the FERC may adopt regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non-FERC jurisdictional facilities to further regulation. Changes in law and to FERC policies and regulations may adversely affect the availability and reliability of firm and/or interruptible transportation service on interstate pipelines, and we cannot predict what future action FERC will take. We do not believe, however, that any regulatory changes will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way they will affect other natural gas gatherers with which we compete. Failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject us to civil penalty liability.

The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (“EPAct 2005”), amended the NGA to add an anti-market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by the FERC, and furthermore provides the FERC with additional civil penalty authority. The EPAct 2005 provided the FERC with the power to assess daily civil penalties for violations of the NGA and the Natural Gas Policy Act (“NGPA”). The civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce. In Order No. 670, the FERC promulgated rules implementing the anti-market manipulation provision of the EPAct 2005. The rules make it unlawful, in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to: (1) use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; (2) make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or (3) engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. The anti-market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non-jurisdictional sales or gathering, but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services, as well as otherwise non-jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted “in connection with” gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. 
Pipeline Safety Regulation
We are subject to regulation by the United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”) through the Pipelines and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (“PHMSA”), pursuant to the Hazardous Liquid Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, as amended (“HLPSA”) and comparable state statutes with respect to design, installation, inspection, testing, construction, operation, replacement and maintenance of pipeline facilities. HLPSA, as amended, governs he design, installation, testing, construction, operation, replacement and management of crude oil pipeline facilities and also covers petroleum and petroleum products, including NGLs and condensate, and requires any entity that owns or operates pipeline facilities to comply with such regulations, to permit access to and copying of records and to file certain reports and provide information as required by the U.S. Secretary of Transportation. These regulations include potential fines and penalties for violations. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with these HLPSA regulations.
Our natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by PHMSA pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968 (“NGPSA”) and the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (“PSIA”), as reauthorized and amended by the Pipeline Inspection, Protection, Enforcement and Safety Act of 2006 (“PIPES Act”). The NGPSA regulates safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of gas pipeline facilities, while the PSIA establishes mandatory inspections for all U.S. oil and natural gas transmission pipelines in high-consequence areas (“HCAs”). 
PHMSA has developed regulations that require pipeline operators to implement integrity management programs, including more frequent inspections and other measures to ensure pipeline safety in HCAs. The regulations require operators, including us, to: 

● | perform ongoing assessments of pipeline integrity;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | identify and characterize applicable threats to pipeline segments that could impact HCAs;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | improve data collection, integration and analysis;
--+---------------------------------------------------


● | repair and remediate pipelines as necessary; and
--+-------------------------------------------------


● | implement preventive and mitigating actions.
--+---------------------------------------------

The HLPSA has been amended by the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act of 2011 (“2011 Pipeline Safety Act”) and the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2016 (“2016 Pipeline Safety Act The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act increased the penalties for safety violations, established additional safety requirements for newly constructed pipelines and required studies of safety issues that could result in the adoption of new regulatory requirements by PHMSA for existing pipelines. The 2011 Pipeline Safety Act doubled the maximum administrative fines for safety violations from $100,000 to $200,000 for a single violation and from $1 million to $2 million for a related series of violations, but provided that these maximum penalty caps do not apply to certain civil enforcement actions. Effective April 27, 2017, to account for inflation, those maximum civil penalties were increased to 

17



$213,268 per day, with a maximum of $2,132,679 for a series of violations. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act extended PHMSA’s statutory mandate through 2019. The 2016 Pipeline Safety Act also empowers PHMSA to address imminent hazards by imposing emergency restrictions, prohibitions and safety measures on owners and operators of hazardous liquid pipeline facilities without prior notice or an opportunity for a hearing. PHMSA issued interim regulations in October 2016 to implement the agency’s expanded authority to address unsafe pipeline conditions or practices that pose an imminent hazard to life, property, or the environment.
PHMSA regularly revises its pipeline safety regulations and has published advanced notices of proposed rulemakings and notices of proposed rulemaking to solicit comments on the need for changes to its natural gas and liquid pipeline safety regulations. In the past few years, PHMSA issued advisory bulletins providing guidance on applicable regulatory requirements, including those that must be followed for the abandonment of a pipeline; aspects of overall pipeline integrity, including the need for corrosion-control systems on buried and insulated pipeline segments, to conduct in-line inspections for all threats, and to ensure in-line inspection tool findings are accurate and verified; the need of owners and operators of natural gas facilities to take appropriate steps to prevent damage to pipeline facilities from accumulated snow or ice; actions pipeline operators should consider taking to ensure the integrity of pipelines in the event of severe flooding or hurricane damage; notice of construction; flow reversal procedures; product changes and conversion; integrity management program evaluation metrics; and incident response plans. Further changes to PHMSA’s rules are expected in the future. 
For example, in July 2015, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing, among other things, to extend operator qualification requirements to operators of certain natural gas gathering lines and to add a specific timeframe for operators’ notifications of accidents or incidents. In January 2017, PHMSA issued a final rule adding a specific timeframe for operators’ notifications of accidents or incidents but delayed final action on the operator qualification proposals until a later date. The final rule became effective March 24, 2017. In addition, in October 2015, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking proposing changes to its hazardous liquid pipeline safety regulations, including to extend: (i) reporting requirements to all onshore or offshore, regulated or unregulated hazardous liquid gathering lines; and (ii) certain integrity management periodic assessment and remediation requirements to regulated onshore gathering lines. On January 13, 2017, PHMSA issued a final rule amending its regulations to impose new reporting requirements for certain unregulated pipelines, including all hazardous liquid gathering lines. The final rule also significantly extends and expands the reach of certain integrity management requirements, regardless of the pipeline’s proximity to HCAs. However, this final rule remains subject to review and approval by the new administration, pursuant to a memorandum issued by the White House to heads of federal agencies. It is unclear whether the final rule will be revised and when it will be implemented. In April 2016, PHMSA issued a notice of proposed rulemaking that would expand integrity management requirements and impose new pressure requirements on currently regulated gas transmission pipelines and would also significantly expand the regulation of gas gathering lines, subjecting previously unregulated pipelines to requirements regarding damage prevention, corrosion control, public education programs, maximum allowable operating pressure limits and other requirements. On October 1, 2019, PHMSA issued its final rule which became effective July 1, 2020. While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, such regulatory changes and any legislative changes could have a material effect on our operations, particularly by extending more stringent and comprehensive safety regulations (such as integrity management requirements) to pipelines and gathering lines not previously subject to such requirements. While we expect any legislative or regulatory changes to allow us time to become compliant with new requirements, costs associated with compliance may have a material effect on our operations.
Furthermore, DOT regulations have incorporated by reference the American Petroleum Institute Standard 653 (“API 653”) as the industry standard for the inspection, repair, alteration and reconstruction of storage tanks. API 653 requires regularly scheduled inspection and repair of such tanks. These periodic tank maintenance requirements may result in significant and unanticipated capital and operating expenditures for repairs or upgrades deemed necessary to ensure the continued safe and reliable operation of our storage tanks.
States are largely preempted by federal law from regulating pipeline safety for interstate lines but most are certified by the DOT to assume responsibility for enforcing intrastate pipeline regulations and inspection of intrastate pipelines. For example, in Texas the Pipeline Safety Department of the TRRC inspects and enforces the pipeline safety regulations for intrastate pipelines, including gathering lines. States may adopt stricter standards for intrastate pipelines than those imposed by the federal government for interstate lines; however, states vary considerably in their authority and capacity to address pipeline safety. State standards may include more stringent requirements for facility design and management in 

18



addition to requirements for pipelines. We do not anticipate any significant difficulty in complying with applicable state laws and regulations. Our pipelines have ongoing inspection and compliance programs designed to keep the facilities in compliance with pipeline safety and pollution control requirements. 
We have incorporated all existing requirements into our programs by the required regulatory deadlines and are continually incorporating the new requirements into procedures and budgets. We expect to incur increasing regulatory compliance costs, based on the intensification of the regulatory environment and upcoming changes to regulations as outlined above. In addition to regulatory changes, costs may be incurred when there is an accidental release of a commodity gathered on our system, or a regulatory inspection identifies a deficiency in our required programs.
Other Laws and Regulation
We are subject to the requirements of the federal Occupational Safety and Health Act (“OSHA”), and comparable state laws. These laws and the implementing regulations strictly govern the protection of the health and safety of employees. The OSHA hazard communications standard, OSHA Process Safety Management, the EPA community right-to-know regulations under Title III of CERCLA and similar state laws require that we organize and/or disclose information about hazardous materials used or produced in our operations. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with these applicable requirements.
We believe that we are in substantial compliance with existing environmental laws and regulations applicable to our current operations and that our continued compliance with existing requirements should not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. As of December 31, 2019, we had no accrued environmental obligations. We are not aware of any environmental issues or claims that will require material capital expenditures or that will otherwise have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. However, we cannot predict how future environmental laws and regulations may impact our operations, and therefore, cannot provide assurance that the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.
Human Capital
Headcount
We do not have any employees. Pursuant to the terms of the Operational Services Agreement, our subsidiary SNMP Services provides us and certain of our subsidiaries, including SEP IV, Catarina Midstream and SECO Pipeline, LLC, with payroll, human resources, employee benefits and other consulting services we mutually agree upon with SNMP Services. As of March 29, 2022, fifteen (15) employees were employed by SNMP Services with their primary function being to provide services for us, all of which were full-time employees. None of SNMP Services’ employees are subject to a collective bargaining agreement. When we refer to “our employees” in this Form 10-K we are referring the SNMP Services’ employees. Our success is due in large part to the skills, experience and dedication of such employees. 
Employee Safety
We believe our responsibility to our employees, neighbors, shareholders and the environment is only fulfilled through our commitment to safety and reliability. Through training, continuous monitoring and promoting a culture of excellence in operations, we continuously strive to keep our people, the communities in which we operate in and the environment safe. By monitoring the integrity of our assets and promoting the safety of our employees, we are investing in the long-term sustainability of our business. 
We are subject to the requirements of OSHA and comparable state statutes that regulate the protection of the health and safety of workers. In addition, the OSHA Hazard Communication Standard requires that information be maintained about hazardous materials used or produced in operations and that this information be provided to employees, state and local government authorities and citizens. We believe that our operations are in compliance with OSHA requirements, including general industry standards, record keeping requirements and monitoring of occupational exposure to regulated substances.

19



In response to COVID-19, we have taken steps to manage the potential impacts of the COVID-19 outbreak on our employees. We continue to practice remote work procedures when possible to protect the safety of our employees and their families, and have taken extra precautions for our employees who work in the field or cannot otherwise work remotely, such as social distancing, face covering protocols and sanitation procedures.
Development and Retention
In managing our human capital resources, we use a strategic approach to building a diverse, inclusive, and respectful workplace. SNMP Services provides expertise and tools to attract, develop, and retain diverse talent and support our employees’ career and development goals. We value our employees’ opinions and encourage them to engage with management and ask questions on topics such as our goals, challenges, and employee concerns. 
We believe that a combination of competitive compensation and career growth and development opportunities help increase employee morale and reduce voluntary turnover. Our comprehensive benefit packages are competitive in the marketplace and we believe in recognizing and rewarding talent through our various compensation programs.
Health and Welfare
We provide a variety of benefits to help promote the health and welfare of our employees and their families. These benefits include medical, dental, vision plans and virtual health visits. Eligible employees also have access, at no charge, to an employee assistance program.
