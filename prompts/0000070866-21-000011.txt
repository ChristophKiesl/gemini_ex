Item 1.        BUSINESS

General Development of the Business
NCR was originally incorporated in 1884 and has developed to become a leading software- and services-led enterprise provider in the financial, retail, hospitality and telecommunications and technology industries. The solutions we provide help our customers, businesses of all sizes, run self-directed banking, stores and restaurants end-to-end and wall-to-wall, by making simple possible through our NCR-as-a-Service solutions that bring together all of the capabilities and competencies of NCR.

We also resell third-party networking products and provide related service offerings in the telecommunications and technology sectors. Our business has evolved from providing hardware and services, to providing software and services within solutions that allow us to increasingly become strategic partners to our customers, helping them build their business strategies and deliver targeted business outcomes.

Operating Segments 
We categorize our operations into the following segments: Banking, Retail, Hospitality and Telecommunications and Technology (T&T). 
The information required by Item 1 with respect to our reportable segments and financial information regarding our geographic areas and those reportable segments can be found in Item 7 of Part II of this Report under “Revenue and Operating Income by Segment” as well as in Item 8 of Part II of this Report as part of Note 4, “Segment Information and Concentrations” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Our Strategy
In order to provide long-term value to all of our stakeholders, we set complementary business goals and financial strategies. Our business goal is to be a software and services-led company, and to be the leading technology provider of choice that runs the store, runs the restaurant and runs self-service banking channels around the world through our NCR-as-a-Service solutions that help banks, stores and restaurants run better, so they have more time to create customer experiences that drive lasting success. Our financial strategy is to transition our revenue mix so that 80 percent of our total revenue is comprised of software and services revenue, 60 percent of our total revenue is comprised of recurring revenue, and our adjusted EBITDA margin rate increases to 20 percent. 
Execution of our goals and strategy is driven by the following key pillars:
•Focus on our customers. We encourage our employees to treat every customer as if they are our only customer. If we provide better service and better quality products than our competitors, our customers will likely buy more from NCR. We are increasingly becoming active, strategic advisors to our clients, helping them retool and reinvent their business in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe this focus has or will lead to increased access to higher level customer contacts, earlier entrance into the sales cycles, and additional opportunities for upselling and cross-selling.
•Take care of our employees. Our 36,000 employees are the direct face of NCR to our clients. Since 2018, NCR has actively worked to increase employee engagement and satisfaction.
•Bring high-quality, innovative products to market. Since 2018, NCR has focused our research and development investments on elevating product quality and bringing new solutions to market in our key focus areas of digital banking, our next-generation retail architecture, including our NCR EmeraldTM cloud-based point of sale product, our AlohaTM Essentials solution bundle, payments and ATM-as-a-Service. Additionally, we have placed an increasing priority on improvements in how we go to market, deliver our solutions and package our solutions as all-in-one solution bundles, making it easier for our customers to buy and for our teams to sell.
•Leverage our brand. NCR has one of the best-known and respected brands in the industries we serve. We believe this to be a strong competitive differentiation with significant equity in our worldwide markets.

Target Markets and Distribution Channels 
NCR provides solutions to customers of varying sizes in the financial, retail, hospitality and T&T industries. 
We provide the banking technology that helps customers run self-directed banking, which primarily centers around our digital banking and ATM businesses, including software and services. Our solutions also serve the retail markets through convenience banking products for retailers designed to complement their core businesses. Our financial solutions customers are located throughout the world in both developed and emerging markets. We have historically sold most of our Banking segment solutions through a direct sales channel, although a portion of revenue is derived through distributors and value-added resellers.
We provide solutions to the retail and hospitality industries that help run the store and run the restaurant including, but not limited to, point-of-sale software and hardware, self-service software and hardware, loyalty software, supply chain and payment solutions. We also provide store virtualization, Internet of Things (IoT), and micro-services platform solutions to modernize store and restaurant IT infrastructure. Our Retail segment customers include food, drug and mass merchandisers, which includes grocery stores, drug stores, and big box retailers, as well as department and specialty retail stores, convenience and fuel retailers and small and medium size specialty retailers. Our Hospitality segment customers include quick service restaurants, table service restaurants, 
small and medium size restaurants as well as travel and entertainment venues. POS and self-service kiosk solutions are sold through a direct sales force and through relationships with value-added resellers, distributors, dealers and other indirect sales channels.
We provide service and support for our products and solutions through services contracts with our customers. We have also established managed services contracts with key customers and continue to pursue additional managed services relationships. Longer term managed services arrangements can help improve the efficiency and performance of a customer’s business, and also increase the strategic and financial importance of its relationship with NCR. We also service competing technologies—for example, ToshibaTec retail technologies and Diebold Nixdorf ATMs. The primary sales channel for our services is our direct sales teams, which exist across all geographies where we operate around the world. Our services professionals provide these services directly to end customers. 
Competition 
We face a diverse group of competitors in the financial, retail and hospitality and other industries, including the telecommunications and technology industry, in which we sell our digital first portfolio of software, services and hardware. The primary competitive factors can vary by geographic area where we operate around the world, but typically include: value and quality of the solutions or products; total cost of ownership; industry knowledge of the vendor; the vendor’s ability to provide and support a total end-to-end solution; the vendor’s ability to integrate new and existing systems; fit of the vendor’s strategic vision with the customer’s strategic direction; and quality of the vendor’s consulting, deployment and support services.
In the financial industry, our Banking segment faces a variety of competitors offering financial services and software including, among others, Fidelity National Information Services Inc., Fiserv, Inc., Q2 Holdings, Inc., Temenos AG, Infosys Ltd., Alkami Technology, Inc. and ACI Worldwide, Inc. In addition, we face competition from ATM manufacturers including Diebold Nixdorf, Inc., and Hyosung TNS Inc., and ATM network operators including Euronet Worldwide, Inc., as well as regional firms across all geographies where we operate around the world.
In the retail and hospitality industries, our Retail and Hospitality segments face a variety of competitors across all geographies where we operate around the world. Our competitors vary by market segment, product, service offering and geographic area, and include Toshiba Tec Corporation, Flooid, Oracle Corporation, GK Software SE, PAR Technology Corporation, Aptos, Inc., Lightspeed, Diebold Nixdorf, Inc., Fujitsu Limited, SAP and HP Inc., among others. In addition, we face new competitors including Toast, Inc., Revel Systems, Inc., Square, Inc., and Upserve, Inc., among others. 
The primary services competitors are the companies identified above, as well as other regional and local independent services firms across all geographies where we operate around the world. We also face services competition from global enterprise technology companies including IBM Corporation, and CompuCom (owned by Office Depot) among others, as these firms continue to focus on services as a core business strategy.
Research and Development 
We remain focused on designing and developing solutions that anticipate our customers’ changing technological needs as well as consumer preferences. Our expenses for research and development were $234 million in 2020, $259 million in 2019, and $252 million in 2018. We anticipate that we will continue to have significant research and development expenditures in the future in order to provide a continuing flow of innovative, high-quality products and services and to help maintain and enhance our competitive position. Information regarding the accounting and costs included in research and development activities is included in Note 1, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report under "Research and Development Costs," and is incorporated herein by reference. 
Patents and Trademarks 
NCR seeks patent protection for its innovations, including improvements, associated with its software, services, hardware, solutions, creations and developments, where such protection is likely to provide value, especially strategic value, to NCR. NCR owns approximately 1,250 patents in the U.S. and numerous other patents in foreign countries. The foreign patents are generally counterparts of NCR’s U.S. patents. Many of the patents owned by NCR are licensed to others, and NCR is licensed under certain patents owned by others. As appropriate, NCR looks to monetize its patents to drive additional value from its patent portfolio. NCR also has numerous patent applications pending in the U.S. and in foreign countries. NCR’s portfolio of patents and patent applications is of significant value to NCR. 
NCR has registered certain trademarks, including service marks, in the U.S. and in foreign countries. NCR considers the “NCR” and NCR logo marks, as well as its other trademarks and service marks, to have significant value to NCR. Loss of NCR’s right to use the NCR trademark could be material. However, the NCR trademark has been used and owned by NCR for at least 100 years, and NCR expects to maintain it rights in and to the NCR trademark for years to come.
Seasonality 
Our sales have been historically seasonal, with lower revenue in the first quarter and higher revenue in the fourth quarter of each year. Such seasonality also causes our working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on variability in the volume, timing and mix of sales. In addition, revenue in the third month of each quarter is typically higher than in the first and second months. However, with the financial strategy to transition our revenue mix to comprise a higher mix of software and services and recurring revenue, our sales are expected to become more linear over time.
Manufacturing and Raw Materials 
In most cases, there are a number of vendors providing the services and producing the parts and components that we utilize. However, there are some services and components that are purchased from single sources due to price, quality, technology or other reasons. For example, we depend on computer chips and microprocessors from Intel and operating systems from Microsoft. Certain parts and components used in the manufacturing of our ATMs and the delivery of many of our retail solutions are also supplied by single sources. In addition, there are a number of key suppliers for our businesses who provide us with critical products for our solutions.
As of December 31, 2020, NCR leverages a network of internal and third party partner facilities across the globe to manufacture its products:
•ATMs are manufactured in NCR facilities located in Manaus, Brazil; Budapest, Hungary; and Chennai, India and partner facilities located in Chihuahua, Mexico.
•SCO solutions are manufactured in NCR facilities located in Budapest, Hungary; Chennai, India and partner facilities located in Chihuahua, Mexico and Xiamen, China.
•Kiosk solutions are manufactured in NCR facilities located in Budapest, Hungary; Manaus, Brazil; and Chennai, India and partner facilities in Buford, Georgia, USA.
•POS/Display terminals are manufactured in NCR facilities located in Budapest, Hungary and partner facilities located in Guadalajara, Mexico and Xiamen, China.
Additionally, NCR outsources the manufacturing of certain printers, bar code scanners and various other retail peripherals such as keyboards and cash drawers.
Further information regarding the potential impact of these relationships on our business operations, and regarding sources and availability of raw materials, is also included in Item 1A of this Report under the caption “Reliance on Third Parties,” and is incorporated herein by reference.
Product Backlog 
Backlog includes orders confirmed for products scheduled to be shipped as well as certain professional and transaction services to be provided. Although we believe that the orders included in the backlog are firm, some orders may be canceled by the customer without penalty. Even when penalties for cancellation are provided for in a customer contract, we may elect to permit cancellation of orders without penalty where management believes it is in our best interests to do so. Further, we have a significant portion of revenue derived from service-based business, which backlog information has not historically been measured. Therefore, we do not believe that our backlog, as of any particular date, is necessarily indicative of revenue for any future period. However, backlog is included as a component of our remaining performance obligation to the extent we determine that the orders are non-cancelable. Refer to Note 1, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of Part II of this Report for additional information on remaining performance obligations.
Risk Management
In 2020, NCR’s Board of Directors created a new committee of the Board, the Risk Committee. The Committee assists NCR’s Board of Directors with its oversight of executive management’s responsibilities to design, implement and maintain an effective enterprise risk management (ERM) framework for the Company’s overall operational, information security, strategic, reputational, technology, environmental, social and governance (ESG), and other risks. The Committee also assists the Board of Directors with 
its oversight responsibilities for matters relating to diversity and inclusion, health, environment, safety, sustainability, and the security of personnel and physical assets. Also in 2020, NCR established the Office of Risk Management and appointed a Chief Risk Officer to assist NCR and the Risk Committee in fulfilling its objectives relating to ERM, ESG, third party risk management (TPRM) and business continuity planning (BCP). The Company’s Chief Risk Officer is responsible for developing and managing formal ERM, ESG, TPRM and BCP programs designed to identify, assess and respond to material and emerging risks and opportunities that may impact the achievement of the Company’s strategic objectives. NCR has established an Executive Risk Committee that will meet routinely to monitor material risks, opportunities and NCR's response plans thereto.
ESG
At NCR, we believe in creating positive change that supports an innovative future – but even more so, we believe in creating that future in a responsible way. Through our ESG strategy, we are committed to addressing key areas that our employees, customers, stockholders, suppliers, and communities care about most. In 2020, NCR established the key ESG Priorities detailed below to drive our ESG strategy. 
ESG Oversight. NCR’s Board of Directors has direct oversight of ESG activities through its Risk Committee. The Risk Committee assists the Board in managing ESG Priorities. The Risk Committee and other committees of the Board oversee components of ESG, including, business ethics and integrity, data protection and security, diversity, equity and inclusion (DE&I), environmental management, our people, product innovation and management, and supplier responsibility. Further, our Chief Risk Officer provides senior-level ESG ownership of and execution on our ESG Priorities, and reports on those activities to the Board’s Risk Committee. 
Business Ethics and Integrity. Our Code of Conduct sets forth standards designed to uphold our values and foster integrity in our relationships with one another and our valued stakeholders. Our Code of Conduct is available at https://www.ncr.com/company/corporate-governance/code-of-conduct.
All our employees are required to complete Code of Conduct training during the onboarding period. All employees are required to complete annual refresher Code of Conduct training. The Code of Conduct training is revised annually, taking into account the prior year’s compliance matters and the Company’s compliance risks.
Our Ethics and Compliance Program is responsible for managing the company’s adherence to the Code of Conduct. Further, our Chief Ethics and Compliance Officer oversees ethical reporting and investigations pertaining to fraud, conflicts of interest, violations of laws, and other similar matters, and reports on those activities to one or more Committees of the Board of Directors.
Data Protection and Security. At NCR, we are proud of our data protection, cybersecurity, and privacy programs. These initiatives receive oversight from the Board’s Risk Committee, as well as several members of our executive leadership team including the Chief Operations Officer, General Counsel, Chief Information Officer, and Chief Technology Officer. NCR’s Chief Information Security Officer and Chief Privacy Officer are responsible for management of these programs. Additional support is provided by our Chief Ethics & Compliance Officer. Under the direction of NCR’s Chief Information Security Officer, the Global Information Security organization is responsible for implementing and maintaining an information security program with the goal to protect information technology resources and protect the confidentiality and integrity of data gathered on our people, partners, customers, and business assets. Also, we employ various information technology and protection methods designed to promote data security including firewalls, intrusion prevention systems, denial of service detection, anomaly based detection, anti-virus/anti-malware, endpoint encryption and detection and response software, Security Information and Event Management system, identity management technology, security analytics, multi-factor authentication and encryption. To further our commitment to data privacy and cybersecurity: NCR maintains the ISO 27001 certification for certain NCR locations throughout the United States, Europe, and India; third party audits for PCI-DSS, PA-DSS and SSAE-18 SOC2 are conducted for certain service offerings; NCR maintains a robust information security awareness and training program pursuant to which employees are required to complete training within 30 days of hire, as well as an annual refresher course, and NCR performs regular testing to help ensure employees can identify email “phishing” attacks; NCR's corporate insurance policies include certain information security risk policies that cover network security, privacy and cyber events; and we maintain the NCR Privacy Policy that can be found at https://www.ncr.com/privacy.
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion. NCR believes in the power and value of diversity and strives to build a globally inclusive workplace where all people are treated fairly. The Board of Directors and its Risk Committee have direct oversight of our diversity, equity and inclusion activities, including those described under the caption “Human Capital Resources” in Item 1 of this Report.
Environmental Management. We are committed to managing our environmental footprint and protecting the global communities in which we operate. We strive to minimize our operations and products' environmental impact while also delivering innovative technologies and solutions designed to support businesses and consumers in their efforts to operate responsibly. We also recognize the importance of minimizing our environmental footprint through energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) management. That is why we report our Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions from our global facilities and service operations through the Carbon Disclosure Project 
(CDP). We complete the annual CDP climate change questionnaire and evaluate our environmental management progress annually to better understand our areas of opportunity to make a true impact.
Our commitment to environmental management extends into our products and operational footprint. Our Brazil, Hungary, and India facilities maintain the ISO 14001 certification. The NCR Global Headquarters in Midtown Atlanta has been awarded two Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum certifications: Building Design and Construction: Core & Shell and Interior Design; and Construction: Commercial Interiors.
Our People. At NCR, we believe that investment in our employees has a positive impact on our employees and our customers. We put that into action with several employee development and engagement programs, including those described under the caption “Human Capital Resources” in Item 1 of this Report.
Product Innovation and Management. Delivering solutions and services that provide value to our customers in an environmentally responsible way is critical to NCR’s ongoing success. As such, we strive to develop and adapt, and recycle our products in a responsible way. One example of how we are already doing this is that certain of our applications, such as Intelligent Deposit and Self-Service Diagnostic Gateway (SSDG), enable our SelfServ ATM customers to better handle the increasing volume – cutting down on costs, maintenance, fuel and materials associated with them.
Supplier Responsibility. We believe in creating positive change responsibly, and our supplier partners play a critical role in bringing that vision to life. We not only expect high quality products and services from our suppliers, we also expect them to conduct their businesses consistent with our Supplier Code of Conduct. Our Supplier Code of Conduct, available at https://www.ncr.com/company/suppliers/manuals-forms-and-templates, sets forth our expectation that our suppliers will meet ethical standards consistent with NCR’s Code of Conduct and policies. Additionally we take a risk-based approach to supply chain due diligence. We engage with the majority of our largest suppliers on a quarterly basis to identify potential risk exposure. As part of our supplier partner onboarding process, supplier partners are required to certify compliance with International Electrotechnical Commission 62474 standards. NCR requires its supplier partners to maintain compliance with the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive, Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) Regulation, and other applicable regulations.
Human Capital Resources
General. NCR views taking care of our people as a critical part of our strategy. We strive to enable a culture and employment brand that attracts, develops and retains top talent. Our talent focus areas in 2020 were aligned to three basic areas:
•building a ONE NCR culture that is focused on our customers, employees and stockholders; 
•preparing our next generation of leaders through extensive training, coaching, mentoring and succession planning supported through our NCR Leadership Institute; and
•hiring the next generation of NCR innovators through our university hiring and partnership programs that help us sustain and strengthen our efforts to be the home of a diverse workforce. 
On December 31, 2020, NCR had approximately 36,000 employees and contractors worldwide. Given the multinational nature of our business, we monitor our global employment footprint. As of December 31, 2020, our employees by geographic region included approximately: 25% in the Asia Pacific and Japan region; 34% in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region; 12% in the Americas, excluding the United States; and 29% in the United States. 
Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I). NCR believes in the power and value of diversity and strives to build a globally inclusive workplace where all people are treated fairly. The Board of Directors and its Risk Committee have direct oversight of DE&I activities. In 2020, we appointed a DE&I leader to oversee NCR’s DE&I programs and goals. Our key initiatives in 2020 included, amongst others: 
•driving workforce diversity guidance programs, which include a quarterly DE&I learning and speaker series;
•activating a supplier diversity program that invests in small businesses, as well as minority, women and veteran-owned business enterprises;
•creating the Global Inclusion Council (GIC), under the executive sponsorship of our President and Chief Executive Officer, and our Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer, with the mission to inspire action that attracts top talent, creates an inclusive work environment that values the diversity of life experiences and perspectives, and encourages innovation in pursuit of NCR’s mission; and
•sponsoring various Business Resource Groups (BRGs), which are voluntary, employee-led groups that foster a diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplace aligned with NCR’s mission, values, goals, business practices and 
objectives, including NCR’s Black Professionals Forum, Women in NCR, and United (LGBTQIA+). We look to support additional BRGs where it will help support our employees.
Employee Engagement, Learning and Development. To further the objectives described above, we regularly seek our employees’ feedback on employee experiences so we can align our objectives with employees’ experiences, building on what we do well and designing programs to improve where needed. We also invest in training and development for our employees, with a focus on safety and security, code of conduct, civil treatment in the workplace, and unconscious bias, among other topics. Further, we sponsor various mentorship programs organized by our BRGs or within our business units or infrastructure groups. 
Government Regulations
NCR is subject to a variety of evolving government laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations, in the various jurisdictions in which our offerings are used, including, for example, privacy and data protection laws, regulations and directives, and anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.K. Bribery Act. In addition, though not material to our business taken as a whole, certain parts of NCR’s operating segments are subject to industry-specific laws and regulations. For example, in our Banking segment, our digital banking business is subject to examination by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Counsel (FFIEC), while portions of our Payments business are contractually obligated to comply with certain anti-money laundering laws and regulations, such as the Bank Secrecy Act. 
Although NCR does not currently expect that compliance with government laws and regulations, including environmental regulations, will have a material effect upon the capital expenditures, cash flow, financial condition, earnings and competitive position of NCR, its segments or its subsidiaries, it is possible that such compliance could have a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, cash flow, financial condition, earnings or competitive position, including, but, not limited to, as NCR's Banking or Payments-related businesses grow or change as NCR continues to implement its business strategy. Further, while NCR does not currently expect to incur material capital expenditures related to compliance with such laws and regulations, and while we believe the amounts provided in our Consolidated Financial Statements are adequate in light of the probable and estimable liabilities in this area, there can be no assurances that environmental matters will not lead to a material adverse impact on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. A detailed discussion of the current estimated impacts of compliance issues relating to environmental regulations, particularly the Fox River, Kalamazoo River and Ebina matters, is reported in Item 8 of Part II of this Report as part of Note 9, "Commitments and Contingencies" of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and is incorporated herein by reference. Further information regarding the potential impact of compliance with governmental laws and regulations is also included in Item 1A of this Report and is incorporated herein by reference.
