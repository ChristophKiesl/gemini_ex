Item 1. Business.
Graham Holdings Company (the Company) is a diversified education and media company whose operations include educational services; television broadcasting; online, print and local TV news; home health and hospice care; and manufacturing. The Company’s Kaplan, Inc. (Kaplan) subsidiary provides a wide variety of educational services, both domestically and outside the United States (U.S.). The Company’s media operations comprise the ownership and operation of television broadcasting (through the ownership and operation of seven television broadcast stations) plus Slate and Foreign Policy magazines; and Pinna, an ad-free audio streaming service for children. The Company’s home health and hospice operations provide home health, hospice and palliative services. The Company’s manufacturing companies comprise the ownership of a supplier of pressure treated wood, an electrical solutions company, a manufacturer of lifting solutions, and a supplier of certain parts used in electric utilities and industrial systems. The Company also owns automotive dealerships, restaurants, a custom framing service company, a cybersecurity training company, a marketing solutions provider, and a customer data and analytics software company. The Company sold Megaphone, a technology podcasting company, in December 2020.
Financial information concerning the principal segments of the Company’s business for the past three fiscal years is contained in Note 19 to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements appearing elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Revenues for each segment are shown in Note 19 gross of intersegment sales. Consolidated revenues are reported net of intersegment sales, which did not exceed 0.1% of consolidated operating revenues.
The Company’s operations in geographic areas outside the U.S. consist primarily of Kaplan’s non-U.S. operations. During each of the fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018, these operations accounted for approximately 22%, 24% and 24%, respectively, of the Company’s consolidated revenues, and the identifiable assets attributable to non-U.S. operations represented approximately 21% and 24% of the Company’s consolidated assets at December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.
Education
Kaplan, a subsidiary of the Company, provides an extensive range of education and related services worldwide for students and professionals. In 2020, Kaplan served approximately 700,000 students and professionals worldwide and had associations with approximately 14,000 companies and commercial relationships with approximately 4,000 universities, colleges, schools and school districts across the globe. Kaplan conducts its operations through three segments: Kaplan North America Higher Education, Kaplan North America Supplemental Education, and Kaplan International. As more fully described below, Kaplan consolidated its former Kaplan Higher Education, Kaplan Test Preparation and Kaplan Professional segments into one business, Kaplan North America, operating through two segments, Higher Education and Supplemental Education. In addition, the results of the Kaplan Corporate segment include results of Kaplan’s investment activities in education technology companies. The following table presents revenues for each of Kaplan’s segments:

 | Year Ended December 31
(in thousands) | 2020 | | 2019 | | 2018
Kaplan International | $ | 653,892 | | | $ | 750,245 | | $ | 719,982 
Kaplan North America Higher Education | 316,095 | | | 305,672 | | | 342,085
Kaplan North America Supplemental Education | 327,087 | | | 388,814 | | | 390,289
Kaplan Corporate and Intersegment Eliminations | 8,639 | | | 7,019 | | | (1,341)
Total Kaplan Revenue | $ | 1,305,713 | | | $ | 1,451,750 | | $ | 1,451,015

In 2020, Kaplan combined its three segments based in the United States (Kaplan Higher Education, Kaplan Test Preparation and Kaplan Professional) into one business known as Kaplan North America. The combination reinforces Kaplan’s interconnected products and services, increases competitiveness in Kaplan’s markets and drives efficiencies. 
Kaplan International
Kaplan International (KI) operates businesses in Europe and the Middle East, North America and the Asia Pacific region, each of which is discussed below. In March 2020, Kaplan acquired BridgeU, a provider of university and careers guidance services for global and international schools. 
Europe and Middle East. In Europe, KI operates the following businesses, all of which are based in the United Kingdom (U.K.) and Ireland: Kaplan UK, KI Pathways, KI Languages, Mander Portman Woodward, Dublin Business School, Kaplan Open Learning and BridgeU. In the Middle East, Kaplan International has operations in the United Arab Emirates.
The Kaplan UK business in Europe, through Kaplan Financial Limited, is a provider of apprenticeship training and test preparation services for accounting and financial services professionals, including those studying for ACCA, CIMA and ICAEW qualifications. In 2020, Kaplan UK provided courses to over 48,000 students in accountancy and financial services. In addition, Kaplan UK is the sole authorized assessment provider for the Solicitors Regulation Authority of assessments under The Qualified Lawyers Transfer Scheme for candidates seeking to become solicitors of England and Wales who are already qualified lawyers in certain recognized jurisdictions, and will in 2021 transition to being the sole authorized assessment provider for the Solicitors Qualifying Examination for all candidates seeking to become a solicitor in England and Wales. Kaplan UK is headquartered in London, England, and has 21 training centers located throughout the U.K.
The KI Pathways business offers academic preparation programs especially designed for international students who wish to study for degrees from universities in English-speaking countries. In 2020, university preparation programs were delivered in Australia, Japan, Myanmar, Singapore and the U.K.
The KI Languages business provides English-language training, academic preparation programs and test preparation for English proficiency exams, principally for students wishing to study and travel in English-speaking countries. As of December 31, 2020, KI Languages operates 25 English-language schools, with 18 located in the U.K., Ireland, Australia, New Zealand and Canada and seven located in the U.S. In 2020, KI Languages served approximately 15,000 students for in-class English-language instruction. Through the Alpadia language schools, KI Languages also offers French and German language training in France, Germany, Switzerland and the U.K. Alpadia has four language schools, located in France, Germany and Switzerland, and operates summer camps for juniors in other European destinations. KI Languages also offers Spanish language training in four Spanish cities through its partnership with Enforex.
Mander Portman Woodward (MPW) is a U.K. independent sixth-form college that prepares domestic and international students for A-level examinations that are required for admission to U.K. universities. MPW operates three colleges, in London, Cambridge and Birmingham. 
KI also operates Dublin Business School in Ireland, a higher education institution, and Kaplan Open Learning in the U.K., an online learning institution. At the end of 2020, these institutions enrolled an aggregate of approximately 9,000 students. 
In 2020, Kaplan Professional ME (formerly Kaplan Genesis), a financial training business operating in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, taught approximately 1,600 students.
U.K. Immigration Regulations. Certain KI businesses serve a significant number of international students; therefore, the ability to sponsor international students to come to the U.K. is critical to these businesses. Pursuant to regulations administered by the United Kingdom Visas and Immigration Department (UKVI), the KI Pathways business is required to hold or operate Student Route sponsorship licenses (which replaced Tier 4 licenses) for international students to be permitted to enter the U.K. to study the courses that KI Pathways delivers. One of the KI Languages schools also has a Student Route license to enable it to teach international students, although students at these schools generally choose to enter the U.K. on a Visitor or Short Term Student visa as opposed to a Student Route visa. 
Each Student Route license holder is required to have passed the Basic Compliance Assessment (BCA) and hold Educational Oversight accreditation. Students who do not satisfy these criteria cannot be issued a Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies by KI’s U.K. schools, which is a prerequisite for obtaining a Student Route visa. The UKVI rules also require all private institutions to obtain Educational Oversight accreditation, which requires a current and satisfactory full risk assessment, audit or review by the appropriate academic standards body. For the ninth consecutive year, all of KI institutions have retained Educational Oversight accreditation, with high grades across all colleges, and all Student Route annual BCA renewals have been approved with high scores in the core measurable requirements. KI Languages has one U.K. English-language school listed on the Kaplan Student master license. The MPW schools each hold current Student and Child Student Route licenses and have performed well consistently, with good records in their Office for Standards in Education, Children’s Services and Skills (OFSTED) and Independent Schools Inspectorate (ISI) Educational Oversight inspections.

The Higher Education and Research Act 2017 (HERA), formally approved on April 27, 2017, significantly reformed the regulation of the higher education sector in the U.K., including the formation of a new regulator for England, the Office for Students (OfS). The OfS published regulatory guidance in April 2019, including the new Regulatory Framework for Higher Education in England. Students enrolled at Pathways institutions registered with the OfS are, subject to the institution meeting certain compliance requirements, given many of the same student privileges as students of universities in the U.K. All of KI’s other higher education businesses in the U.K., excluding Glasgow International College and University of York International Pathway College, successfully completed registration with the OfS in 2020 to ensure that they could continue operating and retain their Student sponsor licenses and/or continue to accept students funded by U.K. student loans. Glasgow International College, which is located in 
Scotland, is not regulated by the OfS and remains overseen by the Quality Assurance Agency for higher education (QAA). York Pathway College forms part of the University of York’s OfS registration. No assurance can be given that each KI business in the U.K. will be able to maintain its Student Route or Child Student Route BCA status and Educational Oversight or OfS/QAA registration. Maintenance of each of these approvals requires compliance with several core metrics that may be difficult to sustain. Loss by one or more institutions of either Student BCA status or Educational Oversight or OfS/QAA registration, would have a material adverse effect on KI Europe’s operating results.
Impact of Brexit. On June 23, 2016, the U.K. held a referendum in which voters approved a proposal that the U.K. leave the European Union (EU), commonly referred to as “Brexit.” The U.K.’s withdrawal became effective on January 31, 2020, at which time it entered an 11-month transition period which ended December 31, 2020. The impact of Brexit on KI over time will depend on the agreed terms of the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU. Uncertainty over the impact and terms of Brexit trade deals may materially diminish interest in traveling to the U.K. for study. If the U.K. is no longer viewed as a favorable study destination, KI’s ability to recruit international students will be adversely impacted, which would materially adversely affect KI’s results of operations and cash flows. As part of the new trade deal, the EU did not grant the U.K. an adequacy decision under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Instead, the EU and U.K. agreed to delay restrictions on the transfer of personal data for an initial period of at least four months from January 1, 2021, which can be extended to up to six months. If the EU does not determine that the U.K. is an adequate destination for the transfer of personal data by the end of the relevant period, all transfers of personal data from the European Economic Area (EEA) must be made with alternative safeguards. If the U.K. does not receive a determination of adequacy under EU law, then KI will need to work with its corporate and university clients, suppliers, business partners and affiliates in order to implement suitable alternative safeguards to transfer personal data from the EEA to the U.K. KI will also need to review the position under U.K. law. The U.K. has on a transitional basis deemed the EEA to be adequate, meaning that currently alternative safeguards are not required in order to transfer personal data from the U.K. to the EEA. However, this adequacy can be removed at any time by the U.K. which may require KI to implement suitable alternative safeguards.
Revised U.K. immigration rules became effective on January 1, 2021, as the Brexit transition was completed. Effective January 1, 2021, all international students, including EEA and Swiss students studying in the U.K. for more than six months, are required to obtain a Student Route visa unless they are undertaking an English language course under a Short Term Study visa of up to 11 months. Free movement ceased between the EEA (together with Switzerland) and the U.K.; students from these countries entering the U.K. are now subject to the same U.K. immigration rules as students from outside the EEA and Switzerland. EEA and Swiss nationals commencing a higher education course in England from August 2021 will no longer qualify for home fee status or have access to financial support from Student Finance England. It is unclear how international student recruitment agents and prospective international students may view the U.K. as a study destination after the introduction of any new immigration requirements, the EU exit negotiations and the U.K.’s exit from the EU. The introduction of revised immigration rules has historically increased, and may continue to increase, KI’s operating costs in the U.K. The introduction of new visa and other administrative requirements for entry into the U.K., Brexit and the perception of the U.K. as a less favorable study destination may have a materially adverse impact on KI’s ability to recruit international students and KI’s results of operations and cash flows. 
Asia Pacific. In the Asia Pacific region, Kaplan operates businesses primarily in Singapore, Australia, New Zealand and the People’s Republic of China, including the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (Hong Kong).
In Singapore, Kaplan operates two business units: Kaplan Higher Education and KHEA-Genesis (which comprises the former Kaplan Financial and Kaplan Professional business units). During 2020, the Higher Education and KHEA-Genesis (Financial) divisions served more than 10,300 students from Singapore and approximately 4,100 students from other countries throughout Asia and Western Europe. KHEA-Genesis (Professional) provided short courses to approximately 700 professionals, managers, executives and businesspeople in 2020.
Kaplan Singapore’s Higher Education business provides students with the opportunity to earn bachelor’s and postgraduate degrees in various fields on either a part-time or full-time basis. Kaplan Singapore’s students receive degrees from affiliated educational institutions in Australia, Ireland and the U.K. In addition, this division offers pre-university and diploma programs.
Kaplan Singapore’s KHEA-Genesis Financial (KHEA-Genesis) business provides preparatory courses for professional qualifications in accountancy and finance, such as the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) and Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA). Kaplan Singapore’s Professional business, through Kaplan Learning Institute, an authorized SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG) Approved Training Organization (ATO), provided professionals with various skills training through workforce skills qualifications (WSQ) courses. Kaplan Learning Institute ceased offering such courses and voluntarily deregistered Kaplan Learning Institute as a private education institution on March 9, 2020, following a notice in June 2019 from SSG suspending Kaplan Singapore Professional’s WSQ ATO status and revoking accreditation and funding for all WSQ courses effective July 1, 2019. These actions have adversely affected and will continue to adversely affect Kaplan Singapore’s revenues and operating results. 
On October 7, 2020, Kaplan Higher Education Academy (KHEA) was granted approval by SSG to deliver WSQ courses as an ATO for a period of two years. KHEA-Genesis is currently securing approvals from SSG for the WSQ courses they intend to offer, with the aim of having the first courses authorized to commence in the second quarter of 2021.
In Australia, Kaplan delivers a broad range of financial services programs from certificate level through master’s level, together with professional development offerings through Kaplan Professional, as well as higher education programs in business, accounting, hospitality, and tourism and management through Kaplan Business School. In 2020, these businesses provided courses to approximately 5,000 students through face-to-face classroom programs (within Kaplan Business School) and approximately 26,000 students through online or distance-learning programs offered by Kaplan Professional. In 2020, Kaplan Professional also had approximately 35,000 subscribers for Ontrack, its continuing professional development platform for financial services professionals.
Kaplan Australia’s English-language business is part of KI Languages, which operates across five locations in Australia and one location in New Zealand, teaching approximately 3,000 students in 2020. The Kaplan Australia Pathways business is also part of KI Pathways. It consists of Murdoch Institute of Technology and the University of Adelaide College and offered face-to-face pathways and foundational education to approximately 1,300 students wishing to enter Murdoch University in Perth and the University of Adelaide in 2020. The contract with Murdoch University to run the Murdoch Institute of Technology is set to expire in June 2021. In November 2019, Kaplan Australia obtained regulatory approval to operate a Melbourne campus for the University of Adelaide, which will commence in March 2021. In November 2020, Kaplan Australia also entered into a seven-year partnership with the University of Newcastle, Australia to operate an on-campus pre-University pathway college offering pathways and English language programs.
Kaplan Australia also owns Red Marker Pty Ltd., a machine learning and artificial intelligence-based provider of regulatory software for the financial services industry. Red Marker’s Artemis product detects potentially noncompliant content as it is being created, helping advisers and licensees to identify and remediate compliance risks associated with the promotion of financial products or services. 
In Hong Kong, Kaplan operates three main business units: Kaplan Financial, Kaplan Language Training and Kaplan Higher Education, serving approximately 9,200 students annually. 
Kaplan Hong Kong’s Financial division delivers preparatory courses to approximately 7,400 students and business executives wishing to earn professional qualifications in accountancy, financial markets designations and other professional fields.
Hong Kong’s Language Training division offers test preparation for both overseas study and college applications, including TOEFL, IELTS, SAT and GMAT, to approximately 700 students.
Kaplan Hong Kong’s Higher Education division offers both full-time and part-time programs to approximately 1,100 students studying for degrees from leading Western universities. Students earn doctorate, master’s and bachelor’s degrees in Hong Kong. Kaplan also offers a proprietary pre-college diploma program through the Kaplan Business and Accountancy School.
In 2014, Kaplan Holdings Limited (Hong Kong) signed a joint venture agreement with CITIC Press Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, the parties incorporated a joint venture company, Kaplan CITIC Education Co. Limited, 49% of which is owned by Kaplan Holdings Limited. The joint venture company is carrying out publishing and distribution of Kaplan Financial training products in the People’s Republic of China (including CFA, FRM and ACCA) and is expanding its business with other Kaplan divisions under an intellectual property license from Kaplan. 
Each of Kaplan’s international businesses is subject to unique and often complex regulatory environments in the countries in which they operate, and the degree of consistency in the application and interpretation of such regulations can vary significantly in certain jurisdictions.
Kaplan North America
As discussed above, in the second half of 2020 Kaplan combined its Kaplan Higher Education, Kaplan Test Preparation and Kaplan Professional segments into one business named Kaplan North America (KNA). The following disclosure combines those now legacy segments under the Kaplan North America business comprised of two segments, Kaplan North America Higher Education (comprising primarily former Kaplan Higher Education (KHE) products and services) and Kaplan North America Supplemental Education (comprising primarily former Kaplan Test Preparation (KTP) and former Kaplan Professional (KP) products and services).
Kaplan North America Higher Education 
Until March 22, 2018, through the KHE segment, Kaplan provided postsecondary education services to students through Kaplan University’s (KU) online and fixed-facility colleges. KU provided a wide array of certificate, diploma and degree programs designed to meet the needs of students seeking to advance their education and career goals.
On March 22, 2018, certain subsidiaries of Kaplan contributed the institutional assets and operations of KU to a new university: an Indiana nonprofit, public-benefit corporation affiliated with Purdue University, known as Purdue University Global (Purdue Global). As part of the transfer to Purdue Global, KU transferred students, academic personnel, faculty and operations, property leases for KU’s campuses and learning centers, and Kaplan-owned academic curricula and content related to KU courses. Kaplan also indemnified Purdue for certain pre-closing liabilities. At the same time, KU and Purdue Global entered into a Transition and Operations Support Agreement, which was amended on July 29, 2019 (TOSA), pursuant to which KNA provides key non-academic operations support to Purdue Global. Kaplan received nominal cash consideration upon the transfer of the institutional assets and operations of KU. The combination of the KHE, KTP and KP segments into one KNA business did not change Kaplan’s or Purdue Global’s obligations under the TOSA.
The transfer of KU did not include any of the assets of the KU School of Professional and Continuing Education (now managed by KNA), which provides professional training and exam preparation for professional certifications and licensures. The transfer also did not include the transfer of other Kaplan businesses.
KNA also provides similar non-academic operations support services for online pre-college, certificate, undergraduate and graduate programs to institutions such as Purdue University and Wake Forest University. These are the same services and operations provided by the KHE segment which is now a part of the KNA business. 
Transition and Operations Support Agreement (TOSA). Purdue Global operates largely online as an Indiana public university affiliated with Purdue University. The operations support activities that KNA provides to Purdue Global (and other institutions of higher education, including Purdue University) include technology support, help-desk functions, human resources support for transferred faculty and employees, admissions support, financial aid processing, marketing and advertising, back-office business functions, certain test preparation, and domestic and international student recruiting services.
Pursuant to the TOSA, KNA is not entitled to receive any reimbursement of costs incurred in providing support functions, or any fee, unless and until Purdue Global has first covered all of its operating costs (subject to a cap). If Purdue Global achieves cost efficiencies in its operations, KNA may be entitled to an additional payment equal to 20% of such cost efficiencies (Purdue Efficiency Payment). In addition, during each of Purdue Global’s first five years, prior to any payment to KNA, Purdue Global is entitled to a priority payment of $10 million per year beyond costs (Purdue Priority Payment). To the extent that Purdue Global’s revenue is insufficient to pay the Purdue Priority Payment, KNA is required to advance an amount to Purdue Global to cover such insufficiency. Upon closing of the transaction, Kaplan paid to Purdue Global an advance in the amount of $20 million, representing, and in lieu of, a Purdue Priority Payment for each of the fiscal years ending June 30, 2019, and June 30, 2020.  
To the extent that there is sufficient revenue to pay the Purdue Efficiency Payment, Purdue Global will be reimbursed for its operating costs (subject to a cap) and will be paid the Purdue Priority Payment. To the extent that there is remaining revenue, KNA will then be reimbursed for its operating costs (subject to a cap) of providing the support activities. If KNA achieves cost efficiencies in its operations, then KNA may be entitled to an additional payment equal to 20% of such cost efficiencies (KNA Efficiency Payment). The TOSA, as amended, reflects the parties’ intent that, subject to available cash (calculated as cash balance minus cash deficiencies, if any, projected for the next six-month period based on applicable budget), KNA is entitled to receive a fee equal to 12.5% (increasing to 13% from June 30, 2023, through June 30, 2027) of Purdue Global’s revenue, which served as the deferred purchase price for the transfer of KU (Deferred Purchase Price). Separately, KNA is entitled to a fee for services provided equal to 8% of KNA’s costs of providing such services to Purdue Global (Contributor Service Fee). KNA’s Contributor Service Fee is deducted from any amounts owed to KNA for the Deferred Purchase Price. Together these payments are known as “Contributor Compensation.” In each case, the Contributor Compensation remains subject to available cash and the limitations of payment carry over from year to year.
After the first five years of the TOSA, KNA and Purdue Global will be entitled to payments in a manner consistent with the structure described above, except that (i) Purdue Global will no longer be entitled to the Purdue Priority Payment and (ii) to the extent that there are sufficient revenues after payment of the KNA Efficiency Payment (if any), Purdue Global will be entitled to an annual payment equal to 10% of the remaining revenue after the KNA Efficiency Payment (if any) is paid, subject to certain other adjustments.
The TOSA has a 30-year initial term, which will automatically renew for five-year periods unless terminated. After the sixth year, Purdue Global has the right to terminate the agreement upon payment of a termination fee equal to 125% of Purdue Global’s total revenue earned during the preceding 12-month period, which payment would be 
made pursuant to a 10-year note, and at the election of Purdue Global, it may receive for no additional consideration certain assets used by KNA exclusively to provide the support activities pursuant to the TOSA. At the end of the 30-year term, if Purdue Global does not renew the TOSA, Purdue Global will be obligated to make a final payment of 75% of its total revenue earned during the preceding 12-month period, which payment will be made pursuant to a 10-year note, and at the election of Purdue Global, it may receive for no additional consideration certain assets used by KNA exclusively to provide the support activities pursuant to the TOSA. Either party may terminate the TOSA at any time if Purdue Global generates (i) $25 million in cash operating losses for three consecutive years or (ii) aggregate cash operating losses greater than $75 million at any point during the initial term. Operating loss is defined as the amount by which the sum of (1) Purdue Global’s and KNA’s respective costs in performing academic and support functions and (2) the $10 million Purdue Priority Payment in each of the first five years following March 22, 2018, exceeds the revenue Purdue Global generates for the applicable fiscal year. Upon termination for any reason, Purdue Global will retain the assets that Kaplan contributed pursuant to the TOSA. Each party also has certain termination rights in connection with a material default or material breach of the TOSA by the other party.
Regulatory Environment. KNA no longer owns or operates KU or any other institution participating in student financial aid programs created under Title IV of the U.S. Federal Higher Education Act of 1965 (Higher Education Act), as amended (Title IV). KNA provides services to Purdue Global, Purdue University, Wake Forest University and other Title IV participating institutions that may require KNA to comply with certain laws and regulations, including applicable statutory provisions of Title IV. KHE also provides financial aid services to Purdue Global and, as such, meets the definition of a “third-party servicer” contained in the Title IV regulations to Purdue Global (but no other institution as of the date of this report). As a third-party servicer, KNA is subject to applicable statutory provisions of Title IV and U.S. Department of Education (ED) regulations that, among other things, require KNA to be jointly and severally liable with its Title IV participating client institution(s) to the ED for any violation by such client institution of any Title IV statute or ED regulation or requirement. KNA is also subject to other federal and state laws, including, but not limited to, federal and state consumer protection laws and rules prohibiting unfair or deceptive marketing practices, data privacy, data protection and information security requirements established by federal state and foreign governments, including for example the Federal Trade Commission and the applicable provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act regarding the privacy of student records. KNA’s failure to comply with these and other federal and state laws and regulations could result in adverse consequences to KNA’s business, including, for example:
•The imposition on KNA and/or Kaplan of fines, other sanctions, or liabilities, including repayment obligations for Title IV funds to the ED or the termination or limitation on Kaplan’s eligibility to provide services as a third-party servicer to any Title IV participating institution;
•Adverse effects on KNA’s business and results of operations from a reduction or loss in KNA’s revenues under the TOSA or any other agreement with any Title IV participating institution if a client institution loses or has limits placed on its Title IV eligibility, accreditation, operations or state licensure, or is subject to fines, repayment obligations or other adverse actions due to noncompliance by KNA (or the institution) with Title IV, accreditor, federal or state agency requirements; 
•Liability under the TOSA or any other agreement with any Title IV participating institution for noncompliance with federal, state or accreditation requirements arising from KNA’s conduct; and
•Liability for noncompliance with Title IV or other federal or state laws and regulations occurring prior to the transfer of KU to Purdue.
Incentive compensation. Under the ED’s incentive compensation rule, an institution participating in Title IV programs may not provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any person or entity engaged in any student recruiting or admission activities or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV funds if such payment is based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid. KNA is a third party providing bundled services to Title IV participating institutions that include recruiting and, in the case of Purdue Global, financial aid services. As such, KNA is also subject to the incentive compensation rules and cannot provide any commission, bonus or other incentive payment to any covered employees, subcontractors or other parties engaged in certain student recruiting, admission or financial aid activities based on success in securing enrollments or financial aid. In addition, tuition revenue sharing payments to KNA under the TOSA (as well as any other agreement with any Title IV participating institution) must comply with revenue sharing guidance provided by the ED related to bundled services agreements. For more information, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. Failure to Comply with the ED’s Title IV Incentive Compensation Rule Could Subject Kaplan to Liabilities, Sanctions and Fines.
Misrepresentations. A Title IV participating institution is required to comply with the ED regulations related to misrepresentations and with related federal and state laws. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and may extend to statements by servicers, such as KNA, that provide marketing or certain other services to such institutions. The laws and regulations may also apply to KNA’s employees and agents, with respect to statements 
addressing the nature of an institution’s programs, financial charges or the employability of its graduates. Additionally, failure to comply with these and other federal and state laws and regulations regarding misrepresentations and marketing practices could result in the imposition on KNA or its client institutions of fines, other sanctions, or liabilities, including federal student aid repayment obligations to the ED, the termination or limitation on KNA’s eligibility to provide services as a third-party servicer to Title IV participating institutions, the termination or limitation of a client institution’s eligibility to participate in the Title IV programs, or legal action by students or other third parties. A violation of misrepresentation regulations or other federal or state laws and regulations applicable to the services KNA provides to its client institutions arising out of statements by KNA, its employees or agents could require KNA to pay the costs associated with indemnifying its client institutions from applicable losses resulting from the violation and could result in fines, other sanctions, or liabilities imposed on KNA.
Compliance by client institutions with Title IV program requirements and other federal, state and accreditation requirements.  KNA currently provides services to education institutions that are heavily regulated by federal and state laws and regulations and subject to extensive accrediting body requirements. Presently, a material portion of KNA’s revenues are attributable to service fees it receives under the TOSA, which are dependent upon revenues generated by Purdue Global and dependent upon Purdue Global’s eligibility to participate in the Title IV federal student aid program. To maintain Title IV eligibility, Purdue Global and KNA’s other client institutions must be certified by the ED as eligible institutions, maintain authorizations by applicable state education agencies and be accredited by an accrediting commission recognized by the ED. Purdue Global and KNA’s other client institutions must also comply with the extensive statutory and regulatory requirements of the Higher Education Act and other state and federal laws and accrediting standards relating to their financial aid management, educational programs, financial strength, disbursement and return of Title IV funds, facilities, recruiting practices, representations made by the school and other parties, and various other matters. Additionally, Purdue Global and other client institutions are subject to laws and regulations that, among other things, limit student default rates on the repayment of Title IV loans, permit borrower defenses to repayment of Title IV loans based on certain conduct of the institution, establish specific measures of financial responsibility and administrative capability, regulate the addition of new campuses and programs and other institutional changes; require compliance with state professional licensure board requirements to the extent applicable to institutional programs and require state authorization and institutional and programmatic accreditation. If the ED finds that Purdue Global or other client institutions have failed to comply with Title IV requirements or improperly disbursed or retained Title IV program funds, it may take one or more of a number of actions, including, but not limited to:
•fining the school;
•requiring the school to repay Title IV program funds;
•limiting or terminating the school’s eligibility to participate in Title IV programs; 
•initiating an emergency action to suspend the school’s participation in Title IV programs without prior notice or opportunity for a hearing;
•transferring the school to a method of Title IV payment that would adversely affect the timing of the institution’s receipt of Title IV funds; 
•requiring the submission of a letter of credit; 
•denying or refusing to consider the school’s application for renewal of its certification to participate in the Title IV programs or for approval to add a new campus or educational program; and
•referring the matter for possible civil or criminal investigation.
If Purdue Global or other client institutions lose or have limits placed on their Title IV eligibility, accreditation or state licensure, or if they are subject to fines, repayment obligations or other adverse actions due to their or KNA’s noncompliance with Title IV regulations, accreditor or state agency requirements or other state or federal laws, KNA’s financial results of operations could be adversely affected. 
Compliance reviews and litigation. KNA and its client institutions are subject to reviews, audits, investigations and other compliance reviews conducted by various regulatory agencies and auditors, including, among others, the ED, the ED’s Office of the Inspector General, accrediting bodies and state and various other federal agencies. These compliance reviews could result in findings of noncompliance with statutory and regulatory requirements that could, in turn, result in the imposition of fines, liabilities, civil or criminal penalties or other sanctions against KNA and its client institutions. Separately, if KNA provides financial aid services to more than one Title IV participating institution (i.e., one or more participating institutions in addition to Purdue Global), it will be required to arrange for an independent auditor to conduct an annual Title IV compliance audit of KNA’s compliance with applicable ED requirements. KNA’s client institutions are also required to arrange for an independent auditor to conduct an annual 
Title IV compliance audit of their compliance with applicable ED requirements, including requirements related to services provided by KNA.
On September 3, 2015, Kaplan sold to Education Corporation of America (ECA) substantially all of the assets of the prior KHE Campuses. The transaction included the transfer of certain real estate leases that were guaranteed or purportedly guaranteed by Kaplan. ECA is currently in receivership, has terminated all of its higher education operations and has sold most, if not all, of its remaining assets (including New England College of Business). Additionally, the receiver has repudiated all of ECA’s real estate leases. Although ECA is required to indemnify Kaplan for any amounts Kaplan must pay due to ECA’s failure to fulfill its obligations under the real estate leases guaranteed by Kaplan, ECA’s current financial condition and the amount of secured and unsecured creditor claims outstanding against ECA make it unlikely that Kaplan will recover from ECA. In the second half of 2018, the Company recorded an estimated $17.5 million in losses on guarantor lease obligations in connection with this transaction in other non-operating expense. The Company recorded an additional estimated $1.1 million in non-operating expense in 2019 and $1 million in non-operating expense in 2020, in each case consisting of legal fees and lease costs. The Company continues to monitor the status of these obligations. Kaplan also may be liable to the current owners of KU and the KHE schools related to the pre-sale conduct of the schools. Additionally, the pre-sale conduct of the schools could be the subject of future compliance reviews or lawsuits that could result in monetary liabilities or fines or other sanctions.
Kaplan North America Supplemental Education
In 2020, KNA’s supplemental education products included all products of the former KTP and KP segments, including test preparation, data science education and training, healthcare simulation businesses, professional licensure training and preparation, corporate training and continuing education. Each of these businesses is discussed below.
Test Preparation. KNA’s test preparation businesses prepare students under the Kaplan Test Prep, Manhattan Prep and Barron’s Educational Series brands for a broad range of standardized, high-stakes tests, including the SAT, ACT, LSAT, GMAT, MCAT and GRE. KNA’s accredited businesses, operating under the Kaplan Prep & Achieve brand, prepare students for licensing exams required to enter certain professions, including nursing, medicine and law. KNA also sells admissions consulting, tutoring and other advising services.

In 2020, KNA served over 220,000 students through its test preparation programs and related products (such as tutoring, online question banks and online practice tests), excluding sales of test prep books by third-party retailers. KNA test preparation programs are taught at Kaplan-branded locations and at numerous other locations, such as hotels, high schools, universities and companies throughout the U.S., including Puerto Rico, as well as in Canada, Mexico and the U.K. KNA also licenses material for certain programs to third parties. Since the end of the first quarter of 2020, virtually all KNA test preparation programs have been offered online, typically in a live online classroom or a self-study format, and in person. Private tutoring services are provided online and, in select markets, in person. As pandemic restrictions were lifted, KNA maintained its strategic decision to move away from in-person courses for test preparation programs to focus on primarily digital delivery of courses.
KNA supplemental education includes Kaplan Publishing, which focuses on print and digital test preparation and reference resources sold through retail channels under the Kaplan Test Prep, Manhattan Prep and Barron’s Educational Series brands. At the end of 2020, Kaplan Publishing had over 1,100 titles in print and digital formats, including more than 250 digital products. In total, KNA test prep prepares students for more than 233 standardized tests, the large majority of which are U.S. focused.
Data Science. KNA operates Metis, a licensed data science and analytics school and training organization that operates immersive, live online boot camp programs and courses, and conducts training for corporations worldwide.
Healthcare Simulation. i-Human Patients provides online, simulated patient interactions for use in training and assessing medical health professionals, which are typically purchased by medical, nursing and physician assistant schools.
Professional Licensure Training and Preparation, Corporate Training, and Continuing Education.  The combination of the Kaplan Professional (U.S.) (KP) segment into the Kaplan North America Supplemental Education segment in 2020 did not alter or otherwise change the KP products or services that Kaplan offers. Through its professional licensure products, operating under the brands Dearborn Real Estate Education, Kaplan Real Estate Education, Bob Hogue School of Real Estate, Kaplan Financial Education, Professional Publications (PPI) and Kaplan Schweser, KNA helps professionals obtain certifications, licensures and designations that enable them to advance their careers. Additionally, KNA collaborates with organizations to solve their talent management challenges through customized corporate learning and development solutions. Through live and online instruction, KNA provides professional license test preparation, licensing and continuing education, as well as leadership and 
professional development programs to businesses and individuals in the accounting, insurance, securities, real estate, financial services, wealth management, engineering and architecture industries. 
In 2020, KNA served approximately 3,200 business-to-business clients through its professional services (formerly KP products) including approximately 160 Fortune 500 companies. In 2020, approximately 150,000 students used KNA’s professional licensure exam preparation offerings.

*The license renewals were filed in October 2020 and the applications are pending at the FCC. GMG does not anticipate any issues with its pending applications or in renewing its FCC licenses and expects the FCC to grant these pending applications in due course, but cannot provide any assurances that the FCC will do so.
Revenue from broadcasting operations is derived primarily from the sale of advertising time to local, regional and national advertisers. In 2020, advertising revenue accounted for 62% of the total for GMG’s operations. Advertising revenue is sensitive to a number of factors, some specific to a particular station or market and others more general in nature. These factors include a station’s audience share and market ranking; seasonal fluctuations in demand for air time; annual or biannual events, such as sporting events and political elections; and broader economic trends, among others.
Regulation of Broadcasting and Related Matters
GMG’s television broadcasting operations are subject to the jurisdiction of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) under the U.S. Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended (the Communications Act). Each GMG television station holds an FCC license that is renewable upon application for an eight-year period. In 2020, four GMG stations timely submitted renewal applications, each of which was due four months prior to the applicable station’s license expiration; one of these applications has been granted (WSLS) (Roanoke), and the three most recent applications remain pending (WKMG, WJXT, WCWJ) (GMG’s Florida stations). While GMG does not anticipate any material delays in the grant of its pending license renewal applications, a station’s operations may continue past the license expiration date in the event that its renewal application remains pending. As shown in the table above, the current terms of the GMG station licenses expire in 2021 through 2028. GMG does not anticipate any issues with its pending applications or in renewing its FCC licenses and GMG expects the FCC to grant future renewal applications for its stations in due course, but cannot provide any assurances that the FCC will do so. 
Digital Television (DTV) and Spectrum Issues.  Each GMG station (and each full-power television station nationwide) broadcasts only in a digital format, which allows transmission of HDTV programming and multiple channels of standard-definition television programming (multicasting). 
Television stations may receive interference from a variety of sources, including interference from other broadcast stations, that is below a threshold established by the FCC. That interference could limit viewers’ ability to receive television stations’ signals. The amount of interference to stations could increase in the future because of the FCC’s decision to allow electronic devices, known as “white space” devices, to operate in the television frequency band on an unlicensed basis on channels not used by nearby television stations. 
In November 2017, the FCC voted to adopt rules authorizing broadcast television stations to voluntarily transition to a new technical standard, called Next Generation TV or ATSC 3.0. The new standard is designed to allow broadcasters to provide consumers with better sound and picture quality; hyper-localized programming, including news and weather; enhanced emergency alerts and improved mobile reception. The standard will allow for the use of targeted advertising and more efficient use of spectrum, potentially allowing for more multicast streams to be aired on the same six-megahertz channel. ATSC 3.0 is not backward compatible with existing television equipment, and the FCC’s rules require full-power television stations that transition to the new standard to continue broadcasting a signal in the existing DTV standard until the FCC phases out the requirement in a future order. A transitioning station’s DTV-formatted content must be substantially similar to the programming aired on its ATSC 3.0 channel until July17, 2023, five years from the date the rules in the original 2017 FCC order were finalized. In June 2020, the FCC re-affirmed this sunset date, but stated that it would open a proceeding one year prior to the sunset date to determine whether the date should be extended. In November 2020, GMG station WDIV (Detroit) applied for and was granted authority by the FCC to effectuate an ATSC 3.0 simulcasting arrangement with another station in the Detroit area (WMYD, licensed to Scripps Broadcasting Holdings, LLC). The station’s ATSC 3.0 stream was then launched on December 7, 2020. As required by the FCC rules, the stream is in addition to WDIV’s current DTV stream, which viewers continue to be able to view.
In connection with the transition to ATSC 3.0, which is an internet protocol-based standard, the FCC has updated its rules to reflect how broadcasters may use their spectrum in non-traditional ways (referred to as “Broadcast Internet”). In June 2020, the FCC issued a Declaratory Ruling clarifying that the television ownership rules would not apply to the lease of broadcast spectrum for Broadcast Internet purposes, and in December 2020, the FCC voted to adopt rules that specifically apply its existing framework regarding derogation of service and use of spectrum for ancillary and supplementary purposes to Broadcast Internet; i.e., a broadcaster must continue to air at least one free, over-the-air television signal in SDTV format, and if a broadcaster opts to use its spectrum for Broadcast Internet services, it will incur a five percent fee based on the gross revenue received by the broadcaster. It is too soon to predict how the use of broadcast spectrum for Broadcast Internet services could impact the industry. In April 2017, the FCC announced the completion of an incentive auction in which certain broadcast television stations bid to relinquish spectrum or move to a different spectrum band in exchange for a share of the revenues obtained by auctioning the reallocated broadcast spectrum for use by wireless broadband providers. None of GMG’s stations participated in the incentive auction. However, certain GMG stations—specifically, WDIV, WSLS, WCWJ and WJXT—were required to move to new channel allotments in order to free up a nationwide block of spectrum for wireless broadband use. The FCC adopted rules requiring this “repacking” of broadcast television stations to new channels to be completed within 39 months after the incentive auction closed, with earlier deadlines set for particular stations in order to stagger the transition to new channels. The WSLS transition was completed on September 11, 2019, the WCWJ and WJXT transitions were completed on January 16, 2020, and the WDIV transition was completed on September 16, 2020 (following tolling of its assigned deadline due to delays related to the COVID-19 pandemic).
GMG’s repacked stations have been eligible to seek reimbursement for repacking-related costs and have been receiving reimbursement payments through the FCC’s process. Congress has capped the overall funds available for repack-related reimbursements. The initial legislation authorizing the incentive auction provided only $1.75 billion in total for all such reimbursements. Congress later made available an additional $1 billion in reimbursement funds, with $600 million in available funds allocated to 2018 and $400 million allocated to 2019.
To date, each repacked commercial television station, including each of the repacked GMG stations, has been allocated a reimbursement amount equal to approximately 92.5% of the station’s estimated repacking costs, as verified by the FCC’s fund administrator. Receipt of the allocated funds is subject to FCC approval of particular requests for reimbursement of actual costs fully incurred. As of December 31, 2020, the repacked GMG stations have received approximately $17.5 million in FCC reimbursements since 2018.
Carriage of Local Broadcast Signals.  Congress has established, and periodically has extended or otherwise modified, various statutory copyright licensing regimes governing the local and distant carriage of broadcast television signals on cable and satellite systems. The Company cannot predict whether or how Congress may maintain or modify these regimes in the future, or what net effect such decisions would have on the Company’s broadcast operations or on the Company overall.
The Communications Act and the FCC rules allow a commercial television broadcast station, under certain circumstances, to insist on mandatory carriage of its signal on cable systems serving the station’s market area (must carry). Alternatively, stations may elect, at three-year intervals, to forgo must-carry rights and allow their signals to be carried by cable systems only pursuant to a “retransmission consent” agreement. Commercial television stations also may elect either mandatory carriage or retransmission consent with respect to the carriage of their signals on direct broadcast satellite (DBS) systems that provide “local-into-local” service (i.e., distribute the signals of local television stations to viewers in the local market area). Stations that elect retransmission consent may negotiate for compensation from cable or DBS systems in exchange for the right to carry their signals. Each of GMG’s television stations has elected retransmission consent for both cable and DBS operators, and each is carried on all of the major cable and DBS systems serving each station’s respective local market pursuant to 
retransmission consent agreements. Retransmission consent elections must be made every three years. The most recent election deadline was October 1, 2020; all GMG stations elected retransmission consent for both cable and DBS operators. The 2020 election process was less time-intensive than prior processes, as the FCC in July 2019 moved to an electronic election system that now allows broadcasters to post their carriage elections online and to send notices to covered MVPDs electronically. The next election deadline is October 1, 2023 and will follow the same process.
Recent statutes have required the FCC to modify its rules governing retransmission consent negotiations. Under the STELA Reauthorization Act (STELAR), enacted in December 2014, the FCC adopted rules prohibiting same-market television broadcast stations from coordinating or jointly negotiating for retransmission consent unless such stations are under common control. The Television Viewer Protection Act, enacted on December 20, 2019, made changes to the “good faith” standards for retransmission consent negotiations, calling for the FCC to implement regulations requiring “large station groups” (groups of television broadcast stations that have a national audience reach of more than 20%) to negotiate in good faith with MVPD “buying groups” (entities that negotiate on behalf of multiple small MVPDs). GMG does not qualify as a “large station group” under the statute and therefore will not be subject to this obligation. While GMG does not anticipate that these recent changes will materially affect its bargaining position in retransmission consent negotiations, if Congress or the FCC were to enact further changes to the retransmission consent rules (such as by requiring small station groups like GMG to negotiate with MVPD buying groups, or otherwise giving MVPDs heightened bargaining power), such changes could have a material effect on retransmission consent revenues.
The FCC has also considered proposals to alter its rules governing network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity. In March 2014, the FCC solicited comments on a proposal to eliminate its network non-duplication and syndicated exclusivity rules, which restrict the ability of cable operators, direct broadcast satellite systems and other distributors classified by the FCC as MVPDs to import the signals of out-of-market television stations with duplicate programming during retransmission consent disputes or otherwise. The FCC has not acted on that proposal to date. If Congress or the FCC were to enact further changes to the exclusivity rules, such changes could materially affect the GMG stations’ bargaining position in future retransmission consent negotiations.
Ownership Limits.  The Communications Act and the FCC’s rules limit the number and types of media outlets in which a single person or entity may have an attributable interest. The FCC is required by statute to review its media ownership rules (with the exception of the national television ownership rule, discussed below) every four years to determine whether those rules remain necessary in the public interest as the result of competition. This process is referred to as the quadrennial review. In November 2017, the FCC conducted such a review and voted to eliminate certain of its ownership limit restrictions and to modify others. However, this FCC decision was challenged in court, and the Third Circuit Court of Appeals set aside the FCC’s decision in November 2019. The FCC appealed the Third Circuit court’s decision, and on January 19, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments in the case. A decision is expected in the first half of 2021.
Pending a decision from the Supreme Court, the FCC’s pre-November 2017 rules remain in effect. These rules include: the newspaper/broadcast cross-ownership rule, which prohibits a single entity from owning a full-power broadcast station and a daily print newspaper in the same local market; the radio/television cross-ownership rule, which imposes certain limits on the ability to own television and radio stations in the same market (in addition to the separate limits on the number of television or radio stations an entity may own in a given market); a more restrictive local television ownership rule, including the Eight Voices Test (generally prohibiting two commercial television stations in the same market from combining ownership if the transaction would result in fewer than eight independently owned stations remaining in the market) and the presumptive prohibition on transactions that would result in common ownership among the top four ranked stations in the same market; and a rule making certain television joint sales agreements (JSAs) attributable in calculating compliance with the FCC’s ownership limits. 
The FCC’s most recent quadrennial review of its media ownership rules was initiated in December 2018, prior to the Third Circuit court’s decision setting aside the FCC’s November 2017 rule changes. That proceeding remains open. GMG’s ability to enter into certain transactions in the future may be affected by the reinstatement of the pre-November 2017 ownership rules, the outcome of the U.S. Supreme Court’s review of the Third Circuit court’s decision, and the resolution of the current FCC quadrennial review proceeding.
Under the national television ownership rule, a single person or entity may have an attributable interest in an unlimited number of television stations nationwide, as long as the aggregate audience reach of such stations does not exceed 39% of nationwide television households and as long as such interest complies with the FCC’s other ownership restrictions. In 2016, the FCC eliminated the 50% Ultra High Frequency (UHF) discount, under which stations broadcasting on UHF channels are credited with only half the number of households in their market for purposes of calculating compliance with the 39% cap. However, the FCC reversed that decision in early 2017, concluding that the UHF discount should not be altered except in connection with a broader review of the national ownership cap. The reinstatement of the UHF discount was upheld by the D.C. Circuit in the summer of 2018. 
In December 2017, the FCC initiated a new rule making proceeding seeking comments regarding its authority to modify or eliminate the national television ownership cap, which was set at 39% by statute, as well as the potential elimination of the UHF discount. The FCC has received comments on its rule making but has not yet issued an order in the proceeding.
Programming.  Six of GMG’s seven stations are affiliated with one or more of the national television networks that provide a substantial amount of programming to their television station affiliates. The expiration dates of GMG’s affiliation agreements are set forth at the beginning of this Television Broadcasting section. WJXT, one of GMG’s Jacksonville stations, has operated as an independent station since 2002. In addition, each of the GMG stations receives programming from syndicators and other third-party programming providers. GMG’s performance depends in part on the quality and availability of third-party programming, and any substantial decline in the quality or availability of this programming could materially affect the ability of GMG and its competitors to enter into certain transactions in the future.
Public Interest Obligations.  To satisfy FCC requirements, stations generally are expected to air a specified number of hours of programming intended to serve the educational and informational needs of children and to complete reports on a quarterly basis concerning children’s programming. In July 2019, the FCC modified these rules to provide broadcasters with more flexibility in meeting the public interest obligations. Among other things, the new rules allow up to 52 hours per year of children’s programming to consist of educational specials and/or short-form programming. The prior rules required all qualifying programming to be regularly scheduled and in 30-minute blocks. While stations are required to air the substantial majority of their educational and informational children’s programming on their primary program stream, under the new rules they may now may air up to 13 hours per quarter of regularly scheduled weekly programming on a multicast stream. In addition, the FCC requires stations to limit the amount of advertising that appears during certain children’s programs. 
The FCC has other regulations and policies to ensure that broadcast licensees operate in the public interest, including rules requiring the disclosure of certain information and documents in an online public inspection file; rules requiring the closed-captioning of programming to assist television viewing by the hearing impaired; video description rules to assist television viewing by the visually impaired; rules concerning the captioning of video programming distributed via the internet; and rules concerning the volume of commercials. Compliance with these rules imposes additional costs on the GMG stations that could affect GMG’s operations. 
Political Advertising.  The FCC regulates the sale of advertising by GMG’s stations to candidates for public office and imposes other obligations regarding the broadcast of political announcements more generally, including the disclosures of certain information related to such advertising in the station’s online public inspection file. The application of these regulations may limit the advertising revenues of GMG’s television stations during the periods preceding elections. Failure to comply with the political advertising rules may result in enforcement actions by the FCC. On October 16, 2019, the FCC admonished GMG because its WDIV station failed to disclose certain sponsorship information and failed to file in a timely manner certain materials in the public inspection file. GMG was one of several station groups so admonished, and GMG received no fines or other consequences as a result of this issue. Recently, the FCC has entered into consent decrees with a large number of radio station groups based on their failure to timely upload to the online public inspection files the materials required by the FCC’s political advertising rules. The Company has procedures in place regarding compliance with the FCC’s political advertising rules, but cannot predict how the FCC’s future application of these rules will affect GMG’s stations.
Broadcast Indecency.  The FCC’s policies prohibit the broadcast of indecent and profane material during certain hours of the day, and the FCC may impose monetary forfeitures when it determines that a television station has violated that policy. Broadcasters have repeatedly challenged these rules in court, arguing, among other things, that the FCC has failed to justify its indecency decisions adequately, that the FCC’s policy is too subjective to guide broadcasters’ programming decisions and that its enforcement approach otherwise violates the First Amendment. In June 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court held that certain fines against broadcasters for “fleeting expletives” were unconstitutional because the FCC failed to provide advance notice to broadcasters of what the FCC deemed to be indecent, but it also upheld the FCC’s authority to regulate broadcast decency. The Company cannot predict how GMG’s stations may be affected by the FCC’s current or future interpretation and enforcement of its indecency policies.
Other Matters. The FCC is conducting proceedings concerning various matters in addition to those described in this section. The outcome of these proceedings and other matters described in this section could adversely affect the profitability of GMG’s television broadcasting operations.

Competition
Kaplan
Kaplan’s businesses operate in fragmented and competitive markets. Each of Kaplan International’s (KI) businesses competes in disaggregated markets with other for-profit institutions and companies (ranging in size from large for-profit universities to small competitors offering English-language courses) and, in certain instances, with government-supported schools and institutions that provide similar training and educational programs. Competitive factors vary by business and include program offerings, ranking of university partners, convenience, quality of instruction, reputation, placement rates, student services and cost. KI derives its competitive advantage from, among other things, delivering high-quality education and training experiences to students, having name brand recognition across multiple markets, developing strong relationships with corporate clients and recruitment partners and offering competitive pricing. Kaplan North America (KNA) competes with companies that provide various education technology solutions, consumer test and licensure preparation and course delivery, corporate training, university administrative support for online programs and courses, curriculum development, overall online program development and analytics for colleges and universities, as well as support for corporate, employer and employee education programs. The market for KNA’s services and products, and especially its higher education services and products, is dynamic and rapidly evolving, and several competitors offer a mix of some of the same products and services or are seeking to move into KNA’s markets. Competitive factors in these KNA markets include the ability to deliver a wide range of educational services and programs to clients across all levels of programs and administrative functions; cost effectiveness; expertise in marketing, recruitment and program delivery; student outcomes and satisfaction; the ability to invest in start-up and scaling initiatives; reputation; and compliance with laws and the ability to navigate complex regulatory requirements. KNA’s ability to effectively compete in the higher education services markets will depend in large part on its successful delivery and navigation of these factors. While the competitive landscape is expanding, KNA’s resources, capabilities and experience are key differentiators in the market. Similarly, KNA’s supplemental education products and services compete with a wide range of national, regional, local, online and location-based competitors. Competitors vary by test, with many focused on preparing students for a single high-stakes test. For its curricular and assessment services, KNA has a number of national competitors, including, for example, ATI/Ascend Learning and HESI/Elsevier, as well as competitors focused on preparation for particular tests. Competitive factors for the supplemental education products vary by product line and include price, features, modality, schedule and reputation. Although KNA faces intense competition and shifting consumer preferences in these areas, particularly with respect to online test preparation, where some new competitors are offering lower-cost and free test preparation products, KNA, and particularly Kaplan Test Prep, remains a leading name in test preparation owing in part to its technical expertise and capabilities, quality of instructors, content, curricula, longevity and reputation in the industry. KNA’s professional licensure training and preparation and corporate training products and services offer a broad portfolio of products, many within highly regulated and mature industries, including securities, insurance, real estate and wealth management, where competition includes a wide variety of national, regional and local companies seeking the same market share and resulting in deep price discounting and commoditization of offerings.
Graham Media Group
GMG competes for audiences and advertising revenues with television and radio stations, cable systems, video services offered by telephone and broadband companies serving the same or nearby areas, DBS services, digital media services, and, to a lesser degree, with other media providers, such as newspapers and magazines. Cable systems operate in substantially all of the areas served by the Company’s television stations, where they compete for television viewers by importing out-of-market television signals; by distributing pay-cable, advertiser-supported and other programming that is originated for cable systems; and by offering movies and other programming on an on-demand, digital or pay-per-view basis. In addition, DBS services provide nationwide distribution of television programming, including pay-per-view programming and programming packages unique to DBS, using digital transmission technologies. Moreover, to the extent that competing television stations in the Company’s television markets transition to ATSC 3.0, such stations may pose an increased competitive challenge to the Company’s stations in the future, such as by offering an increased number of multicast channels or by offering advanced features. 
Competition continues to increase from established and emerging online distribution platforms. Movies and television programming increasingly are available on an on-demand basis through a variety of online platforms, which include free access on the websites of the major TV networks, ad-supported viewing on platforms such as 
Hulu, and subscription-based access through services such as Netflix. In addition, online-only subscription services offering live television services have been launched both by traditional pay-TV competitors (such as DISH and DirecTV) and new entrants (such as Fubo). The Company has entered into agreements for some of its stations to be distributed via certain of these services, typically through opt-in agreements negotiated by the stations’ affiliated networks. Participation in these services has given the Company’s stations access to new distribution platforms. At the same time, competition from these various platforms could adversely affect the viewership of the Company’s television stations via traditional platforms and/or the Company’s strategic position in negotiations with pay-TV services. In addition, the networks’ increased role in negotiating online distribution arrangements for their affiliated stations, together with the networks’ imposition of higher fees on affiliated stations in exchange for broadcast and traditional pay-TV retransmission rights, may have broader effects on the overall network-affiliate relationship, which the Company cannot predict.
Hoover
Hoover’s predominant product line is fire-retardant treated wood products for building interior applications that are specified by architects in accordance with building code requirements for multi-family residential, commercial and institutional nonresidential buildings. Hoover’s fire-retardant product lines are sold through a stocking distributor network of more than 100 locations spanning the U.S. and Canada. Hoover’s competitors are licensees of other chemical suppliers to the wood treating industry who compete with Hoover’s stocking distributors on a local basis. The primary areas of competition are product availability and price, although brand loyalty due to product quality is significant. Wood products are commodities with volatile market pricing; however, Hoover’s reputation for quality products and its unique distribution model, which provides superior product availability, enable Hoover to maintain a leading position across the continent.
Dekko
Dekko has three distinct product families that compete in fragmented, competitive global markets: power and data distribution for office and furniture products, lighting solutions, and electrical harness manufacturing. These products are sold through dealer and distribution channels and original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers, focused primarily on the North American market. While all markets and products are price sensitive, technology, engineering solutions, quality and delivery performance are critical in purchase decisions. Dekko’s multiple long-term relationships, high-quality manufacturing facilities, engineering support and reputation as a solutions provider, in addition to being a product supplier, all contribute to sustaining its competitive advantages.
Graham Healthcare Group
The home health and hospice industries are extremely competitive and fragmented, consisting of both for-profit and nonprofit companies. According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission’s July 2020 Data Book, there are approximately 11,365 Medicare-certified home health providers and approximately 4,639 hospice providers in the U.S., with the number of active home healthcare providers rapidly increasing. GHG markets its services to physicians, discharge planners and social workers at hospitals, nursing homes, senior living communities and physicians’ offices through a direct sales model. GHG differentiates its offerings based on response time, clinical programming, clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction. Throughout the three states in which it operates, GHG competes primarily with both privately owned and hospital-operated home health and hospice service providers. 
Clyde’s
The restaurant industry is highly competitive. Clyde’s competes with national and regional chains and independent, locally owned restaurants for customers and personnel. The principal basis for competition are types of food and service, quality, price, location, brand and attractiveness of facilities.
Graham Automotive
The retail automotive industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Automobile dealerships compete with dealerships offering the same brands as well as those offering other manufacturers’ brands. Competitors include small local dealerships and large national multi-franchise automotive dealership groups. In addition to competition for vehicle sales, dealerships compete for parts and service business with other dealerships, automotive parts retailers and independent mechanics. The principal competitive factors in vehicle sales are price, selection of vehicles, location of dealerships and quality of customer service. The principal competitive factors in parts and service sales are price, the use of factory-approved replacement parts, factory-trained technicians and the quality of customer service. 
Framebridge
Framebridge operates in a highly fragmented market. Competitors include small local retail operations and a few national retail chains. The competitive factors in the framing industry are price, selection and convenience. 
Framebridge’s centralized manufacturing, clear and transparent pricing, retail stores that are optimized for foot traffic and a curated buying experience rather than framing workshops, and strong e-commerce and digital capabilities contribute to its competitive advantages.
Code3 (formerly a part of SocialCode)
The business of managed digital advertising is highly competitive. Public multinational advertising agencies may exacerbate price competition in an attempt to protect existing relationships with advertising clients in traditional media formats such as television. Public and private advertising technology companies, digital media agencies and newer market entrants such as consulting firms also compete on price, service and technology offerings. Code3 seeks to maintain a competitive advantage and maximize its clients’ return on advertising budgets by utilizing a combination of the deep expertise of its employees, who manage media spending on the largest digital platforms; a proprietary software (SaaS) as a service platform, allowing clients to make better use of first-party and third-party data to increase advertising effectiveness; and a full-service creative team with a nuanced understanding of digital media.
Decile
Decile faces competition from lower-cost providers that provide a narrower data analytics offering. In addition, at higher price points aimed at larger marketers ($50M+ annual revenue), there are several large customer data platform (CDP) competitors that attempt to unify many disparate sources of data to improve omnichannel advertising outcomes. Decile seeks to maintain a competitive advantage by simplifying the connection between data and marketing and bridging the gap between financial and marketing analytics to help marketers extract the most value out of their customer and sales data, all at a competitive price. Decile’s additional third-party data enrichment capabilities and data science analytics serve as key differentiators in the mid-market space where those capabilities are not available at a competitive price.
Slate
As a digital media company, Slate operates in highly competitive markets for subscribers, audiences and advertisers. For written work, Slate faces competition from other online publishers, especially magazines and newspapers. In podcasting, Slate faces competition from other podcast networks, as well as traditional radio networks. In the face of stiff competition, Slate is able to attract and retain a large educated, affluent audience and subscriber base by creating high-quality content, and is then able to compete for advertisers who wish to reach that audience on trusted, brand-safe properties.
Pinna
Pinna is currently the only ad-free, audio on-demand streaming service designed just for children that offers multiple audio formats in one space that complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA). The market for children’s subscription digital media entertainment is large. It includes media subscription services for families, subscription services for children, online learning/gaming destinations, audiobooks and podcasts for children, gaming subscriptions and free digital content. Key differentiators for Pinna include its access to multiple formats and its offering of curated best-in-class brands and original shows all in one ad-free COPPA-compliant place.

The Company recognizes the importance of attracting, developing and retaining highly qualified employees throughout each of its businesses. The following is a description of the Company’s efforts to manage and promote human capital within its organization.
Oversight and Management. The Company’s human resources organization and the human resource organizations of its various businesses manage employment-related matters, including recruiting and hiring, training, compensation, workplace safety, performance management, support for specific needs including 
supporting employees who are caregivers or working remotely, and creating diversity, equity and inclusion strategies. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors provides oversight of certain human capital matters, including compensation and benefits, development, workforce diversity and inclusion initiatives and succession planning. 
Compensation and Benefits. The Company offers strong compensation and benefits programs to its employees. In addition to salaries, depending on the business unit, these programs may include healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, family leave, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance programs, bonuses, long-term incentive compensation plans, pension and a 401(k) Plan. The Company also offers eligible employees certain equity-based grants under the Company’s Incentive Compensation Plan with vesting and performance conditions to facilitate the attraction, retention, motivation and reward of key employees and to align their interests with those of the Company’s stockholders.
Health and Safety. The health and safety of the Company’s employees is paramount. The Company’s health and safety programs are designed to address multiple jurisdictions and regulations as well as the specific risks and unique working environments of each of the Company’s businesses. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company’s businesses implemented significant changes that were determined to be in the best interest of their employees while complying with government regulations. The Company successfully transitioned a significant portion of its employees to work from home, while some of the Company’s businesses were considered essential businesses requiring employees to work on-site. Additional safety measures were implemented for employees continuing to work on-site, including purchasing personal protective equipment, adopting strong cleaning protocols, implementing quarantine, distancing and testing protocols to align with regulatory guidelines, providing contactless services, purchases and deliveries where possible and moving classes to online platforms. For example, Kaplan shifted classes that were usually held in person to online platforms and Graham Automotive increased the use of remote sales, with at-home test drives and deliveries and provided service department pickup and deliveries.
Training and Talent Development. The Company is committed to the continued growth and development of its employees across all businesses. Employees complete harassment and discrimination training, leadership management training and are offered specific skills training at various businesses designed to support the growth and advancement of their professional skills. For example, in 2020, Kaplan developed and initiated training programs on diversity and inclusion for all employees and managers to provide instruction, self-assessment and reflection exercises in areas such as unconscious bias and the importance of a diverse workforce. Additionally, employee engagement and feedback surveys are completed throughout the year.
Diversity and Inclusion. The Company has implemented initiatives to make progress to achieving a diverse talent pipeline and to support the retention and training of a diverse workforce at the corporate and business unit levels. For example, at Graham Media Group, employees are sourced through various media organizations, schools and associations, niche job boards and participation in media and diversity-focused career fairs such as National Association of Black Journalists, National Association of Hispanic Journalists and Asian American Journalists Association.
