* Sanofi did not opt-in to or elected not to continue to co-develop the product candidate. Under the terms of our agreement, Sanofi is entitled to receive royalties on any future sales of the product candidate. 
** Antibodies targeting the Ang2 receptor and ligand in ophthalmology were previously included in our antibody collaboration with Sanofi. Under the terms of our agreement, Sanofi is entitled to receive royalties on any future sales of the product candidate and a potential development milestone. 
*** Sanofi did not opt-in to the product candidate. Under the terms of our agreement, Sanofi is entitled to receive royalties on any future sales of the product candidate. In 2015, we and the Biomedical Advanced Research Development Authority (BARDA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) entered into an agreement whereby HHS provides certain funding to support research, development, and manufacturing of a monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of Ebola virus infection.

Our core business strategy is to maintain a strong foundation in basic scientific research and discovery-enabling technologies, and to combine that foundation with our clinical development, manufacturing, and commercial capabilities. We are executing our long-term objective to build a successful, integrated, multi-product biopharmaceutical company that provides patients and medical professionals with innovative options for preventing and treating human diseases.
We believe that our ability to develop product candidates is enhanced by the application of our VelociSuite® technology platforms. Our discovery platforms are designed to identify specific proteins of therapeutic interest for a particular disease or cell type and validate these targets through high-throughput production of genetically modified mice using our VelociGene® technology to understand the role of these proteins in normal physiology, as well as in models of disease. Our human monoclonal antibody technology (VelocImmune) and cell line expression technologies (VelociMab®) may then be utilized to discover and produce new product candidates directed against the disease target. Our antibody product candidates currently in clinical trials were developed using VelocImmune. We continue to invest in the development of enabling technologies to assist in our efforts to identify, develop, manufacture, and commercialize new product candidates.

Clinical Programs - Ophthalmologic Diseases
EYLEA - Ophthalmologic Diseases
Overview
Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) is a naturally occurring protein in the body. Its normal role in a healthy organism is to trigger formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) supporting the growth of the body's tissues and organs. However, in certain diseases, such as wet AMD, it is also associated with the growth of abnormal new blood vessels in the eye, which exhibit abnormal increased permeability that leads to edema. Scarring and loss of fine-resolution central vision often results. CRVO is caused by obstruction of the central retinal vein that leads to a back-up of blood and fluid in the retina. Release of VEGF contributes to increased vascular permeability in the eye and macular edema. In BRVO, a blockage occurs in the blood vessels branching from the main vein draining the retina, resulting in the release of VEGF and consequent retinal edema. For centrally involved DME, VEGF-mediated leakage of fluid from blood vessels in the eye results in interference with vision. Wet AMD, diabetic retinopathy (which includes DME), and RVO are three of the leading causes of adult blindness in the developed world. In these conditions, severe visual loss is caused by neovascular proliferation and/or retinal edema.
EYLEA is a recombinant fusion protein, consisting of portions of human VEGF receptors 1 and 2 extracellular domains fused to the Fc portion of human IgG1 and formulated as an iso-osmotic solution for intravitreal administration. EYLEA acts as a soluble decoy receptor that binds VEGF-A and placental growth factor (PlGF) and thereby can inhibit the binding and activation of these cognate VEGF receptors. EYLEA is specially purified and contains iso-osmotic buffer concentrations, allowing for injection into the eye.
Neovascular Glaucoma
NVG is a secondary glaucoma triggered by the formation of new blood vessels (neovascularization) on the iris and the anterior chamber angle. Neovascularization restricts aqueous outflow and consequently elevates intraocular pressure (IOP). NVG is a serious condition that may lead to permanent loss of vision, a persistently painful eye, and, especially in the advanced stages, is unlikely to respond to treatment. NVG is caused by eye diseases leading to retinal ischemia, mainly CRVO, proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), and ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS).
NVG meets the criteria for an orphan indication in Japan where the estimated number of NVG patients is 30,000 to 40,000. In 2015, Bayer initiated a Phase 3 study in Japan to assess the efficacy and safety of intravitreal administration of aflibercept in comparison to sham treatment on the change in IOP in patients with NVG. The primary endpoint of this Phase 3 study (n=54), which was the change in IOP from baseline to week 1, was numerically in favor of EYLEA (p=0.06). Statistically significant improvements were observed in both neovascularization of the iris and neovascularization of the iridocorneal angle with EYLEA, compared to sham treatment. Most ocular treatment emergent adverse events were injection related, including conjunctival hemorrhage and injection site pain in the EYLEA group. 
Diabetic Retinopathy
Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes mellitus characterized by microvascular damage to the blood vessels in the retina. It can progress to proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), where new, abnormal vessels that are susceptible to hemorrhage grow initially from the retina and/or optic disc and extend beyond the internal limiting membrane. PDR can subsequently lead to various vision-threatening complications such as vitreous hemorrhage, traction macular detachment, and neovascular glaucoma. There is currently no standard treatment for non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) in the absence of DME and patients are often observed until disease progresses sufficiently to warrant intraocular surgery (vitrectomy) or, more commonly, extensive laser treatment (panretinal photocoagulation (PRP)). PRP is utilized with the intent of preserving function of the central retina, but is inherently destructive to the peripheral retina and may result in a considerable loss of peripheral visual field. 
In the first quarter of 2016, a Phase 3 trial (PANORAMA) was initiated to assess the efficacy and safety of intravitreal aflibercept in patients with moderately severe to severe NPDR without DME. 
Combination Product with Rinucumab
We have recently discontinued the Phase 2 CAPELLA study, evaluating aflibercept co-formulated with rinucumab in patients with wet AMD. The data from the study showed that at 12 and 28 weeks, the combination therapy did not add to the improvement in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) that was demonstrated with intravitreal aflibercept injection monotherapy, the primary endpoint of the study. Results in the EYLEA monotherapy arm of this study were consistent with the efficacy and safety observed in Phase 3 pivotal studies of EYLEA in wet AMD. 
7

Combination Product with Nesvacumab
In the first quarter of 2016, two Phase 2 studies, RUBY (for the treatment of DME) and ONYX (for the treatment of wet AMD), were initiated. Both studies are investigating nesvacumab, an antibody to Ang2 co-formulated with aflibercept, as a single, intravitreal injection. Efficacy and safety data from both the RUBY and ONYX studies will be analyzed at week 36.
Late-Stage Antibody-based Clinical Programs
Praluent for LDL cholesterol reduction
Overview
Elevated LDL cholesterol ("bad cholesterol") level is a validated risk factor leading to cardiovascular disease. Statins are a class of drugs that lower LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) through inhibition of HMG-CoA, an enzyme regulating the early and rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis that ultimately results in an increase in LDL receptors to increase the uptake of plasma LDL lipoproteins. Similar to statins, PCSK9 impacts the number of available LDL receptors and therefore plays a key role in modulating LDL-C levels in the body. PCSK9 is a secreted protein that binds to and induces the destruction of the LDL receptor, thereby interfering with cellular uptake and increasing circulating levels of LDL cholesterol. In a landmark study published in The New England Journal of Medicine in March 2006, patients with lower than normal PCSK9 levels due to a genetic abnormality not only had significantly lower levels of LDL-C, but also a significant reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease (CHD). We used our VelocImmune technology to generate a fully human monoclonal antibody inhibitor of PCSK9, called Praluent, which is intended to lower LDL cholesterol.
Clinical Programs
Phase 3 ODYSSEY Program. The potential of Praluent to demonstrate cardiovascular benefit is being prospectively assessed in the ongoing 18,000-patient ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial, which is fully enrolled and is expected to be completed in 2017. All patients who entered the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial had experienced a heart attack or unstable angina requiring hospitalization within the previous year before entering the trial, and experienced inadequately controlled LDL cholesterol despite receiving maximally-tolerated statins and potentially other lipid-lowering therapies. 
In the first quarter of 2016, an independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) of the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES study completed the first interim analysis. In accordance with the protocol, the DMC performed a futility assessment. The DMC recommended the study continue with no changes. In the fourth quarter of 2016, an independent DMC conducted a second, pre-specified interim analysis for futility and overwhelming efficacy (hazard ratio <0.802 corresponding to p<0.0001) for the primary endpoint with consistency across subgroups and regions, positive trends for secondary end points including all-cause mortality, and no excess non cardiovascular mortality. Based on the recommendation of the independent DMC, the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial will continue as planned. Regeneron remains blinded to the actual results of the first and second interim analyses, and the DMC will continue to monitor the ongoing safety and efficacy of Praluent as planned.
In the first quarter of 2016, we and Sanofi announced positive results from the Phase 3 ODYSSEY ESCAPE trial evaluating Praluent in patients with HeFH, whose cholesterol levels required chronic, weekly or bi-weekly apheresis therapy. The trial met its primary endpoint, demonstrating that patients who added Praluent to their existing treatment regimen significantly reduced the frequency of their apheresis therapy by 75%, compared to placebo (p<0.0001). Sixty-three percent of patients treated with Praluent no longer required apheresis, compared to zero percent of placebo patients. Apheresis is a procedure where bad (LDL) cholesterol is removed from the blood, in a process similar to kidney dialysis. 
In the third quarter of 2016, we and Sanofi announced, and presented at the ESC Congress 2016, additional positive detailed results from the Phase 3 ODYSSEY ESCAPE trial. The trial demonstrated that adding Praluent to existing therapy reduced LDL cholesterol by approximately 50% from baseline (compared to 2% increase for placebo). Other key results from ODYSSEY ESCAPE, which were also published in the European Heart Journal, included:

• | Ninety-three percent of patients treated with Praluent experienced at least a 50% reduction in their apheresis

procedures (p<0.0001).

• | Throughout the trial, patients treated with Praluent experienced significant reductions in their LDL cholesterol starting

at week 6 (55% greater reduction compared to placebo), and lasting until the trial ended, at week 18 (46% greater reduction compared to placebo) (p<0.0001).

• | A similar proportion of patients experienced adverse events (AEs) in both the Praluent and placebo groups (76% in both groups). The most common AEs (occurring in at least 5% of the Praluent group) were fatigue (15% Praluent; 10% placebo), nasopharyngitis (10% Praluent; 10% placebo), diarrhea (10% Praluent; 0% placebo), myalgia (10% Praluent; 5% placebo), upper respiratory infection (7% Praluent; 19% placebo), headache (7% Praluent; 5% placebo), arthralgia (7% Praluent; 10% placebo), and back pain (5% Praluent; 10% placebo).

In the second quarter of 2016, the FDA accepted for review a supplemental BLA for a monthly dosing regimen of Praluent, with a target action date of January 24, 2017. In January 2017, the FDA extended the review period for the supplemental BLA. The FDA determined that Regeneron's and Sanofi's responses to information requested by the FDA during its review of the sBLA was a major amendment, which has resulted in a three month extension of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date to allow time for the FDA to review the additional information. The new target action date is April 24, 2017. 
In the fourth quarter of 2016, as a post-marketing commitment to the FDA, a Phase 4 randomized, placebo-controlled, long-term trial that prospectively evaluates the effect of Praluent on neurocognitive function was initiated. 
Sarilumab (REGN88; IL-6R Antibody) for inflammatory diseases
Overview
IL-6 is a key cytokine involved in the pathogenesis of RA, causing inflammation and joint destruction. Sarilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to IL-6R generated using our VelocImmune technology.
Rheumatoid Arthritis
Phase 3 Program. Based on positive results from the Phase 3 studies of sarilumab in adult patients with active RA, we and Sanofi submitted a BLA for U.S. regulatory approval of sarilumab, which was accepted for review by the FDA in December 2015. The target date for an FDA decision on the BLA was October 30, 2016. However, on October 28, 2016, we and Sanofi announced that the FDA issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) regarding the BLA for sarilumab. The CRL refers to certain deficiencies identified during a routine good manufacturing practice inspection of the Sanofi facility in Le Trait, France where sarilumab is filled and finished, one of the last steps in the manufacturing process. Satisfactory resolution of these deficiencies is required before the BLA can be approved. The CRL did not identify any concerns relating to the safety or efficacy of sarilumab. The FDA subsequently reclassified the Sanofi Le Trait fill-and-finish facility as "acceptable" based on review of responses to an FDA Form 483, as well as proposed corrective actions. In the first quarter of 2017, we expect to resubmit the sarilumab BLA, contingent upon successful completion of the pre-approval inspection of Le Trait in connection with the Dupixent BLA. The sarilumab active pharmaceutical ingredient is manufactured by Regeneron at its Rensselaer, New York facility. The FDA has completed a pre-approval inspection of Regeneron’s sarilumab manufacturing facility; no Form 483 was issued in connection with the pre-approval inspection of Regeneron’s facility, which is the form used if the FDA investigators have observed any conditions that in their judgement may constitute a violation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and related acts.
In July 2016, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) accepted for review the Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) for sarilumab. In addition, in October 2016, an application for marketing approval for sarilumab was submitted in Japan.
In March 2016, we and Sanofi announced positive top-line data from the Phase 3 SARIL-RA-MONARCH study that demonstrated superiority of sarilumab vs. adalimumab (marketed by AbbVie Inc. as HUMIRA®) in improving signs and symptoms of RA at 24 weeks in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis. The primary endpoint was change from baseline in DAS28-ESR at 24 weeks, which demonstrated a statistically significant difference in favor of sarilumab (-3.25 for sarilumab compared to -2.22 for adalimumab, p<0.0001). The study also met clinically important secondary endpoints including improvements in signs and symptoms of RA as measured by patients achieving a 20% improvement in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria (72% for sarilumab vs. 58% for adalimumab, p<0.01). Additional positive secondary endpoints included ACR50 and ACR70 response, and improvement in physical function, as measured by the Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) as compared to adalimumab (p<0.01 for all of these measures). DAS28-ESR is a measure of disease activity in RA, which includes the evaluation of 28 joints in the body for tenderness and swelling, a general health assessment, and ESR, a laboratory measure for inflammation. The incidence of AEs (64% for both groups), serious AEs (5% for sarilumab vs. 7% for adalimumab), infections (29% for sarilumab vs. 28% for adalimumab), and serious infections (1% for both groups) were generally similar between groups. Neutropenia, which was not associated with infections, was more common with sarilumab (14% for sarilumab vs. 1% for adalimumab), as has been seen in previous studies with IL-6 inhibitors. Injection site erythema (8% sarilumab vs. 3% adalimumab) was also more common with sarilumab. In November 2016, detailed results of SARIL-RA-MONARCH study were presented during the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Annual Meeting.

Non-infectious Uveitis
Phase 2 SARIL-NIU-SATURN Study. SARIL-NIU-SATURN was a small Phase 2, randomized double-masked, placebo-controlled study (n=58) conducted to assess the effect of sarilumab on non-infectious uveitis of the posterior ocular segment. We reported results of this study at the pre-specified primary endpoint (week 16) during 2015. Top-line 52-week data were presented at the American Academy of Ophthalmology conference in October 2016. 
Polyarticular-course Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (pcJIA)
Phase 2 pcJIA Study. A Phase 2 study of sarilumab in pcJIA was initiated in the third quarter of 2016 and is currently enrolling patients.
Dupixent (dupilumab/REGN668; IL-4R Antibody) for allergic and inflammatory conditions
Overview
IL-4R is required for signaling by the cytokines IL-4 and IL-13. Both of these cytokines are critical mediators of immune response, which, in turn, drives the formation of Immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies and the development of allergic responses, as well as the atopic state that underlies atopic (allergic) dermatitis, asthma, nasal polyps, and eosinophilic esophagitis. Dupilumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody generated using our VelocImmune technology that is designed to bind to IL-4R alpha subunit and block signaling from both IL-4 and IL-13.
Atopic Dermatitis
Phase 3 Program. The LIBERTY AD Phase 3 clinical program consisted of five trials of patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis at sites worldwide. Patients from the LIBERTY AD CHRONOS, LIBERTY AD SOLO 1, and LIBERTY AD SOLO 2 studies were transitioned to either the LIBERTY CONTINUE or LIBERTY AD Open label Extension trials. 
In 2014, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation to Dupixent for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who are not adequately controlled with topical prescription therapy and/or for whom these treatments are not appropriate. This designation is based on positive results from Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, the determination that atopic dermatitis is a serious disease, and preliminary clinical evidence that indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies. The FDA has accepted for priority review the BLA for Dupixent for the treatment of adult patients with inadequately controlled moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis. The target date for an FDA decision on the BLA is March 29, 2017. An FDA pre-approval inspection for Dupixent at Sanofi's Le Trait fill-and-finish facility has been scheduled for the first quarter of 2017. In addition, in December 2016, the EMA accepted for review the MAA for Dupixent for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy.
In 2015, the United Kingdom (UK) Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) granted Promising Innovative Medicine (PIM) Designation to Dupixent in the short-term treatment of adult patients with severe atopic dermatitis who have responded inadequately to all available topical prescription treatments and/or systemic ciclosporin, or who are intolerant of or ineligible for such treatments. A PIM Designation is an early indication that a medicinal product is a promising candidate for the Early Access to Medicines Scheme (EAMS), in the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of life-threatening or seriously debilitating conditions with unmet need. PIM Designation is the first step in a 2-step EAMS process that allows patients to be treated with Dupixent in advance of formal regulatory approval. 
In April 2016, we and Sanofi announced positive top-line data from the Phase 3 LIBERTY AD SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 studies. These studies met their primary endpoints, and treatment with Dupixent as monotherapy significantly improved measures of overall disease severity, skin clearing, itching, quality of life, and mental health. A total of 1,379 adult patients with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis were enrolled in the identically-designed SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 trials. Patients were enrolled if they were not adequately controlled with topical medications, or if topical treatment was not medically advisable. All patients were assessed via the 5-point Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) scale, ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe); entry criteria required a baseline score of 3 or 4. Patients were also assessed using the Eczema Area and Severity Index (EASI) and other measures. Patients were randomized into one of three treatment groups: Dupixent 300 mg subcutaneously once per week, Dupixent 300 mg subcutaneously every two weeks, or placebo for 16 weeks following an initial Dupixent loading dose of 600 mg subcutaneously, or placebo. Results at 16 weeks included the following:

• | For SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, respectively, 37% and 36% of patients who received Dupixent 300 mg weekly, and 38% and 36% of patients who received Dupixent 300 mg every two weeks, achieved clearing or near-clearing of skin lesions (IGA 0 or 1), compared to 10% and 8.5% with placebo (p<0.0001). This was the primary endpoint of the study in the United States.

10


• | For SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, respectively, the percent improvement in EASI from baseline was 72% and 69% in patients who received the 300 mg weekly dose, and 72% and 67% for patients who received Dupixent 300 mg every two weeks, compared to 38% and 31% for placebo (p<0.0001).


• | For SOLO 1 and SOLO 2, respectively, 52.5% and 48% of patients who received Dupixent 300 mg weekly, and 51% and 44% of patients who received Dupixent 300 mg every two weeks, achieved EASI-75 compared to 15% and 12% with placebo (p<0.0001). This was the key secondary endpoint in the United States and one of the primary endpoints in the EU. 

For the 16-week treatment period, the overall rate of AEs (65%-73% Dupixent and 65%-72% placebo) was comparable between the Dupixent groups and the placebo groups. The proportion of patients who completed the treatment period was 88%-94% for Dupixent and 80.5%-82% for placebo. The rate of serious AEs was 1%-3% for Dupixent and 5%-6% for placebo. Serious and severe infections were also numerically higher in the placebo groups in both studies (0.5%-1% Dupixent and 2%-3% placebo). AEs that were noted to have a higher rate with Dupixent treatment across both studies included injection site reactions (10%-20% Dupixent and 7%-8% placebo) and conjunctivitis (7%-12% Dupixent and 2% placebo); approximately 26% of patients in both studies reported a history of allergic conjunctivitis at study entry. No patient discontinued therapy due to injection site reactions and only one patient discontinued therapy due to conjunctivitis. More detailed results from SOLO 1 and SOLO 2 were presented at the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology (EADV) conference in October 2016.
In the first quarter of 2016, the Phase 3 LIBERTY AD CAFÉ study of Dupixent in severe atopic dermatitis was initiated. This placebo-controlled study will investigate two dose regimens of Dupixent (300 mg weekly and 300 mg every two weeks) with concomitant topical corticosteroids in adult patients with severe atopic dermatitis who are not adequately controlled with, or are intolerant to or ineligible for, oral cyclosporine A therapy. The primary endpoint of this study will be the proportion of patients with a 75% or greater improvement from baseline in their EASI score.
In June 2016, we and Sanofi announced positive data from the Phase 3 LIBERTY AD CHRONOS study. This study met its primary and secondary endpoints, and Dupixent with topical corticosteroids (TCS) significantly improved measures of overall disease severity at 16 and 52 weeks, when compared to placebo with TCS. The primary endpoint results at week 16 were the following:

• | 39% of patients who received either Dupixent 300 mg weekly with TCS or Dupixent 300 mg every two weeks with TCS achieved clearing or near-clearing of skin lesions (IGA 0 or 1), compared to 12% of patients receiving placebo with TCS (p<0.0001).


• | 64% of patients who received Dupixent 300 mg weekly with TCS, and 69% of patients who received Dupixent 300 mg every two weeks with TCS achieved EASI-75, a 75% reduction on an index measuring eczema severity, compared to 23% of patients receiving placebo with TCS (p<0.0001).

The secondary endpoint 52-week results were the following:

• | 40% of patients who received Dupixent 300 mg weekly with TCS, and 36% of patients who received Dupixent 300 mg every two weeks with TCS achieved clearing or near-clearing of skin lesions (IGA 0 or 1), compared to 12.5% of patients receiving placebo with TCS (p<0.0001).


• | 64% of patients who received 300 mg weekly with TCS, and 65% of patients who received 300 mg every two weeks with TCS achieved EASI-75, compared to 22% with placebo with TCS (p<0.0001).

Patients were less likely to discontinue therapy in the Dupixent with TCS groups compared to placebo with TCS group (15% in both Dupixent groups; 33% placebo).
The overall rate of AEs in the LIBERTY AD CHRONOS study was comparable between the Dupixent with TCS groups (83% for the weekly dose (qw) and 88% for the every two weeks (q2w) dosing group) and the placebo with TCS group (84%). The rate of serious AEs was comparable between the Dupixent with TCS groups (3% (qw) and 4% (q2w)) and placebo with TCS group (5%). Serious and/or severe infections were numerically higher in the placebo with TCS group (1% in both Dupixent groups and 2% placebo). Adverse events that were noted to have a higher rate with Dupixent included injection site reactions (20% (qw) and 16% (q2w) Dupixent; 9% placebo) and conjunctivitis (19% (qw) and 13% (q2w) Dupixent; 8% placebo); 22% of patients on placebo, and 23% (qw) and 28% (q2w) of patients on Dupixent reported a history of allergic conjunctivitis at study entry.
Phase 2 Study in Pediatric Patients. Based on the results of a Phase 2 pharmacokinetic and safety study in pediatric patients (6-17 years of age) with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, two Phase 3 pediatric studies (6-11 years of age and 12-17 years of age) are expected to be initiated in the first half of 2017. 
In October 2016, the FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for dupilumab for the treatment of moderate to severe (12 to less than 18 years of age) and severe (6 months to less than 12 years of age) atopic dermatitis in pediatric patients who are not adequately controlled with, or who are intolerant to, topical medication.

Asthma
Phase 3 Study. A Phase 3 trial, LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST, in adult and adolescent patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma was fully enrolled in the third quarter of 2016. LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST is expected to serve as the second required pivotal efficacy study, since, based on discussions with the FDA, the Phase 2b study will also be considered a pivotal efficacy study. LIBERTY ASTHMA QUEST is a global, placebo-controlled Phase 3 study that enrolled more than 1,900 patients with uncontrolled persistent asthma and is evaluating two doses of dupilumab, 200 mg and 300 mg, subcutaneously administered every other week.
Nasal Polyps
Phase 3 Study. A Phase 3 study, LIBERTY NP SINUS, in adult patients with bilateral nasal polyps on a background therapy with intranasal corticosteroids was initiated in the fourth quarter of 2016.
Eosinophilic Esophagitis
Phase 2 Study. A Phase 2 trial of dupilumab in eosinophilic esophagitis was initiated in 2015 and is ongoing. EoE is a chronic allergic inflammatory disease that is considered a major cause of gastrointestinal illness. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell that, due to allergens, can accumulate in the esophagus, causing inflammation and tissue injuries that create difficulty swallowing. People with eosinophilic esophagitis may also have allergies, asthma, atopic dermatitis, or chronic respiratory disease. 
REGN2222 (RSV-F Antibody) for RSV
Overview
Respiratory Syncytial Virus, or RSV, is a virus that infects the lungs and breathing passages. It is the most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways) and is the second most common cause of death, globally, in the first year of life. RSV results in a significant healthcare burden, as it is the leading cause of infant hospitalizations in the United States. In addition to hospitalizations, RSV frequently results in emergency department, urgent care, and physicians’ office visits. It is estimated that about half of all children will have an RSV infection by their first birthday. REGN2222 is a fully human monoclonal antibody to the RSV-F protein. REGN2222 was generated using our VelocImmune technology. 
Clinical Program
A Phase 3 study of REGN2222 (NURSERY Pre-Term) was initiated in 2015 and is currently enrolling patients.
In 2015, the FDA granted Fast Track designation to REGN2222 for the prevention of serious lower respiratory tract disease caused by RSV. 
Fasinumab (REGN475; NGF Antibody) for pain due to osteoarthritis and chronic low back pain
Overview
Pain is a frequent reason for physician visits, a common reason for taking prescription medications, and a major cause of work disability and impaired quality of life. Targeting NGF is a potential advance in pain management. NGF expression is elevated in many acute and chronic painful conditions and NGF blockade has demonstrated efficacy in various animal models of pain. Fasinumab is a fully human monoclonal antibody to NGF, generated using our VelocImmune technology.
The fasinumab program is expected to consist of approximately 10,000 patients treated with fasinumab.

Osteoarthritis
Phase 2/3 Study. In the second quarter of 2015, we initiated a Phase 2/3 clinical study (16-weeks) in patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis pain of the hip or knee who have a history of inadequate pain relief or intolerance to current analgesic therapies. In May 2016, we announced positive top-line data from the study. At 16 weeks, patients treated with all four doses of fasinumab demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in pain relief, the primary endpoint of the study, as well as improvements in the secondary measure evaluating physical function. The U.S. study enrolled 421 adult patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis of the hip or knee who had a history of inadequate pain relief or intolerance to acetaminophen, and at least one oral nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) and an opioid. Patients in the study were experiencing significant pain at baseline with an average pain score of 6.3 on a 10-point scale. Patients were evaluated for pain, stiffness, and physical function using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) in addition to other measures. Patients were randomized to one of five treatment groups in a 1:1:1:1:1 fashion; fasinumab 1mg, 3mg, 6mg, 9mg, or placebo, all delivered subcutaneously every 4 weeks through week 12, with the primary efficacy measured at week 16. Following week 16, patients were studied for an additional 20 weeks off treatment. On the primary endpoint, fasinumab-treated patients reported less pain at 16 weeks when compared to placebo on the 10-point WOMAC subscale for pain (-3.03 to -3.65 fasinumab vs. -2.25 placebo; p=0.03 through p=0.0001). Overall incidence of AEs, including serious and severe events, was similar across the fasinumab groups and placebo. As expected with antibodies to NGF, there was an increase in certain neuro-musculoskeletal AEs in the fasinumab treatment groups (17% combined fasinumab; 6% placebo) including arthralgia, paraesthesia, hypoaesthesia, and peripheral edema.
In October 2016, we and Teva announced that at the 36-week analysis of the Phase 2/3 clinical study in patients with moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis pain of the hip or knee, the incidence of adjudicated arthropathies was found to be potentially dose-dependent, with a higher rate of patients experiencing arthropathies in the higher dose groups (12% (9mg), 7% (6mg), 5% (3mg), 2% (1mg), and 1% (placebo)). In the ongoing fasinumab osteoarthritis pivotal Phase 3 program (further described below), we and Teva are planning to advance only the lower doses from the Phase 2/3 study, subject to discussion with the FDA and other health authorities. Updated data from the osteoarthritis pain Phase 2/3 study will be presented at upcoming medical congresses.
Phase 3 Study. In the first quarter of 2016, the FDA confirmed that we may proceed with studies of longer than sixteen-week duration. A Phase 3 long-term safety study in patients with pain due to osteoarthritis of the knee or hip was initiated in the first quarter of 2016. 
Chronic Low Back Pain
A Phase 2b study in chronic low back pain was initiated in the first quarter of 2016. In October 2016, the FDA placed the Phase 2b study in chronic low back pain on clinical hold and requested an amendment of the study protocol; this was based on the FDA's recommendation that patients with advanced osteoarthritis at baseline not receive higher doses of fasinumab. Following this development, we completed an unplanned interim review of results and stopped dosing in the study. The unplanned analysis showed clear evidence of efficacy with improvement in pain scores in all fasinumab groups compared to placebo at the 8- and 12-week time points (nominal p<0.01). Preliminary safety results are generally consistent with what has been previously reported with the class. The Phase 2b chronic low back pain study enrolled approximately 70% of the targeted 800 patients in four dose groups: placebo, 6mg subcutaneously monthly, 9mg subcutaneously monthly, and 9mg intravenously every two months. Patients will continue to be followed for up to 36 weeks. 
We and Teva plan to design pivotal Phase 3 studies in chronic low back pain. The companies plan to submit a pivotal program plan for review with the FDA and other health authorities.
Updated data from the chronic lower back pain Phase 2b study will be presented at upcoming medical congresses.
Research Programs
Our preclinical research programs include the areas of oncology/immuno-oncology, angiogenesis, ophthalmology, metabolic and related diseases, muscle diseases and disorders, inflammation and immune diseases, bone and cartilage, pain and neurobiology, cardiovascular diseases, and infectious diseases.
In March 2016, the New England Journal of Medicine published a paper based on the work done at the Regeneron Genetics Center showing that inactivating mutations of the angiopoeitin-like 4 (Angptl-4) gene are associated with a significantly reduced risk of coronary artery disease in humans. Angptl-3 and Angptl-4 are related genes that both regulate lipoprotein lipase. 
In 2015, we and BARDA entered into an agreement to develop, test, and manufacture a monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of Ebola virus infection. Under the terms of the agreement, HHS will provide funding to support our preclinical development, antibody manufacturing, and for a Phase 1 study in healthy volunteers, and has the option to provide additional funding for further manufacturing and development studies. In addition, in 2016, we and BARDA of the HHS entered into an 
13

agreement whereby HHS will provide certain funding to manufacture and study two antibody therapies for the potential treatment of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). 
Research and Development Technologies
Many proteins that are either on the surface of or secreted by cells play important roles in biology and disease. One way that a cell communicates with other cells is by releasing specific signaling proteins, either locally or into the bloodstream. These proteins have distinct functions and are classified into different "families" of molecules, such as peptide hormones, growth factors, and cytokines. All of these secreted (or signaling) proteins travel to and are recognized by another set of proteins, called "receptors," which reside on the surface of responding cells. These secreted proteins impact many critical cellular and biological processes, causing diverse effects ranging from the regulation of growth of particular cell types to inflammation mediated by white blood cells. Secreted proteins can at times be overactive and thus result in a variety of diseases. In these disease settings, blocking the action of specific secreted proteins can have clinical benefit. In other cases, proteins on the cell-surface can mediate the interaction between cells, such as the processes that give rise to inflammation and autoimmunity.
Our scientists have developed two different technologies to design protein therapeutics to block the action of specific cell surface or secreted proteins. The first technology, termed the "Trap" technology, was used to generate EYLEA, ZALTRAP, and ARCALYST. These novel "Traps" are composed of fusions between two distinct receptor components and the constant region of an antibody molecule called the "Fc region," resulting in high affinity product candidates. VelociSuite is our second technology platform; it is used for discovering, developing, and producing fully human monoclonal antibodies that can address both secreted and cell-surface targets.
VelociSuite. VelociSuite consists of VelocImmune, VelociGene, VelociMouse®, VelociMab, and other related technologies. The VelocImmune mouse platform is utilized to produce fully human monoclonal antibodies. VelocImmune was generated by exploiting our VelociGene technology (see below), in a process in which six megabases of mouse immune gene loci were replaced, or "humanized," with corresponding human immune gene loci. VelocImmune mice can be used to generate efficiently fully human monoclonal antibodies to targets of therapeutic interest. VelocImmune and our entire VelociSuite offer the potential to increase the speed and efficiency through which human monoclonal antibody therapeutics may be discovered and validated, thereby improving the overall efficiency of our early stage drug development activities. We are utilizing the VelocImmune technology to produce our next generation of drug candidates for preclinical and clinical development.
Our VelociGene platform allows custom and precise manipulation of very large sequences of DNA to produce highly customized alterations of a specified target gene, or genes, and accelerates the production of knock-out and transgenic expression models without using either positive/negative selection or isogenic DNA. In producing knock-out models, a color or fluorescent marker may be substituted in place of the actual gene sequence, allowing for high-resolution visualization of precisely where the gene is active in the body during normal body functioning as well as in disease processes. For the optimization of preclinical development and pharmacology programs, VelociGene offers the opportunity to humanize targets by replacing the mouse gene with the human homolog. Thus, VelociGene allows scientists to rapidly identify the physical and biological effects of deleting or over-expressing the target gene, as well as to characterize and test potential therapeutic molecules.
Our VelociMouse technology platform allows for the direct and immediate generation of genetically altered mice from embryonic stem cells (ES cells), thereby avoiding the lengthy process involved in generating and breeding knockout mice from chimeras. Mice generated through this method are normal and healthy and exhibit a 100% germ-line transmission. Furthermore, mice developed using our VelociMouse technology are suitable for direct phenotyping or other studies. We have also developed our VelociMab platform for the rapid screening of antibodies and rapid generation of expression cell lines for our Traps and our VelocImmune human monoclonal antibodies.
We have utilized our VelociSuite technologies to develop a class of potential drug candidates, known as bi-specific antibodies. In the area of immunotherapies in oncology, we are exploring the use of bi-specific antibodies that target tumor antigens and the CD3 receptor on T-cells to harness the oncolytic properties of T-cells. Our first such bi-specific antibody, which entered into clinical development in 2014, targets CD20 and CD3.
Regeneron Genetics Center. In 2014, we launched a new human genetics initiative via a wholly owned subsidiary, Regeneron Genetics Center LLC (RGC). RGC leverages de-identified clinical, genomic, and molecular data from human volunteers to identify medically relevant associations in a blinded fashion designed to preserve patients' privacy. The objective of RGC is to expand the use of human genetics for discovering and validating genetic factors that cause or influence a range of diseases where there are major unmet medical needs, with the prospect of improving the drug discovery and development process. RGC is undertaking multiple approaches, including large population-based efforts as well as family- and founder-based approaches. RGC utilizes laboratory automation and innovative approaches to cloud computing to achieve high-quality throughput.
Central to the work of RGC is a collaboration with the Geisinger Health System of Pennsylvania. Geisinger collects samples from consented patient volunteers, while RGC performs sequencing and genotyping to generate de-identified genomic data. In 
14

addition, RGC has expanded on its foundational population-based collaboration with Geisinger with a growing number of other institutions worldwide.
Collaboration Agreements
Collaborations with Sanofi
Antibodies. Since November 2007, we and Sanofi have been parties to a global, strategic collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize fully human monoclonal antibodies. The collaboration is governed by a Discovery and Preclinical Development Agreement (Antibody Discovery Agreement) and a License and Collaboration Agreement (each as amended), collectively referred to as the Antibody Collaboration. Pursuant to the Antibody Discovery Agreement, as amended, Sanofi is responsible for funding up to $130.0 million of our antibody discovery activities in each of 2016 and 2017 to identify and validate potential drug discovery targets and develop fully human monoclonal antibodies against these targets. We lead the design and conduct of research activities under the Antibody Discovery Agreement, including target identification and validation, antibody development, research and preclinical activities through filing of an Investigational New Drug application (IND) or its equivalent, toxicology studies, and manufacture of preclinical and clinical supplies. Sanofi has the right to extend antibody development and preclinical activities relating to selected programs for up to an additional three years after 2017. Sanofi must identify any programs to be extended by June 30, 2017, and we and Sanofi must then agree on a plan and budget for the extended activities. During the extended period, we will use commercially reasonable efforts to develop such antibodies and conduct preclinical activities through IND preparation. After 2017, funding from Sanofi under the Antibody Discovery Agreement will cease to continue, except with regard to the programs for which Sanofi has exercised its extension right.
For each drug candidate identified through discovery research under the Antibody Discovery Agreement (including drug candidates developed during the extended period of up to an additional three years described above), Sanofi has the option to license rights to the candidate under the License and Collaboration Agreement. If it elects to do so, Sanofi will co-develop the drug candidate with us through product approval. Development costs for the drug candidate are shared between the companies, with Sanofi generally funding these costs as they are incurred by us, except that following receipt of the first positive Phase 3 trial results for a co-developed drug candidate, subsequent Phase 3 trial-related costs for that drug candidate are shared 80% by Sanofi and 20% by us. We are generally responsible for reimbursing Sanofi for half of the total development costs for all collaboration antibody products from our share of profits from commercialization of collaboration products to the extent they are sufficient for this purpose. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical requirements of each drug candidate under the collaboration until commercial supplies of that drug candidate are being manufactured. 
Under our collaboration agreement, Sanofi records product sales and cost of sales for commercialized products, and Regeneron has the right to co-promote such products. We have exercised our option to co-promote Praluent, sarilumab, and dupilumab in the United States. We have not exercised our option to co-promote any of these antibodies outside the United States; however, we retain the right to do so at a future date subject to the terms of the collaboration agreement. We and Sanofi will equally share profits and losses from sales within the United States. We and Sanofi share profits outside the United States on a sliding scale based on sales starting at 65% (Sanofi)/35% (us) and ending at 55% (Sanofi)/45% (us), and share losses outside the United States at 55% (Sanofi)/45% (us). In addition to profit sharing, we are entitled to receive up to $250.0 million in sales milestone payments, with milestone payments commencing after aggregate annual sales outside the United States exceed $1.0 billion on a rolling 12-month basis.
Immuno-Oncology. In July 2015, we and Sanofi entered into a global strategic collaboration to discover, develop, and commercialize antibody-based cancer treatments in the field of immuno-oncology (the IO Collaboration). The IO Collaboration is governed by an Immuno-oncology Discovery and Development Agreement (IO Discovery Agreement), and an Immuno-oncology License and Collaboration Agreement (IO License and Collaboration Agreement). In connection with the IO Discovery Agreement, Sanofi made a $265.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to us. Pursuant to the IO Discovery Agreement, we will spend up to $1,090.0 million (IO Discovery Budget) to identify and validate potential immuno-oncology targets and develop therapeutic antibodies against such targets through clinical proof-of-concept. Sanofi will reimburse us for up to $825.0 million (IO Discovery Funding) of these costs, subject to certain annual limits (up to $200.0 million for 2017). The term of the IO Discovery Agreement will continue through the later of five years from the effective date of the IO Collaboration or the date the IO Discovery Budget is exhausted, subject to Sanofi’s option to extend it for up to an additional three years for the continued development (and funding) of selected ongoing programs. Pursuant to the IO Discovery Agreement, we will be primarily responsible for the design and conduct of all research activities, including target identification and validation, antibody development, preclinical activities, toxicology studies, manufacture of preclinical and clinical supplies, filing of IND Applications, and clinical development through proof-of-concept. We will reimburse Sanofi for half of the development costs they funded that are attributable to clinical development of antibody product candidates under the IO Discovery Agreement from our share of future profits, if any, from commercialized IO Collaboration products to the extent they are sufficient for this purpose. With regard to product candidates for which proof-of-concept is established, Sanofi will have the option to license rights to the product candidate pursuant to the IO License and Collaboration Agreement (as further described below). 
15

In connection with the IO License and Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi made a $375.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to us. If Sanofi exercises its option to license rights to a product candidate thereunder, it will co-develop the drug candidate with us through product approval. Principal control of development of each product candidate that enters development under the IO License and Collaboration Agreement will alternate between us and Sanofi on a candidate-by-candidate basis. Sanofi will fund drug candidate development costs up front for the candidates for which it is the principal controlling party and we will reimburse half of the total development costs for all such candidates from our share of future IO Collaboration profits to the extent they are sufficient for this purpose. In addition, we and Sanofi will share equally, on an ongoing basis, the development costs for the drug candidates for which we are the principal controlling party. The party having principal control over the development of a product candidate will also lead the commercialization activities for such product candidate in the United States. We are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to supply clinical requirements of each drug candidate under the IO License and Collaboration Agreement until commercial supplies of that IO drug candidate are being manufactured. For all products commercialized under the IO License and Collaboration Agreement, Sanofi will lead commercialization activities outside of the United States. Each party will have the right to co-promote licensed products in countries where it is not the lead commercialization party. The parties will share equally in profits and losses in connection with the commercialization of collaboration products. 
Under the terms of the IO License and Collaboration Agreement, the parties will also co-develop our antibody product candidate targeting PD-1 (REGN2810). We have principal control over the development of REGN2810, and the parties share equally, on an ongoing basis, development expenses for REGN2810 up to a total of $650.0 million. We will lead commercialization activities in the United States, while Sanofi will lead commercialization activities outside of the United States and the parties will equally share profits from worldwide sales. We will be entitled to a milestone payment of $375.0 million in the event that sales of all licensed products targeting PD-1 (including REGN2810), together with sales of any other products licensed under the IO License and Collaboration Agreement and sold for use in combination with a licensed product targeting PD-1, equal or exceed $2.0 billion in any consecutive twelve-month period.
Collaborations with Bayer 
EYLEA outside the United States. Since October 2006, we and Bayer have been parties to a license and collaboration agreement for the global development and commercialization outside the United States of EYLEA. Under the agreement, we and Bayer collaborate on, and share the costs of, the development of EYLEA. Bayer markets EYLEA outside the United States, where, for countries other than Japan, the companies share equally in profits and losses from sales of EYLEA. In Japan, we are entitled to receive a tiered percentage of between 33.5% and 40.0% of EYLEA net sales. 
Commencing with the first commercial sale of EYLEA in a major market country outside the United States, we became obligated to reimburse Bayer for 50% of the development costs that it has incurred under the agreement from our share of the collaboration profits (including payments to us based on sales in Japan). The reimbursement payment in any quarter will equal 5% of the then outstanding repayment obligation, but never more than our share of the collaboration profits in the quarter unless we elect to reimburse Bayer at a faster rate. As a result, we expect that a portion of our share of EYLEA profits outside the United States will be used to reimburse Bayer for this repayment obligation. 
Within the United States, we retain exclusive commercialization rights to EYLEA and are entitled to all profits from any such sales.
Ang2 antibody outside the United States. In March 2016, we entered into an agreement with Bayer governing the joint development and commercialization outside the United States of nesvacumab, an antibody product candidate to Ang2, including in combination with aflibercept, for the treatment of ocular diseases or disorders. Nesvacumab/aflibercept, a combination product candidate comprised of an antibody to Ang2 co-formulated with aflibercept, is being developed under the agreement. In connection with the agreement, Bayer made a $50.0 million non-refundable up-front payment to us and is obligated to pay 25% of global development costs and 50% of development costs exclusively for the territory outside the United States. We are also entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $80.0 million in development milestone payments from Bayer. Bayer will share profits and losses from sales outside the United States equally with us, and is responsible for certain royalties payable to Sanofi on sales of the product outside of the United States. Within the United States, we have exclusive commercialization rights and will retain all of the profits from sales.

Collaboration with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma
Fasinumab Asia. In September 2015, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation (MTPC) providing MTPC with development and commercial rights to fasinumab in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore, Vietnam, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka (the MTPC Territories). In connection with the agreement, MTPC made a $10.0 million non-refundable up-front payment in 2015, and in the first quarter of 2016, MTPC made additional payments of $45.0 million and $15.0 million to us. We are also entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $155.0 million in development milestone and other contingent payments. 
Under the agreement, we are obligated to manufacture and supply MTPC with clinical and commercial supplies of fasinumab. If fasinumab is commercialized in the MTPC Territories, we will supply the product to MTPC at a tiered purchase price, which ranges from 30% to 50% of net sales of the product (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances), and are eligible for additional payments up to an aggregate of $100.0 million upon the achievement of specified annual net sales amounts starting at $200.0 million.
Collaboration with Teva 
Fasinumab. In September 2016, we entered into a collaboration agreement with Teva to develop and commercialize fasinumab globally, excluding certain Asian countries that are subject to our collaboration agreement with MTPC (as described above). In connection with the agreement, Teva made a $250.0 million non-refundable up-front payment in September 2016. We will lead global development activities, and the parties will share equally, on an ongoing basis, development costs under a global development plan. In addition, we are entitled to receive up to an aggregate of $460.0 million in development milestones and up to an aggregate of $1,890.0 million in contingent payments upon achievement of specified annual net sales amounts. We are responsible for the manufacture and supply of fasinumab globally.
Within the United States, we will lead commercialization activities, and the parties will share equally in any profits or losses in connection with commercialization of fasinumab. In the territory outside of the United States, Teva will lead commercialization activities and we will supply product to Teva at a tiered purchase price, which is calculated as a percentage of net sales of the product (subject to adjustment in certain circumstances). 
Collaboration with Intellia Therapeutics
In April 2016, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Intellia Therapeutics, Inc., to advance CRISPR/Cas gene-editing technology for in vivo therapeutic development. We will collaborate with Intellia to conduct research for the discovery, development, and commercialization of new therapies (Product Collaboration), in addition to the research and technology development of the CRISPR/Cas platform (Technology Collaboration). In connection with the execution of the agreement, we made a $75.0 million up-front payment in April 2016. We are responsible for costs of developing and commercializing CRISPR/Cas products under the Product Collaboration agreement and are also obligated to pay potential development and sales milestones, and royalties on any future sales of such products resulting from the development and commercialization of CRISPR/Cas products. In addition, under the Technology Collaboration agreement, we are responsible for funding certain research and technology development costs.
Under the terms of the Product Collaboration agreement, the parties agreed to a target selection process, whereby we may obtain exclusive rights in up to 10 targets to be chosen by us during the collaboration term, subject to various adjustments and limitations set forth in the agreement. Of these 10 total targets, we may select up to five non-liver targets, while the remaining targets will be focused in the liver. Additionally, we may replace a limited number of targets with substitute targets upon the payment of a replacement fee, in which case rights to the replaced target(s) will revert to Intellia. 
The Technology Collaboration term and the period for selecting targets for inclusion under the Product Collaboration both end in 2022, provided that we may make a payment to extend the term for an additional two-year period. The Product Collaboration agreement will continue until the date when no royalty or other payment obligations are due, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of the agreement.
Certain targets that either we or Intellia select pursuant to the target selection process may be subject to a co-development and co-commercialization arrangement at our option or Intellia’s option, as applicable. Transthyretin amyloidosis (ATTR), the first target selected by us, will be subject to the co-development and co-commercialization arrangement between the parties. 
In May 2016, Intellia completed an initial public offering (IPO) of its common stock and thereby triggered our obligation to purchase up to $50.0 million of Intellia common stock in a concurrent private placement. As part of the concurrent private placement, we purchased from Intellia at the closing of the IPO shares of Intellia common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $50.0 million. 
17

Collaboration with Adicet Bio
In July 2016, we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with Adicet Bio, Inc., a privately held company, to develop next-generation engineered immune-cell therapeutics with fully human chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) and T-cell receptors (TCRs) directed to disease-specific cell surface antigens in order to enable the precise engagement and killing of tumor cells. In connection with the execution of the agreement, we made a $25.0 million up-front payment to Adicet, and are obligated to provide Adicet with research funding over the course of a five-year research term.
Under the terms of the agreement, the parties will collaborate to identify and validate targets and work together to develop a pipeline of engineered immune-cell therapeutics for selected targets. We have the option to obtain development and commercial rights for a certain number of the product candidates developed by the parties, subject to an option payment for each product candidate. If we exercise our option on a given product candidate, Adicet then will have an option to participate in the development and commercialization for such product. If Adicet doesn’t exercise its option, Adicet will be entitled to royalties on any future sales of such products by us. In addition to developing CARs and TCRs for use in novel immune-cell therapies as part of the collaboration, we will have the right to use these CARs and TCRs in our other antibody programs outside of the collaboration.
We will also be entitled to royalties on any future sales of products developed and commercialized by Adicet under the agreement for all products for which we do not have development and commercial rights.
Manufacturing
We currently manufacture bulk drug materials at our manufacturing facilities in Rensselaer, New York, which consists of approximately 564,000 square feet of owned research, manufacturing, office, and warehouse space. We currently have approximately 97,000 liters of cell culture capacity at these facilities. 
In 2014, we acquired a 400,000 square foot facility in Limerick, Ireland. We are renovating this facility to accommodate and support our growth, primarily in connection with expanding our manufacturing capacity to support our global supply chain. We currently are in the process of validating the facility, as required by regulatory authorities, for the manufacture of bulk drug materials. 
Certain raw materials or other products necessary for the manufacture and formulation of our products and product candidates are provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party suppliers. In addition, we rely on certain third parties to perform packaging, filling, finishing, labeling, distribution, laboratory testing, and other services related to the manufacture of our products and product candidates, and to supply various raw materials and other products. See Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Manufacturing and Supply" for further information.
Among the conditions for regulatory marketing approval of a medicine is the requirement that the prospective manufacturer's quality control and manufacturing procedures conform to the good manufacturing practice (GMP) regulations of the health authority. In complying with standards set forth in these regulations, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the areas of production and quality control to ensure full technical compliance. Manufacturing establishments, both foreign and domestic, are also subject to inspections by or under the authority of the FDA and by other national, federal, state, and local agencies. We are approved by the FDA and other regulatory agencies to manufacture our marketed products at our Rensselaer facilities. 
Sales and Marketing 
We have a New Products Marketing and Planning group, a Market Research group, and a Market Access group to evaluate commercial opportunities for our targets and drug candidates, assess the competitive environment, and analyze the commercial potential of our product portfolio, and prepare for market launch of new products. These groups are fully functional to support our product and product candidates that we are independently developing and/or commercializing, and also work closely with our collaborators for co-developed products to develop marketing plans and forecasts and to develop and execute pre-launch market development programs.
We also have a full-service commercialization group to handle various aspects of our commercial programs. The group includes experienced professionals in the fields of marketing, communications, professional education, patient education and advocacy, reimbursement and market access, trade and distribution, commercial operations, commercial analytics, market research, and forecasting. Moreover, for EYLEA and Praluent, we have hired, trained, and deployed a field-based organization including regional directors, medical specialists, and reimbursement managers, each typically with a number of years of experience in the biopharmaceutical industry in a variety of therapeutic areas including oncology, ophthalmology, immunology, and inflammation. We have over 450 field-based employees in the United States, including personnel that have been recently hired in preparation for the potential approval of sarilumab and Dupixent. 
18

In connection with the sales and marketing of ARCALYST for CAPS, we have a marketing, trade, reimbursement, and distribution group to provide case management and reimbursement services to patients with CAPS and their treating physicians. 
Customers
We sell EYLEA in the United States to several distributors and specialty pharmacies. We sell ARCALYST in the United States to two specialty pharmacies. Under these distribution models, the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally take physical delivery of product. For EYLEA, the distributors and specialty pharmacies generally sell the product directly to healthcare providers, whereas for ARCALYST, the specialty pharmacies sell the product directly to patients. We had sales to three customers (Besse Medical, a subsidiary of AmerisourceBergen Corporation; McKesson Corporation; and Curascript SD Specialty Distribution, a subsidiary of Express Scripts) that each accounted for more than 10% of total gross product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. On a combined basis, our product sales to these customers accounted for approximately 99% of our gross product revenue for the year ended December 31, 2016. We are also a party to collaboration agreements with Bayer and Sanofi, whereby our collaborator is responsible for recording product sales of EYLEA outside the United States and global sales of Praluent, respectively. 
Competition
We face substantial competition from pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and chemical companies. Our competitors include Genentech (a member of the Roche Group), Roche, Novartis AG, Pfizer Inc., Allergan, Inc., Eli Lilly and Company, AbbVie Inc., Merck & Co., Inc., Amgen Inc., AstraZeneca PLC, Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, Johnson & Johnson, GlaxoSmithKline plc, and others. Many of our competitors have substantially greater research, preclinical, and clinical product development, manufacturing capabilities, and financial, marketing, and human resources than we do. Competition from smaller competitors may also be or become more significant if those competitors acquire or discover patentable inventions, form collaborative arrangements, or merge with large pharmaceutical companies. Even if we are able to commercialize additional product candidates, one or more of our competitors may have brought a competitive product to market earlier than us or may have obtained or obtain patent protection that dominates or adversely affects our activities or products. Our ability to compete depends, to a great extent, on how fast we can develop safe and effective product candidates, complete clinical testing and approval processes, and supply commercial quantities of the product to the market. Competition among product candidates approved for sale is based on efficacy, safety, reliability, availability, price, patent position, and other factors.

Monoclonal Antibodies in Development. Our clinical candidates in development are all fully human monoclonal antibodies which were generated using our VelocImmune technology. Our antibody generation technologies and clinical candidates face competition from many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies using various technologies. Numerous other companies are developing therapeutic antibody products. Companies such as Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, AstraZeneca, Amgen, Biogen Inc., Novartis, Roche/Genentech, Bristol-Myers Squibb, AbbVie, and GlaxoSmithKline have generated therapeutic products that are currently in development or on the market that are derived from recombinant DNA that comprise human antibody sequences. Astellas has licensed our VelocImmune technology as part of their internal antibody development programs. 
The following table provides an overview of the competitive landscape for our antibody programs that are in late-stage clinical development:
22

23

The table above is not exhaustive and is focused on antibody competitors. We are also aware of several companies developing or marketing small molecules that may compete with our antibody product candidates in various indications, if such product candidates obtain regulatory approval in those indications. For sarilumab, oral, small-molecule JAK inhibitors such as Pfizer's Xeljanz® (tofacitinib citrate) and Eli Lilly's baricitinib may pose a competitive threat in the rheumatoid arthritis indication if sarilumab is approved in such indication. For dupilumab, Pfizer's Eucrisa® (crisaborole) may be a competitor in the atopic dermatitis indication if dupilumab is approved in such indication.
For additional information regarding our antibody programs and the substantial competition they face, see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Commercialization of Products - Our marketed products are subject to significant competition, and our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, if any are approved for marketing, may face significant competition." 
Other Areas. Many pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies are attempting to discover new therapeutics for indications in which we invest substantial time and resources. In these and related areas, intellectual property rights have been sought and certain rights have been granted to competitors and potential competitors of ours, and we may be at a substantial competitive disadvantage in such areas as a result of, among other things, our lack of experience, trained personnel, and expertise. A number of corporate and academic competitors are involved in the discovery and development of novel therapeutics that are the focus of other research or development programs we are now conducting. Some of these competitors are currently conducting advanced preclinical and clinical research programs in these areas. These and other competitors may have established substantial intellectual property and other competitive advantages.
If any of these or other competitors announces a successful clinical study involving a product that may be competitive with one of our product candidates or the grant of marketing approval by a regulatory agency for a competitive product, such developments may have an adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, cash flows, or future prospects.
We also compete with academic institutions, governmental agencies, and other public or private research organizations, which conduct research, seek patent protection, and establish collaborative arrangements for the development and marketing of products that would provide royalties or other consideration for use of their technology. These institutions are becoming more active in seeking patent protection and licensing arrangements to collect royalties or other consideration for use of the technology they have developed. Products developed in this manner may compete directly with products we develop. We also compete with others in acquiring technology from these institutions, agencies, and organizations.
Patents, Trademarks, and Trade Secrets
Our success depends, in part, on our ability to obtain patents, maintain trade secret protection, and operate without infringing on the proprietary rights of third parties (see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Market Exclusivity - We may be restricted in our development, manufacturing, and/or commercialization activities by patents or other proprietary rights of others, and could be subject to damage awards if we are found to have infringed such patents or rights"; and Part I, Item 3. "Legal Proceedings"). Our policy is to file patent applications to protect technology, inventions, and improvements that we consider important to our business and operations. We hold an ownership interest in a number of issued patents in the United States and foreign countries with respect to our products and technologies. In addition, we hold an ownership interest in hundreds of patent applications in the United States and foreign countries. 
Our patent portfolio includes granted patents and pending patent applications covering our VelociSuite technologies, including our VelocImmune mouse platform which produces fully human monoclonal antibodies. Our issued patents covering these technologies generally expire between 2020 and 2030. However, we continue to file patent applications directed to improvements to these technology platforms.
Our patent portfolio also includes issued patents and pending applications relating to commercialized products and our product candidates in clinical development. These patents cover the proteins and DNA encoding the proteins, manufacturing patents, method of use patents, and pharmaceutical compositions, as well as various methods of using the products. 
The following table describes our U.S. patents and European patents (EP) that we currently consider of primary importance to our marketed products, including the territory, patent number, general subject matter class, and expected expiration dates. The noted expiration dates include any patent term adjustments. Certain of these patents may also be entitled to term extensions. We continue to pursue additional patents and patent term extensions in the United States and other jurisdictions covering various aspects of our products that may, if issued, extend exclusivity beyond the expiration of the patents listed in the table below. One or more patents with the same or earlier expiry date may fall under the same "general subject matter class" for certain products and are not separately listed.

In addition, in the United States and certain other countries, our competitive position may be enhanced due to the availability of market exclusivity under relevant law (for additional information regarding market exclusivity, see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property and Market Exclusivity - Loss or limitation of patent rights, and new regulatory pathways for biosimilar competition, could reduce the duration of market exclusivity for our products"). The effect of expiration of a patent relating to a particular product also depends upon other factors, such as the nature of the market and the position of the product in it, the growth of the market, the complexities and economics of the process for manufacture of the active ingredient of the product, and the requirements of new drug provisions of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act or similar laws and regulations in other countries.
We also are the nonexclusive licensee of a number of additional patents and patent applications. In 2011, we and Genentech entered into a Non-Exclusive License and Partial Settlement Agreement relating to ophthalmic sales of EYLEA in the United States. Pursuant to this agreement, we received a non-exclusive license to certain patents relating to VEGF receptor proteins, known as the Davis-Smyth patents, and other technology patents. In 2013, we entered into an Amended and Restated Non-Exclusive License and Settlement Agreement with Genentech; under the amended agreement, we received a worldwide non-exclusive license to the Davis-Smyth patents, and certain other patents, owned or co-owned by Genentech for the prevention or treatment of human eye diseases and eye disorders through administration of EYLEA to the eye. Also in 2013, we entered into a Non-Exclusive License and Settlement Agreement with Genentech and Sanofi under which we and Sanofi received a worldwide non-exclusive license to the Davis-Smyth patents, and certain other patents, in all indications for human use other than the prevention or treatment of eye diseases and eye disorders through administration to the eye. Our obligation to pay royalties to Genentech pursuant to these agreements terminated on May 7, 2016, when the licenses granted to us thereunder became fully paid up and royalty free for the duration of the remaining term of the underlying patents.
Patent law relating to the patentability and scope of claims in the biotechnology field is evolving and our patent rights are subject to this additional uncertainty. The degree of patent protection that will be afforded to our products in the United States and other important commercial markets is uncertain and is dependent upon the scope of protection decided upon by the patent offices, courts, and governments in these countries. There is no certainty that our existing patents or others, if obtained, will provide us protection from competition or provide commercial benefit. 
Others may independently develop similar products or processes to those developed by us, duplicate any of our products or processes or, if patents are issued to us, design around any products and processes covered by our patents. We expect to continue, when appropriate, to file product and process applications with respect to our inventions. However, we may not file any such applications or, if filed, the patents may not be issued. Patents issued to or licensed by us may be infringed by the products or processes of others.
Defense and enforcement of our intellectual property rights is expensive and time consuming, even if the outcome is favorable to us. It is possible that patents issued or licensed to us will be successfully challenged, that a court may find that we are infringing validly issued patents of third parties, or that we may have to alter or discontinue the development of our products or pay licensing fees to take into account patent rights of third parties (see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Intellectual Property

and Market Exclusivity - We may be restricted in our development, manufacturing, and/or commercialization activities by patents or other proprietary rights of others, and could be subject to damage awards if we are found to have infringed such patents or rights"; and Part I, Item 3. "Legal Proceedings").
Government Regulation
Regulation by government authorities in the United States and foreign countries is a significant factor in the research, development, manufacture, and marketing of our products and our product candidates (see Part I, Item 1A. "Risk Factors - Risks Related to Commercialization of EYLEA - We and Bayer are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight with respect to EYLEA. If we or Bayer fail to maintain regulatory compliance for EYLEA, EYLEA marketing approval may be withdrawn, which would materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition";  "Risks Related to Commercialization of Praluent - We and Sanofi are subject to significant ongoing regulatory obligations and oversight with respect to Praluent. If we or Sanofi fail to maintain regulatory compliance for Praluent, Praluent marketing approval may be withdrawn, which would materially harm our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition"; and "Risks Related to Maintaining Approval of Our Marketed Products and the Development and Obtaining Approval of Our Product Candidates and New Indications for Our Marketed Products - If we do not maintain regulatory approval for our marketed products, and obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates or new indications for our marketed products, we will not be able to market or sell them, which would materially and negatively impact our business, prospects, operating results, and financial condition."). All of our product candidates will require regulatory approval before they can be commercialized. In particular, human therapeutic products are subject to rigorous preclinical and clinical trials and other pre-market approval requirements by the FDA and foreign authorities. Many aspects of the structure and substance of the FDA and foreign pharmaceutical regulatory practices have been reformed during recent years, and continued reform is under consideration in a number of jurisdictions. The ultimate outcome and impact of such reforms and potential reforms cannot be predicted. 
The activities required before a product candidate may be marketed in the United States begin with preclinical tests. Preclinical tests include laboratory evaluations and animal studies to assess the potential safety and efficacy of the product candidate and its formulations. The results of these studies must be submitted to the FDA as part of an IND, which must be reviewed by the FDA before proposed clinical testing can begin. Typically, clinical testing involves a three-phase process. In Phase 1, trials are conducted with a small number of subjects to determine the early safety profile of the product candidate. In Phase 2, clinical trials are conducted with subjects afflicted with a specific disease or disorder to provide enough data to evaluate the preliminary safety, tolerability, and efficacy of different potential doses of the product candidate. In Phase 3, large-scale clinical trials are conducted with patients afflicted with the specific disease or disorder in order to provide enough data to understand the efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate, as required by the FDA. The results of the preclinical and clinical testing of a biologic product candidate are then submitted to the FDA in the form of a BLA for evaluation to determine whether the product candidate may be approved for commercial sale. In responding to a BLA, the FDA may grant marketing approval, request additional information, or deny the application. Before approving a new drug or biologic product, the FDA also requires that the facilities at which the product will be manufactured or advanced through the supply chain be in compliance with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP, requirements and regulations governing the manufacture, shipment, and storage of the product.
Any approval required by the FDA for any of our product candidates may not be obtained on a timely basis, or at all. The designation of a clinical trial as being of a particular phase is not necessarily indicative that such a trial will be sufficient to satisfy the parameters of a particular phase, and a clinical trial may contain elements of more than one phase notwithstanding the designation of the trial as being of a particular phase. The results of preclinical studies or early stage clinical trials may not predict long-term safety or efficacy of our compounds when they are tested or used more broadly in humans. 
Approval of a product candidate by comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries is generally required prior to commencement of marketing of the product in those countries. The approval procedure varies among countries and may involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain such approval may differ from that required for FDA approval. 
Various federal, state, and foreign statutes and regulations also govern or influence the research, manufacture, safety, labeling, storage, record keeping, marketing, transport, and other aspects of pharmaceutical product candidates. The lengthy process of seeking these approvals and the compliance with applicable statutes and regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources. Any failure by us or our collaborators or licensees to obtain, or any delay in obtaining, regulatory approvals could adversely affect the manufacturing or marketing of our products and our ability to receive product or royalty revenue. 
In addition to the foregoing, our present and future business will be subject to regulation under the United States Atomic Energy Act, the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the National Environmental Policy Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, national restrictions, and other current and potential future local, state, federal, and foreign regulations.
