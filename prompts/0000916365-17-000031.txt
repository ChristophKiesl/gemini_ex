Item 1. | Business

Overview
Tractor Supply Company (the “Company” or “we”) is the largest operator of rural lifestyle retail stores in the United States. The Company is focused on supplying the needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle (which we refer to as the “Out Here” lifestyle), as well as tradesmen and small businesses.  We operate retail stores under the names Tractor Supply Company, Del’s Feed & Farm Supply and Petsense and operate websites under the names TractorSupply.com and Petsense.com.  Our stores are located primarily in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities.
Tractor Supply Company has one reportable industry segment which is the retail sale of products that support the rural lifestyle. At December 31, 2016, we operated 1,738 retail stores in 49 states (1,595 Tractor Supply and Del’s retail stores and 143 Petsense retail stores). Our Tractor Supply stores typically range in size from 15,000 to 20,000 square feet of inside selling space, along with additional outside selling space and our Petsense stores have approximately 5,500 square feet of inside selling space. For Tractor Supply retail locations, we use a standard design for most new built-to-suit locations that includes approximately 15,500 square feet of inside selling space. 
Business Strategy
We believe our sales and earnings growth is the result of executing our business strategy, which includes the following key components:

Market Niche
We have identified a specialized market niche: supplying the lifestyle needs of recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.  By focusing our product assortment on these core customers, we believe we are differentiated from general merchandise, home center and other specialty retailers. We cater to the rural lifestyle and often serve a market by being a trip consolidator for many basic maintenance needs for farm, ranch and rural customers.
Customers
Our target customers are home, land, pet and livestock owners who generally have above average income and below average cost of living. We seek to serve a customer base that primarily lives in towns outlying major metropolitan markets and in rural communities. This customer base includes recreational farmers and ranchers and others who enjoy the rural lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.
Customer Service
We are committed to providing our customers reliable product availability and a high level of in-store service through our motivated, well-trained store team members. We believe the ability of our store team members to provide friendly, responsive and seasoned advice helps our customers find the right products to satisfy their everyday needs as well as the specialty items needed to complete their rural lifestyle projects.  We also engage with our customers through an e-commerce website (TractorSupply.com), which provides the opportunity to allow customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information, research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas.  Additionally, we maintain a customer solutions center at our Store Support Center located in Brentwood, Tennessee to support our in-store and online customers as well as our store team members. We believe this commitment to customer service promotes strong customer loyalty and repeat shopping.
We use a third party provider to measure our level of customer service.  This process allows customers to provide feedback on their shopping experience.  Based on the third party provider’s data, we believe our customer satisfaction scores to be among the best-in-class.  We carefully evaluate the feedback we receive from our customers and implement improvements at the individual store level based on that feedback.
Store Personnel and Training
We seek to hire store team members with farming and ranching backgrounds, with particular emphasis on general maintenance, equine and welding. We endeavor to staff our stores with courteous, highly motivated team members and devote considerable resources to training store team members, often in cooperation with our vendors.  Our training programs include:

• | a thorough on-boarding process to prepare new team members for their new role;


• | new store opening training that prepares new store managers to open stores to Company standards;


• | a management training program which covers all aspects of our store operations, delivering superior service and managing the team member experience;


• | structured training on customer service and selling skills;


• | online product knowledge training produced in conjunction with key vendors;


• | leadership development programs that prepare leaders to expand their current contributions; and


• | an annual store manager meeting with vendor product presentations.

Store Environment
Our stores are designed and managed to make shopping an enjoyable experience and to maximize sales and operating efficiencies.  Stores are strategically arranged to provide an open environment for optimal product placement and visual display. In addition, these layouts allow for departmental space to be easily re-allocated and visual displays to be changed for seasonal products and promotions. Display and product placement information is routinely sent to stores to ensure quality and uniformity among the stores.  Informative signs are located in key product categories to assist customers with purchasing decisions and merchandise location.  These signs provide customers with a comparison of product qualities, clear pricing, useful information regarding product benefits, and suggestions for appropriate accessories. Our store layouts and visual displays are designed to provide our customers a feeling of familiarity and enhance the shopping experience. Also, our store team members wear highly visible red vests, aprons or smocks with nametags, and our customer service and checkout counters are conveniently located near the front of the store.
Merchandising and Purchasing
We offer an extensive assortment of products for those seeking to enjoy the Out Here lifestyle, as well as tradesmen and small businesses.  Our product assortment is tailored to meet the needs of our customers in various geographic markets. Our full line of product offerings includes a broad selection of high quality, reputable brand name and exclusive brand products and is supported by a strong in-stock inventory position with an average of 16,000 to 20,000 products per store.  No one product accounted for more than 10% of our sales during 2016. Our comprehensive selection of merchandise is comprised of the following major product categories:

• | Equine, livestock, pet and small animal products, including items necessary for their health, care, growth and containment;


• | Hardware, truck, towing and tool products;


• | Seasonal products, including heating, lawn and garden items, power equipment, gifts and toys;


• | Work/recreational clothing and footwear; and


• | Maintenance products for agricultural and rural use.

The following chart indicates the percentage of net sales represented by each of our major product categories during fiscal 2016, 2015 and 2014:

 | Percent of Net Sales
Product Category: | 2016 | | 2015 | | 2014
Livestock and Pet | 46 | % | | 44 | % | 44 | %
Hardware, Tools, Truck and Towing | 22 | | | 23 | | 22 | 
Seasonal, Gift and Toy Products | 19 | | | 20 | | 20 | 
Clothing and Footwear | 8 | | | 8 | | 9 | 
Agriculture | 5 | | | 5 | | 5 | 
Total | 100 | % | | 100 | % | 100 | %

Our buying team continuously reviews and updates our product assortment to respond to customer needs and to offer new, relevant products. We are focused on providing key products that our customers use on a regular basis for their lifestyle and maintenance needs with emphasis on consumable, usable, and edible (“C.U.E.”) products.  Examples of C.U.E. product categories include, but are not limited to, livestock feed and bedding, pet food, lubricants, and various seasonal products, such as heating, pest control and twine.

Index

Our products are sourced through both domestic and international vendors.  Our business is not dependent upon any one vendor or particular group of vendors.  We purchase our products from a group of approximately 850 vendors, with no one vendor representing more than 10% of our purchases during fiscal 2016.  Approximately 300 core vendors accounted for 90% of our merchandise purchases during fiscal 2016.  We have not experienced any significant difficulty in obtaining satisfactory alternative sources of supply for our products, and we believe that adequate sources of supply exist at substantially similar costs for nearly all of our products.  We have no material long-term contractual commitments with any of our product vendors.
Our buying teams focus on merchandise procurement, vendor line reviews and testing of new products and programs.  We also employ a dedicated inventory management team that focuses exclusively on forecasting and inventory replenishment, a committed merchandise planning team that concentrates on assortment planning and a specialized pricing team that seeks to optimize market-specific pricing for our products.  Through the combined efforts of these teams, we continue to focus on improving our overall inventory productivity and in-stock position.
Intellectual Property 
Our subsidiary, Tractor Supply Co. of Texas, LP (“TSCT”), owns registrations with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (“USPTO”) for various service marks including TSC®, Tractor Supply Co.®, TSC Tractor Supply Co.® and the trapezium design for retail store services. We consider these service marks, and the accompanying goodwill and name recognition, to be valuable assets of our business. TSCT also owns several other service marks for retail services, some of which have been registered with the USPTO and some of which are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO. 
In addition to selling products that bear nationally-known manufacturer brands, we also sell products manufactured for us under a number of exclusive brands that we consider to be important to our business. These exclusive brands are manufactured for us by a number of vendors and provide an alternative to the national brands, which helps provide value for our customers and positions us as a destination store. 
Our exclusive brands represented approximately 32% of our total sales in fiscal 2016 and approximately 31% of our total sales in fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2014. Our exclusive brands include:

 4health® (pet foods and supplies) |  JobSmart® (tools) 
 Bit & Bridle® (apparel and footwear) |  Paws & Claws® (pet foods and supplies) 
 Blue Mountain® (apparel) |  Producer’s Pride® (livestock and horse feed and supplies) 
 C.E. Schmidt® (apparel and footwear) |  Red Shed® (gifts, collectibles, and outdoor furniture) 
 Countyline® (livestock, farm and ranch equipment) |  Redstone® (heating products) 
 Dumor® (livestock and horse feed and supplies) |  Retriever® (pet foods and supplies) 
 Equistages® (horse feed) |  Royal Wing® (bird feed and supplies) 
 Groundwork® (lawn and garden supplies) |  Traveller® (truck and automotive products) 
 Huskee® (outdoor power equipment) |  TSC Tractor Supply Co® (trailers, truck tool boxes and animal
 | bedding) 

The exclusive brands identified above have been registered as trademarks with the USPTO for certain products and are the subject of applications for registration pending before the USPTO for other products. 
Our trademark and service mark registrations have various expiration dates; however, provided that we continue to use the marks and renew the registrations in a timely manner, the registrations are potentially perpetual in duration.
We believe our intellectual property, which includes the trademarks and service marks identified above, together with certain trade names, domain names, patents and copyrights, has significant value and is an important component of our merchandising and marketing strategies. 
Distribution
We currently operate a distribution network for supplying stores with merchandise and delivering product ordered through TractorSupply.com. In fiscal 2016, our Tractor Supply stores received approximately 75% of merchandise through this network while the remaining merchandise shipped directly to the stores from our vendors. We believe this flow facilitates the prompt and efficient distribution of merchandise in order to enhance in-stocks, minimize freight costs and improve the inventory turn rate. Our distribution facilities, located in Arizona, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, Texas, and Washington, represent total distribution capacity of 5.0 million square feet. In fiscal 2017, we plan to begin construction on a new northeast distribution

center as well as an expansion of our existing distribution center in Waverly, Nebraska which will provide additional distribution capacity once construction is completed.
We select the locations of our distribution facilities in an effort to minimize logistics costs and optimize the distance from distribution facilities to our stores. Our distribution centers utilize warehouse and labor management tools that support the planning, control and processing of inventory. We manage our inbound and outbound transportation activity in-house through the use of a transportation management system.  We utilize multiple common carriers for store and direct to customer deliveries. We manage our transportation costs through carrier negotiations, the monitoring of transportation routes, and the scheduling of deliveries.
Marketing
We utilize an “everyday value price” philosophy to consistently offer our products at competitive prices complemented by strategically planned promotions throughout the year. To drive store traffic and position ourselves as a destination store, we promote broad selections of merchandise with newspaper circulars, customer targeted direct mail and e-mail, as well as digital and social media offerings.  Vendors frequently support these specific programs by offering temporary cost reductions and honoring coupons. Our vendors also provide assistance with product presentation and fixture design, brochures, support for in-store events, and point-of-purchase materials for customer education and product knowledge for our team members. 
Omni-Channel
We communicate with our customers across multiple touch points including our stores, e-commerce website (TractorSupply.com), e-mail, social media, direct mail and our customer call center.  Our goal is to be available at any time and in any way our customers choose to engage with our brand.  Connecting with consumers online provides the opportunity for customers to shop at a time and place that fits their schedule while delivering enhanced product information, research and decision tools that support product selection and informational needs in specific subject areas.  We give our customers the ability to purchase products and have them shipped to one of our retail stores, their homes or offices. In 2016, we also began offering in certain stores an option to buy online and pick up in store. We believe our e-commerce capabilities further enhance customer service and extend our market to areas where our retail stores are not currently located. We maintain a fulfillment center within our Franklin, Kentucky distribution center to support our e-commerce activities. Additionally in 2016, we continued to invest in our omni-channel platform through expanded capabilities related to fulfillment options, product information and site research. We are focused on delivering an enhanced mobile and tablet experience, improving the site response time and expanding our product offerings for vendor direct to customer shipments.
Petsense
On September 29, 2016, we acquired Petsense, a small-box pet specialty supply retailer focused on meeting the needs of pet owners, primarily in small and mid-sized communities, and offering a variety of pet products and services. At December 31, 2016, we operated 143 Petsense stores in 26 states. The Petsense name is registered with the USPTO. Our two HomeTown Pet stores were converted to Petsense stores in fiscal 2017.
Management and Team Members
As of December 31, 2016, we employed approximately 13,000 full-time and 13,000 part-time team members. We also employ additional part-time team members during peak periods.  We are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.
At the end of fiscal 2016, our store operations were organized into eleven regions.  Each region is led by a regional director or vice president, and the region is further organized into districts, each of which is led by a district manager.  We have two internal advisory boards, one comprised of store managers and the other comprised of district managers.  These groups bring a grassroots perspective to operational initiatives and generate chain-wide endorsement of proposed best-practice solutions.
All of our team members participate in one of various bonus incentive programs, which provide the opportunity to receive additional compensation based upon team and/or Company performance. In addition to bonus incentive programs, we provide our eligible team members the opportunity to participate in an employee stock purchase plan and a 401(k) retirement savings plan. We also share in the cost of health insurance provided to eligible team members, and team members receive a discount on merchandise purchased from the Company.
We encourage a promote-from-within environment when internal resources permit.  We also provide internal leadership development programs designed to prepare our high-potential team members for greater responsibility. Our current team of district managers and store managers have an average tenure of approximately six years.  Management believes internal promotions, coupled with the hiring of individuals with previous retail experience, will provide the management structure necessary to support our planned growth.

Continuous Improvement
We are committed to a continuous improvement program called Tractor Value System (“TVS”), which is our catalyst to drive change throughout our organization.  TVS is a business management system that emphasizes, through data analytics and team member engagement, a focus on continuous improvement.  Through TVS, we examine business processes and identify opportunities to reduce costs, drive innovation, and improve effectiveness.  We have implemented numerous continuous improvement projects (with team members from multiple areas of our business) to evaluate key operations and implement process changes. Team members are empowered and expected to challenge current paradigms and improve processes. Our management encourages the participation of all team members in decision-making, regularly solicits input and suggestions from our team members and incorporates suggestions into our improvement activities.
Management Information and Control Systems
We have invested considerable resources in our management information and control systems to support superior customer service, manage the purchase, pricing and distribution of our merchandise, improve our operating efficiencies and support online operations. Our key management information and control systems include a point-of-sale system, an e-commerce platform, a supply chain management and replenishment system, a transportation management system, warehouse and labor management tools, a price optimization system, a vendor purchase order control system and a merchandise presentation system. These systems are integrated through an enterprise resource planning (“ERP”) system.  This ERP system tracks merchandise from initial order through ultimate sale and interfaces with our financial systems.
We continue to evaluate and improve the functionality of our systems to maximize their effectiveness. Such efforts include ongoing hardware and software evaluations, refreshes and upgrades to support optimal software configurations and application performance.  We plan to continue to invest in information technology and implement efficiency-driving system enhancements.  We continue to strengthen the security of our information systems and invest in technology to support store, distribution facility and omni-channel expansion.  These efforts are directed toward improving business processes, maintaining secure, efficient and stable systems, and enabling the continued growth and success of our business. 
Growth Strategy
Our current and long-term growth strategy is to:  (1) expand domestic geographic market presence through opening new retail stores, (2) enhance financial performance through comparable store sales growth achieved through targeted merchandising and marketing programs with an “everyday value price” philosophy supported by strong customer service, (3) enhance product margin through strategic product sourcing, inventory and markdown management, a strong exclusive brand offering, and optimization of product pricing and transportation costs, (4) leverage operating costs by focusing on opportunities for continuous improvement and elimination of waste in all of our processes, (5) expand market opportunities via omni-channel enhancements, tying together our website product content, social media, digital and online shopping experience, and (6) expand through selective acquisitions, as such opportunities arise, to add complementary businesses and to enhance penetration into new and existing markets to supplement organic growth.
Over the past five years, we have experienced considerable sales growth, resulting in a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 9.9%. We plan to open approximately 100 new Tractor Supply and 25 to 30 new Petsense stores in fiscal 2017, a selling square footage increase of approximately 6.6%.  In fiscal 2016, we opened 113 new Tractor Supply stores and began operating 143 Petsense stores as compared to 114 new Tractor Supply stores in fiscal 2015. This represents a selling square footage increase of approximately 10.8% during fiscal 2016 and 8.0% during fiscal 2015. 
At December 31, 2016, we operated 1,738 retail stores in 49 states (1,595 Tractor Supply and Del’s retail stores and 143 Petsense retail stores). Given the size of the communities that we target, we believe that there is ample opportunity for new store growth in many existing and new markets. We have developed a proven method for selecting store sites and have identified approximately 900 additional markets for new Tractor Supply stores. We also believe that there is opportunity for up to 1,000 Petsense stores. Approximately 54% of our Tractor Supply stores are in freestanding buildings and 46% are located in strip shopping centers.  We lease approximately 94% of our stores and own the remaining 6%.
Competition
We operate in a competitive retail industry. The principal competitive factors include location of stores, fulfillment options, price, quality of merchandise, in-stock consistency, merchandise assortment and presentation, product knowledge and customer service. We compete with general merchandise retailers, home center retailers, specialty and discount retailers, independently owned retail farm and ranch stores, numerous privately-held regional farm store chains and farm cooperatives, as well as internet-based retailers.  However, we believe we successfully differentiate ourselves from many of these retailers by focusing on our specialized

market niche for customers living the rural lifestyle. See further discussion of competition in 1A, “Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
Seasonality and Weather
Our business is seasonal.  Historically, our sales and profits are the highest in the second and fourth fiscal quarters due to the sale of seasonal products. We experience our highest inventory and accounts payable balances during our first fiscal quarter for purchases of seasonal products to support the higher sales volume of the spring selling season and again during our third fiscal quarter to support the higher sales volume of the cold-weather selling season.
Historically, weather conditions, including unseasonably warm weather in the fall and winter months and unseasonably cool weather in the spring and summer months, have affected the timing and volume of our sales and results of operations. In addition, extreme weather conditions, including snow and ice storms, flood and wind damage, hurricanes, tornadoes, heavy rain and droughts, have impacted operating results both negatively and positively, depending on the severity and length of these conditions. Our strategy is to manage product flow and adjust merchandise assortments and depth of inventory to capitalize on seasonal demand trends.
Stewardship and Compliance with Environmental Matters
Our operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, enacted or adopted, regulating the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment.  We are committed to complying with all applicable environmental laws and regulations.  We are also committed to becoming a more environmentally sustainable company.  This commitment is demonstrated through our Stewardship Program, which is our environmental sustainability program.  Through this program, the Company has implemented a number of initiatives designed to reduce our impact on the environment.  These initiatives include the installation of energy management systems, LED lighting, high efficiency heating/air conditioning systems in our stores, and recycling programs in our stores, distribution facilities and the Store Support Center. Our Store Support Center, opened in 2014, and our distribution center in Casa Grande, Arizona, opened in 2015, were each awarded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) Silver certification for environmentally sustainable design, construction and operation.  We also installed solar arrays at the Store Support Center in Brentwood, Tennessee and our store in Hendersonville, Tennessee.
