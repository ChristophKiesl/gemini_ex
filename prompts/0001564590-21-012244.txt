Item 1. Business. 
Overview 
 We are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing a pipeline of novel, proprietary therapeutics that have the potential to transform radiotherapy in cancer. We leverage our expertise in superoxide dismutase mimetics to design drugs to reduce normal tissue toxicity from radiotherapy and to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. Our lead product candidate, avasopasem manganese (GC4419, also referred to as avasopasem), is a potent and highly selective small molecule dismutase mimetic we are initially developing for the reduction of severe oral mucositis, or SOM. We are also developing a second dismutase mimetic product candidate, GC4711, to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of stereotactic body radiation therapy, or SBRT.
 SOM is a common, debilitating complication of radiotherapy in patients with head and neck cancer, or HNC. In February 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation to avasopasem for the reduction of SOM induced by radiotherapy, with or without systemic therapy. In October 2018, we began evaluating avasopasem in a Phase 3 registrational trial, which we refer to as the ROMAN trial, and we expect to report topline data from this trial in the second half of 2021. We believe avasopasem, which to date is not approved for any indication, has the potential to be the first FDA-approved drug and the standard of care for the reduction in the incidence of SOM in patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy, and we plan to further evaluate its use in other radiotherapy-induced toxicities, including esophagitis. In January 2020, we announced that the first patient was dosed in a Phase 2a trial evaluating the efficacy of avasopasem in reducing the incidence of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis in patients with lung cancer, which we refer to as the AESOP trial. We expect to report topline data from this trial in the first half of 2022. In June 2020, following a delay in the planned initiation of the trial due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the first patient was dosed in a Phase 2a multi-center trial in Europe assessing the safety of avasopasem in patients with HNC undergoing standard-of-care radiotherapy, which we refer to as the EUSOM trial. We expect to report topline data from this trial in the second half of 2021.
 Avasopasem has successfully completed two clinical trials to reduce SOM in patients with HNC undergoing intensity-modulated radiation therapy, or IMRT, and also receiving cisplatin, a chemotherapy drug. SOM is commonly defined as Grade 3 or Grade 4 oral mucositis on the World Health Organization, or WHO, scale. We demonstrated proof-of-concept with avasopasem for this indication in a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 223-patient Phase 2b trial. In the trial, avasopasem met the primary endpoint by demonstrating a statistically significant reduction in duration of SOM in the 90 mg treatment arm as compared to placebo, consistent with the results of our Phase 1b/2a SOM trial. The median duration of SOM in this arm was 1.5 days, a 92% reduction compared to placebo. Key secondary endpoints evaluating the incidence and severity of SOM also demonstrated substantial dose-dependent reductions of 34% and 47%, respectively, in the 90 mg treatment arm, and avasopasem was well tolerated in this trial. Severity is defined as the reduction in incidence of Grade 4 oral mucositis on the WHO scale. In addition, in this trial, consistent with results from our other clinical trials and preclinical studies to date, the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy was maintained through two years when combined with avasopasem. Following consultation with the FDA, we initiated the ROMAN trial, a single confirmatory, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 3 registrational trial of a 90 mg dose of avasopasem in patients with locally advanced HNC receiving radiotherapy. The primary endpoint of the ROMAN trial is the reduction in the incidence of SOM through the completion of radiotherapy. 
 Superoxide, a highly reactive molecule, is produced by every cell as a part of normal metabolism, and at higher levels in certain diseases. Left uncontrolled it is highly toxic, leading to cell damage or cell death. To prevent this, the body produces superoxide dismutase enzymes, or SODs, which convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide. Hydrogen peroxide is much less toxic than superoxide to normal tissue. Radiotherapy induces a large burst of superoxide in the irradiated tissues, which can overwhelm these SODs, damaging normal cells. Such damage to the oral mucosa, located in the mouth, is referred to as oral mucositis, or OM, and is particularly common among patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy. 
 Radiotherapy-induced SOM can lead to devastating complications. A majority of patients will suffer severe pain which is often managed with the use of opioids. Patients with SOM are at risk of dehydration and malnutrition as a result of the inability to eat or drink, and often require nutrition through a feeding tube or 
 1


intravenous line. SOM can also be dose-limiting, requiring a reduction or delay in subsequent radiotherapy, leading to poorer clinical outcomes. Approximately 11% of patients receiving radiotherapy for HNC experience unplanned breaks of a week or more in radiotherapy due to SOM, with each week of treatment delay decreasing tumor control by over 10%. Additionally, it is estimated that patients with HNC who developed OM when treated with radiotherapy incurred, on average, approximately $32,000 in additional medical expenses in the first six months from the start of radiotherapy compared to patients with HNC treated with radiotherapy who did not develop OM. 
 Each year in the United States, approximately 65,000 patients are diagnosed with HNC, according to the American Cancer Society. In the five largest European markets, approximately 68,000 patients are diagnosed annually with HNC, and an additional 23,000 in Japan. We estimate that approximately 65% of patients diagnosed with HNC will be treated with radiotherapy. All patients with HNC treated with radiotherapy are at risk for developing SOM, which suggests a target patient population of approximately 42,000 patients in the United States alone for our lead indication. 
 Our market research suggests the potential for significant, rapid uptake of avasopasem for SOM, if approved. Based on a third-party claims database, we estimate that over 80% of radiotherapy treatments for HNC patients are performed at approximately 700 sites. We have conducted primary market research at 125 of these sites. Based on this market research, 72% of the sites have infusion capabilities to administer avasopasem and an additional 17% of the sites could develop the capabilities to infuse with modifications at their facilities. Of the facilities that currently have the ability to infuse, the respondents at these sites suggested they would recommend avasopasem to 55% of their patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy, which is relatively consistent with prior market research. In a separate survey that we conducted of 150 U.S. radiation oncologists, respondents stated that they would recommend avasopasem to 69% of their patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy in combination with chemotherapy or targeted therapy. Furthermore, 96% of these physicians stated that they would try avasopasem within the first twelve months of it becoming available and 77% of physicians stated that they would adopt avasopasem within the first 12 months of it becoming available. We believe, if approved, avasopasem would be prescribed by physicians as standard-of-care treatment for patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy. 
 Based on observations from multiple studies, we estimate that approximately 70% of patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy will develop SOM and between 20% to 30% will develop Grade 4 OM. Despite this clear unmet need, no drug has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of SOM in patients with HNC. Current measures attempting to moderate SOM include basic oral care; anti-inflammatory agents; antimicrobials, coating agents, anesthetics and analgesics; laser and other light therapy, cryotherapy; and natural and other miscellaneous agents. The treatment guidelines developed by the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer and International Society of Oral Oncology, or MASCC / ISOO, demonstrate that there is a high unmet need for the treatment or prevention of OM in patients with HNC, and a lack of clear efficacy with existing treatment options. 
 We have expanded the evaluation of avasopasem into the reduction of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis, or mucositis of the esophagus, which often develops in patients receiving radiotherapy for lung, esophageal, breast or head and neck cancers or for lymphoma. Esophagitis is a frequent and radiotherapy-limiting side effect in these patients. Esophagitis can be life-threatening and symptoms include an inability to swallow, severe pain, ulceration, infection, bleeding and weight loss and it can require hospitalization. There are also no drugs approved by the FDA for the prevention or treatment of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis, with treatment options focused on minimizing the symptoms of the problem. These do not address the underlying cause of esophagitis. In January 2020, we announced the initiation of the Phase 2a AESOP trial for the reduction of the incidence of esophagitis in patients with lung cancer receiving IMRT. 
 Unlike existing treatment options that are largely palliative in nature, we believe avasopasem has the potential to address and mitigate the root cause of radiotherapy-induced mucositis, including OM and esophagitis. By removing superoxide, avasopasem is designed to reduce the damage radiotherapy causes to the patient’s normal tissue, and thereby reduce the incidence and severity of mucositis. In our on-going AESOP trial, we are seeking to reduce the incidence of Grade 2 or worse esophagitis as assessed by the National Cancer Institute, or NCI, Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events scale. 
 In addition to developing avasopasem for the reduction of normal tissue toxicity from radiotherapy, we are developing our dismutase mimetics to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of higher daily doses of radiotherapy, 
 2


including SBRT. SBRT typically involves a patient receiving one to five large doses of radiotherapy, in contrast to the 30 to 35 small daily doses typical of IMRT. Cancer cells have been observed to be more susceptible than normal cells to increased levels of hydrogen peroxide. In our preclinical studies, we have observed increased anti-cancer efficacy of higher daily doses of radiotherapy in combination with our dismutase mimetics. In a preclinical study, we demonstrated that this increase in anti-cancer efficacy was due to the conversion of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide by our dismutase mimetics. This increased efficacy could be particularly important in settings where the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy alone is insufficient to achieve the desired outcome. Clinically, SBRT is increasingly used in patients with certain tumors, such as those seen in locally advanced pancreatic cancer, or LAPC, and non-small cell lung cancer, or NSCLC, that are less responsive to the small daily doses typical of IMRT. Even with the use of SBRT, the opportunity for improvement in treatment outcomes is substantial. 
 To explore this opportunity, we successfully completed a pilot, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase 1/2 trial of avasopasem in combination with SBRT in patients with LAPC. In October 2020, we announced interim data from this trial. In the analysis of the intent-to-treat population, multiple endpoints showed a positive trend in favor of improved anti-cancer efficacy with avasopasem compared to placebo. While many of the patients were early in their follow-up post treatment, addition of the dismutase mimetic to SBRT appeared to improve survival and response rate versus placebo. Toxicity was comparable across both treatment arms, with no significant differences in overall or Grade 3 GI toxicity post-SBRT. The data presented included all patients followed for a minimum of three months and 19 for more than one year, with data through August 24, 2020. We plan to provide final data from this trial with at least one year of follow-up on all patients in the second half of 2021.
 We leveraged our observations from the pilot LAPC trial to prepare our GC4711 clinical trials in combination with SBRT. We have successfully completed Phase 1 trials of intravenous GC4711 in healthy volunteers and initiated a Phase 1/2 trial in patients with NSCLC, in October 2020, which we refer to as the GRECO-1 trial. The GRECO-1 trial is supported in part by a Small Business Innovation Research grant from the NCI of the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for the investigation of our dismutase mimetics in combination with SBRT for the treatment of lung cancer. We intend for this trial to assess the anti-cancer efficacy and safety of GC4711 in combination with SBRT. Subsequently, we intend to assess the anti-cancer efficacy and safety of GC4711 in combination with SBRT and a checkpoint inhibitor. We expect to report initial data from this trial in the first half of 2022. 
 We also plan to initiate a Phase 2b trial of GC4711 in combination with SBRT in patients with LAPC in the first half of 2021, which we refer to as the GRECO-2 trial. The GRECO-2 trial is designed as a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to determine the impact on overall survival by adding GC4711 to SBRT following chemotherapy in patients with LAPC.
 In September 2020, we initiated a pilot Phase 2 clinical trial of avasopasem to evaluate its ability to improve 28-day mortality in hospitalized patients who are critically ill with COVID-19. The randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 trial is designed to assess the safety and efficacy of avasopasem in improving 28-day mortality, compared to placebo. The trial will enroll up to 50 hospitalized adult patients critically ill with COVID-19 at several sites across the U.S. We expect to report topline data from this trial in the first half of 2021.
 We retain worldwide rights to our product candidate portfolio. Our product candidate portfolio is protected by issued patents with claims directed to composition of matter and method of use, which, when including patent term extensions, are projected to expire between 2027 and 2038 in the United States. 
 We intend to commercialize avasopasem and our other current product candidates, if approved, by building a specialized sales and marketing organization of approximately 40 sales representatives focusing on radiation oncologists in the United States. We believe that this targeted sales organization would allow us to reach the concentrated prescribing base of approximately 4,000 U.S. radiation oncologists, who we believe are among the physicians most likely to use avasopasem and our other product candidates. Outside the United States, we may seek to establish collaborations to maximize the commercial opportunities for avasopasem and our other product candidates. 
 Our management team has extensive drug development and commercialization experience ranging from discovery through market registrational and commercial launches.

Business Update Regarding COVID-19 
 The current COVID-19 pandemic continues to present a substantial public health and economic challenge around the world and is affecting our employees, communities, clinical trial sites and business operations, as well as the U.S. economy and international financial markets. The full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will directly or indirectly impact our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be accurately predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning COVID-19, the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact, including the effectiveness of vaccines and vaccine distribution efforts, and the economic impact on local, regional, national and international markets. See “Risk Factors—Other Risks Related to Our Business—The COVID-19 pandemic caused by the novel strain of coronavirus has adversely impacted and could continue to adversely impact, our business, including our preclinical studies and clinical trials, results of operations and financial condition” in Part I, Item 1A of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.
 While we are currently continuing our ongoing clinical trials, the COVID-19 pandemic and related precautions have directly or indirectly impacted the timeline for certain of our clinical trials. We delayed the initiation of the EUSOM trial due to concerns with clinical trial enrollment in Europe during the COVID-19 pandemic. The first patient was dosed in this trial in June 2020, and target enrollment was decreased to approximately 35 patients due to the delay. This trial was expected to contribute to the safety database for avasopasem in patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy. As a result of the delay in initiating the trial in Europe, the target enrollment for the ROMAN trial was increased to approximately 450 patients in order to ensure we are positioned to maintain the planned overall size of the safety database in a timely manner. We have since completed enrollment in the EUSOM trial and continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe and any potential impact on the data readout for this trial, which is expected in the second half of 2021. Completion of enrollment for the ROMAN trial is expected in the first half of 2021 and topline data is expected in the second half of 2021, subject to the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business. 
 Mitigation activities to minimize COVID-19-related operation disruptions are ongoing given the severity and evolving nature of the situation, and we are continuing to monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and ongoing clinical development activity, generally.
 Our third-party contract manufacturing partners continue to operate at or near normal levels. While we currently do not anticipate any material interruptions in our clinical trial supply or manufacturing scale-up activities, it is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic and response efforts may have an impact in the future on our third-party suppliers and contract manufacturing partners' ability to manufacture our clinical trials supply or progress manufacturing scale-up activities.
 We have also implemented measures designed to protect the health and safety of our workforce, including a work-from-home policy in line with state and local requirements for employees who can perform their jobs offsite. We are continuing our essential research and development activities at our laboratory and are taking precautionary measures to protect our employees working in our facilities in such capacities.

Our Pipeline 
 The following table summarizes our product candidates: 
 
Our Strategy 
 Our mission is to transform cancer therapy by reducing normal tissue toxicity induced by radiotherapy and to improve the lives of patients with cancer. We are also seeking to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy with the use of our dismutase mimetics. Key elements of our strategy are as follows: 

• | Complete development and obtain FDA approval of avasopasem for the reduction of radiotherapy-induced toxicities. Avasopasem has received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA for the reduction of SOM induced by radiotherapy, with or without systemic therapy. We are currently evaluating avasopasem in a Phase 3 registrational trial to reduce the incidence of SOM in patients receiving radiotherapy for locally advanced HNC. We are also evaluating avasopasem in a Phase 2a trial to reduce the incidence of esophagitis in patients receiving radiotherapy for lung cancer. Based upon the outcomes of our ongoing trials, we may initiate additional clinical trials for avasopasem to reduce radiotherapy-induced toxicities in other cancer indications. We may also pursue a strategy for avasopasem, if approved for reduction in the incidence of SOM, of presenting clinical data to entities like the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, or NCCN, to support the use of avasopasem to reduce esophagitis and/or other radiotherapy-induced toxicities as medically accepted indications in published drug compendia, notwithstanding that these indications may not be approved by the FDA.

• | Build a commercial infrastructure in the United States. We intend to commercialize avasopasem, if approved, by building a specialized sales and marketing organization in the United States focused on radiation oncologists. We believe a scientifically-oriented, customer-focused team of approximately 40 sales representatives would allow us to effectively reach the approximately 4,000 radiation oncologists in the United States. We also expect to leverage this sales organization to commercialize GC4711, if approved, and any of our future product candidates in the United States. Outside the United States, we may seek to establish collaborations for the commercialization of avasopasem and our other product candidates.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Advance the development of GC4711 in combination with SBRT to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. Based on extensive preclinical research results and positive interim data from our pilot LAPC trial, we believe that GC4711 has the potential to increase the anti-cancer efficacy and safety profile of SBRT. We successfully completed Phase 1 trials with GC4711 in healthy volunteers and initiated a Phase 1/2 trial with GC4711 in combination with SBRT in

patients with NSCLC in October 2020. In addition, we expect to initiate a Phase 2b trial with GC4711 in combination with SBRT in patients with LAPC in the first half of 2021.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Develop additional novel dismutase mimetics and formulations. We intend to leverage our expertise in superoxide dismutase mimetics to continue to develop novel compounds that are intended to reduce normal tissue toxicity from radiotherapy and increase the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. Additionally, we believe we can broaden the utility of GC4711 or other novel dismutase mimetics in our portfolio by formulating them for oral delivery or other routes of administration. We are currently evaluating multiple formulations of GC4711 and other novel compounds. In addition, we intend to seek new applications for our dismutase mimetics, including other potential combinations in cancer therapy.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Seek strategic collaborative relationships. We intend to seek strategic collaborations to facilitate the capital-efficient development of our dismutase mimetics. We believe these collaborations could potentially provide significant funding to advance our dismutase mimetics candidate pipeline while allowing us to benefit from the development expertise of our collaborators.

Background on Superoxide and Superoxide Dismutase 
 Superoxide is similar to the molecular oxygen, O2, that is essential to breathing and life, except it carries one more electron. This extra electron, shown in the chemical formula O2•-, makes superoxide a reactive oxygen species that can react with a variety of biological molecules. Superoxide is produced constantly in every living cell by normal activities such as mitochondrial respiration, and if not removed rapidly, it causes damage to lipids, proteins, DNA and other critical biological molecules. As a result, it can harm or kill cells and has been implicated in a variety of biological disorders, including cancer. As protection, human cells produce SODs to eliminate superoxide by rapidly and selectively converting it to hydrogen peroxide at rates of 107 molecules per second or higher. Hydrogen peroxide is much less toxic than superoxide to normal cells, and is subsequently broken down by various enzymes, such as catalase (the natural disposal enzyme for hydrogen peroxide), to molecular oxygen and water. The SOD pathway is depicted below. 
 

Radiotherapy induces bursts of superoxide in the irradiated tissues well in excess of normal amounts, which can overwhelm native SOD activity. It generates superoxide directly, by splitting water molecules immediately, and indirectly, by activating enzymes that produce large amounts of superoxide following radiation. In addition, once tissue damage has begun, inflammatory cells attracted to the irradiated region also produce superoxide prodigiously. The resulting high levels of superoxide can induce significant damage in normal cells, and, depending on which organs fall within the irradiated field, can drive a variety of normal tissue toxicities. A condition referred to as mucositis occurs when the cells lining the gastro-intestinal tract, known as the mucosa, are damaged or killed. 
 Scientific literature suggests that metabolic differences make cancer cells much less sensitive than normal cells to elevated superoxide; elevated superoxide levels may even be typical of some cancers. As a result, the removal of the excess superoxide generated by radiotherapy does not decrease the anti-cancer efficacy of 
 6


radiotherapy. Meanwhile, scientific literature also suggests that cancer cells are much more sensitive than normal cells to elevated hydrogen peroxide, so the conversion of excess superoxide to hydrogen peroxide by SODs may contribute to the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. 
 Artificially increasing SOD levels, by gene overexpression or administering recombinant SOD enzyme, has been shown in third-party preclinical and clinical studies to reduce radiotherapy-induced normal tissue toxicities, including mucositis. The preclinical studies have also suggested that increasing SOD levels can increase the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. Current therapeutic applications of the SODs themselves, however, have been limited by their following characteristics: 
  
• | large size and inability to enter cells and mitochondria, where superoxide is predominantly produced;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | immunogenicity, particularly when derived from non-human sources;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | short half-lives in circulation; and
--+-------------------------------------


• | inactivation or inhibition by various reactive oxygen species, including hydrogen peroxide.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our Superoxide Dismutase Mimetics 
 We believe low molecular weight drugs that can mimic native SODs can overcome the limitations of using the native enzymes therapeutically. The challenge has been finding small molecule dismutase mimetics with similarly fast catalytic rates and high selectivity for superoxide that are also stable, safe and suitable for manufacturing. We are developing our dismutase mimetics to address this challenge. 
 Our class of dismutase mimetics are based on a common core structure, where a macrocyclic ring positions five nitrogen atoms to tightly hold a manganese atom in the ring’s center. These pentaaza macrocycles are manufactured with the manganese in the +2 oxidation state, or Mn+2. In solution, this Mn+2 reacts rapidly with the protonated form of superoxide, which has the chemical formula HO2• and is constantly in equilibrium with regular superoxide. In this reaction, Mn+2 gives up an electron and is oxidized to Mn+3, making hydrogen peroxide. Then, as quickly as superoxide can reach the Mn+3, it takes superoxide’s extra electron, reducing back to Mn+2, making molecular oxygen and bringing the dismutase mimetic full circle back to where it started. 
 Our Dismutase Mimetics Core Structure: 
 Pentaaza Macrocycles 
 

We have designed, and are developing, our dismutase mimetics to have each of the following essential features: 
  
• | Speed. Our dismutase mimetics catalyze the conversion of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and molecular oxygen at a rapid rate of 2 × 107 molecules per second or more, comparable to native SODs. Their structures hold the manganese such that it can rapidly shift back and forth between Mn+2 and Mn+3, meaning that their catalytic rate, or the speed that they convert superoxide, is mostly dependent on how fast superoxide can get to the manganese.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | Selectivity. Our dismutase mimetics are designed to interact only with superoxide. Central to this selectivity are three key attributes: (1) the Mn+2 will not react with reducing agents; (2) oxidizing Mn+2 requires a powerful oxidizing agent, so it will not react with nitric oxide and molecular oxygen; and (3) the Mn+2 oxidizes rapidly via a single-electron pathway, excluding many other biologically relevant reactive oxygen species, including peroxynitrite, hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide, that operate as two-electron oxidizing agents.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Stability. Our dismutase mimetics hold on tightly to the manganese at the center of the macrocyclic ring, allowing them to maintain their functionality as dismutase mimetics while they remain in the body.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Safety. We have observed our dismutase mimetics to be well-tolerated in our preclinical studies and clinical trials in patients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Synthesis. We have developed an efficient and cost-effective manufacturing process.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In radiotherapy, we believe our dismutase mimetics have the potential to reduce normal tissue toxicity by removing excessive superoxide. We have demonstrated this in preclinical models not only of mucositis, but also radiotherapy damage to the lungs, liver and other organs. Importantly, our dismutase mimetics do not interfere with the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy, as demonstrated in preclinical tumor models and in our placebo-controlled Phase 2b SOM trial in patients with HNC. 
 There is also the potential to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of SBRT, where our dismutase mimetics generate high daily doses of hydrogen peroxide. Preclinically we have shown this effect in a variety of cancer types, including head and neck, pancreatic, lung and breast cancer and, when SBRT is combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Given the combination of reduced normal tissue toxicity and increased anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy, we believe that our dismutase mimetics can transform radiotherapy. 
 We currently have two dismutase mimetic candidates in clinical development, avasopasem and GC4711. Leveraging our expertise, we plan to continue to develop novel compounds and believe we can broaden the utility of our technology by formulating one or more candidates for oral delivery or other routes of administration. 
 Radiotherapy-Induced Toxicities in Patients with Cancer 
 Over 50% of patients with cancer will be treated with radiotherapy at some time in their treatment cycle. While radiotherapy has variable success depending on the cancer being treated, the toxicity or side effects associated with its use can limit its effectiveness. Radiotherapy causes acute and late toxicities that affect various organs and functions. 
 One of the most common radiotherapy-induced toxicities results in a condition referred to as mucositis which occurs when cells lining the gastro-intestinal tract, known as the mucosa, are damaged or killed. The oral mucosa is a common location for mucositis to occur, particularly for patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy. Another common location for mucositis to occur in patients receiving radiotherapy is the esophagus, referred to as esophagitis.

Oral Mucositis 
 OM occurs when radiotherapy induces the production of superoxide that attacks and breaks down the epithelial cells lining the mouth. The severity of OM is commonly measured using the WHO scale, which is also used by the FDA as a basis for product approvals. The scale consists of five Grades: Grade 0 through Grade 4. SOM is commonly defined as Grade 3 or Grade 4 OM. 

Grade | WHO Scale Description 
------+----------------------------------------------------------------------
0 | No OM 
1 | Erythema (redness) and soreness 
2 | Erythema and ulcers but patients can swallow solid food 
3 | Ulcers with extensive erythema and patients cannot swallow solid food
4 | Oral alimentation (solid or liquid) is not possible 

 
SOM can lead to devastating complications, including: 
  
• | Pain. A majority of patients experience severe pain, often requiring opioids to manage the pain. A publication describing 191 patients being treated for HNC noted that of the 157 patients reporting the greatest amount of mouth and throat soreness, 70% were taking opioids to alleviate their pain.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Dehydration and malnutrition. Approximately 70% of patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy become unable to eat, drink, or both, often requiring nutrition through a gastrostomy tube or intravenous line.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Treatment interruption. SOM can be dose-limiting, requiring a reduction or delay in radiotherapy, leading to poorer clinical outcomes. Approximately 11% of patients experience unplanned breaks of a week or more in radiotherapy, with each week of treatment delay decreasing tumor control by over 10%.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Increased economic burden. Approximately 16% of patients receiving radiotherapy for HNC are hospitalized due to SOM. Based on a third-party analysis of medical insurance claims covering 40 million patient years, patients with HNC and treated with radiotherapy who developed OM incurred, on average, approximately $32,000 in additional medical expenses in the first six months from the start of radiotherapy compared to such patients who did not develop OM.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Each year in the United States, approximately 65,000 patients are diagnosed with HNC, according to the American Cancer Society. In the five largest European markets, approximately 68,000 patients are diagnosed annually with HNC, and an additional 23,000 in Japan. 
 All of the patients with locally advanced HNC being treated with standard-of-care radiotherapy are at risk for developing SOM and based on observations from multiple studies, we estimate that approximately 70% will develop SOM and between 20% to 30% will develop Grade 4 OM. 
 In a survey we conducted of 150 U.S. radiation oncologists, OM was identified as the most burdensome side effect caused by radiotherapy in patients being treated for HNC. OM was also characterized as the side effect most likely to cause treatment interruptions. 
 Current Treatment Landscape and Limitations 
 There are currently no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of OM in patients with HNC. In 2020, MASCC / ISOO published an update to the leading clinical practice guidelines for the management of OM. These guidelines, which are summarized below, underscore how limited the existing approaches are for the management of OM in patients with HNC, and that these approaches have been largely palliative to date.

• | Basic oral care. The guidelines suggest the use of basic oral care protocols to prevent OM across all cancer modalities; however, the guidelines indicate the clinical evidence is weak in supporting the effectiveness of this approach.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Anti-inflammatory agents. The guidelines recommend the use of benzydamine mouthwash to prevent OM in patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy doses up to 50 gray without concomitant chemotherapy and suggest the use of benzydamine for patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy with chemotherapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Antimicrobials, coating agents, anesthetics, and analgesics. The guidelines suggest the use of 0.2% morphine mouthwash to treat pain associated with OM in patients with HNC.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Laser and other light therapy. The guidelines recommend the use of low-level laser therapy to prevent OM in patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy. However, some evidence suggests that low-level laser therapy may have long-term carcinogenic effects, so MASCC / ISOO advices the clinician to inform patients about the expected benefits and potential risks of this therapy.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Cryotherapy. The guidelines recommend the use of 30 minutes of oral cryotherapy to prevent OM in certain cancer patients, not including those receiving radiotherapy for HNC.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Natural and other miscellaneous agents. The guidelines suggest oral glutamine to prevent OM in patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy. The suggestion is with caution because of the higher mortality rate seen in patients undergoing hematopoietic stem cell transplantation who receive parenteral glutamine. The guidelines also suggest the use of honey to prevent OM in patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy, with or without chemotherapy.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 These MASCC / ISOO guidelines demonstrate that there is a high unmet need for the treatment or prevention of OM in patients with HNC, driven by the lack of clear efficacy of the existing treatment options. This unmet need is further demonstrated by the findings from our survey of 150 U.S. radiation oncologists, where only 19% and 21% of physicians, respectively, stated that topical agents are effective in preventing or reducing the incidence of SOM and in treating or reducing the duration of SOM in patients with HNC. The respondents also stated that effectiveness in preventing or reducing the incidence of SOM was the most important product attribute. The FDA has also acknowledged this unmet need and the lack of effective therapies for the reduction of the duration, incidence and severity of SOM induced by radiotherapy by granting avasopasem Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designation. 
 Our Solution: Avasopasem for Radiotherapy-Induced Severe Oral Mucositis 
 Avasopasem is a potent and highly selective small molecule dismutase mimetic we are developing for the reduction of SOM in patients with HNC. We believe avasopasem, which to date is not approved for any indication, has the potential to address shortcomings associated with current approaches and become the standard of care treatment for SOM in patients with locally advanced HNC. 
 10


Potential Benefits of Avasopasem for Severe Oral Mucositis 
 We believe that avasopasem has the potential to be the first FDA-approved drug and the standard of care for the reduction of SOM in patients with HNC receiving radiotherapy, with the following benefits: 

• | Mechanism of action designed to address the root cause of OM: Unlike existing treatment options that are largely symptomatic and reactive in nature, we believe avasopasem has the potential to address and mitigate the root cause of OM. Avasopasem is designed to rapidly convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide, reducing mucosal damage and thereby the incidence and severity of mucositis.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compelling Randomized Phase 2b clinical data: Results from our Phase 2b trial demonstrate the potential benefits of avasopasem across all evaluated parameters of SOM. Avasopasem has received Fast Track and Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Maintenance of anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy: Two-year follow-up clinical data from our Phase 2b trial for avasopasem in patients with locally advanced HNC showed similar rates of tumor control and survival between avasopasem and placebo with no observed decrease in the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. We believe this is significant as maintenance of anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy is of key importance to physicians when considering new drugs to manage side effects of radiotherapy.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Higher patient adherence: The intravenous formulation of avasopasem, administered in a clinical setting by a health care provider, promotes higher patient adherence, optimizing clinical outcomes.

Ongoing ROMAN Trial (Phase 3) 

 In February 2018, avasopasem was granted Breakthrough Therapy Designation by the FDA for the reduction of SOM induced by radiotherapy, with or without systemic therapy. As part of our correspondence with the FDA, we received the following guidance: 

• | One pivotal trial is required to support a New Drug Application, NDA, filing;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | The Phase 2b trial will be considered supportive to the Phase 3 pivotal trial;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Reduction in the incidence of SOM through the radiotherapy treatment period should be the primary endpoint of the Phase 3 registrational trial; and
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | All available tumor outcome data at the time of the NDA submission, including survival data, should be included in the NDA submission.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In October 2018, we initiated a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter, placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial of avasopasem in patients with locally advanced HNC receiving radiotherapy, which we refer to as the Reduction in Oral Mucositis with Avasopasem Manganese trial, or ROMAN trial. We plan to enroll approximately 450 patients in a 3:2 randomization favoring the avasopasem 90 mg treatment arm. Like our Phase 1b/2a and Phase 2b trials, the eligible population is patients with locally advanced, squamous cell HNC who are eligible for seven weeks of standard-of-care radiotherapy. 
 13


ROMAN Trial Design (n≈450 patients)
 

The primary endpoint of the ROMAN trial is the reduction in the incidence of SOM through the radiotherapy period for patients being treated with 90 mg of avasopasem as compared to placebo received as a 60-minute intravenous infusion less than 60 minutes before radiation, Monday to Friday, for seven weeks. All patients will be assessed twice weekly for OM by trained evaluators during the course of their radiotherapy treatment. 
 Additional endpoints include, among others, reduction in the severity of SOM and reduction in the number of days of SOM experienced by all patients, as well as the effect of treatment on tumor outcomes measured by overall survival, or OS, progression-free survival, or PFS, locoregional control, or LRC, and distant metastasis-free, or DM-free, rates. For these purposes, we define the severity of SOM as the incidence of Grade 4 OM. Adverse events will be monitored during the trial period. 
 We expect to complete enrollment in the ROMAN trial by the first half of 2021 and to report topline data from this trial in the second half of 2021. If these results are positive, we plan to submit an NDA to the FDA. 
 Ongoing Phase 2a Trial in Patients with HNC in Europe (EUSOM Trial)
 In June 2020, we initiated a Phase 2a multi-center trial of avasopasem in Europe evaluating avasopasem in combination with IMRT and concurrent cisplatin in patients with locally advanced HNC, which we refer to as the EUSOM trial. 
 The primary objective of this trial is to assess the safety of avasopasem in combination with IMRT and concurrent cisplatin. Secondary objectives include, among others, the reduction in the incidence of SOM through the radiotherapy period. 
 We have completed enrollment in the EUSOM trial and expect to report topline data from this trial in the second half of 2021. 
 14


Phase 2b Trial in Patients with HNC 
 In December 2017, we announced positive topline data from a Phase 2b trial in 223 patients with locally advanced HNC being treated with IMRT and concurrent cisplatin at multiple sites in the United States and Canada. The trial was a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial assessing the effects of avasopasem on the median duration, incidence and severity of SOM. Patients received 30 mg of avasopasem, 90 mg of avasopasem or placebo as a 60-minute infusion less than 60 minutes before radiation, Monday to Friday, for seven weeks. All patients were assessed twice weekly for OM by trained evaluators during the course of their radiotherapy treatment. If SOM was present in a patient at the end of the course of his or her radiotherapy treatment, that patient continued to be evaluated weekly for up to eight additional weeks. 
 
Phase 2b Trial Design (n=223)
 

The primary endpoints of the trial were reduction in the duration of SOM in the 90 mg and 30 mg treatment arms. Duration was defined as the number of days from when a patient was first assessed with SOM until the first day that patient was assessed with Grade 2 or less OM, with no subsequent occurrences of SOM. 
 In this trial, the 90 mg treatment arm of avasopasem demonstrated a statistically significant reduction compared to placebo on the primary endpoint (p=0.024). The median duration of SOM in this arm was 1.5 days, a 92% reduction compared to placebo. 
 Secondary endpoints included reduction in the incidence and severity of SOM in each of the 90 mg and 30 mg treatment arms. For these purposes, we define the severity of SOM as the incidence of Grade 4 OM. The incidence of SOM in the 90 mg treatment arm was reduced by 36% through 60 Gy and 34% through the full course of radiotherapy treatment compared to placebo and the severity of SOM in the 90 mg treatment arm was reduced by 47% through the full course of radiotherapy treatment compared to placebo. The gray, or Gy, is the International System of Units unit of absorbed radiation dose.  
 In the 30 mg treatment arm, intermediate reductions compared to placebo were observed in median duration of SOM (58%), incidence of SOM through 60 Gy (31%) and through the full course of radiotherapy treatment (8%), and in severity of SOM (30%) through the full course of radiotherapy treatment. 
 In the trial, we also observed an apparent delay in the onset of SOM in the 90 mg treatment arm compared to placebo, reduced usage of opioids in both the 30 mg and 90 mg treatment arms compared to placebo, and reduced placement and use of gastrostomy tubes in the 90 mg treatment arm compared to placebo. 
 15


The following chart depicts the course of SOM in each patient in the 90 mg treatment arm or the placebo arm who experienced at least one episode of SOM during the course of his or her treatment and follow-up. Each bar represents a single patient and illustrates the length of time between that patient’s first evaluated instance of SOM and his or her last evaluated instance of SOM, along with the severity of his or her SOM during that interval. 
 

This chart demonstrates that (1) fewer patients in the 90 mg treatment arm developed SOM than in the placebo arm, (2) fewer patients in the 90 mg treatment arm developed Grade 4 OM than in the placebo arm, and (3) on average, SOM did not last as long for patients in the 90 mg treatment arm. This is consistent with the observed reductions in the individual numerical endpoints of median duration, incidence and severity. 
 We followed patients from this trial for tumor outcomes out to two years following radiotherapy. In the two-year assessment of tumor outcomes, we observed similar outcomes among the three arms in OS, PFS, LRC and DM-free rates.

Phase 1b/2a Trial in Patients with HNC 
 In August 2016, we completed a Phase 1b/2a, open-label, multi-center, dose escalation trial of the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties of avasopasem in combination with radiotherapy and concurrent cisplatin in 46 patients with locally advanced HNC. The objectives of this trial were to evaluate the safety and tolerability of avasopasem and to assess the potential of avasopasem to reduce the duration, incidence and severity of SOM. 
 17


In this trial, patients were assigned to treatment duration groups based upon the dose and duration of dosing of avasopasem received and we observed that the incidence, duration, and severity of SOM through six weeks of radiotherapy (with patients receiving a cumulative radiotherapy dose of 60 Gy) decreased for patients who received six to seven weeks of avasopasem. In the group receiving six to seven weeks of avasopasem, 29% of patients experienced SOM, with a median duration of 2.5 days, and no patients experienced Grade 4 OM. Avasopasem was well tolerated and a maximum tolerated dose was not reached. 
 Patients in the trial were followed for tumor outcomes at one-year post-radiotherapy. The observed LRC, DM-free, PFS, and OS rates in 44 patients evaluable for tumor outcome at one year were 93%, 93%, 84% and 93%, respectively. We believe these outcomes are similar to the outcomes observed in historical control studies, suggesting that avasopasem does not decrease the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. 
 Radiotherapy-Induced Esophagitis 
 Radiotherapy-induced esophagitis is a common and debilitating adverse effect that develops in patients receiving radiotherapy, most commonly for lung, esophageal, breast or head and neck cancers or for lymphoma. Radiotherapy-induced esophagitis is inflammation, edema, erythema, and erosion of the mucosal surface of the esophagus caused by radiotherapy. Esophagitis can be life-threatening, and symptoms include an inability to swallow, severe pain, ulceration, infection, bleeding and weight loss and may require hospitalization. The severity of esophagitis is graded using the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events, which is a five-point grading scale: 
 
 
Grade | Description 
------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1 | Patients are asymptomatic with only clinical observations 
2 | Patients are symptomatic with altered eating or swallowing, with oral supplements indicated 
3 | Patients exhibit severely altered eating or swallowing requiring tube feeding, total parenteral nutrition or hospitalization
4 | Patient requires urgent operative intervention; condition is life-threatening 
5 | Results in death 

 
Radiotherapy-induced esophagitis potentially represents a larger market opportunity than OM. In lung cancer (our first target market for esophagitis), there are approximately 230,000 new patients annually in the United States, of which approximately 50,000 are treated with radiotherapy. The overall frequency of Grade 2 or higher esophagitis in patients receiving radiotherapy for the treatment of lung cancer is approximately 50%. The results of our survey of 150 U.S. radiation oncologists suggested that they view OM data as being representative of potential efficacy in esophagitis, which we believe supports the feasibility of exploring the use of avasopasem for the reduction of esophagitis. 
 Current Treatment Landscape and its Limitations 
 There are currently no FDA-approved drugs and no established guidelines for the treatment of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis. Treatment options are not only ineffective but also largely symptomatic in nature, with medications being administered in conjunction with a focus on adequate hydration and nutrition. These approaches, which include various analgesics such as topical lidocaine and opioids, and tube or intravenous feeding, do not treat the underlying cause of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis. 
Our Solution: Avasopasem for Radiotherapy-Induced Esophagitis 
 Unlike existing treatment options that are largely palliative in nature, we believe avasopasem has the potential to address and mitigate the root cause of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis. By removing superoxide, avasopasem is designed to reduce the damage radiotherapy ordinarily causes to the patient’s esophageal mucosa, and thereby reduce the incidence of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis. We believe avasopasem has the potential to become the standard of care for the reduction in the incidence of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis in patients with lung cancer.

Clinical Development of Avasopasem for Esophagitis 
 Below is a summary of our clinical development of avasopasem for the treatment of esophagitis. 
 
 
Trial and Status | Trial Design | Trial Objectives | Trial Milestones 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Phase 2a trial for esophagitis in patients with lung cancer receiving IMRT(AESOP trial) Ongoing | • 90 mg avasopasem given before each of typically 30 radiotherapy fractions • Approximately 60 patients | • Primary objective: assess efficacy of avasopasem in reducing the incidence of Grade 2 or higher esophagitis | • Announced first patient dosed in January 2020. • Topline data expected in 1H 2022. 

Ongoing Phase 2a Trial in Patients with Lung Cancer (AESOP Trial)
 In January 2020, we announced the initiation of a Phase 2a trial of avasopasem in combination with radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy in approximately 60 patients with lung cancer, which we refer to as the AESOP trial. 
 The primary endpoint of the trial is to assess the efficacy of avasopasem in reducing the incidence of Grade 2 or higher esophagitis in these patients. 
 We expect to report topline data from the AESOP trial in the first half of 2022.
 Increasing Anti-Cancer Efficacy of Radiotherapy 
 As cancer cells are much more sensitive than normal cells to elevated hydrogen peroxide, we believe the conversion of excess superoxide to hydrogen peroxide by our dismutase mimetics has the potential to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy. We are evaluating our dismutase mimetics to determine their ability to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of high daily doses of radiotherapy, which we have demonstrated in our preclinical studies. This increased efficacy could be particularly important in settings where the current anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy alone is insufficient to achieve the desired outcome. 
 Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer Overview 
 Pancreatic cancer is a disease in which solid tumors form in the tissues of the pancreas. It is a particularly aggressive form of cancer and represents the third-leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States with approximately 57,000 new diagnoses and 46,000 deaths estimated in 2019. In the five largest European markets and Japan, there were approximately 109,000 new pancreatic cancer diagnoses in 2018. Over 30% of newly-diagnosed patients have non-metastatic disease that is unresectable due to the location of the primary tumor or its relationship to the surrounding vasculature. The first line of treatment for patients with unresectable tumors is chemotherapy. For those patients whose tumors remain unresectable following chemotherapy, SBRT is an emerging treatment option. Even with SBRT as an option, patients with pancreatic cancer often have a poor prognosis, with a five-year survival rate of only approximately 10%. As a result, there remains a large unmet need to increase the effectiveness of disease management and ultimately improve outcomes for patients. 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Overview 
 According to the NCI, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related mortality in the United States. The NCI estimates that in 2018 there were approximately 234,000 new cases of lung cancer (both NSCLC and small cell lung cancer) in the United States and approximately 154,000 deaths. Approximately 175,000 patients are diagnosed with NSCLC each year in the United States, and are typically treated with some combination of surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and immunotherapy, depending on the severity of their disease, and SBRT is an established radiotherapy treatment for some forms of NSCLC. Even with all these current treatment options, 
 19


NSCLC is the leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States with an estimated 142,670 deaths in 2019. As such, improving the effectiveness of lung cancer treatment and improving patient outcomes represents a significant unmet need. 
 Our Solution: GC4711 for Increasing Anti-Cancer Efficacy in Patients Receiving SBRT 
 GC4711 is our second dismutase mimetic product candidate. We are specifically targeting GC4711, an analog of avasopasem, with the goal of increasing the anti-cancer efficacy of SBRT. Based on our extensive preclinical data and positive interim data from our pilot LAPC trial, we believe GC4711 has the potential to increase the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy, and that it may also protect normal tissue during SBRT. By adding GC4711 to an SBRT regimen, we believe that our dismutase mimetics’ conversion of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide may increase the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy at current doses.
 Phase 1 Trials
 In December 2017, we completed a Phase 1 single-dose trial of intravenously-administered GC4711 in Australia. In March 2020, we completed a second Phase 1 trial of the dose and schedule of GC4711 administered by 15-minute intravenous infusions to healthy volunteers in Australia. 
 In these trials, GC4711 was observed to be well tolerated. There were no Grade 3, 4, or 5 adverse events, and no adverse events led to withdrawal from these trials. We used the results of these trials to identify the dose and schedule of GC4711 to be studied in future trials and to support an Investigative New Drug Application, or IND, filing for intravenous GC4711 delivered via 15-minute infusion. 
 Preclinical Results 
 We have observed in multiple xenograft and syngeneic tumor mouse models a strong correlation between the daily dose of radiation and the increase in anti-cancer efficacy with our dismutase mimetics. Notably, we observed that many of the mice at the highest daily dose of radiotherapy with a dismutase mimetic became tumor-free. The results of one such study, in which mice bearing NSCLC xenograft tumors received 24 mg/kg of avasopasem daily for five days concurrent with one of four different radiotherapy dosage regimens, are depicted below. For example, 5 Gy x 5 RT indicates that the mice received five daily doses of five Gy each. These radiotherapy regimens were selected because, without the addition of our dismutase mimetic, each should produce an equivalent reduction in tumor growth. The data reflects that expected result, but the increase in anti-cancer efficacy with addition of the dismutase mimetic increases significantly at the higher daily doses of radiotherapy. 
 H1299 Human NSCLC Tumors in Mice 
 
 
5 Gy x 5 RT | 7 Gy x 3 RT | 10 Gy x2 RT | 18 Gy x 1 RT

 

20



In another preclinical study, mice bearing pancreatic cancer xenograft tumors treated with a single 12 Gy dose demonstrated a meaningful decrease in tumor volume when avasopasem was added, as depicted below. We believe that this result shows that our dismutase mimetics have the potential to synergize with SBRT to rapidly convert superoxide to hydrogen peroxide and exploit cancer cells’ increased sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide to promote cancer cell death. 
 

Additional preclinical studies have provided further evidence supporting our dismutase mimetics’ biological mechanism in combination with radiotherapy in solid tumors. To test the hypothesis that our dismutase mimetics’ conversion of superoxide to hydrogen peroxide increases the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy, we genetically engineered NSCLC tumors to overexpress catalase enzyme when triggered. This overexpression of catalase, a native enzyme that rapidly removes hydrogen peroxide, blocked the dismutase mimetic’s synergy with radiotherapy in an experiment similar to the ones described above. 
 

21



We believe the results of our studies represent significant potential in the treatment of cancer, particularly as recent advances in radiotherapy, such as SBRT, are capable of administering targeted, high daily doses of radiotherapy to solid tumors. SBRT utilizes several beams of various intensities aimed at different angles to precisely target the tumor, with the goal of delivering the highest possible dose of radiotherapy to kill cancer cells while minimizing exposure to normal cells. For example, SBRT is an established radiotherapy treatment for NSCLC, used increasingly for small, peripheral lung tumors. Data to date suggest that SBRT could also increase the anti-cancer efficacy and safety of radiotherapy for many other patients with NSCLC, LAPC and other cancers. SBRT application for large or centrally located NSCLC tumors, however, faces unique challenges, as lung and other toxicities limit the amount of radiotherapy patients can tolerate. As such, the most suitable patients for this procedure currently are those with smaller, well-defined tumors who are ineligible for or cannot tolerate surgery. 
 The increase in anti-cancer efficacy of SBRT with our dismutase mimetics has been shown in a variety of models of lung, pancreatic, head and neck, breast and other cancers. In addition, because low oxygen levels typically found deep in larger tumors can interfere with the anti-cancer efficacy of radiotherapy, it is important that our dismutase mimetics appear to also increase anti-cancer efficacy in hypoxic tumor models. Further, they may also reduce the normal tissue toxicities that restrict the patients now eligible for SBRT. Because of this we believe that the combination of GC4711 and SBRT has the potential to further increase the anti-cancer efficacy of and to broaden the group of patients who can benefit from SBRT. 
 The clinical research community is also exploring the possibility of increasing the anti-cancer efficacy of SBRT by combining it with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy, merging the targeted efficacy of radiotherapy with the demonstrated durability of checkpoint therapy. In preclinical models combining our dismutase mimetics with SBRT and anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1 or anti-CTLA4 checkpoint therapy, this triple combination was more effective than combinations of SBRT combined with checkpoint therapy or SBRT combined with dismutase mimetic. The triple combination increased control of the irradiated primary tumors and also appeared to reduce the metastatic spread of the cancer and even controlled pre-existing tumors outside the radiation field. Based upon these data, we believe there is an opportunity to assess the combination of SBRT, checkpoint therapy and GC4711 as a novel approach to treating various cancers.

Phase 1/2 Pilot Trial of Avasopasem in Patients with LAPC 
 The primary objective of this trial was to determine the maximum tolerated daily dose of SBRT in conjunction with our dismutase mimetic, with secondary measures assessing, among others, OS, PFS, resectability and overall response rate compared to placebo. 
 In October 2020, we announced interim data from this trial. In the analysis of the intent-to-treat population, multiple endpoints showed a positive trend in favor of improved anti-cancer efficacy with avasopasem compared to placebo. While many of the patients were early in their follow-up post treatment, addition of the dismutase mimetic to SBRT appeared to improve survival and response rate versus placebo. Toxicity was comparable across both treatment arms, with no significant differences in overall or Grade 3 GI toxicity post-SBRT. The interim data from this trial enabled us to select the dose of SBRT for our subsequent trial in this indication, the GRECO-2 trial, of five daily doses at 10 Gy/dose. The data presented included all patients followed for a minimum of three months and 19 for more than one year, with data through August 24, 2020. 
 We plan to provide final data from this trial with at least one year of follow-up on all patients in the second half of 2021.
 Ongoing Phase 1/2 Trial of GC4711 in Patients with NSCLC (GRECO-1 Trial) 
 In October 2020, we initiated a Phase 1/2 trial of GC4711 in combination with SBRT in patients with NSCLC, which we refer to as the GRECO-1 trial. We intend for this trial to assess the anti-cancer efficacy and safety of GC4711 in combination with SBRT. Subsequently, we intend to assess the anti-cancer efficacy and safety of GC4711 in combination with SBRT and a checkpoint inhibitor.
 Approximately 5 patients will be a part of the Phase 1 open-label safety run-in portion of the trial. Following the safety run-in cohort, up to 66 NSCLC patients with locally advanced disease will receive GC4711 with SBRT or placebo with SBRT over five consecutive weekdays in the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 portion of trial.
 The primary objective of the trial is to assess safety and improvements in measures of pneumonitis. Key secondary objectives, among others, include objective response rate, PFS and OS. 
 The GRECO-1 trial is supported in part by a Small Business Innovation Research grant from the NCI of the NIH for the investigation of our dismutase mimetics in combination with SBRT for the treatment of lung cancer. We expect to report initial data from the GRECO-1 trial in the first half of 2022. 
 Planned Phase 2b Trial of GC4711 in Patients with LAPC (GRECO-2 Trial)
 We plan to initiate a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter, placebo-controlled Phase 2b trial of GC4711 in combination with SBRT in patients with LAPC, which we refer to as the GRECO-2 trial. We expect to enroll approximately 160 patients in this trial. 
 24


The primary objective of this trial is to determine the impact on OS by adding GC4711 to SBRT following chemotherapy in patients with unresectable or borderline resectable nonmetastatic pancreatic cancer. Key secondary objectives, among others, will include PFS, locoregional tumor control, distant metastasis rate, surgical resection outcomes, and objective response rate.
 We expect to initiate enrollment in the GRECO-2 trial in the first half of 2021.
 Oral and Other Formulations 
 Preclinical studies conducted by us suggest that GC4711 and other novel dismutase mimetics in our portfolio can also be delivered by other routes of administration beyond intravenous. We are currently evaluating multiple formulations of GC4711 and these other novel compounds for future potential development. 
 Clinical Development of Avasopasem for COVID-19 
 Below is a summary of our clinical development of avasopasem for the treatment of COVID-19. 
  
Trial and Status | Trial Design | Trial Objectives | Trial Milestones 
Phase 2 pilot trial for COVID-19 in critically ill hospitalized adult patients Ongoing | • Randomized, double-blinded, multi-center, placebo-controlled • Two arms: 90 mg and placebo • Up to 50 patients | • Primary objective: assess 28-day mortality with 90 mg avasopasem relative to placebo | • Topline data expected in 1H 2021. 

Ongoing Phase 2 Pilot Trial in Critically Ill Patients with COVID-19
 In September 2020, we announced the initiation of a randomized, double-blinded, multicenter, placebo-controlled Phase 2 pilot trial of avasopasem in up to 50 hospitalized patients who are critically ill with COVID-19. 
 The primary endpoint of the trial is to assess the efficacy of avasopasem in improving 28-day mortality compared to placebo. Patients receive 90 mg of avasopasem or placebo as a 3-hour intravenous infusion twice daily for seven days. The trial will also collect additional data, among others, related to the requirement for intensive care, mechanical ventilation, and organ function.
 We expect to report topline data from this trial in the first half of 2021.  
 Manufacturing 
 We do not own or operate, and currently have no plans to establish, any manufacturing facilities. We currently rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third party contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, for the supply of current good manufacturing practice-grade, or cGMP-grade, clinical trial materials and commercial quantities of our product candidates and products, if approved. We require all of our CMOs to conduct manufacturing activities in compliance with cGMP requirements and we maintain our avasopasem product candidate in refrigerated conditions prior to intravenous infusion. We have assembled a team of experienced employees and consultants to provide the necessary technical, quality and regulatory oversight of our CMOs. 
 25


We anticipate that these CMOs will have the capacity to support both clinical supply and commercial-scale production, but we do not have any formal agreements at this time with any of these CMOs to cover commercial production. We believe that we have sufficient quantities of drug substance and drug product to supply our current Phase 3 and Phase 2a trials of avasopasem for the reduction of SOM and radiotherapy-induced esophagitis, respectively. We are in the process of implementing a redundant supply chain for avasopasem drug substance and drug product, with long-term agreements in place, to provide the drug substance and drug product prior to submission of an NDA. 
 We also may elect to pursue additional CMOs for manufacturing supplies of drug substance and finished drug product in the future. We believe that our standardized manufacturing process can be transferred to a number of other CMOs for the production of clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates in the ordinary course of business. 
 Commercialization 
 Our aim is to become a fully integrated biopharmaceutical company. At our current stage, we have not yet established a commercial organization or distribution capabilities. We intend to commercialize avasopasem, if successfully developed and approved, by building a specialized sales and marketing organization in the United States focused on radiation oncologists. We believe a scientifically oriented, customer-focused team of approximately 40 sales representatives would allow us to effectively reach the approximately 4,000 radiation oncologists in the United States, who treat patients using an even smaller number of radiation machines. There are approximately 2,500 radiotherapy treatment sites in the United States. Based on a third-party claims database, we estimate that over 80% of radiotherapy treatments for HNC patients are performed at approximately 700 sites. Because of the limited number of physicians concentrated around a smaller number of radiation machines, we believe we can effectively commercialize avasopasem, if approved, in the United States with a small, focused commercial organization. We also expect to leverage this sales organization to commercialize GC4711, if approved, and any of our future product candidates in the United States. Outside the United States, we may seek to establish collaborations for the commercialization of avasopasem and our other product candidates. 
Competition 
 The biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries put significant emphasis and resources into the development of novel and proprietary therapies for cancer treatment. While we believe that our knowledge, experience and scientific resources provide us with competitive advantages, we face potential competition from many different sources, including large and specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic research institutions and governmental agencies and public and private research institutions. Any product candidates that we successfully develop and commercialize will compete with existing treatment options and new therapies that may become available in the future. 
 Many of our potential competitors may have significantly greater financial resources, a more established presence in the market, and more expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical and clinical testing, obtaining regulatory approvals and reimbursement, and marketing approved products than we do. Mergers and acquisitions in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and diagnostic industries may result in even more resources being concentrated among a smaller number of our competitors. Smaller or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These potential competitors may also compete with us in recruiting and retaining top qualified scientific, sales, marketing and management personnel and establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our programs. 
 The key competitive factors affecting the success of avasopasem, GC4711 and any of our other product candidates, if approved, are likely to be their efficacy, safety, convenience, price, the level of generic competition and the availability of reimbursement from government and other third-party payors. There are currently no FDA-approved drugs for the treatment of OM in patients with HNC and no FDA-approved drugs or established guidelines for the treatment of radiotherapy-induced esophagitis. 
 A number of large pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that currently market and sell drugs or biologics are pursuing the development of therapies in the fields in which we are interested. Our commercial opportunity for any of our product candidates could be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and 
 26


commercialize products that are safer, more effective, less expensive, more convenient or easier to administer, or have fewer or less severe side effects, than any products that we may develop. Because our product candidates are designed to reduce the side effects, or to increase the anti-cancer efficacy, of radiotherapy, our commercial opportunities could also be reduced or eliminated if radiotherapy methods are improved in a way that reduces the incidence of such side effects or increases anti-cancer efficacy, or if new therapies are developed which effectively treat cancer without causing such side effects. Our competitors also may obtain FDA, EMA or other regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we may obtain approval for ours, which could result in our competitors establishing a strong market position before we are able to enter the market. 
 Intellectual Property 
 Our commercial success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain proprietary protection for avasopasem, GC4711 and any of our other product candidates, manufacturing methods and processes, novel discoveries, and other know-how; to operate without infringing on or otherwise violating the proprietary rights of others; and to prevent others from infringing or otherwise violating our proprietary rights. Our policy is to seek to protect our proprietary position by, among other methods, filing or in-licensing U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications related to our product candidates and other proprietary technologies, inventions and improvements, including claims related to composition of matter and methods of use, that are important to the development and implementation of our business. We also rely on trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our proprietary position. For more information, please see “Risk Factors—Risks Related to Intellectual Property.” 
Patents and Patent Applications 
 As of December 31, 2020, our owned and currently pending and/or in-force patent portfolio consisted of approximately 19 issued U.S. patents, 9 pending U.S. patent applications, 117 issued foreign patents including 7 issued European patents that have been validated in many European countries, and 104 pending foreign applications. 
 The term of individual patents depends upon the legal term for patents in the countries in which they are obtained. In most countries in which we file, including the United States, the patent term is 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, a patent’s term may be lengthened by patent term adjustment, which compensates a patentee for administrative delays by the USPTO, in examining and granting a patent, or may be shortened if a patent is terminally disclaimed over an earlier expiring patent. In some instances, such a patent term adjustment may result in the term of a United States patent extending beyond 20 years from the earliest filing date of a non-provisional patent application. In the United States, the term of a patent that covers a drug product may also be eligible for patent term extension when regulatory approval is granted, provided the legal requirements are met. This permits patent term restoration as compensation for the patent term lost during the FDA regulatory review process. The Hatch-Waxman Act permits a patent term extension of up to a maximum of five years beyond the expiration of the patent if the patent is eligible for such an extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act. The length of the patent term extension is related to the length of time the drug is under regulatory review; however, it cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval. Only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Similar provisions are available in Europe and certain other jurisdictions to extend the term of a patent that covers an approved drug. In the future, if and when our drug candidates receive approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities, we expect to apply for patent term extensions on issued patents covering those drugs, depending upon the length of the clinical trials for each drug and other factors. 
 The two most advanced product candidates in our portfolio, avasopasem and GC4711, are protected by issued patents with claims directed to composition of matter and method of use. Avasopasem is covered by a composition of matter patent in the United States that has a natural expiration date in 2022. However, we believe the avasopasem composition of matter patent may be eligible for a patent term extension under the Hatch-Waxman Act of no more than four and a half years which, if granted, could result in an expiration date in 2027. GC4711 is covered by a composition of matter patent in the United States, which also covers oral bioavailability of the product candidate, and has a natural expiration date in 2036. However, we believe the GC4711 composition of matter patent may be eligible for a patent term extension of at least about two years which, if granted, could result in an expiration date in 2038. The U.S. patent family covering the method of treating OM has a natural expiration date in late 2027, and if we are successful in obtaining a patent term extension of approximately two and a half years which we believe should be available, could result in an expiration date in early 2030. The U.S. patent family covering treating tissue damage resulting from radiation therapy, chemotherapy or a combination thereof by administering high doses 
 27


of avasopasem, including that being tested in the ROMAN Phase 3 trial, has a natural expiration date in 2032, and if we are successful in obtaining a patent term extension which we believe should be available, could result in an expiration date in 2034. When including only current issued patents and related patent term extensions, our product candidate patent portfolio is projected to expire between 2027 and 2038 in the United States. Additional pending or future patent applications may supplement or extend this patent portfolio.
 However, there can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications will issue or that we will benefit from any patent term extension or favorable adjustment to the term of any of our patents. The applicable authorities, including the FDA in the United States, may not agree with our assessment of whether such patent term extensions should be granted, and if granted, they may grant more limited extensions than we request. 
 We also have pending patent families in the United States that cover certain combinations of our product candidates with several oncology products and therapies that may provide protection for the use of our product candidates in connection with those oncology products and therapies, which, if granted, are projected to expire between 2037 and 2039. 
 Trademarks and Trade Secrets 
 As of December 31, 2020, our owned and currently pending and/or in-force trademark portfolio consisted of 2 registered U.S. trademarks, 6 pending U.S. trademark applications, 14 registered foreign trademarks, and 10 pending foreign trademark applications. 
 Furthermore, we rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovation and potential in-licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect our proprietary information, in part, using confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants. These agreements are designed to protect our proprietary information and, in the case of the invention assignment agreements, to grant us ownership of technologies that are developed through a relationship with an employee or a third party. These agreements may be breached, and we may not have adequate remedies for any such breach. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors. To the extent that our commercial partners, collaborators, employees, and consultants use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us, disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know-how and inventions. 
 Royalty Agreement with Blackstone Life Sciences (Formerly Known as Clarus Ventures)
 In November 2018, we entered into the Royalty Agreement with Blackstone Life Sciences, or Blackstone. Pursuant to the Royalty Agreement, Blackstone agreed to pay us, in the aggregate, up to $80.0 million, or the Royalty Purchase Price, in four tranches of $20.0 million each upon the achievement of specified clinical milestones in our ROMAN trial. We agreed to apply the proceeds from such payments primarily to support clinical development and regulatory activities for avasopasem, GC4711 and any pharmaceutical product comprising or containing avasopasem or GC4711, or, collectively, the Products, as well as to satisfy working capital obligations and for general corporate expenses. We received the first tranche of the Royalty Purchase Price in November 2018, the second tranche of the Royalty Purchase Price in April 2019, and the third tranche of the Royalty Purchase Price in February 2020, in each case in connection with the achievement of the first three milestones, respectively, under the Royalty Agreement. 
 In May 2020, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to the Royalty Agreement, or the Amendment, with Clarus IV Galera Royalty AIV, L.P., or the Blackstone Purchaser. The Blackstone Purchaser is affiliated with Blackstone Life Sciences, successor in interest to Clarus Ventures. The Amendment increased the Royalty Purchase Price by $37.5 million to $117.5 million by increasing the fourth tranche from $20.0 million to $37.5 million and adding a new $20.0 million tranche upon the achievement of an additional clinical enrollment milestone.  
 Pursuant to the amended Royalty Agreement, in connection with the payment of each tranche of the Royalty Purchase Price, we have agreed to sell, convey, transfer and assign to Blackstone all of our right, title and interest in a high single-digit percentage of (i) worldwide net sales of the Products and (ii) all amounts received by us or our affiliates, licensees and sublicensees with respect to Product-related damages (collectively, the Product Payments) during the Royalty Period. The Royalty Period means, on a Product-by-Product and country-by-country basis, the period of time commencing on the commercial launch of such Product in such country and ending on the 
 28


latest to occur of (i) the 12th anniversary of such commercial launch, (ii) the expiration of all valid claims of our patents covering such Product in such country, and (iii) the expiration of regulatory data protection or market exclusivity or similar regulatory protection afforded by the health authorities in such country, to the extent such protection or exclusivity effectively prevents generic versions of such Product from entering the market in such country. 
 If Blackstone fails to fund the full amount of any remaining tranche of the Royalty Purchase Price within two business days of the conditions to the payment of such tranche having been satisfied, we may terminate our obligation to accept such tranche and any additional remaining tranches. In such event, Blackstone’s aggregate right, title and interest in the Product Payments shall be reduced to a low single-digit percentage. 
 Under the amended Royalty Agreement, if we commercialize our product candidates, we must establish a trained sales force sufficiently in advance of the anticipated commercial launch of our products. Along with other conditions, we may not grant any exclusive right or license under our patents and know-how related to our product candidates to any third party without the prior written consent of Blackstone. In addition, we may not enter into any out-license that would expressly allow a third party to use our intellectual property to develop or commercialize a product that is competitive with the Products. 
 The amended Royalty Agreement will remain in effect until the date on which the aggregate amount of the Product Payments paid to Blackstone exceeds a fixed single-digit multiple of the actual amount of the Royalty Purchase Price received by us, unless earlier terminated pursuant to the mutual written agreement of us and Blackstone.
 In May 2020, as partial consideration for the Amendment, we issued two warrants to the Blackstone Purchaser to purchase an aggregate of 550,661 shares of our common stock at an exercise price equal to $13.62 per share, each of which will become exercisable upon the receipt by Galera of the applicable specified milestone payment. The issued warrants expire six years after the initial exercise date of each respective warrant.
 Government Regulation 
 The FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in state and local jurisdictions and in other countries impose substantial and burdensome requirements upon companies involved in the clinical development, manufacture, marketing and distribution of drugs, such as those we are developing. These agencies and other federal, state and local entities regulate, among other things, the research and development, testing, manufacture, quality control, safety, effectiveness, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising and promotion, distribution, post-approval monitoring and reporting, sampling and export and import of our product candidates. 
U.S. Government Regulation 
 In the United States, the FDA regulates drugs under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and its implementing regulations. The process of obtaining regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with appropriate federal, state, local and foreign statutes and regulations requires the expenditure of substantial time and financial resources. Failure to comply with the applicable U.S. requirements at any time during the product development process, approval process or after approval, may subject an applicant to a variety of administrative or judicial sanctions, such as the FDA’s refusal to approve pending NDAs, withdrawal of an approval, imposition of a clinical hold, issuance of warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, total or partial suspension of production or distribution, injunctions, fines, refusals of government contracts, restitution, disgorgement or civil or criminal penalties. 
 The process required by the FDA before a drug may be marketed in the United States generally involves the following: 
  
• | completion of preclinical laboratory tests, animal studies and formulation studies in compliance with the FDA’s good laboratory practice, or GLP, regulations;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an Investigational New Drug application, or IND, which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 29


 
• | approval by an independent IRB, at each clinical site before each trial may be initiated;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | performance of adequate and well-controlled human clinical trials in accordance with good clinical practice, or GCP, requirements to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product for each indication;
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | submission to the FDA of an NDA;
--+---------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA advisory committee review, if applicable;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | satisfactory completion of an FDA inspection of the manufacturing facility or facilities at which the product is produced to assess compliance with current good manufacturing practice, or cGMP, requirements and to assure that the facilities, methods and controls are adequate to preserve the drug’s identity, strength, quality and purity;
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | FDA review and approval of the NDA, including consideration of the views of any FDA advisory committee, prior to commercial marketing or sale of the drug in the United States; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Compliance with any post-approval requirements, including the potential requirement to implement a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, or to conduct a post-approval study.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Preclinical Studies 
 Preclinical studies include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry, toxicity and formulation, as well as animal studies to assess potential safety and efficacy. An IND sponsor must submit the results of the preclinical studies, together with manufacturing information, analytical data and any available clinical data or literature, among other things, to the FDA as part of an IND. Some preclinical studies may continue even after the IND is submitted. An IND automatically becomes effective 30 days after receipt by the FDA, unless before that time the FDA raises concerns or questions related to one or more proposed clinical trials and places the clinical trial on a clinical hold. In such a case, the IND sponsor and the FDA must resolve any outstanding concerns before the clinical trial can begin. As a result, submission of an IND may not result in the FDA allowing clinical trials to commence. 
Clinical Trials 
 Clinical trials involve the administration of the investigational new drug to human subjects under the supervision of qualified investigators in accordance with GCP requirements, which include the requirement that all research subjects provide their informed consent in writing for their participation in any clinical trial. Clinical trials are conducted under protocols detailing, among other things, the objectives of the trial, the parameters to be used in monitoring safety, and the effectiveness criteria to be evaluated. A protocol for each clinical trial and any subsequent protocol amendments must be submitted to the FDA as part of the IND. In addition, an IRB at each institution participating in the clinical trial must review and approve the plan for any clinical trial before it commences at that institution. Information about certain clinical trials must be submitted within specific timeframes to the National Institutes of Health, or NIH, for public dissemination on their www.clinicaltrials.gov website. 
 Human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases, which may overlap or be combined: 
  
• | Phase 1: The drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects or patients with the target disease or condition and tested for safety, dosage tolerance, absorption, metabolism, distribution, excretion and, if possible, to gain an early indication of its effectiveness.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Phase 2: The drug is administered to a limited patient population to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks, to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 30


 
• | Phase 3: The drug is administered to an expanded patient population, generally at geographically dispersed clinical trial sites, in well-controlled clinical trials to generate enough data to statistically evaluate the efficacy and safety of the product for approval, to establish the overall risk-benefit profile of the product, and to provide adequate information for the labeling of the product.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Progress reports detailing the results of the clinical trials must be submitted at least annually to the FDA and more frequently if serious adverse events occur. Phase 1, Phase 2 and Phase 3 clinical trials may not be completed successfully within any specified period, or at all. Furthermore, the FDA or the sponsor may suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time on various grounds, including a finding that the research subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk. Similarly, an IRB can suspend or terminate approval of a clinical trial at its institution if the clinical trial is not being conducted in accordance with the IRB’s requirements or if the drug has been associated with unexpected serious harm to patients. 
 Marketing Approval 
 Assuming successful completion of the required clinical testing, the results of the preclinical studies and clinical trials, together with detailed information relating to the product’s chemistry, manufacture, controls and proposed labeling, among other things, are submitted to the FDA as part of an NDA requesting approval to market the product for one or more indications. In most cases, the submission of an NDA is subject to a substantial application user fee. Under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act, or PDUFA, guidelines that are currently in effect, the FDA has a goal of ten months from the date of “filing” of a standard NDA for a new molecular entity to review and act on the submission. This review typically takes twelve months from the date the NDA is submitted to FDA because the FDA has approximately two months to make a “filing” decision. 
 In addition, under the Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2003, as amended and reauthorized, certain NDAs or supplements to an NDA must contain data that are adequate to assess the safety and effectiveness of the drug for the claimed indications in all relevant pediatric subpopulations, and to support dosing and administration for each pediatric subpopulation for which the product is safe and effective. The FDA may, on its own initiative or at the request of the applicant, grant deferrals for submission of some or all pediatric data until after approval of the product for use in adults, or full or partial waivers from the pediatric data requirements. 
 The FDA also may require submission of a REMS plan to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh its risks. The REMS plan could include medication guides, physician communication plans, assessment plans, and/or elements to assure safe use, such as restricted distribution methods, patient registries, or other risk minimization tools. 
 The FDA conducts a preliminary review of all NDAs within the first 60 days after submission, before accepting them for filing, to determine whether they are sufficiently complete to permit substantive review. The FDA may request additional information rather than accept an NDA for filing. In this event, the application must be resubmitted with the additional information. The resubmitted application is also subject to review before the FDA accepts it for filing. Once the submission is accepted for filing, the FDA begins an in-depth substantive review. The FDA reviews an NDA to determine, among other things, whether the drug is safe and effective and whether the facility in which it is manufactured, processed, packaged or held meets standards designed to assure the product’s continued safety, quality and purity. 
 The FDA may refer an application for a novel drug to an advisory committee. An advisory committee is a panel of independent experts, including clinicians and other scientific experts, that reviews, evaluates and provides a recommendation as to whether the application should be approved and under what conditions. The FDA is not bound by the recommendations of an advisory committee, but it considers such recommendations carefully when making decisions. 
 Before approving an NDA, the FDA typically will inspect the facility or facilities where the product is manufactured. The FDA will not approve an application unless it determines that the manufacturing processes and facilities are in compliance with cGMP requirements and adequate to assure consistent production of the product within required specifications. Additionally, before approving an NDA, the FDA may inspect one or more clinical trial sites to assure compliance with GCP requirements. 
 31


After evaluating the NDA and all related information, including the advisory committee recommendation, if any, and inspection reports regarding the manufacturing facilities and clinical trial sites, the FDA may issue an approval letter, or, in some cases, a complete response letter. A complete response letter generally contains a statement of specific conditions that must be met in order to secure final approval of the NDA and may require additional clinical trials or preclinical studies in order for FDA to reconsider the application. Even with submission of this additional information, the FDA ultimately may decide that the application does not satisfy the regulatory criteria for approval. If and when those conditions have been met to the FDA’s satisfaction, the FDA will typically issue an approval letter. An approval letter authorizes commercial marketing of the drug with specific prescribing information for specific indications. 
 Even if the FDA approves a product, it may limit the approved indications for use of the product, require that contraindications, warnings or precautions be included in the product labeling, require that post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, be conducted to further assess a drug’s safety after approval, require testing and surveillance programs to monitor the product after commercialization, or impose other conditions, including distribution and use restrictions or other risk management mechanisms under a REMS, which can materially affect the potential market and profitability of the product. The FDA may prevent or limit further marketing of a product based on the results of post-marketing studies or surveillance programs. After approval, some types of changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications, manufacturing changes, and additional labeling claims, are subject to further testing requirements and FDA review and approval. 
 FDA Expedited Programs 
 The FDA has various programs, including fast track designation, accelerated approval, priority review, and breakthrough therapy designation, which are intended to expedite or simplify the process for the development and FDA review of drugs that are intended for the treatment of serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions and demonstrate the potential to address unmet medical needs. The purpose of these programs is to provide important new drugs to patients earlier than under standard FDA review procedures. 
 To be eligible for a fast track designation, the FDA must determine, based on the request of a sponsor, that a product is intended to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition and demonstrates the potential to address an unmet medical need. The FDA will determine that a product will fill an unmet medical need if it will provide a therapy where none exists or provide a therapy that may be potentially superior to existing therapy based on efficacy or safety factors. The FDA may review sections of the NDA for a fast track product on a rolling basis before the complete application is submitted, if the sponsor provides a schedule for the submission of the sections of the NDA, the FDA agrees to accept sections of the NDA and determines that the schedule is acceptable, and the sponsor pays any required user fees upon submission of the first section of the NDA. 
 The FDA may give a priority review designation to drugs that offer major advances in treatment or provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists. A priority review means that the goal for the FDA to review an application is six months, rather than the standard review of ten months under current PDUFA guidelines. Under the new PDUFA agreement, these six and ten month review periods are measured from the “filing” date rather than the receipt date for NDAs for new molecular entities, which typically adds approximately two months to the timeline for review and decision from the date of submission. Most products that are eligible for fast track designation are also likely to be considered appropriate to receive a priority review. 
 In addition, products studied for their safety and effectiveness in treating serious or life-threatening illnesses and that provide meaningful therapeutic benefit over existing treatments may be eligible for accelerated approval and may be approved on the basis of adequate and well-controlled clinical trials establishing that the drug product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into account the severity, rarity or prevalence of the condition and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. As a condition of approval, the FDA may require a sponsor of a drug receiving accelerated approval to perform post-marketing studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical endpoint, and the drug may be subject to accelerated withdrawal procedures. 
 32


Moreover, under the provisions of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act, passed in July 2012, a sponsor can request designation of a product candidate as a “breakthrough therapy.” A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early in clinical development. Drugs designated as breakthrough therapies are also eligible for accelerated approval. The FDA must take certain actions, such as holding timely meetings and providing advice, intended to expedite the development and review of an application for approval of a breakthrough therapy. 
 Even if a product qualifies for one or more of these programs, the FDA may later decide that the product no longer meets the conditions for qualification or decide that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened. We may explore some of these opportunities for our product candidates as appropriate. 
 Post-Approval Requirements 
 Drugs manufactured or distributed pursuant to FDA approvals are subject to pervasive and continuing regulation by the FDA, including, among other things, requirements relating to recordkeeping, periodic reporting, product sampling and distribution, advertising and promotion and reporting of adverse experiences with the product. After approval, most changes to the approved product, such as adding new indications or other labeling claims are subject to prior FDA review and approval. There also are continuing, annual user fee requirements for any marketed products and the establishments at which such products are manufactured, as well as new application fees for supplemental applications with clinical data. 
 The FDA may impose a number of post-approval requirements as a condition of approval of an NDA. For example, the FDA may require post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to further assess and monitor the product’s safety and effectiveness after commercialization. 
 In addition, drug manufacturers and other entities involved in the manufacture and distribution of approved drugs are required to register their establishments with the FDA and state agencies, and are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and these state agencies for compliance with cGMP requirements. Changes to the manufacturing process are strictly regulated and often require prior FDA approval before being implemented. FDA regulations also require investigation and correction of any deviations from cGMP requirements and impose reporting and documentation requirements upon the sponsor and any third-party manufacturers that the sponsor may decide to use. Accordingly, manufacturers must continue to expend time, money, and effort in the area of production and quality control to maintain cGMP compliance. 
 Once an approval is granted, the FDA may withdraw the approval if compliance with regulatory requirements and standards is not maintained or if problems occur after the product reaches the market. Later discovery of previously unknown problems with a product, including adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or with manufacturing processes, or failure to comply with regulatory requirements, may result in mandatory revisions to the approved labeling to add new safety information; imposition of post-market studies or clinical trials to assess new safety risks; or imposition of distribution or other restrictions under a REMS program. Other potential consequences include, among other things: 
  
• | restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, complete withdrawal of the product from the market or product recalls;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warning or other safety information about the product;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | fines, warning letters or holds on post-approval clinical trials;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------


• | refusal of the FDA to approve pending NDAs or supplements to approved NDAs, or suspension or revocation of product approvals;
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | product seizure or detention, or refusal to permit the import or export of products; or
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

• | injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------

 The FDA strictly regulates marketing, labeling, advertising and promotion of products that are placed on the market. Drugs may be promoted only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved label. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant liability. 
 In addition, the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, or PDMA, which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states. Both the PDMA and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution. 
 Other Healthcare Laws 
 Pharmaceutical companies are subject to additional healthcare regulation and enforcement by the federal government and by authorities in the states and foreign jurisdictions in which they conduct their business. Such laws include, without limitation, U.S. federal and state anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, false claims, consumer fraud, pricing reporting, and transparency laws and regulations with respect to drug pricing and payments and other transfers of value made to physicians and other healthcare professionals, as well as similar foreign laws in the jurisdictions outside the U.S. Violations of such laws, or any other governmental regulations that apply, may result in penalties, including, without limitation, civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, additional reporting and oversight obligations, the curtailment or restructuring of operations, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs and individual imprisonment. 
Coverage and Reimbursement 
 Sales of any pharmaceutical product depend, in part, on the extent to which such product will be covered by third-party payors, such as federal, state and foreign government healthcare programs, commercial insurance and managed healthcare organizations, and the level of reimbursement for such product by third-party payors. Significant uncertainty exists as to the coverage and reimbursement status of any newly approved product. Decisions regarding the extent of coverage and amount of reimbursement to be provided are made on a plan-by-plan basis. With respect to off-label uses, third-party payors may provide coverage and reimbursement under certain circumstances. By way of example, Medicare covers off-label uses of FDA-approved drugs if the use is supported as a medically accepted indication by certain compendia and is not otherwise listed as unsupported, not indicated, not recommended, or equivalent terms, in any such compendia. For products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. 
 In addition, third-party payors are increasingly reducing reimbursements for pharmaceutical products and services. Moreover, for drugs and biologics administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such products. The U.S. government and state legislatures have continued implementing cost-containment programs, including price controls, restrictions on coverage and reimbursement and requirements for substitution of generic products. Adoption of price controls and cost-containment measures, and adoption of more restrictive policies in jurisdictions with existing controls and measures, could further limit sales of any product. Decreases in third-party reimbursement for any product or a decision by a third-party payor not to cover a product could reduce physician usage and patient demand for the product. 
 In international markets, reimbursement and healthcare payment systems vary significantly by country, and many countries have instituted price ceilings on specific products and therapies. For example, the European Union provides options for its member states to restrict the range of medicinal products for which their national health insurance systems provide reimbursement and to control the prices of medicinal products for human use. A member state may approve a specific price for the medicinal product, or it may instead adopt a system of direct or 
 34


indirect controls on the profitability of the company placing the medicinal product on the market. Products may face competition from lower-priced products in foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products and may also compete with imported foreign products. Furthermore, there is no assurance that a product will be considered medically reasonable and necessary for a specific indication, be considered cost-effective by third-party payors, that an adequate level of reimbursement will be established even if coverage is available or that the third-party payors’ reimbursement policies will not adversely affect the ability for manufacturers to sell products profitably. 
 Healthcare Reform 
 In the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and we expect there will continue to be, a number of legislative and regulatory changes to the healthcare system that could affect the pharmaceutical industry. In March 2010, the Affordable Care Act was signed into law, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers in the United States. The Affordable Care Act contained a number of provisions, including those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs and reimbursement adjustments. Additionally, the Affordable Care Act increased the minimum level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% of the average manufacturer price; required collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations; required manufacturers to participate in a coverage gap discount program, under which they must agree to offer 70 percent point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer’s outpatient drugs to be covered under Medicare Part D; imposed a non-deductible annual fee on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers who sell “branded prescription drugs” to specified federal government programs, implemented a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted, or injected; expanded of eligibility criteria for Medicaid programs, created a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee, identify priorities in, and conduct comparative clinical effectiveness research, along with funding for such research; and established of a Center for Medicare Innovation at CMS to test innovative payment and service delivery models to lower Medicare and Medicaid spending, potentially including prescription drug spending. 
 Since its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act.  The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act in its entirety, although it is unclear how the Supreme Court will rule.  In addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted, including aggregate reductions of Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which was temporarily suspended from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021, and further reduced payments to several types of Medicare providers. Moreover, there has recently been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted legislation designed, among other things, to bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drug products. Individual states in the United States have also become increasingly active in implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures and, in some cases, mechanisms to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. 
 Foreign Regulation 
 In addition to regulations in the United States, we will be subject to a variety of regulations in other jurisdictions governing, among other things, clinical studies and commercial sales and distribution of our product candidates. Whether or not we obtain FDA approval for a product, we must obtain the requisite approvals from the comparable regulatory authorities in foreign countries prior to the commencement of clinical studies or marketing of the product candidates in those countries. The requirements and process governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country.  Failure to comply with applicable foreign regulatory requirements, may be subject to, among other things, fines, suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approvals, product recalls, seizure of products, operating restrictions and criminal prosecution.

Clinical Trials
 Certain countries outside of the United States have a similar process that requires the submission of a clinical study application much like the IND prior to the commencement of human clinical studies. In the European Union, or EU, for example, a clinical trial authorization, or CTA, must be submitted to each country’s national health authority and an independent ethics committee, much like the FDA and the IRB, respectively. Once the CTA is approved by the national health authority and the ethics committee has granted a positive opinion in relation to the conduct of the trial in the relevant member state(s), in accordance with a country’s requirements, clinical study development may proceed.
 Clinical trials of medicinal products in the European Union must be conducted in accordance with EU and national regulations and the International Conference on Harmonization, or ICH, guidelines on Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, as well as the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki. If the sponsor of the clinical trial is not established within the EU, it must appoint an EU entity to act as its legal representative. The sponsor must take out a clinical trial insurance policy, and in most EU countries, the sponsor is liable to provide ‘no fault’ compensation to any study subject injured in the clinical trial.
 Prior to commencing a clinical trial, the sponsor must obtain a CTA from the competent authority, and a positive opinion from an independent ethics committee. The CTA must include, among other things, a copy of the trial protocol and an investigational medicinal product dossier containing information about the manufacture and quality of the medicinal product under investigation. Currently, CTAs must be submitted to the competent authority in each EU member state in which the trial will be conducted. Under the new Regulation on Clinical Trials, which is currently expected to take effect by early 2022, there will be a centralized application procedure where one national authority takes the lead in reviewing the application and the other national authorities have only limited involvement. Any substantial changes to the trial protocol or other information submitted with the CTA must be notified to or approved by the relevant competent authorities and ethics committees.  Medicines used in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with GMP. Other national and European Union-wide regulatory requirements may also apply.
 Marketing Authorizations
 In the European Union, medicinal products can only be placed on the market after obtaining a Marketing Authorization, or MA. To obtain regulatory approval of an investigational medicinal product under European Union regulatory systems, we must submit a marketing authorization application, or MAA. The application used to file the NDA in the United States is similar to that required in the European Union, with the exception of, among other things, country‑specific document requirements. The process for doing this depends, among other things, on the nature of the medicinal product.
 Essentially, there are two types of MAs. The centralized procedure results in a single MA, issued by the European Commission, based on the opinion of the EMA’s CHMP, or Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, which is valid across the entire territory of the European Union. The centralized procedure is compulsory for human medicines that are: (i) derived from biotechnology processes, such as genetic engineering, (ii) contain a new active substance indicated for the treatment of certain diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative diseases, autoimmune and other immune dysfunctions and viral diseases, (iii) designated orphan medicines and (iv) advanced therapy medicinal products, or ATMPs, such as gene therapy, somatic cell therapy or tissue-engineered medicines. The centralized procedure may at the request of the applicant also be used in certain other cases. 
 National MAs, which are issued by the competent authorities of the EU member states and only cover their respective territory, are available for products not falling within the mandatory scope of the centralized procedure. Where a product has already been authorized for marketing in an EU member state, this national MA can be recognized in another member state through the mutual recognition procedure. If the product has not received a national MA in any member state at the time of application, it can be approved simultaneously in various member states through the decentralized procedure. Under the decentralized procedure an identical dossier is submitted to the national competent authority of each of the member states in which the MA is sought, one of which is selected by the applicant as the reference member state.
 36


Under the centralized procedure, the maximum timeframe for the evaluation of a MAA by the EMA is 210 days. In exceptional cases, the CHMP might perform an accelerated review of a MAA in no more than 150 days (not including clock stops). Innovative products that target an unmet medical need and are expected to be of major public health interest may be eligible for a number of expedited development and review programs, such as the PRIME scheme, which provides incentives similar to the breakthrough therapy designation in the U.S. PRIME is a voluntary scheme aimed at enhancing the EMA’s support for the development of medicines that target unmet medical needs. It is based on increased interaction and early dialogue with companies developing promising medicines, to optimize their product development plans and speed up their evaluation to help them reach patients earlier. Product developers that benefit from PRIME designation can expect to be eligible for accelerated assessment but this is not guaranteed. The benefits of a PRIME designation include the appointment of a CHMP rapporteur before submission of a MAA, early dialogue and scientific advice at key development milestones, and the potential to qualify products for accelerated review earlier in the application process.
 MAs have an initial duration of five years. After these five years, the authorization may be renewed for an unlimited period on the basis of a reevaluation of the risk-benefit balance. 
 Data and Marketing Exclusivity
 The European Union also provides opportunities for market exclusivity. Upon receiving marketing authorization, new chemical entities generally receive eight years of data exclusivity and an additional two years of market exclusivity. If granted, data exclusivity prevents regulatory authorities in the EU from referencing the innovator’s data to assess a generic or biosimilar application. During the additional two‑year period of market exclusivity, a generic/biosimilar MA can be submitted, and the innovator’s data may be referenced, but no generic/biosimilar product can be marketed until the expiration of the market exclusivity. The overall ten-year market exclusivity period may be extended to a maximum of eleven years if, during the first eight years, a new therapeutic indication with significant clinical benefit over existing therapies is approved. However, there is no guarantee that a product will be considered by the EU or member state regulatory authorities to be a new chemical entity, and products may not qualify for data exclusivity. 
 Post-Approval Requirements
 Similar to the United States, both MA holders and manufacturers of medicinal products are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight by the EMA, the European Commission and/or the competent regulatory authorities of the member states. The holder of a MA must establish and maintain a pharmacovigilance system and appoint an individual qualified person for pharmacovigilance who is responsible for oversight of that system. Key obligations include expedited reporting of suspected serious adverse reactions and submission of periodic safety update reports, or PSURs.
 All new MAAs must include a risk management plan, or RMP, describing the risk management system that the company will put in place and documenting measures to prevent or minimize the risks associated with the product. The regulatory authorities may also impose specific obligations as a condition of the MA. Such risk-minimization measures or post-authorization obligations may include additional safety monitoring, more frequent submission of PSURs, or the conduct of additional clinical trials or post-authorization safety studies.  
 The advertising and promotion of medicinal products is also subject to laws concerning promotion of medicinal products, interactions with physicians, misleading and comparative advertising and unfair commercial practices. All advertising and promotional activities for the product must be consistent with the approved summary of product characteristics, and therefore all off-label promotion is prohibited. Direct-to-consumer advertising of prescription medicines is also prohibited in the EU. Although general requirements for advertising and promotion of medicinal products are established under EU directives, the details are governed by regulations in each member state and can differ from one country to another. 
 37


Failure to comply with EU and member state laws that apply to the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing approval, marketing authorization of medicinal products and marketing of such products, both before and after grant of the MA, manufacturing of pharmaceutical products, statutory health insurance, bribery and anti-corruption or with other applicable regulatory requirements may result in administrative, civil or criminal penalties. These penalties could include delays or refusal to authorize the conduct of clinical trials, or to grant MA, product withdrawals and recalls, product seizures, suspension, withdrawal or variation of the MA, total or partial suspension of production, distribution, manufacturing or clinical trials, operating restrictions, injunctions, suspension of licenses, fines and criminal penalties.
 The aforementioned EU rules are generally applicable in the European Economic Area, or EEA, which consists of the 27 EU member states plus Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland. 
 For other countries outside of the European Union, such as countries in Latin America or Asia, the requirements governing the conduct of clinical studies, product licensing, pricing and reimbursement vary from country to country. In all cases, again, the clinical studies are conducted in accordance with GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements and the ethical principles that have their origin in the Declaration of Helsinki.
 Data Privacy and Security Laws
 Numerous state, federal and foreign laws, including consumer protection laws and regulations, govern the collection, dissemination, use, access to, confidentiality and security of personal information, including health-related information. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including data breach notification laws, health information privacy and security laws, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, and federal and state consumer protection laws and regulations (e.g., Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act), that govern the collection, use, disclosure, and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our partners. In addition, certain state and non-U.S. laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, the California Privacy Rights Act, or CPRA and the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, govern the privacy and security of personal information, including health-related information in certain circumstances, some of which are more stringent than HIPAA and many of which differ from each other in significant ways and may not have the same effect, thus complicating compliance efforts. Failure to comply with these laws, where applicable, can result in the imposition of significant civil and/or criminal penalties and private litigation.  Privacy and security laws, regulations, and other obligations are constantly evolving, may conflict with each other to complicate compliance efforts, and can result in investigations, proceedings, or actions that lead to significant civil and/or criminal penalties and restrictions on data processing.
