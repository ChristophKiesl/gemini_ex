Geographic Operations
 
We maintain administrative and operational organizations in North America, Europe, South America and Asia Pacific to support our operating segments, assist with the management of affiliate relations and facilitate financial and statutory reporting and tax compliance on a worldwide basis. Our operations are located in the following countries:

North America | Europe | South America | Asia Pacific
--------------+-----------+----------------+-------------
Canada | Belgium | Netherlands | Argentina | Australia 
Mexico | Denmark | Norway | Brazil | China 
United States | Finland | Russia | Colombia | India 
 | France | South Africa | Ecuador | Japan 
 | Germany | Spain | | New Zealand
 | Hungary | Sweden | | Singapore 
 | Ireland | Switzerland | | South Korea
 | Italy | Turkey | | Thailand 
 | Lithuania | United Kingdom | | 

 
Our non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates manufacture and sell products similar to those we produce in the United States. Operations outside the U.S. may be subject to a greater risk of changing political, economic and social environments, changing governmental laws and regulations, currency revaluations and market fluctuations than our domestic operations. See the discussion of risk factors in Item 1A.
 
Sales reported by our non-U.S. subsidiaries comprised $3,702, or 52%, of our 2020 consolidated sales of $7,106. A summary of sales and long-lived assets by geographic region can be found in Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8.
 
Customer Dependence
 
We are largely dependent on light vehicle, medium- and heavy-duty vehicle and off-highway original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customers. Ford Motor Company (Ford) and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA) were the only individual customers accounting for 10% or more of our consolidated sales in 2020. As a percentage of total sales from operations, our sales to Ford were approximately 20% in 2020, 20% in 2019 and 20% in 2018, and our sales to FCA (via a directed supply relationship), our second largest customer, were approximately 12% in 2020, 11% in 2019 and 11% in 2018. PACCAR Inc, Deere & Company and Volkswagen AG (including Traton Group) were our third, fourth and fifth largest customers in 2020. Our 10 largest customers collectively accounted for approximately 54% of our sales in 2020.
 
Loss of all or a substantial portion of our sales to Ford, FCA or other large volume customers would have a significant adverse effect on our financial results until such lost sales volume could be replaced and there is no assurance that any such lost volume would be replaced.
 
Sources and Availability of Raw Materials
 
We use a variety of raw materials in the production of our products, including steel and products containing steel, stainless steel, forgings, castings, bearings, and batteries and related rare earth materials. Other commodity purchases include aluminum, brass, copper and plastics. These materials are typically available from multiple qualified sources in quantities sufficient for our needs. However, some of our operations remain dependent on single sources for certain raw materials.
 
While our suppliers have generally been able to support our needs, our operations may experience shortages and delays in the supply of raw material from time to time due to strong demand, capacity limitations, short lead times, production schedule increases from our customers and other problems experienced by the suppliers. A significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of our suppliers could adversely impact our ability to meet our production schedules and to deliver our products to our customers in a timely manner.
 
Seasonality
 
Our businesses are generally not seasonal. However, in the light vehicle market, our sales are closely related to the production schedules of our OEM customers and those schedules have historically been weakest in the third quarter of the year due to a large number of model year change-overs that occur during this period. Additionally, third-quarter production schedules in Europe are typically impacted by the summer vacation schedules and fourth-quarter production is affected globally by year-end holidays.

Backlog
 
A substantial amount of the new business we are awarded by OEMs is granted well in advance of a program launch. These awards typically extend through the life of the given program. This backlog of new business does not represent firm orders. We estimate future sales from new business using the projected volume under these programs.
Competition
 
Within each of our markets, we compete with a variety of independent suppliers and distributors, as well as with the in-house operations of certain OEMs. With a focus on product innovation, we differentiate ourselves through efficiency and performance, reliability, materials and processes, sustainability and product extension.
 
The following table summarizes our principal competitors by operating segment as of December 31, 2020:

Our proprietary driveline and power technologies product lines have strong identities in the markets we serve. Throughout these product lines, we manufacture and sell our products under a number of patents that have been obtained over a period of years and expire at various times. We consider each of these patents to be of value and aggressively protect our rights throughout the world against infringement. We are involved with many product lines and the loss or expiration of any particular patent would not materially affect our sales and profits.

We own or have licensed numerous trademarks that are registered in many countries, enabling us to market our products worldwide. For example, our Spicer®, Victor Reinz® , Long® and TM4® trademarks are widely recognized in their market segments.
 
Engineering and Research and Development
 
Since our introduction of the automotive universal joint in 1904, we have been focused on technological innovation. Our objective is to be an essential partner to our customers and we remain highly focused on offering superior product quality, technologically advanced products, world-class service and competitive prices. To enhance quality and reduce costs, we use statistical process control, cellular manufacturing, flexible regional production and assembly, global sourcing and extensive employee training.
 
We engage in ongoing engineering and research and development activities to improve the reliability, performance and cost-effectiveness of our existing products and to design and develop innovative products that meet customer requirements for new applications. We are integrating related operations to create a more innovative environment, speed product development, maximize efficiency and improve communication and information sharing among our research and development operations. At December 31, 2020, we had seven stand-alone technical and engineering centers and nineteen additional sites at which we conduct research and development activities. Our research and development costs were $146 in 2020, $112 in 2019 and $103 in 2018. Total engineering expenses including research and development were $246 in 2020, $271 in 2019 and $252 in 2018. During 2020, we reduced our total engineering spend in response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, taking advantage of various government programs and subsidies in the countries in which we operate. We also made the strategic decision to focus our engineering spend more heavily on research and development activities, continuing to progress key electrification initiatives despite the global pandemic.
 
Our research and development is targeted to create unique value for our customers. Our technologies are enabling the electrification of vehicles and accessories to improve efficiency and reduce the impact of carbon emissions. Our advanced drivelines are more efficient than ever before and include mechatronic systems to enhance performance. The power technologies group is developing new ways to keep batteries and power electronics at optimum temperatures to improve their efficiency and operation. We have developed innovative fuel cell products to help keep vehicles running in near continuous operation.

This is achieved through a consistent commitment to excellence in, health, safety, security management, and risk elimination. Dana’s health, safety and security programs ensure that all employees receive training, guidance, and assistance in safety awareness and risk prevention. An implemented, verified, audited, and communicated occupational health and safety management system reflects Dana’s internal and external commitment to all our stakeholders in identifying and reducing the health and safety risk of our employees around the world. Dana has developed robust safety systems, including detailed work instructions and processes for standard and non-standard work, as well as regular layer process audits to ensure that we carefully consider safety in each of our work functions.
COVID-19 Response – The company’s response to the global COVID-19 pandemic was comprehensive, swift, and decisive with an emphasis on health and safety.

To achieve this, we have emphasized three core areas: retention and employee development, resources for employees, and recruiting of new team members.
Retention and Employee Development – Dana believes the development of its people is critical to the company’s success. The company empowers individuals to lead their development by articulating their professional, personal, and career growth aspirations to their manager. Development of all Dana people is strongly encouraged and should be considered each year as a part of their goals. Dana as an organization has the responsibility to set the tone, culture, and organizational expectations. The company also provides regular training opportunities for our associates across the globe to ensure they have the skills and information to keep pace with technological change. This development is supported and measured with robust performance management and development plans that encourages employees to continuously improve upon their past performance and build on critical skills the company requires to remain competitive.
