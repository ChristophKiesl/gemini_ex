Our Company
 
LMP, through our wholly owned subsidiaries, currently offers our customers the opportunity to buy, sell, rent and subscribe for, and obtain financing for automobiles both online and in person.
 
We describe our business model as “Buy, Rent or Subscribe, Sell and Repeat.” This means that we “Buy” pre-owned automobiles primarily through auctions or directly from other automobile dealers, and new automobiles from manufacturers and manufacturer distributors at fleet rates. We “Rent or Subscribe” by either renting automobiles to our customers or allowing them to enter into our subscription plan for automobiles in which customers have use of an automobile for a minimum of thirty (30) days. We “Sell” our inventory, including automobiles previously included in our rental and subscription programs, to customers, and then we hope to “Repeat” the whole process.
 


We believe we offer a stress-free and user-friendly experience, either directly or through arrangements with third parties, that enables consumers to efficiently:
 

– | Browse and purchase a vehicle | – | Subscribe for a vehicle 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+---+------------------------------------------------
– | Rent a vehicle | – | Sell or trade-in vehicle 
– | Obtain pre-approval for financing (through third parties) | – | Buy extended warranties (through third parties)
– | Schedule pick-ups for all programs at the originating location and deliveries for all programs are typically scheduled through third parties | | 

 
Our platform is designed to streamline the automobile transaction value chain by digitizing a substantial part of the sales and transaction process. We believe this will enhance the consumer experience by creating operational efficiencies that are designed to improve our financial and business performance. We also intend to centralize sales, title, tag, finance and logistics operations, in order to create additional financial and operational benefits, as well as a positive consumer experience. We believe that bringing more of the vehicle shopping and transaction experience online will provide consumers with a broader range of purchase, rental and subscription options while eliminating time spent in negotiation and haggling.
 
We commenced our operations in the first quarter of 2017. Currently, we only offer sales of pre-owned automobiles, and rentals and subscriptions for both pre-owned and new automobiles. As of December 31, 2020, our inventory consisted of 241 automobiles in total. Of those, 128 were subscribed and in use by customers and 113 were available for subscription consumers or were available for sale. Our current facility is approximately 8,771 square feet on 1.25 acres of land. Our facility contains storage for ten vehicles on the interior and up to 90 on the exterior. We believe over 90% of our fleet will be rented and subscribed and in use by customers and we can facilitate over 1,000 subscribers using our current facility.
 
Industry Overview
 
The automotive retail industry is highly competitive and fragmented. Consumers use a variety of online and offline sources to research vehicle information, obtain vehicle pricing information and identify dealers. In addition, dealers use a variety of marketing channels to promote themselves to consumers.

We believe that the following are the current key drivers of growth for the automobile industry:
 

● | Economic Drivers. Consumer demand for new and used vehicles has increased as fewer people are using public transportation during the Covid-19 pandemic. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Emerging Technologies and Disruptive Business Models. We believe the U.S. automobile industry is rapidly evolving through the adoption of new technologies and disruptive business models, which we believe is driven primarily by consumer expectations and demands for a better purchasing experience. 
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Off-Lease Vehicles. The number of off-lease vehicles has grown from 2.0 million in 2014 to 3.4 million in 20183. We believe that the off-lease vehicle market can provide a steady supply of high-quality automobiles that will offer consumers a viable alternative to the new-vehicle market. We expect that this will result in increased competition with the new vehicle market. 
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Subscription Market. We believe the subscription model has been widely adopted in several different sectors, such as consumer goods, streaming media and data cloud services. Driven by consumer demand, the automobile industry has begun adopting a subscription model as an alternative to ownership and leasing. Although we believe that vehicle ownership will continue to dominate the industry, we expect that the auto subscription segment will grow steadily. 
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


● | Pre-Owned Automobile Sales Market. America’s automobile industry is one of the most powerful engines driving the U.S. economy4. According to Edmunds Used Vehicle Outlook 2019, approximately 40.2 million pre-owned vehicles were sold in 2018, up from 39.3 million pre-owned vehicles sold in 2017.

Reorganization and Securities Issuances
 
The Company was incorporated under the laws of Delaware in December 2017. Samer Tawfik, our founder, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, contributed one hundred percent (100%) of the equity interests in each of LMP Motors.com, LLC and LMP Finance, LLC to the Company in December 2017, and in January 2018, 601 NSR, LLC and LMP Automotive Holdings, LLC made the Company their sole member. We refer to these transactions as the reorganization. As a result of the reorganization, the Company now owns one hundred percent (100%) of the equity in each of these four entities. LMP Motors.com, LLC currently operates our automobile sales business. LMP Finance, LLC currently operates our rental and subscription business. 601 NSR, LLC and LMP Automotive Holdings, LLC were formed to enter into future potential strategic acquisitions, but are currently inactive. As a result of the reorganization, Mr. Tawfik was issued 15,750,000 shares of common stock and ST RXR Investments, LLC, or ST RXR, a company wholly owned and controlled by Mr. Tawfik, was issued 5,250,000 shares of common stock.

During the second and third quarters of 2018, we issued convertible promissory notes in an aggregate principal amount of $1,448,965, or the 6-month notes, pursuant to a private placement offering. The 6-month notes bear interest at 4% per annum and mature six (6) months from the date of issuance, at which time the principal and any accrued but unpaid interest shall be due and payable. The holders of the 6-month notes may, at any time prior to the maturity date, convert the 6-month notes (and accrued interest) into shares of our common stock by dividing (a) the outstanding principal balance and unpaid accrued interest under the applicable 6-month note on the date of conversion by (b) $4.75 (subject to adjustment as provided in the 6-month notes). Based on the terms of the conversion rights, we did not recognize a beneficial conversion discount.
 
During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repaid eight of the 6-month notes in the principal amount of $962,000 and converted the remaining seven 6-Month Notes to 44,684 shares of common stock with a principal and accrued interest value of $212,249.
