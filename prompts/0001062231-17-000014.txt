We have also developed and commercialized a disconnecting AWD system, which strengthens AAM's position as a leader in global driveline systems technology. AAM's EcoTrac® Disconnecting AWD system technology seamlessly engages AWD functionality while improving fuel efficiency and reducing CO2 emissions. This technology is featured on the Jeep Cherokee and its derivatives, and will be featured on the newly designed Chevrolet Equinox and GMC Terrain beginning in 2017.
AAM also develops and manufactures high-efficiency axle systems through the use of proprietary technologies to optimize product design and lubrication management, while also significantly reducing friction and improving fuel economy. Our high efficiency axles are featured on several premium OEM vehicles, including Cadillac, Mercedes-Benz and JLR.
Our e-AAM subsidiary engineers and develops battery electric and hybrid driveline systems to be commercialized for crossover vehicles and passenger cars. These systems are designed to improve fuel efficiency by up to 30%, reduce CO2 emissions and provide AWD capability with the additional benefit of improved vehicle stability when compared to traditional mechanical AWD systems.
Through the development of our EcoTrac® Disconnecting AWD system, our high efficiency axles and our 
e-AAM™ hybrid and electric driveline systems, we have significantly improved fuel efficiency and safety, ride and handling performance while reducing emissions for our customer's products. 
As our customers continue to focus on reducing vehicle weight through the use of aluminum or other conventional means, AAM is well positioned to offer innovative, industry-leading solutions, through proprietary technologies such as QuantumTM axles, PowerLite® axles, PowerDense® gears and PowerFilm® lubricant for passenger car, light truck and AWD applications.
Backlog
We typically enter into agreements with our customers to provide axles or other driveline or drivetrain products for the life of our customers' vehicle programs. Our new and incremental business includes awarded programs and incremental content and volume including customer requested engineering changes. Our backlog may be impacted by various assumptions, many of which are provided by our customers based on their long range production plans. These assumptions include future production volume estimates, changes in program launch timing and fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates. 
Our new and incremental business backlog is approximately $875 million for programs launching from 2017 to 2019. Approximately 80% of our new and incremental business backlog relates to AWD and RWD applications for crossover vehicles and passenger cars. Approximately 40% of our new and incremental business backlog will be for end use markets outside the U.S and approximately 60% is for customers other than GM. 
Patents and Trademarks
We maintain and have pending various U.S. and foreign patents, trademarks and other rights to intellectual property relating to our business, which we believe are appropriate to protect our interest in existing products, new inventions, manufacturing processes and product developments. We do not believe that any single patent or trademark is material to our business nor would expiration or invalidity of any patent or trademark have a material adverse effect on our business or our ability to compete.
Cyclicality and Seasonality
Our operations are cyclical because they are directly related to worldwide automotive production, which is also cyclical and dependent on general economic conditions and other factors. Our business is also moderately seasonal as our major OEM customers historically have an extended shutdown of operations (typically 1 to 2 weeks) in conjunction with their model year changeover and an approximate one-week shutdown in December. Accordingly, our quarterly results may reflect these trends.
6

Environmental Matters
We are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign environmental and occupational safety and health laws, regulations and ordinances, including those regulating air emissions, water discharge, waste management and environmental cleanup. We closely monitor our environmental conditions to ensure that we are in compliance with applicable laws, regulations and ordinances. We have made, and will continue to make, capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental requirements, including recurring administrative costs. Such expenditures were not significant in 2016, 2015 and 2014.
Associates
We employ approximately 13,100 associates on a global basis (including our joint venture affiliates) of which approximately 3,600 are employed in the U.S. Approximately 2,000 of these U.S. associates are represented by the UAW, of which approximately 1,300 are hourly associates at our Three Rivers Manufacturing Facility in Michigan who are subject to a stand alone UAW agreement that expires March 6, 2021. An additional 700 associates at our MSP Industries Corporation and Colfor Manufacturing, Inc. subsidiaries are represented by the UAW under collective bargaining agreements that expire August 14, 2020 and June 8, 2018, respectively. In addition, approximately 100 associates at our Albion Automotive subsidiary in Scotland, approximately 100 associates at our Chennai Manufacturing Facility in India, approximately 4,300 associates at our Guanajuato Manufacturing Complex in Mexico and approximately 500 associates at our Araucária Manufacturing Facility in Brazil are represented by labor unions that are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The current collective bargaining agreements at Albion and Chennai will expire on March 31, 2017 and March 31, 2019, respectively. The collective bargaining agreements in Mexico and Brazil expire and are renegotiated annually.
