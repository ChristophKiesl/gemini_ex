Overview
 We offer products and services to support the needs of institutional investors throughout their investment processes. Clients look to us for an integrated view of the drivers of risk and return in their portfolios, broad and deep asset class coverage, quality data, an objective perspective and innovation.
 Our clients include asset owners (pension funds, endowments, foundations, central banks, sovereign wealth funds, family offices and insurance companies), asset management firms (mutual funds, hedge funds, providers of exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”)), private wealth managers, real estate investment trusts and financial intermediaries (banks, broker-dealers, exchanges, custodians, trust companies and investment consultants).
 We provide products and services that support global investing and for decades have helped institutional investors address challenging investment and risk problems. Equity factor investing was pioneered in the 1970s based on research, data and analytics developed by Barra – part of our company since 2004. We continue to innovate in the development of indexes and analytical models; provision of ratings and analysis that enables institutional investors to integrate environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) factors into their investment strategies; and analysis of real estate in both privately and publicly owned portfolios.
 Clients use our products and services to help construct portfolios and allocate assets. The analytical content we provide through our products is enabled by applications and are the basis for the services that we provide to clients. Our analytical tools and content help clients measure and manage risk across all major asset classes. Our powerful computational and reporting platform can process large multi-asset class portfolios on an intra-day basis. We offer clients the flexibility to tailor our products and services and integrate them into their own workflows.
 Primary Uses of Our Products and Services
 Institutional investors use our offerings to achieve a wide range of objectives.
 1

Benchmarking —Institutional investors worldwide use our indexes to evaluate the performance of their funds. Our indexes are among the most widely used benchmarks for multi-country passive and active equity strategies worldwide.
 Index-linked product creation —Our indexes are used as the basis for products such as ETFs. We are a leading provider of equity indexes to the ETF industry, with approximately 900 ETFs based on our equity indexes listed around the world.
 Portfolio construction —Asset managers use our research, data and multi-asset class and multi-currency models to help build portfolios and allocate assets. Our global equity content sets provide tools for portfolio optimization and back-testing. Asset managers also construct portfolios by replicating or tracking our indexes.
 Risk management —Our products and services for statistical analysis provide clients with a broad range of risk calculations on a daily basis. One of our best-known statistical models calculates Value at Risk (“VaR”), which estimates the largest possible loss that could be incurred in a portfolio at a specific confidence level over a given period of time. Our Real Estate offerings include risk analytics for a variety of sectors, including residential and retail properties. We offer an extensive library of stress testing scenarios and a suite of stress testing tools that enable clients to design and run stress tests that reflect their own investment views.
 ESG integration —MSCI ESG Research provides in-depth ratings and analysis of ESG-related business practices of thousands of companies worldwide. Our ratings and analysis can help institutional investors pursue their sustainable long-term investing goals and uncover risks and opportunities that traditional investment research may not detect.
 Performance attribution —We offer a suite of performance attribution models with which to analyze the sources of portfolio performance on an absolute or relative basis, including a platform that helps analyze the strengths and weaknesses of a real estate portfolio’s performance relative to its benchmark. Our products are multi-asset class and multi-currency, and we collect market and portfolio data daily. A streamlined workflow makes attribution reporting intuitive and efficient.
 Regulatory reporting —Our products help institutional investors comply with regulatory reporting requirements around the world. Our processing capability enables us to create and implement a broad range of customized reports.
 Our Business Model
 Our principal business model is to license annual, recurring subscriptions to our products and services for a fee, which is, in a majority of cases, paid in advance. Fees may vary by product or service, number of users or volume of services. Recurring subscription offerings include our managed services offering, whereby we oversee the production of risk and performance reports on behalf of clients.
 We also charge clients to use our indexes as the basis for index-linked investment products such as ETFs or as the basis for passively managed funds and separate accounts. These clients commonly pay us a license fee, primarily in arrears, for the use of our intellectual property primarily based on the assets under management (“AUM”) in their investment product.
 Certain exchanges use our indexes as the basis for futures and options contracts and pay us a license fee, primarily paid in arrears, for the use of our intellectual property primarily based on their volume of trades.
 Clients also subscribe to periodic benchmark reports, digests and other publications associated with our Real Estate products. Fees are primarily paid in arrears after the product is delivered.
 We also realize one-time fees related to customized reports, historical data sets and certain implementation and consulting services, as well as from certain products and services that are purchased on a non-renewal basis.

Revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016 totaled $1,150.7 million, up 7.0% from the prior year period. Sources of revenue consisted of $913.7 million in recurring subscriptions, $210.2 million in revenue from asset-based fees, and $26.8 million in non-recurring revenue. See Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Results of Operations.”
 Our Operating Segments
 We operate in four segments: Index, Analytics, ESG and Real Estate. Because the ESG and Real Estate operating segments do not meet segment disclosure reporting thresholds, ESG and Real Estate are combined and presented as part of the All Other segment for reporting purposes. See Note 13, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, included herein, for additional information on our current segment reporting structure.

Index Segment
 Our indexes are used in many areas of the investment process, including index-linked product creation and performance benchmarking, as well as portfolio construction and rebalancing, and asset allocation. We currently calculate over 190,000 global equity indexes, which include approximately 7,300 custom indexes. As of December 31, 2016, 97 of the top 100 global asset managers (as ranked by Pensions & Investments (“P&I”) in its report dated May 2016) licensed equity indexes from us. Clients receive data directly from us or from one or more third-party providers of financial information that distribute our equity indexes worldwide. The performance of our equity indexes is also referenced frequently when selecting investment managers, assigning return benchmarks in mandates, comparing performance and providing market and academic commentary. The performance of certain of our equity indexes is reported on a daily basis in the financial media.

• | MSCI Global Equity Indexes. MSCI Global Equity Indexes include our flagship indexes and are designed to measure returns across a wide variety of equity markets (e.g., Europe, Japan, USA, emerging markets), sizes (e.g., mid and large capitalization), and industries (e.g., banks, media). As of December 31, 2016, we calculated indexes that covered more than 80 countries in developed, emerging and frontier markets, as well as various regional indexes built from the component country indexes. These indexes include the MSCI ACWI, MSCI World, MSCI EAFE, MSCI ACWI IMI, MSCI Emerging Market and MSCI USA Indexes. We believe that MSCI Global Equity Indexes are the most widely used benchmarks by cross-border equity funds. A number of asset owners use the MSCI ACWI IMI Indexes as the policy benchmark for their equity portfolios.

constraints. They can be used for back-testing strategies or developing specialized investment products, minimizing portfolio tracking error and constructing index-linked products.

We offer a comprehensive suite of factor index families, including high-exposure factor indexes (e.g., the MSCI Minimum Volatility Index), high capacity factor indexes (e.g., MSCI Value Weighted Indexes), combinations of single factor indexes (e.g., MSCI Quality Mix Index) and multi-factor indexes (e.g., MSCI Diversified Multiple-Factor Indexes).

Growth Strategy
 We believe we are well positioned for growth. Our multi-pronged strategy is focused on addressing the most critical needs of institutional investors and building on our strong client relationships and the integral role that our products and services play in the investment process.
Client Growth
 We believe there are opportunities to expand our business with existing clients and to add new clients. We intend to:
  
• | Increase subscriptions within our current client base. We expect that our products and services will enable us to offer clients more ways to achieve their current and future objectives. Many of our clients use only a limited number of our offerings, and we believe there are opportunities to sell additional products and services to existing clients and to increase the number of users and locations. We believe our knowledge of our clients and our familiarity with their investment processes puts us in a unique position that enables us to license additional products to them.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Expand our client base. We seek to add new clients by increasing our sales efforts and by leveraging the investments made in recent years, including transitioning away from our historic product-centric approach to a client needs-centric approach by merging our legacy product brands under an umbrella MSCI brand. We also believe that efforts to expand our geographic presence in recent years (33 offices serving clients in 87 countries) have positioned us to further leverage our brand strength, product reach and access to the global investment community to attract new clients and capitalize on growing demand for investment decision support tools.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Focus on client relationship management. As the objectives of our clients change, we continue to respond with products and services that address their evolving strategic and investment needs. In recent years, we have realigned our global client coverage function to sharpen our focus on current clients and improve our ability to identify new prospects. In 2016, we created the position of Chief Client Officer, who oversees the functions of client coverage, marketing and corporate communications with the goal of integrating our outreach to clients and prospects, sales and marketing strategy and client service. We have also transformed our Analytics offerings across multiple dimensions, including strategy, product development, execution and governance. To ensure that we provide world-class service to our largest accounts, we have assigned senior account managers (“SAMs”) to approximately 100 of our top clients and key account managers to cover such accounts on a dedicated basis. We are developing services and custom solutions involving a range of technical experts who operate in teams that interact with clients from pre-sales (e.g., Sales, Technical Sales Support, Product Management and Applied Research) to post-sales (e.g., Implementation, Consultants and Solution Management).

• | Increase licensing of indexes for ETFs and other exchange traded investment products. Based on demand for our indexes as the basis for ETFs, we believe that there is opportunity for continued growth and expansion in the market, among both asset owners and managers, including registered investment advisers. We will continue to pursue opportunities to increase licensing of our indexes for index-linked investment products to capitalize on the growth in number and variety of our indexes and related products. We expect to benefit as more clients adopt factor-based indexes, an area we believe is of significant strength for MSCI. The table below illustrates the growth trend with respect to the number of exchange listings of ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (“EMEA”) and Asia.

• | Increase managed services offerings. Continued pressure on management fees is causing our clients to look for ways to become more operationally efficient. Our Managed Services include end-to-end services that aim to assist clients with meeting operational and regulatory requirements by providing a convenient and cost-effective way to outsource data processing and reporting. Our clients outsourcing of these functions to our data management professionals enables them to focus more on value-added work such as risk budgeting, asset allocation, manager selection and monitoring. Our end-to-end services include consolidation of data from various sources, data reconciliation analysis, uploading of data into our risk and portfolio management applications, identification of anomalies and customized reporting at our clients’ direction.

Develop New Offerings, Enhance Existing Products and Services and Provide Value-Added Services
 We continue to develop new offerings, enhance our current products and services and provide value-added services. Much of our product and content development is based on an ongoing and active dialogue with clients, which helps us to understand their needs and anticipate market developments. We intend to:

• | Create innovative product and service offerings and enhance existing offerings. We see strong demand for products and services that can help clients create, implement and manage their investment strategies. We strive to transform clients’ challenges into opportunities by introducing innovative new products and enhancements to existing offerings. In Index, this includes developing new standard or custom indexes. In Analytics, we are transforming our platform with the aim of allowing investors to consolidate all MSCI content in one platform, discover drivers of return and risk across their portfolios and share their analysis with stakeholders. We also announced substantial updates in 2016 to our fixed income factor model that will help clients manage credit risk in fixed income portfolios. We are also expanding our products and services to further address the needs of fixed income investors. For example, we recently introduced a new model for bank loans. As consideration of ESG factors moves more into the mainstream of investing, we are developing new research and ratings products that assess corporate responsibility. Additionally, in Real Estate, we are building new products to address the needs of closed-end funds in the value-add and opportunistic spaces. We also aim to expand our coverage in emerging institutional markets across the European continent, Asia and South America.

Over the past three years, we have directed our investments toward product development, research, data production systems, technology infrastructure and application design to enable us to design and develop new products more quickly and cost-effectively over time. Further increasing our ability to construct additional indexes, and design applications more effectively, will allow us to address client needs and bring new products and product enhancements to the market more quickly. We continue a multi-year program to expand our technology infrastructure capacity and provide progressive enhancements, including updating our data center facilities worldwide. Given these efforts, we are better able to service the demands of our customers.

We intend to continue to seek to acquire products, technologies, services and companies that will complement our product offerings and client base, as well as increase our ability to provide investment decision support tools to equity, fixed income and multi-asset class investment institutions, and the financial intermediaries that serve such institutions.
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Competitive Advantages
 We believe our competitive advantages include:
  
• | Strong client relationships and a deep understanding of client needs. We believe that our relationships with the leading institutional investors are broader and more global than those of our peers. Our vantage point enables us to view financial markets in terms of what matters to global investors and financial institutions. We consult with clients and other market participants during the product development process to take into account their objectives and needs. From 33 offices in the Americas, EMEA and Asia, we engage in conversations with institutional investors looking beyond geographic boundaries and asset classes to produce content and insights about global risk-taking and opportunity. We believe that our consultative approach to product development, dedication to client support and our range of products and services enable us to build strong relationships with investment professionals and institutions around the world. The skills, knowledge and experience of our research, applications development, global sales, data management and production and product management teams enable us to develop and enhance our models, methodologies, data and applications to meet client needs. As of December 31, 2016, our clients included:

• | 97 of the top 100 global asset managers (as ranked by P&I in its report dated May 2016);
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 90 of the top 100 global pension funds (as ranked by P&I/Towers Watson in their report dated September 2016);
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 79 of the top 100 global hedge funds (as ranked by Preqin as of 2016); and
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | 87 of the top 100 global banks (as ranked by The Banker Database as of December 2015).
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | High data quality. We offer proprietary software and databases that house data from more than 200 third-party sources as well as our proprietary data. Our data-management teams work to achieve the highest standards for data quality and accuracy. We currently calculate more than 190,000 end-of-day indexes daily and more than 10,000 indexes in real time.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Extensive historical databases. We have amassed extensive databases of historical global market data, proprietary equity index data, private real estate benchmark data, risk data and ESG data. Historical data is a critical component of our clients’ investment processes, allowing them to research and back-test investment strategies and analyze portfolios over many investment and business cycles and under a variety of historical situations and market environments. We believe our databases of research-enhanced data, including more than 45 years of certain index data history, nearly 35 years of certain risk and real estate data history, as well as more than 15 years of certain historical governance data, would be difficult and costly to replicate. The information is not available from any single source and would require intensive data checking and quality assurance testing that we have performed over our many years of accumulating this data.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Client integration of our products and services. Many of our clients have integrated our products or services into their performance measurement and risk management processes, where these products or services become an integral part of our clients’ daily portfolio management functions. In certain cases,
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

our clients are requested by their customers to report using our products or data. Additionally, our products and services can help clients comply with local regulations or client reporting requirements. Consequently, we believe that certain of our clients may experience business disruption and additional costs if they cease using or replace our products or services.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Strong brand recognition. We believe that our brand is well-established and recognized throughout the institutional investment community worldwide. The strength of our brand reflects the longstanding quality and widespread use of our products and services. We believe our indexes, data and models are well-positioned to be the tools of choice for investment institutions increasingly looking to third-party products and services for help with benchmarking, index-linked product creation and portfolio and multi-asset class market risk management.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Global products and operations. Our products cover most major investment markets throughout the world. For example, the MSCI Global Equity Index family provides broad equity market coverage for over 80 countries in our developed, emerging and frontier market categories. Additionally, we produce 49 single country models, 10 regional or global models and an integrated multi-asset class risk model covering 90 equity markets, 60 fixed income markets, 161 currencies and alternative asset classes including private assets and commodities. As of December 31, 2016, our clients were located in 87 countries, with many of them having a presence in multiple locations around the world. As of December 31, 2016, our employees were based in 21 countries in order to maintain close contact with our clients and the international markets we follow. We believe our global presence and focus enable us to serve our clients well and capitalize on a great number of business opportunities in many countries and regions of the world.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Flexibility to address investors’ needs. Our competitive advantages – proprietary content combined with applications and services that help clients solve large-scale, complex investment problems – enable us to compete with both specialty firms and providers of integrated platforms.
--+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Sophisticated models with practical application. We have invested significant time and resources for more than three decades in developing sophisticated, innovative and practical index methodologies and risk models that combine financial theory and investment practice. We continually enhance our models to reflect the evolution of markets and to incorporate methodological advances into risk forecasting.
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Open architecture and transparency. We have an open architecture philosophy aimed at increasing data access and integration features in our products and services. Clients can access our data through our applications, third-party applications or their own applications. We also recognize that the marketplace is complex and multi-layered, as a competitor in one context may be a supplier or distributor in another context. For example, Standard & Poor’s competes with us in indexes, supplies index data that we distribute in our portfolio analytics software products and jointly developed and maintains GICS and GICS Direct with us. In order to provide transparency, we document and disclose many details of our models and methodologies to our clients so that they can better understand and utilize our products and services. We believe our open architecture approach and commitment to transparency benefits us and our clients.
--+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Scalable application platforms. We will continue to invest in our data centers, technology platforms and software products to provide scalable solutions for the processing of large volumes of asset and portfolio data. In doing so, we are able to offer clients computing capacity that they would otherwise not be able to access in a cost-effective manner through internal development.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Highly skilled employees. Our workforce is skilled, technical and, in some instances, specialized. In particular, our research and application development departments include individuals with backgrounds in mathematics, statistics, finance, portfolio investment and application development who combine advanced academic credentials with market experience. Our employees’ experience and knowledge give us access to, and allow us to add value at, the highest levels of our clients’ organizations.

Clients
 As of December 31, 2016, we served 6,500 clients across 87 countries worldwide, with 52.3% of revenues coming from clients in the Americas, 35.2% in EMEA and 12.5% in Asia and Australia. To calculate the number of clients, we may count certain affiliates, user locations, or business units within a single organization as separate clients. For example, the asset management and broker-dealer units of a diversified financial services firm may be treated as separate clients, even though the financial services firm is the only party to the applicable subscriptions or licenses. If we aggregate all related clients under their respective parent entity, the number of clients would be approximately 3,900, as of December 31, 2016.
 Our Aggregate Retention Rate was 92.7% and 93.4% for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. See Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Key Financial Metrics and Drivers— Operating Metrics—Aggregate Retention Rate ” for the definition of Aggregate Retention Rate and more detailed aggregate retention rate data.
 Revenues from our 10 largest clients contributed a total of 25.7%, 26.0% and 25.8% to our total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.
 In the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our largest client organization by revenue, BlackRock, Inc. and its affiliates (“BlackRock”), accounted for 9.4%, 10.3% and 10.6% of our operating revenues, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, 93.7%, 93.0% and 92.1%, respectively, of our revenues from BlackRock were attributable to asset-based fees on the AUM of ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes, including its iShares ETF business.
 Geographic Information 
 We currently have branches or subsidiaries in the following locations: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, England, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, the Philippines, Singapore, South Africa, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, United Arab Emirates and the U.S. See Note 13, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our revenues and certain assets by geographic area.
Marketing, Sales and Client Coverage
 In 2016, we consolidated our marketing, sales and client coverage functions with the goal of better helping our clients meet their strategic initiatives, improving sales and client retention through targeted client marketing and increasing transparency within our global team and operations.
Marketing
 Our marketing team’s primary focus is to promote and empower our brand. We communicate with both existing clients and prospective clients through our email newsletters which deliver research, insights and news about our content, through our public website, client portals, and via social media. We supplement these direct marketing efforts with targeted online advertising and co-branding initiatives with some of our major clients. We also issue press releases from time to time on client wins, new research and product and services developments. 
 Additionally, our employees play a pivotal role in ensuring the success of our marketing strategy. Our marketing professionals arrange interviews for our industry and content experts in prominent financial and trade media. Members of our research team and other employees regularly speak at industry conferences, as well as at our own events. For example, we hosted approximately 700 seminars, webinars, conferences and workshops in various locations across the globe in 2016. These events bring our staff and our clients together, expose those clients to our latest research and product enhancements, and give our staff an opportunity to gain insight into our clients’ needs.
 Sales and Client Coverage
 
Our client coverage team is responsible for our sales and client support functions. Our geographic reach enables us to support our large global client base and provide valuable face-to-face client service. As of December 
 11

31, 2016, our client coverage team included approximately 200 salespeople and over 250 client support personnel in 33 offices worldwide that supported clients in 87 countries. 
 Our client coverage teams are organized by client segment, product and service offerings and region. From time to time, we consolidate our client coverage teams to better support our clients’ needs. For example, we consolidated the legacy risk management analytics and portfolio management analytics sales teams into one integrated team while incorporating ESG and Real Estate sales and service teams into our overall client coverage organization. In 2016, we focused on our optimized distribution model which is based on client outreach, client engagement and the client experience, all of which are intended to ensure that our clients’ diverse and evolving strategic objectives are fully supported.  In 2016, the SAMs program improved our ability to more strategically engage with senior clients, up to and including CEOs.  Each SAM is focused on understanding client strategy to enable us to better address our clients’ challenging investment issues through our products and services. We also implemented the Coverage target-based incentive plan (“CIP”). The CIP initiative further incentivizes our client coverage personnel by aligning each eligible employee’s target annual incentive with key performance metrics in accordance with our overall goals and strategy.
 Product Development and Production
 We take a coordinated team approach to product development and production. Our product management, research, data operations and technology and application development departments are at the center of this process.  Our research and product management teams seek to understand our clients’ investment processes and needs in order to design products and services that help clients understand the dimensions of performance and risk in their portfolios and make better-informed investment decisions. For more information about our research and development and associated costs, see Note 1, “Introduction and Basis of Presentation—Significant Accounting Policies, Research and Development” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein and “Research and development” in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.
 Drawing on decades of experience with the investment process worldwide, our research department develops, reviews and enhances our various methodologies and models. Our global data operations and technology team designs and manages our processes and systems for market data procurement, proprietary data production and quality control. Our application development team builds our sophisticated applications. As part of our product development process, we also commonly consult with clients and other market participants to understand their specific needs and investment process requirements. Our product management team facilitates this collaborative product development and production approach. The roles and functions of our product development and production teams include:
  
• | Research. Our models are developed by a cross-functional research team of mathematicians, economists, statisticians, financial engineers and investment industry experts. Employees in our index and risk and analytics research departments have both advanced academic credentials and broad financial and investment industry experience. They work on both developing new models and methodologies and enhancing existing ones. We monitor investment trends and their drivers globally; analyze product-specific needs in areas such as capitalization-weighted, factor and specialized indexes; and examine instrument valuation, risk modeling, portfolio construction, asset allocation and VaR simulation. An important way we monitor global investment trends and their implications for our business is through the forum provided by our Editorial Advisory Board (“EAB”). Our EAB, which was established in 1999, meets twice a year and is comprised of senior investment professionals from around the world and senior members of our performance and risk research team. In 2016, our performance and risk researchers participated in numerous industry events and conferences, and their papers have been published in leading academic and industry journals. They also play a leading role in many of the seminars, workshops and webinars we host throughout the year, presenting and discussing their latest research findings with both existing and prospective clients.

• | Data Operations and Information Technology. Our data operations and technology teams consist of a combination of operations and information technology specialists. We license a large volume and variety of market data for every major market in the world, including fundamental and return data, from more than 200 third-party sources in 2016. We apply our models and methodologies to this market data to produce our proprietary risk and index data. Our data operations team oversees this complex process.
--+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Our experienced information technology staff builds proprietary software and databases that house all of the data we license or produce in order for our data operations team to perform data quality checks and run our data production systems. Our applications and data reside on servers, networks and databases engineered and managed by our IT Infrastructure team, and operated and monitored by our IT Operations team. This technology suite resides in our global data centers in Nevada, U.S. and Geneva, Switzerland. Our data factory produces our proprietary index data such as end-of-day and real time equity indexes, real estate benchmarks, and our proprietary risk data such as daily and monthly equity risk forecasts, real estate performance and risk reporting and MSCI ESG Research reports. We have data operations and technology offices in North America, Europe and Asia.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | Application Development. Certain of our proprietary risk data are made available to clients through our proprietary applications, such as Barra Aegis, BarraOne, RiskManager, WealthBench, Credit Manager and ESG Manager. Our application development team consists of individuals with experience in both the finance and software industries. Our staff has an extensive skill set, including expertise in both the Java-based technologies used in our web-based, on-demand software application tool for multi-asset class risk analysis and reporting and Microsoft-based technologies used in our desktop equity and fixed income analytics software applications. We also have extensive experience with database technologies, computational programming techniques, scalability and performance analysis and quality assurance. We use a customized code base and software development methodology that leverages best practices from the software industry, including agile programming, test-driven development, parallel tracking, iterative cycles, prototyping and beta releases. We build our applications by compiling multiple components, which enables us to reuse designs and codes in multiple applications. Our software development projects involve extensive collaboration with our product management team and directly with clients. We have application development offices in the U.S., Europe and Asia.

Competition
 Many industry participants compete with us by offering one or more similar indexes. Such indexes vary widely in scope, including by geographic region, business sector and risk category and may be used by clients in a variety of ways in many different markets around the world.  A number of these markets have become increasingly competitive in recent years.
 Among our Index competitors are FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of The London Stock Exchange Group PLC and S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (a joint venture company owned by CME Group, Inc. and CME Group Services LLC and by S&P Global Inc.).
 There is also growing competition from asset managers and investment banks that create their own indexes often in cooperation with index providers, which may, among other things, provide some form of calculation agent service. This is especially true for factor indexes, often referred to as “smart beta indexes.” Asset managers, such as WisdomTree and Goldman Sachs Asset Management, manage funds or ETF indexes based on their own proprietary indexes, and many investment banks have launched structured products or entered into OTC derivatives based on their own proprietary indexes.
 Many industry participants compete with us by providing one or more similar offerings in a very competitive marketplace for risk management data and analytics.
 Our Analytics products and services compete with offerings from a range of competitors, including Axioma, Inc., BlackRock Solutions, Bloomberg Finance L.P., and FactSet Research Systems Inc.  Additionally, many of the larger broker-dealers have developed proprietary analytics tools for their clients. Similarly, many investment institutions, particularly the larger global organizations, have developed their own internal risk management analytics tools.
 We also have a variety of competitors for our other products that comprise a smaller portion of our revenues.

Intellectual Property and Other Proprietary Rights
 We consider many aspects of our products, processes and services to be proprietary. We have registered, among others, “MSCI,” “Barra,” “RiskMetrics,” “RiskManager,” “FEA,” “InvestorForce,” and “IPD” as trademarks or service marks in the United States and in certain foreign countries. We will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks, service marks and copyrights as appropriate. From time to time, we also file patent applications to protect our proprietary rights. We currently hold 23 U.S. and foreign patents and have one U.S. patent pending. Additionally, many of our products, processes and services require the use of intellectual property obtained from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our products and services.
 Although we believe the ownership of such patents, copyrights, trademarks, service marks, the implementation of certain measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights and our ability to obtain the rights to use intellectual property of third parties are important to our business and contribute in part to our overall success, we do not believe we are dependent on any one of our intellectual property rights or any one license to use third-party intellectual property. For a description of the risks associated with legal protection of our intellectual property and other rights, infringement claims and the ability to obtain or renew licenses for third-party intellectual property, see Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors— Legal Protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages. Third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights, and third-party litigation may materially adversely affect our ability to protect our intellectual property rights” below.
 Company History
 The following is a summary of the Company’s history since its inception:
 MSCI Timeline
 
 
1969 | • | Capital International pioneered the development of global equity indexes and began licensing its first equity indexes in 1969. 
1998 | • | We were incorporated in 1998 and became a public company in November 2007. Our only two shareholders were Morgan Stanley and Capital Group International. 
2004 | • | In June 2004, we acquired Barra, LLC (formerly Barra, Inc., “Barra”), a provider of portfolio risk analytics tools that launched its first risk analytics products in 1975. This broadened our product range beyond indexes. 
2007 | • | In November 2007, we completed our initial public offering. 
2008 | • | In April 2008, Capital Group International divested its ownership position. 
2009 | • | In May 2009, Morgan Stanley divested its ownership position and we became a fully independent, stand-alone public company. 
2010 | • | In June 2010, we acquired RiskMetrics Group, Inc. (“RiskMetrics”), a leading provider of risk management products and services. In addition to this core product line, RiskMetrics owned Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (“ISS”), a pioneer in the development of policy-based proxy voting recommendations and a leading provider of governance products and services. 
 | • | RiskMetrics also owned the Center for Financial Research and Analysis (“CFRA”), Innovest Strategic Value Advisors, Inc. (“Innovest”) and KLD Research and Analytics (“KLD Research”). Innovest and KLD Research are now known as MSCI ESG Research LLC (“MSCI ESG Research”). 
 | • | In July 2010, we acquired Measurisk, LLC (“Measurisk”), a provider of risk transparency and risk measurement tools for hedge fund investors. With our clients’ demanding increasing levels of transparency from their hedge fund managers, this acquisition helped us develop a broad platform and set the standard for analyzing and reporting hedge fund risk. Measurisk’s products are now part of our hedge fund risk transparency offerings.

 14

 
2012 | • | In November 2012, we acquired real estate performance measurement group IPD Group Limited (“IPD”). The acquisition of IPD expanded our multi-asset class offerings by facilitating the integration of private real estate assets into our models, as well as adding a family of real estate indexes to our suite of equity indexes. 
2013 | • | In January 2013, we acquired Investor Force Holdings, Inc. (“InvestorForce”), a leading provider of performance reporting tools to the institutional investment community in the U.S. The InvestorForce offering enables us to provide consultants with integrated, daily monitoring, analysis of and reporting on institutional assets. 
 | • | In March 2013, we completed the sale of the CFRA product line. 
2014 | • | In April 2014, we completed the sale of ISS, which was not deemed to be core to our strategy. 
 | • | In August 2014, we acquired Governance Holdings Co. (“GMI Ratings”), a provider of corporate governance research and ratings to institutional investors, banks, insurers, auditors, regulators and corporations seeking to incorporate ESG criteria into risk assessment and decision-making. This acquisition enhanced our existing platform of ESG research and tools, allowing us to deliver a more comprehensive suite of ESG data, applications and services to our clients.
2015 | • | In October 2015, we acquired all of the assets of Insignis, Inc. (“Insignis”), a leading provider of daily automated collection, aggregation and management of financial data. This acquisition helped us further automate the collection and integration of data across our risk and performance management platforms. 
2016 | • | In August 2016, we completed the sale of the Real Estate occupiers business, which was acquired as part of the IPD acquisition in 2012.

 Government Regulation
 The Company is subject to reporting, disclosure and recordkeeping obligations pursuant to SEC requirements. MSCI ESG Research is a registered investment adviser and must comply with the requirements of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and related SEC regulations. Such requirements relate to, among other things, disclosure obligations, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, marketing restrictions and general anti-fraud prohibitions.
