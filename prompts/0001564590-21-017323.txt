Item 1. Business
 JOANN is the nation’s category leader in sewing and fabrics (collectively, “Sewing”) and one of the fastest growing competitors in the arts and crafts category. The Creative Products industry is a large and growing market, which according to a 2017 Association for Creative Industries (“AFCI”) study is in excess of $40 billion. The industry is currently experiencing a significant acceleration for product demand in response to multiple themes that have been further solidified during the COVID-19 pandemic, such as heightened do-it-yourself (“DIY”) customer behavior, amplified participation from both new and existing customers and increased digital engagement, of which we are a key beneficiary because we have positioned ourselves and our go-forward strategies to capitalize on increased demand for Creative Products. As a well-established and trusted brand for over 75 years, we believe we have a deep understanding of our customers, what inspires their creativity and what fuels their incredibly diverse projects. Since 2016, we have embarked on a strategy to transform JOANN, which has helped us pivot from a traditional retailer to a fully-integrated, digitally-connected provider of Creative Products.
 As the nation’s category leader in Sewing with approximately one-third market share, based on our internal research estimates of market share of the Creative Products industry that primarily consist of an annual survey of Creative Product consumers as of July 31, 2020, we believe we offer the broadest selection of products while being committed to providing the most inspiration, helpful service and education to our customers. While we continue to gain market share and solidify this leadership position in Sewing, which represented 48% of our total net sales in fiscal 2021, we have also been growing our share of and believe we have further significant share opportunity in the arts and crafts category. We are well-positioned in the marketplace and have multiple competitive advantages, including our broad assortment, established omni-channel platform, multi-faceted digital interface with customers and skilled and knowledgeable team members. We offer an extensive assortment, which at its peak, averages more than 95,000 stock keeping units (“SKUs”) in stores and over 245,000 SKUs online, across Creative Product categories. Over 50% of our in-store net sales cannot be directly comparison-shopped because of our strong and growing own-brand portfolio, including our copyrighted or proprietary fabric patterns and designs and factory direct relationships. We have expanded access to this broad assortment through e-commerce and digital capabilities that complement our physical network, drive customer engagement and deliver an exceptional customer experience while supporting consistently strong gross margins. Through our omni-channel platform, we serve our customers in a differentiated manner by offering several convenient fulfillment options, including buy online pick-up in store (“BOPIS”), curbside pick-up and ship-to-home offerings. Our omni-channel platform operates at a large scale, having generated approximately $511 million, $126 million and $103 million in net sales in fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our data-driven digital capabilities further reinforce our relationship with our customers. Customers can interact with our brand whenever and however they want. Customers connect with us through our newly re-designed mobile-first website, joann.com, and our widely-used mobile application with more than 12 million downloads. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we had approximately 71 million addressable customers in our vast database, nearly 17 million customers in our email database and over four million customers in our very large SMS text database. These points of differentiation are reinforced by our knowledgeable, friendly and trusted team members, a significant number of whom are sewing and craft enthusiasts, who offer a service-oriented experience for our customers that we believe cannot be replicated by mass retailers or pure play online players.
 We appeal to an expansive customer base ranging across all ages, demographics and skill levels. We serve the DIY customer, including those who make to give or donate their creations, and supply small business owners with components to create and sell their own merchandise. We estimate this group makes up approximately one-quarter of our customers and typically resells on online marketplaces such as Etsy, eBay, Shopify and other platforms, which have also experienced significant growth in 2020. Our customers are passionate and creative, using their hearts, hands and minds in their sewing, crafting and decorating activities. We believe our customers’ enthusiasm drives the JOANN culture, as exemplified by our “Make to Give” program. We strive to support our community of creators, and they create to support their communities by donating or gifting the items they make, which range from blankets for hospitalized children, homeless persons, and shelter pets, to masks for hospitals, schools and friends. We estimate that over 70% of JOANN customers make to give or donate their creations. Our loyal core customer base is key to our sales growth, and for fiscal 2021, 29% of our net sales were generated by our top three million customers. Additionally, in fiscal 2021, our new customer base has grown faster and is spending more than in prior years. Since February 1, 2020, we have acquired over 10 million new customers, many who initially purchased fabric to make their own masks but have expanded their shopping behavior across our diversified merchandise categories in subsequent transactions. Customers typically purchase from JOANN with a project in mind that requires several component items. In that vein, we believe our physical footprint is an advantage, as most customers regularly want to explore what is new, see how various items and colors work together, see how a fabric drapes, feel the texture and seek help from our experienced team members.

In 2016, we accelerated our journey to transform JOANN by reinventing the in-store and digital customer experience. We recruited talent at every level of the company and across all key business areas to complement our existing expertise. This undertaking has resulted in significant enhancements to our value proposition, including reinvigorating our core merchandise assortment, refreshing our branding, developing a location refresh prototype and improving the customer experience. We improved our assortment by conducting a systematic review of all categories at a product-level and all layouts at a location-level in order to optimize sales and gross margin. We have also expanded our data-driven digital footprint, which includes our extensive digital marketing assets, CRM system, social media platforms and e-commerce capabilities. We better understand our customers through our centralized database that brings together how each customer interacts in our physical and digital properties and provides a holistic view of their behavior. We are able to utilize this data to drive engagement with our brand, create loyalty and inspire, educate and ensure we are increasing our share of customer spend through timely and relevant marketing. By using data and digital contact channels, including email and SMS digital display, and leveraging our mobile application, we are able to contact customers with personalized content and provide the convenience to shop wherever and however they choose. We believe that these core initiatives and transformational investments have driven our performance and increased customer engagement over the last several years and strategically position us to continue to create long-term value. This momentum was temporarily interrupted in fiscal year 2020 by the unanticipated headwind of incremental U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports that we estimate, before mitigation, would have amounted to $75 million of additional annual costs, as these tariffs applied to a broad range our products. However, after working to partially offset their effects and having incorporated the balance of these tariffs into our cost base, we are driving strong operating profit growth across both our locations and e-commerce platform as well as achieving margin expansion.
 Our momentum through the COVID-19 pandemic has been further supported by heightened DIY customer behavior, significant increases in the number of new and current customers participating in new categories and the continued rise of online marketplaces. As a result, according to Earnest Research, we and the other two largest specialty competitors in the Creative Products industry have seen on average 22% growth in year-over-year sales since May 3, 2020. Over the same period, we have experienced outsized growth, gained share and enhanced our strong foundation, increasing total comparable sales by 38% since May 3, 2020 while adding over 10 million new customers to our marketing database since February 1, 2020. These new customers have already driven elevated repeat purchase levels both via our locations and e-commerce platform and represent further opportunities to cross-sell and become part of our ongoing customer base. These new customers tend to be younger and more affluent than existing customers in our database, and are large consumers of our rapidly growing sewing and craft technology categories which include machines and related supplies. These trends support our business, as we estimate that a typical customer who purchases a sewing or craft technology machine will purchase an average of over $500 of our products in the year following their machine purchase and over $330 in the subsequent year. We are further encouraged by the retention of these new customers and their migration to shopping outside of the Sewing category. These new customers are regularly shopping across our other categories, with the fastest-growing cohort being new customers shopping the arts and crafts category. We believe that these underlying trends, along with our transformational investments and initiatives executed since 2016, strategically position us well to continue to drive long-term value creation.
 As of January 30, 2021, we operated 855 retail locations in 49 states at an average size of approximately 22,000 square feet. Our locations offer a complete selection of fabric and sewing accessories and an assortment of art, crafts, artificial floral, finished seasonal and home décor merchandise that varies based on location size.

 48% of our total net sales were within the Sewing category in fiscal, 2021. We offer a broad and comprehensive assortment of Sewing products in all of our locations and online.

Marketing 
 Our marketing efforts are key to the ongoing success and growth of our brand. We engage a diverse customer base ranging across ages, demographics, interests and skill levels, from the novice to the experienced sewist and maker. Our primary focus with these efforts is to deepen the relationship with our customers, with a long-term focus of creating loyalty and helping our customers find their “Happy Place” at JOANN. 
 We leverage our proprietary customer database to provide relevant and timely communications to customers through multiple digital channels (email, SMS text, mobile application push notifications, and display marketing), and to our most engaged customers via a robust direct mail program. This allows us to efficiently and effectively reach our target customers on a regular basis throughout the year. We rely primarily on digital marketing tactics to drive customer acquisition, including online display and search marketing, social media and affiliate marketing programs. Our retention marketing programs leverage a robust customer relationship management (“CRM”) platform and database that provides us a detailed view of customer behavior, combining sales in our locations with online and social media activity. Through this database, we can personalize our digital marketing, email, SMS text, and direct mail campaigns to ensure we are providing the most relevant content to our customer at all times. 
 Customers can interact with our brand whenever and however they want. Customers connect with us through our newly re-designed mobile-first website, joann.com, and our widely used mobile application with more than 12 million downloads. As of the end of fiscal 2021, we had approximately 71 million addressable customers in our vast database, nearly 17 million customers in our email database and over four million customers in our very large SMS text database. As of January 30, 2021, our customers can shop over 245,000 SKUs available on our e-commerce platform. Customers have the ability to shop their local location online, with convenient omni-channel services available like buy online pick-up in store or curbside pickup. Customers can also choose to order direct to home, with extended aisle offerings across all major product categories. For

customers seeking to purchase in greater quantities, we offer low pricing for bulk purchases through our JOANN+ service on joann.com. Those looking for inspiration and education can access thousands of projects in multiple ways and formats, including our digital platforms that offer thousands of project ideas, from novice to expert level, and include convenient shopping lists for each project. Customers seeking video tutorials can access free content both through joann.com and on the JOANN YouTube channel, where we post additional “how-to” videos. Finally, customers looking to build more advanced skills can gain access to Creativebug, our wholly owned subsidiary, which offers hundreds of longer form video tutorials from experts in the industry via a subscription. Our Creativebug website offers an extensive array of online arts and crafts instructional videos allowing customers to learn how to paint, draw, sew, quilt, knit, crochet, and much more, while capturing the intimate experience of learning from top designers and artists. 
 We interact with our customers in multiple ways digitally, through online communities, social media platforms and on joann.com. Our highly active social networks are playing an increasingly significant role in our marketing, public relations and customer engagement. We utilize Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, Pinterest and affiliate marketing partners as engagement tools to inspire, educate, promote sales, introduce new products, share customer stories and engage in communication, including customer service support and idea sharing. We also have established relationships with key crafting and sewing influencers who help promote our brand, projects, and product offerings. Through our digital and social communities, we have launched key initiatives further connecting our diverse customers, including: 
  
• | our “Make to Give” campaign for calendar year 2020 focused on making and donating cotton masks and scrubs to support our communities and front line health care workers, through which we estimate that we have directly donated materials for over 20 million masks, scrubs and other personal protective equipment and our customers have purchased, made, and in many cases donated, more than 400 million other items as of January 30, 2021; and
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | the launch of our two inaugural campaigns designed to give back to those in need: (i) the “Minority Creative Grant” that we established in August 2020, awarding minority makers a series of grants totaling $100,000 to support them in growing their businesses, and (ii) the “Handmade Hero’s Award” of $100,000 that we established in November 2020, awarding and giving back to those who have made to donate to their own communities throughout the year.
--+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 We also encourage our customers to share their projects with others, and they can easily do so by utilizing the hashtag “#handmadewithjoann.” Through this hashtag, content is not only shared in the social platform posted on, but also flows through our mobile application and on joann.com for others to comment on and be inspired. 
 As we further build our brand, we continually explore and test strategic partnerships. These partnerships can range from co-branding products and services to building entirely new offerings for customers. For example, we partner with Girl Scouts of America and 4-H. At the core of each of these partnerships, we seek to connect with and build a longer term relationship with younger and upcoming makers and those who share our common passion to help others, further generating awareness of the social value of our brand. 
 Purchasing
 We generally have multiple domestic and international sources of supply available for each category of products we sell. During fiscal 2021, we sourced approximately 64% of our purchases from domestic suppliers with the remaining approximately 36% of our products coming directly from manufacturers located in foreign countries, of which just over half were sourced from China. To further support our direct sourcing strategic initiative, we opened our foreign sourcing office in Shanghai, China in 2018. We continue to diversify our internationally sourced products by expanding in several other countries, including Pakistan, India and South Korea. The focus on supplier diversification has allowed us to partially offset the negative impact of the U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports. Because of the increase in foreign sourcing, we need to order these products further in advance than would be the case if the products were sourced domestically, which in turn requires us to have a longer in-transit time for our merchandise and higher safety stock levels in our distribution centers and locations. Our domestic suppliers also source internationally many of the products they sell to us. 
 Although we have very few long-term purchase commitments with any of our suppliers, we strive to maintain continuity with them. All purchases are executed centrally through our store support center, allowing location managers and team members to focus on customer service and enabling us to negotiate volume discounts, control product mix and ensure quality. As of January 30, 2021, our top supplier represented approximately 10% of our total annual purchase volume and the top 10 suppliers represented approximately 29% of our total annual purchase volume. As of January 30, 2021, we were utilizing approximately 720 merchandise suppliers, with the top 119 representing approximately 80% of our purchasing volume.

Logistics 
 We operate three distribution centers in Hudson, Ohio, Visalia, California and Opelika, Alabama, all of which ship merchandise to our locations on a weekly basis. The distribution centers also ship select products ordered by customers through joann.com directly to their homes. As of January 30, 2021, approximately 89% of the products in our locations are shipped through our distribution center network, with the remaining 11% of our purchases shipped directly from our suppliers to our locations. As of January 30, 2021, approximately 37% of our locations are supplied from the Hudson distribution center, 28% from the Visalia distribution center and 35% from the Opelika distribution center. 
 We transport product from our distribution centers to our locations utilizing contract carriers. Merchandise is shipped directly from our distribution centers to our locations using dedicated core carriers for approximately 93% of our locations. For the remainder of our locations, we transport product using less than truckload carriers or through a regional “hub” where product is cross-docked for local delivery. We do not own either the regional hub or the local delivery vehicles. 
 Location Operations
 Site Selection 
 We believe that our locations are integral to our success. New and relocated sites are selected through a coordinated effort of our executive, real estate, finance and operations management teams. In evaluating the desirability of a potential location, we consider both market demographics and site-specific criteria. Market criteria we consider important include, but are not limited to, our existing location sales performance in that immediate market (if we have an existing location), distance to other JOANN locations, competitive presence, total population, number of households, median household income, percentage of home ownership versus rental and historical and projected population growth. Site-specific criteria we consider important include, but are not limited to, size of the location, rental terms, size of the shopping center, co-tenants, traffic patterns, availability of convenient parking and ease of entry from the major roadways framing the location. 
Opening or Remodeling Locations 
 Our location refresh program employs standard operating procedures to efficiently open new locations or remodel or relocate existing locations. We have developed processes to optimize inventory assortments and marketing programs for locations that we open or remodel, which are under regular review to uncover opportunities to improve performance and consistency of execution. We generally look to execute location projects in the period from February through October to maximize sales and to minimize disruption to operations during our fourth quarter peak selling season. 
Location Management 
 Each location generally has a manager and an assistant manager. The remainder of staff is a combination of full-time and part-time team members based on each location’s individual sales volume. Managers generally are compensated with a base salary plus a bonus, which is tied to individual location and overall company performance. 
 We strive to promote our managers from within our assistant manager ranks as a result of high performance and completion of our internal management training program. Many of our team members, including managers, started as our customers and are enthusiasts within the Creative Products community. We believe this continuity serves to solidify long-standing relationships between us and our customers, and aids in our ability to provide exceptional service. When we relocate in the same market, we generally retain its team members to staff the new location. Each location is under the supervision of a district manager who reports to a regional vice president.

We have geographic coverage for our retail locations across the United States that we believe provide sufficient scale to efficiently leverage our e-commerce business, national marketing programs and logistics networks.

Our new location opening costs depend on the building type, location size and general construction and labor costs in the geographic area. Our relocation and remodel projects range in scope and cost based on the specific needs and sales potential of the location being refreshed as well as the size of the location, condition of the building and regional differences in construction costs. Components of cost for these projects include leasehold improvements (net of landlord financial contribution), furniture, fixtures and equipment, inventory (net of vendor support) and pre-opening labor and facilities expenses incurred during the project. 
 Competitive Landscape 
 We are the nation’s category leader in Sewing and one of the fastest growing competitors in the arts and crafts category, serving customers in their pursuit of apparel and craft sewing, crafting, home decorating and other creative endeavors. We compete with select mass merchants, including Walmart, Inc. and Target Corporation, which dedicate a portion of their selling space to selling Creative Products items. We also compete with specialty retailers in the Creative Products industry, such as The Michaels Companies, Inc. and Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., as well as smaller regional and local operators. 
 In addition to e-commerce options offered by the retailers mentioned above, we compete with companies that sell fabrics and crafts only over the internet, such as Amazon.com or its subsidiary Fabric.com. We estimate pure play e-commerce players represent less than 10% market share of the Creative Products industry. We believe that we are the only specialty player that can serve customers holistically with an expansive Creative Products assortment, service-oriented experience and integrated omni-channel capabilities. 
 Information Technology 
 Our point-of-sale systems and e-commerce platform record the sale of product at the item level. These transactions are collected and transmitted to our financial, merchandising, omni-channel fulfillment and reporting systems throughout the day. Information obtained from item-level transaction data enables us to identify important trends, provide customers and team members with updated inventory information, ensure our products are reliably replenished as sold, eliminate less profitable items, and optimize product margins through analysis of our advertising, pricing and promotions. 
 Our locations are equipped with broadband communication that is made available to customers so that our mobile e-commerce assets are able to augment our in-store customer service. The broadband service is also used within the location to enhance the checkout experience and internal location communications. 
 Our financial, merchandise and retail systems leverage enterprise software, complemented by other technology solutions for specific business processes where those other solutions are a better fit for our requirements. Those solutions include our portfolio of software for merchandise planning and replenishment as well as our recently upgraded human resource systems.

Human Capital and Team Members 
 As of January 30, 2021, we had approximately 27,500 full and part-time team members, of whom approximately 25,600 worked in our retail locations. The number of part-time team members is substantially higher during our peak selling season of September through December to support higher merchandising and customer service requirements. We believe our turnover is below average for retailers, primarily because many of our team members are themselves Creative Products enthusiasts. Our ability to offer flexible scheduling is also important in attracting and retaining team members, since approximately 87% of our team members work part-time. 
 The United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union, or the union, currently represents team members who work in our Hudson, Ohio distribution center. As of January 30, 2021, less than 1% of our team members were unionized. Our current contract with the union expires on May 5, 2023 and relations with the union are good. Otherwise, none of our team members are unionized. 
 Trademarks 
 We do business under trademarks for “Jo-Ann,” “JOANN,” “Joann.com,” “Jo-Ann Fabrics,” “Jo-Ann Fabric and Craft Stores,” “Jo-Ann Fabrics and Crafts,” “Jo-Ann Fabrics & Crafts” and “Creativebug,” as well as under numerous trademarks relating to our private label products and marketing programs. We believe that our trademarks provide significant value to our business. 
Government Regulation 
 Various aspects of our operations are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, rules and regulations, any of which may change from time-to-time. Laws and regulations affecting our business may change, sometimes frequently and significantly, as a result of political, economic, social or other events. Some of the federal, state or local laws and regulations that affect us include but are not limited to: 

• | consumer product safety, product liability, truth-in-advertising or consumer protection laws;
--+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | labor and employment laws, including wage and hour laws;
--+---------------------------------------------------------


• | tax laws or interpretations thereof, including collection of state sales tax on e-commerce sales;
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | data protection and privacy laws and regulations;
--+--------------------------------------------------


• | environmental laws and regulations;
--+------------------------------------


• | trade, anti-bribery, customs or import and export laws and regulations, including collection of tariffs on product imports; and
--+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


• | intellectual property laws.
--+----------------------------

 Continued compliance with such laws and regulations could prove to be costly and could affect various aspects of our business. For example, increases in minimum wages or changes in wage and hour laws could limit our growth and materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operation. Additionally, with the trend in environmental, health, transportation, and safety regulations becoming more restrictive, such as certain physical and electronic accessibility requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, it is possible that the costs of compliance with such laws and regulations will continue to increase.
 Seasonality
 Our business exhibits seasonality, which is typical for most retail companies. Our net sales are stronger in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. Net income is highest during the months of September through December when sales volumes provide significant operating leverage. Working capital needs to finance our operations fluctuate during the year and reach their highest levels during the second and third fiscal quarters as we increase our inventory in preparation for our peak selling season. However, the COVID-19 pandemic may have an impact to consumer behaviors and customer traffic that result in changes in the seasonal fluctuations of our business. For example, our fiscal 2021 second, third and fourth quarter results were positively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic due to the demand for select merchandise categories.
